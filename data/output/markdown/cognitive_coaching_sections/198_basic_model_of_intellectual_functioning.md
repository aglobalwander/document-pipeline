## BASIC MODEL OF INTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONING

If Cognitive Coaches intend to develop strategies, learning activities, and assessment indicators that focus on the intellect rather than on superficial behaviors, it is helpful to have a basic model of human intellectual functioning in mind to guide them. We draw upon Feuerstein's and other authors' models of human intellectual functioning that distinguish four basic thought clusters (Feuerstein, Falik, and Feuerstein 2015, 125; Lomofsky 2014; Costa 1991; Taba 1962).

- Input of data through the senses and from memory (the more senses that are engaged, the richer the input)
- Processing those data into meaningful relationships
- Output, or application, of those relationships in new or novel situations
- Metacognition, or self-monitoring, regulating, and directing one's own thoughts, intentions, actions, beliefs, and emotions

Every event a person experiences causes the brain to call up meaningful, related information from storage, whether the event is commonplace or rare. The more meaningful, relevant, and complex the experience is, the more actively the brain attempts to integrate and assimilate it into its existing storehouse of programs and structures. The most complex thinking occurs when an external stimulus or problem challenges the brain to:

- Draw on the greatest amount of information, conceptual systems, schema, and structured meanings already in storage
- Expand already existing conceptual systems
- Develop new structures

A problem may be defined as any stimulus or challenge that has no readily apparent resolution. If there is a ready match between what is perceived by the senses and what is already in storage, no problem exists. For example, there is not much need to process information when you are asked your name because the response to the challenge is readily available. Jean Piaget (1954) called this assimilation .

If, however, the challenge or problem cannot be explained or resolved with existing knowledge in short or long-term memory, the information must be processed. Some action must be taken to gather more information to resolve the discrepancy, and the resolution must be evaluated for its 'fit' with reality. Piaget called this accommodation , and he saw it as the process by which new knowledge is constructed. Coaching in the area of cognition mediates accommodation.
