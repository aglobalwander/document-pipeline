## Flexibility in Educational Settings

According to Shulman (1987), expert teachers are more opportunistic and flexible in their teaching. They take advantage of new information, quickly bringing new interpretations and representations of the problem to light. It is this flexibility, and not merely the knowledge or experience of possible scenarios, that makes the difference.

Flexible teachers are aware of and legitimize differences of opinions, tendencies, desires, and styles without necessarily accepting them. Flexible teachers search for and value the differences between individuals and their unique behaviors. They are continually forming a distinct and accepting self-perception in relation to others. Such teachers:

- Are more adept at developing and testing hypotheses about learning difficulties or instructional strategies and look upon each experience as learning opportunities
- Are willing to consider and embrace change (Hattie 2003, 8)
- Adjust to students' diverse styles, preferences, cultures, and developmental levels
- Tolerate ambiguity, seeking further information rather than being satisfied with available data
- Are more adept at anticipating problems and then improvising, seeking, and generating alternatives
- See through multiple perspectives
- Make distinctions between surface and deep learning; surface learning is more about content and deep learning more about understanding and imposing personal meaning (Hattie 2003, 9)
