Introduction
Purpose of this document 1
Business management guide

=== Page 8 ===
The Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the
16 to 19 age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be
knowledgeable and inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on
encouraging students to develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes
necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The Diploma Programme model
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core (see figure 1). It encourages the
concurrent study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study two modern languages (or a modern
language and a classical language), a humanities or social science subject, an experimental science,
mathematics and one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma
Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance.
In each of the academic areas students have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can
choose subjects that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.
Figure 1
Diploma Programme model
Introduction
The Diploma Programme 2
Business management guide

=== Page 9 ===
Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they can,
instead of an arts subject, choose two subjects from another area. Normally, three subjects (and not
more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB
recommends 240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than at SL.
At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of the
course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some element of coursework assessed by teachers.
The core of the Diploma Programme model
All DP students participate in the three course elements that make up the core of the model.
The theory of knowledge (TOK) course engages students in reflection on the nature of knowledge and on
how we know what we claim to know. It encourages students to become more aware of their own
perspectives, and to reflect critically on their own beliefs and assumptions.
In TOK, students explore the means of producing knowledge within the core theme of “knowledge and the
knower” as well as within various optional themes (knowledge and technology, knowledge and politics,
knowledge and language, knowledge and religion, and knowledge and indigenous societies) and areas of
knowledge (the arts, natural sciences, human sciences, history, and mathematics). The course also
encourages students to make comparisons between different areas of knowledge and reflect on how
knowledge is arrived at in the various disciplines, what the disciplines have in common, and the differences between them.
Creativity, activity, service (CAS) is at the heart of the DP. The emphasis in CAS is on helping students to
develop their own identities, in accordance with the ethical principles embodied in the IB mission
statement and the IB learner profile. It involves students in a range of activities alongside their academic
studies throughout the DP. The three strands of CAS are creativity (arts, and other experiences that involve
creative thinking), activity (physical exertion contributing to a healthy lifestyle) and service (an unpaid and
voluntary exchange that has a learning benefit for the student). Possibly, more than any other component
in the DP, CAS contributes to the IB’s mission to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect.
The extended essay (EE), including the world studies EE, offers the opportunity for IB students to investigate
a topic of special interest, in the form of a 4,000-word piece of independent research. The area of research
undertaken is chosen from one of the students’ six DP subjects, or in the case of the interdisciplinary world
studies essay, two subjects. The essay also acquaints students with the independent research and writing
skills expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally presented, structured writing, in which
ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent manner, appropriate to the subject or
subjects chosen. It is intended to promote high-level research and writing skills, intellectual discovery and
creativity. An authentic learning experience it provides students with an opportunity to engage in personal
research on a topic of choice, under the guidance of a supervisor.
Approaches to teaching and approaches to learning
Approaches to teaching and approaches to learning across the DP refers to deliberate strategies, skills and
attitudes which permeate the teaching and learning environment. These approaches and tools, intrinsically
linked with the learner profile attributes, enhance student learning and assist student preparation for the
Diploma Programme assessment and beyond. The aims of approaches to teaching and learning in the
Diploma Programme are to:
•
empower teachers as teachers of learners as well as teachers of content
The Diploma Programme 3
Business management guide

=== Page 10 ===
•
empower teachers to create clearer strategies for facilitating learning experiences in which students
are more meaningfully engaged in structured inquiry and greater critical and creative thinking •
promote both the aims of individual subjects (making them more than course aspirations) and linking
previously isolated knowledge (concurrency of learning) •
encourage students to develop an explicit variety of skills that will equip them to continue to be
actively engaged in learning after they leave school, and to help them not only obtain university
admission through better grades but also prepare for success during tertiary education and beyond •
enhance further the coherence and relevance of the students’ DP experience •
allow schools to identify the distinctive nature of an IB Diploma Programme education, with its blend of idealism and practicality.
The five approaches to learning (developing thinking skills, social skills, communication skills, self management skills and research skills) along with the six approaches to teaching (teaching that is inquiry based, conceptually focused, contextualized, collaborative, differentiated and informed by assessment)
encompass the key values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy.
Further details can be found on the DP Approaches to teaching and learning website on the programme resource centre.
The IB mission statement and the IB learner profile
The DP aims to develop in students the knowledge, skills and attitudes they will need to fulfill the aims of
the IB, as expressed in the organization’s mission statement and the learner profile. Teaching and learning
in the DP represent the reality in daily practice of the organization’s educational philosophy.
Academic integrity
Academic integrity in the Diploma Programme is a set of values and behaviours informed by the attributes
of the learner profile. In teaching, learning and assessment, academic integrity serves to promote personal
integrity, engender respect for the integrity of others and their work, and ensure that all students have an
equal opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquire during their studies.
All coursework—including work submitted for assessment—is to be authentic, based on the student’s
individual and original ideas with the ideas and work of others fully acknowledged. Assessment tasks that
require teachers to provide guidance to students or that require students to work collaboratively must be
completed in full compliance with the detailed guidelines provided by the IB for the relevant subjects.
For further information on academic integrity in the IB and the DP, please consult the IB publications
Academic integrity, Effective citing and referencing, Diploma Programme: From principles into practice and the
relevant articles in the “General regulations: Diploma Programme” section in Diploma Programme
Assessment procedures. Specific information regarding academic integrity as it pertains to external and
internal assessment components of this DP subject can be found in this guide.
Acknowledging the ideas or work of another person
Coordinators and teachers are reminded that candidates must acknowledge all sources used in work
submitted for assessment. The following is intended as a clarification of this requirement.
Diploma Programme candidates submit work for assessment in a variety of media that may include audio visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print or electronic sources. If a candidate uses
the work or ideas of another person, the candidate must acknowledge the source using a standard style of
referencing in a consistent manner. A candidate’s failure to acknowledge a source will be investigated by
the IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.
The Diploma Programme 4
Business management guide

=== Page 11 ===
The IB does not prescribe which style(s) of referencing or in-text citation should be used by candidates; this
is left to the discretion of appropriate faculty/staff in the candidate’s school. The wide range of subjects,
three response languages and the diversity of referencing styles make it impractical and restrictive to insist
on particular styles. In practice, certain styles may prove most commonly used, but schools are free to
choose a style that is appropriate for the subject concerned and the language in which candidates’ work is
written. Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a given subject, it is expected that the
minimum information given includes: name of author, date of publication, title of source, and page numbers as applicable.
Candidates are expected to use a standard style and use it consistently so that credit is given to all sources
used, including sources that have been paraphrased or summarized. When writing text candidates must
clearly distinguish between their words and those of others by the use of quotation marks (or other
method, such as indentation) followed by an appropriate citation that denotes an entry in the bibliography.
If an electronic source is cited, the date of access must be indicated. Candidates are not expected to show
faultless expertise in referencing, but are expected to demonstrate that all sources have been
acknowledged. Candidates must be advised that audio-visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data
published in print or in electronic sources that is not their own must also attribute the source. Again, an
appropriate style of referencing/citation must be used.
Learning diversity and learning support requirements
Schools must ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided to
candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Access and inclusion
policy and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes: Removing barriers to learning.
The documents Meeting student learning diversity in the classroom and The IB guide to inclusive education: a
resource for whole school development are available to support schools in the ongoing process of increasing
access and engagement by removing barriers to learning.

Overview of the curriculum model
The business management course is designed to meet the current and future needs of students who want
to develop their knowledge of business content, concepts and tools to assist with business decision making. Future employees, business leaders, entrepreneurs or social entrepreneurs need to be confident,
creative and compassionate as change agents for business in an increasingly interconnected global
marketplace. The business management course is designed to encourage the development of these attributes.
Through the exploration of four interdisciplinary concepts—creativity, change, ethics and sustainability
—this course empowers students to explore these concepts from a business perspective. Business
management focuses on business functions, management processes and decision-making in contemporary contexts of strategic uncertainty.
Students examine how business decisions are influenced by factors that are internal and external to an
organization and how these decisions impact upon a range of internal and external stakeholders. Emphasis
is placed on strategic decision-making and the operational business functions of human resource
management, finance and accounts, marketing, and operations management.
Introduction
Nature of the subject 6
Business management guide

=== Page 13 ===
The business management course encourages the application of local, national and global examples to
content and concepts; the internal assessment (IA) for both SL and HL is an individual business research
project that allows greater analysis and evaluation of content, concepts and context. Students can develop
a deeper understanding of an organization by studying its processes through the lenses of creativity, change, ethics and sustainability.
For the external assessment (paper 1 SL and HL), students will be assessed on their knowledge of important
contemporary business topics through their analysis of a fictitious business. Paper 2 (SL and HL) has a
greater focus on developing students’ analytical and financial quantitative skills. This will allow students to
combine their qualitative writing as business communicators with deeper financial analysis. In paper 3 (HL
only) students apply their knowledge of business tools and content through an innovative and potentially
disruptive social enterprise. This paper will allow business students to demonstrate their empathetic,
creative, analytical and evaluative skills. It will allow students to make ethical strategic decisions for their
stakeholders on a disruptive good or service; in the process, changing the lives of their stakeholders for the better.
Business management is a challenging and dynamic discipline that more than meets the needs of our
students growing and developing in a complex business environment. This course prepares students to be
global citizens ready to face up to the challenges and opportunities awaiting them in our ever-changing world.
Distinction between SL and HL
The SL course in business management differs from the HL course in terms of the:
•
recommended hours devoted to teaching (150 hours for SL compared to 240 hours for HL) •
extra depth and breadth required (extension material for HL only) •
nature of the examination questions in papers 2 and 3.
◦
Paper 2 for both SL and HL focuses on developing quantitative skills; however, HL students will need to develop these further in greater depth.
◦
Paper 3 is an HL-only paper based on a social enterprise, where students identify and describe a
human need and the potential organizational challenges facing the social entrepreneur. Further
to this, students are required to write a decision-making document that includes a business recommendation.
Business management and the core
Business management and theory of knowledge
Theory of knowledge (TOK) explores questions about knowledge and the process of knowing. TOK
emphasizes comparisons and connections between areas of knowledge and encourages students to
become more aware of their perspectives and the perspectives of others.
There are potential TOK connections throughout the business management syllabus. For example, there is
a particularly strong synergy between the business management topic of management information
systems and the optional TOK theme of “knowledge and technology”. Both consider the impact of today's
“information age”, its scope and ethical considerations concerning innovations such as artificial intelligence and data mining.
In TOK, students study a core theme, optional themes and areas of knowledge using a tool called the
“knowledge framework”. This framework consists of four elements: scope, perspectives, methods and tools,
and ethics. The links between business management and the TOK knowledge framework elements are explored briefly under the following headings.
Nature of the subject 7
Business management guide

=== Page 14 ===
Scope
How do we decide whether a particular discipline should be regarded as a human science? Do the
disciplines in the human sciences diverge from each other more fundamentally than disciplines in other
areas of knowledge? Are some types of knowledge more useful than others?
This element explores how the discipline and practice of business management fits within the totality of
human knowledge. It encourages discussion of how business management relates to other academic
disciplines, and how the human sciences compare and contrast with other areas of knowledge. Students
could also reflect on how business organizations support almost every aspect of human endeavour from
public universities and private pharmaceutical companies working together to develop new vaccines, to
non-government organizations (NGOs) providing primary education to the rural poor in developing
countries. The scope of business organizations to develop knowledge and ideas is only limited by
entrepreneurs' collective imaginations. Discussions of scope also allow students to explore the limitations
and potential applications of new knowledge that is generated by business organizations.
Perspectives
Are some types of knowledge less open to interpretation than others? Why do facts sometimes not change
our minds? How can we decide between the views of experts when they disagree with each other?
This element focuses on the importance of context and different perspectives. Perspectives are a crucial
aspect of all IB courses—the IB mission statement closes with the aim of developing “… learners who
understand that other people, with their differences, can also be right”. There are many ways to make
exciting and compelling links to perspectives in the business management course. For example, a recurring
topic throughout the business management syllabus is stakeholders, their differing viewpoints, conflicting
objectives and how they are affected by change. Considering the differing perspectives of stakeholder
groups allows students to gain a greater understanding of issues as diverse as financial accounts and
workforce participation. Linking to TOK discussions about perspectives can help students to deepen
understanding of their own perspectives as well as making them more aware of the perspectives of others.
Methods and tools
To what extent are the methods used in the human sciences “scientific”? To what extent can human
scientists use mathematical techniques to make accurate predictions? How can we judge when evidence is adequate?
This element focuses on exploring the methods, tools and practices that we use to produce knowledge.
Woven into every unit is the business management toolkit. This suite of decision-making tools is designed
to help business leaders assess their current situation and implement strategies for the future. To evaluate
these tools, students must consider the reliability of the data fed into these tools and the subjectivity of
their outcomes. This evaluative approach also fits with the fourth aim of the business management course,
which helps students to engage with decision-making as a process and a skill.
Ethics
In what ways do ethical judgments differ from other kinds of decisions? To what extent are the methods of
the human sciences limited by the ethical considerations involved in studying human beings? Does all
knowledge impose moral obligations on those who know it?
Ethics is both part of the TOK knowledge framework and one of the concepts in business management. The
first aim of this course is “to develop as confident, creative and compassionate business leaders,
entrepreneurs, social entrepreneurs, and as change agents”. Students can consider ethical decision-making
within every unit, whether it be privacy issues relating to big data and consumer profiling or the moral
objectives of social enterprises. When making links to TOK and ethics, the focus should be clearly on ethics
concerning knowledge. So, for example, rather than merely debating whether a controversial issue is right
or wrong, in TOK, students would consider what criteria we could use to make such judgments, who
decides, or where our values and moral beliefs come from.
Nature of the subject 8
Business management guide

=== Page 15 ===
The DP business management course has multiple opportunities for teachers and students to explore TOK
connections and the nature of knowledge. Sample questions in each unit are included to ignite classroom discussion and student interest.
Note: These suggestions are not prescriptive, and teachers are encouraged to follow their interests and those of their class.
Business management and the extended essay
An extended essay (EE) in business management provides students with an opportunity to undertake in depth research in a certain area or topic in the subject. The world of business management offers potential
for creative EEs. Students have a diverse range of areas to conduct their independent research from human
resource management, to finance, to operations, to marketing.
While undertaking the business management course, students develop essential skills that can enable them
to produce a well-balanced EE. Although students are expected to base their EE on secondary resources,
primary research can be used as well, where appropriate. Students may wish to use secondary material such
as company data, which is often accessible due to the reporting requirements of businesses.
To develop and support their arguments, students should apply relevant business theory and conduct
through analysis and evaluation in an effort to answer the research question.
The EE in business management is not an extension of the internal assessment (IA) task for the subject.
Students must have a clear understanding of the distinction between the IA and the EE.
For more information refer to the “Business management: Subject-specific guidance” section of the EE website, found on the programme resource centre.
Business management and creativity, activity, service
In the business management course students explore interactions between humans and their environment
in their own context and learn to reflect on their own identity, and potential roles in society. They are
encouraged to contribute to positive change in their communities. Students develop awareness and
knowledge of how certain businesses work, through in-depth research of case studies, including an IA
component that deepens their understanding of the complexities in business.
This knowledge is extended through creativity, activity, service (CAS), where students are motivated to act
as responsible global citizens. By acquiring skills, they learn about strategic thinking and setting objectives,
acquire planning skills and develop an appreciation for different cultural perspectives within organizations.
These skills support their CAS activities and help the students to choose CAS activities with significance or meaning for their communities.
Business management and the IB learner profile
The business management course helps to meet the demands of the IB mission statement that “aims to
develop inquiring, knowledgeable and caring young people who help to create a better and more peaceful
world through intercultural understanding and respect” (IB mission statement). This mission is further
delineated through the attributes of the IB learner profile, and the business management curriculum allows
students opportunities to demonstrate and develop these attributes through the implicit and explicit content of the course.
IB learners are:
Business management students will:
inquirers
undertake independent and collaborative investigations into real-world business case
studies, for example, through the IA research project where they develop overarching
concept-driven questions and gather relevant data to address these.
knowledgeable

their own strengths and weaknesses; hence, seek out new further sources of
information to ensure that solutions are as effective as they can be given prevailing strategic uncertainty.
Business management and international mindedness
Developing international-mindedness is essential to the business management course. Many businesses
operate across national borders and even seemingly local businesses are influenced by international
competition. The business management course helps students to understand and evaluate the implications
of business activity in an interconnected, global market.
The course encourages the use of inquiries, contemporary examples and case studies at a variety of levels,
from the local to the global, as well as from smaller scale businesses to multinational ones. Throughout the
course, teachers can choose case studies that reflect the context that they are teaching as well as case
studies that allow for comparisons across contexts. The four key concepts underpinning the course create a
framework for these discussions. The course is designed to give students an international perspective and
to encourage their appreciation of cultural diversity among different types of business organizations, and individuals and groups within them.
The course promotes the ideals of international cooperation and responsible citizenship. Students are
encouraged to make sense of the forces and circumstances that drive and restrain change in an interdependent and multicultural world.
Nature of the subject 10
Business management guide

=== Page 17 ===
Conceptually focused and contextualized teaching and learning is important for business management.
Case studies and real-world examples help to keep the right focus within the course.
Figure 3
The relationship between inquiries, concepts, content and contexts in business management
As indicated in figure 3, the three components of concepts, content and contexts are of equal relevance
and teachers may choose any one as a starting point for their teaching. Concepts are anchored in the
content of business management—its tools and theories—and are given context through the study of
case studies and real-world examples. Together these components help students to acquire a holistic and
integrated understanding of business management as a discipline.
The business management course is focused on inquiry-based teaching and learning, where students are
given the opportunity to explore business tools and theories using case studies and create their own
questions and formulate their own solutions to problems or issues facing an organization. This inquiry
approach can be used, for example, in paper 1 and the concept-based business research project IA for both
SL and HL. The teaching of the business management content should, therefore, be supported by focusing
on case studies and applying real-world examples. In some of the assessments, students will be expected to
demonstrate their understanding of business management through the lens of a case study rather than the
response being purely theoretical. In doing this, the students will go beyond their comprehension of just
theory and clearly analyse or evaluate the situation highlighted in the different case studies.
While inquiry permeates the whole course, the assessment objective 3 (AO3) topics that require more
depth are considered areas that lend themselves particularly well to this approach. However, it is important
that teachers know that inquiry as a teaching and learning strategy is not only applicable to AO3 topics.
Introduction
Approaches to the teaching and learning in business management 11
Business management guide

=== Page 18 ===
Teachers need to see the value of this approach in terms of allowing students to develop and demonstrate
higher-order thinking skills. It is important to highlight that inquiry needs to be taking place to ensure
students are actively involved in researching business issues. This inquiry approach will aid students in
developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills, an appreciation of different viewpoints, collaboration and reflective discussion.
Business skills are important to the study of business management and reflect the subject’s distinctive
approach. The teaching and learning of these skills enriches the students’ understanding of business and
enables them to apply these to various business theories and tools. It is essential that the skills should be
covered throughout the course and that they are introduced and integrated where appropriate in relation
to the concepts, content and contexts at both SL and HL. Students are expected to demonstrate
competence in the use of business skills in both the external assessment and internal assessment.
Formative assessment, as a central part of learning and teaching, helps students to build up the primary
and secondary skills required to reach their learning objectives in the subject and beyond.
Primary skills refer to those key constructs that we want to assess and are usually stated explicitly in the
learning objectives or the assessment objectives of the final assessment components. For example,
students’ abilities to apply business management tools and theories in case studies.
Secondary skills, however, are not explicit in the key learning objectives or assessment objectives in that
subject but are necessary skills for the students to perform effectively in the subject and beyond. These are
usually implicit skills that are transdisciplinary and transferrable to other subjects. For example, research
skills, reading comprehension skills, summarizing and synthesis skills.
These skills are further explored in the Business management teacher support material (TSM).
The four concepts that underpin the business management course (change, creativity, ethics and
sustainability) are integrated into the conceptual understandings of all the units to ensure that a conceptual thread is woven throughout the course.
Conceptually focused teaching helps learners to:
•
organize new information by categorizing groups of facts, ideas, theories and tools according to patterns of similarity or difference •
deepen their understanding of the complex and dynamic business world •
approach concepts and content in different ways through multiple perspectives •
make connections with other subjects to enhance interdisciplinary learning •
design overarching inquiry questions or statements that link concepts to content and to contexts.
Conceptual understanding therefore enhances the student’s overall understanding of the course, making
the subject more meaningful. This understanding assists students in showing clear evidence of synthesis
and evaluation in their responses to questions asked in the external assessment (even though the questions
may not be explicitly concept based). In the internal assessment, however, students must use a concept as a
lens through which to analyse their research project.
The definition, relative importance and relationship to the subject of business management of each of the
four key concepts may be the subject of debate. Teachers should explore how these concepts may be
understood and applied differently in different contexts. Figure 4 provides brief understandings of how the
key concepts may be initially understood in relation to the course.
Figure 4
The relationship between the key concepts and the business management course
Key concept
Understanding in relation to the course
Change
This concept is explored from several perspectives since businesses operate in a
dynamic world that is subject to constant change. Change may be a conversion,
transformation, or movement from one form, state or value to another. Inquiry
into the concept of change involves understanding and evaluating causes,
processes and consequences. Due to increasing competition, new technologies
and markets as well as changing trends in consumer behaviour, business

Key concept
Understanding in relation to the course
organizations need to adapt their objectives, strategies and operations if they are
to succeed. This success emerges from their ability to research and respond to
signals in both the internal and external environment.
Creativity
Creativity is the process of generating new ideas and considering existing ideas
from new perspectives. Creativity includes the ability to recognize the value of
ideas when developing innovative responses to problems; it may be evident in
the process as well as outcomes, products or solutions. The creation of ideas and
solutions involves a process of synthesizing and evaluating in response to surrounding changes.
Ethics
Ethics refers to moral principles, code or morals that govern the behaviour of a
person or group of people. In understanding ethics, it is important to note that
every business decision has moral implications. These decision-making processes
are based on moral philosophies or guidelines that influence the way a business
conducts itself. The consequences of these implications can be significant for
internal and external stakeholders and the natural environment.
Sustainability
Sustainability is “meeting the needs of the present without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (United Nations 1987).
Sustainability can be enhanced by conserving resources or finding more efficient
ways to produce or discover new resources. Business decisions should consider
the impacts of their results on people, planet and profit (this is termed the “triple bottom line”).
•
Cultural/social sustainability (people): businesses are encouraged to be
aware of their cultural and community settings. Within this mindset
businesses focus not only on the local community but also consider the
cultural norms and values within the external environment.
•
Environmental sustainability (planet): this demands that enterprises work
on minimizing their negative environmental impact through different
practices such as reusing, recycling or reducing waste.
•
Economic sustainability (profit): businesses/entrepreneurs are risk-takers
and strive to make a profit, which is part of their economic responsibility.
However, this also translates into employment opportunities and tax
revenue to allow for further development of the community.
Specific examples of how these key concepts can be integrated into the teaching and learning of the course can be found in the TSM.
Business management toolkit
The business management toolkit is a set of situational, planning and decision-making tools. These tools
should be used by students to analyse and evaluate the syllabus content and can be applied in different
disciplinary and interdisciplinary contexts; teachers should integrate the tools while teaching the course.
Suggestions for usage are included in figure 5 and in every unit. A visual business management toolkit is available in the TSM.
Note: The suggested areas of tool integration are indicative only and teachers should feel free to integrate
the tools in other unit areas where appropriate. All of these tools must be taught (at AO2 and AO4 level) alongside the syllabus content.
Note: All tools are SL and HL unless otherwise stated. HL only tools are in bold.

The TSM provides further guidance on the application of this toolkit including additional support on the
approaches to teaching and learning in the course.
Engaging with sensitive topics
The study of business management provides students with an opportunity to engage with exciting,
stimulating and personally relevant business topics and issues. However, it should be noted that often such
topics and issues can also be sensitive and personally challenging. Teachers should be aware of this and
provide guidance to students on how to approach and engage with such topics and issues in a responsible
and inclusive manner, providing due consideration to questions and issues that may arise.
Prior learning
The business management course requires no specific prior learning of business management or business
studies. No particular background in terms of specific subjects for national or international qualifications is
expected or required. However, a familiarity with business concepts and theories would be an advantage,
as would completing the individuals and societies course in the Middle Years Programme (MYP).
Links to the Middle Years Programme
The MYP individuals and societies subject group involves inquiry into historical, contemporary, political,
social, economic, cultural, technological and environmental contexts that impact on, and are influenced by,
individuals and societies. This is a very useful foundation for students who go on to study the DP business management course.
Students who have studied through the MYP are familiar with a conceptual approach to learning. For
example, the concepts of change, creativity, ethics and sustainability (within MYP individual and
societies courses) are further developed in the DP business management course. Conceptual analysis in the
business management course is expected to have an increasing degree of sophistication and disciplinary specificity.
The development of certain skills in the MYP individuals and societies subject group is also excellent
preparation for a DP course in business management, which requires the student to inquire, demonstrate
knowledge and understanding of content and concepts, and exhibit the capacity to think critically in a
given contextual setting. This learning process supports higher-level mastery of the approaches to teaching and learning skills.
Links to the Career-related Programme
In the Career-related Programme (CP), students study at least two DP subjects, a core consisting of four
components and a career-related study, which is determined by the local context and aligned with student
needs. Courses can be chosen from any group of the DP, and it is possible to study more than one course
from the same group (for example, business management and economics).
Approaches to the teaching and learning in business management 15
Business management guide

=== Page 22 ===
Business management develops the student’s creative, critical thinking and decision-making skills, which
are highly desired across a range of career-related pursuits. Business management is an ideal choice for CP
students considering careers in investment banking, chartered accounting, finance, corporate law, research,
leisure and tourism, government and non-governmental organizations, project management, and so on.
The DP business management course emphasizes the development of: strong written, verbal and visual
communication skills; critical thinking; problem-solving and ethical considerations that will assist students
in preparing for the future global workplace. This in turn fosters the IB learner profile attributes that are
transferable to the entire CP, providing relevance and support for the student’s learning.
For CP students, DP courses can be studied at SL or HL. Schools can explore opportunities to integrate CP students with DP students.

General
Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most important aims of assessment are that it
should support curricular goals and encourage appropriate student learning. Both external and internal
assessments are used in the Diploma Programme and Career-related Programme. IB examiners mark work
produced for external assessment, while work produced for internal assessment is marked by teachers and externally moderated by the IB.
There are two main types of assessment identified by the IB.
•
Formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is concerned with providing accurate and
helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of learning taking place and the nature of
students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop students’ understanding and capabilities.
Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide information to
monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives.
•
Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring
student achievement at, or towards the end, of the course of study.
A comprehensive assessment plan is viewed as being integral with teaching, learning and course
organization. For further information, see the IB Programme standards and practices document.
The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not norm-referenced. This approach to
assessment judges students’ work by their performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, and
not in relation to the work of other students. For further information on assessment within the Diploma
Programme please refer to the publication Assessment: principles and practice—Quality assessments in a digital age.
To support teachers in the planning, delivery and assessment of the DP or CP courses, a variety of resources
can be found on the programme resource centre or purchased from the IB store (store.ibo.org). Additional
publications such as specimen papers and markschemes, teacher support materials, subject reports and
grade descriptors can also be found on the programme resource centre. Past examination papers as well as markschemes can be purchased from the IB store.
Methods of assessment
The IB uses several methods to assess work produced by students.
Assessment criteria
Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended. Each criterion concentrates on a
particular skill that students are expected to demonstrate. An assessment objective describes what
students should be able to do, and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do it. Using
assessment criteria allows discrimination between different answers and encourages a variety of responses.
Each criterion comprises a set of hierarchically ordered level descriptors. Each level descriptor is worth one
or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The maximum marks for each
criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are added
together to give the total mark for the piece of work.
Markbands
Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance against which responses are judged.
They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds to Assessment
Assessment in the Diploma Programme and Career related Programme 37
Business management guide

=== Page 44 ===
a range of marks to differentiate student performance. A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which
particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.
Analytic markschemes
Analytic markschemes are prepared for those examination questions that expect a particular kind of
response and/or a given final answer from students. They give detailed instructions to examiners on how to
break down the total mark for each question for different parts of the response.
Marking notes
For some assessment components marked using assessment criteria, marking notes are provided. Marking
notes give guidance on how to apply assessment criteria to the particular requirements of a question.
Inclusive access arrangements
Inclusive access arrangements are available for candidates with access requirements. Standard assessment
conditions may put candidates with assessment access requirements at a disadvantage by preventing them
from demonstrating their attainment level. Inclusive access arrangements enable candidates to
demonstrate their ability under assessment conditions that are as fair as possible.
The IB publication Access and inclusion policy provides details on all the inclusive access arrangements
available to candidates. The IB publication Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes: Removing
barriers to learning outlines the position of the IB with regard to candidates with diverse learning needs in
the IB programmes. For candidates affected by adverse circumstances, the IB publication Diploma
Programme Assessment procedures (updated annually), which includes the general regulations, provides details on access consideration.
Responsibilities of the school
The school is required to ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided
to candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Access and
inclusion policy and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes: Removing barriers to learning.

Three different methods are used to assess students.
•
Analytic markschemes specific to each examination paper •
Markbands •
Assessment criteria
The markbands and assessment criteria are published in this guide.
•
For paper 1, there are markbands and markschemes.
•
For paper 2, there are markbands and markschemes.
•
For paper 3, there are assessment criteria and markschemes
The markbands and assessment criteria are related to the assessment objectives established for the
business management course and the individuals and societies grade descriptors. The markschemes are specific to each examination.
Written papers
The external assessment of the business management course consists of two examination papers at SL and
three examination papers at HL that are externally set and externally marked. They are designed to allow
students to demonstrate their competencies in relation to the business management assessment
objectives. All questions on the examination papers are based on specifications in this guide.
The external components contribute 70% to the final assessment at SL and 80% to the final assessment at
HL.
In common with all DP examination papers, students at SL and HL are given five minutes of reading time before they begin answering the papers.
Paper 1 overview
Paper 1 is the same for SL and HL students. Three months prior to the examination the IB will release a
statement with two elements. The first element will be a small number of topics that provide context to the
case study. These topics will not be topics that are in the guide but ones that students are asked to research
for approximately five hours. Topics in the pre-released statement will build on topics contained in the
syllabus. The aim is to assess students’ knowledge around important contemporary business topics that
could not have been anticipated when the guide was written.
The second element will be the first 200 words, approximately, of the case study itself. The release of this
portion of the case study will provide additional context and will reduce the number of words to be read
during the examination period. The aim of the paper is to assess students’ knowledge of the business
management syllabus. The examination is based upon one case study, of approximately 800 to 1,000
words, that students do not see before the examination. Most questions will be qualitative, although some
minor calculations could be part of the assessment.
Paper 2 overview
Paper 2 will be based on stimulus material. SL and HL students will sit different examinations, but these will
be similar in intent and form. The aim of the examination is to assess students’ knowledge of the business
management syllabus. Most questions will be quantitative, though some questions may not have a
quantitative element. Students will receive an examination booklet with questions based on the stimulus
material seen for the first time during the examination. The stimulus material will be presented in parts.
Each part has a question; students will read each part and answer the question before reading the next part

and answering the question, and so on. The stimulus material will be a combination of written and
diagrammatic stimulus such as charts and infographics. For SL only, one of the stimulus options in section B
of the examination may be on a social enterprise. HL students will be assessed on a social enterprise in
paper 3. Section A will be assessed against AO1, AO2 and AO4 levels whereas Section B will be assessed against all four levels including AO3.
Paper 3 overview
Paper 3 will be about a social enterprise and requires students to identify and describe a human need and
the potential organizational challenges facing the social entrepreneur wanting to meet this need. Further
to this, students are required to write a decision-making document that includes a business
recommendation. Only HL students will sit this examination. The paper will consist of stimulus followed by
questions. The stimulus material will consist of a short introduction to an organization, supported by a
visual representation of a product, and five or six excerpts from various documents (such as emails, Twitter feeds, newspaper articles, and so on).
The paper will have the following three tiers of questions.
•
AO1 questions—assesses students’ ability to describe the human need in the stimulus material.
•
AO2 questions—assesses students’ ability to explain the key challenges facing the social entrepreneur
or social enterprise in the setting of the stimulus material.
•
AO3/AO4 questions—assesses students’ ability to recommend a plan for the organization in meeting
the identified human need. In doing so, students will be required to demonstrate knowledge and
understanding, and their ability to explain, synthesize and evaluate evidence, and formulate a recommendation.
Please refer to the Business management teacher support material for further guidance on how to prepare for the external assessments.
Command terms
Teachers and students must be familiar with the command terms used at each assessment objective level
to understand the depth of treatment required in examination questions. Cognitive demands progress
from AO1 to AO3, while AO4 terms are specific to particular skills.
Examination questions may use any command term from the assessment objective level specified in the
“Syllabus content” section, or a less demanding command term from a lower level. For example, if the
assessment objective level for a topic is AO2, an examination question could contain any of the command
terms for AO2, such as “explain”, “distinguish”, and so on. Alternatively, the examination question could
contain a command term from AO1, such as “describe”. However, a more demanding command term, such
as “evaluate”, from a higher level (AO3 in this case) cannot be used.
The command terms used in each question, or part thereof, indicate the depth required. The command
terms are organized by assessment objective level in the “Assessment objectives” section earlier in the
guide and defined in the “Glossary of command terms” in the appendices.
Use of examples and case studies
In order to be awarded marks in the higher markbands and levels of assessment criteria, students are
expected, where appropriate, to refer to the stimulus material provided in examinations, use case studies
explored in class and illustrate their answers with examples. In this way, students highlight their
understanding of how business management tools and theories operate in practice. Where the stimulus
material, case studies and examples are referred to, students should not simply state the information, but
rather offer some explanation of how it relates to the question asked.
Use of business management terms
Students are expected to demonstrate the ability to appropriately define, use and apply the business
management terms included in the “Syllabus” section.

Use of calculators
While all questions requiring a calculator can be answered fully using a four-function (plus, minus, multiply,
divide) calculator, graphic display calculators (GDCs) are allowed during the examination.
Teachers and schools must adhere to the regulations regarding the use of electronic calculators in
examinations, and students must be made aware of these. This information can be found in the annually
revised version of Calculators guidance for examinations booklet.

Purpose of internal assessment
Internal assessment (IA) is an integral part of the course and is compulsory for both SL and HL students. It
enables students to demonstrate the application of their skills and knowledge and to pursue their personal
interests, without the time limitations and other constraints that are associated with written examinations.
The internal assessment should, as far as possible, be woven into normal classroom teaching and not be a
separate activity conducted after a course has been taught.
The IA requirements at SL and at HL are the same. Students are expected to produce a business research
project about a real issue or problem facing a particular organization using a conceptual lens.
Guidance and authenticity
The business research project (SL/HL) submitted for the IA must be the student’s own work. However, it is
not the intention that students should decide upon a title or topic and be left to work on the IA component
without any further support from the teacher. The teacher should play an important role during both the
planning stage and the period when the student is working on the internally assessed work. It is the
responsibility of the teacher to ensure that students are familiar with:
•
the requirements of the type of work to be internally assessed •
the assessment criteria; students must understand that the work submitted for assessment must address these criteria effectively.
Teachers and students must discuss the internally assessed work. Students should be encouraged to initiate
discussions with the teacher to obtain advice and information; students must not be penalized for seeking
guidance. As part of the learning process, teachers should read and give advice to students on one draft of
the work. The teacher should provide oral or written advice on how the work could be improved, but not
edit the draft. The next version handed to the teacher must be the final version for submission.
It is the responsibility of teachers to ensure that all students understand the basic meaning and significance
of concepts that relate to academic integrity, especially authenticity and intellectual property. Teachers
must ensure that all student work for assessment is prepared according to the requirements and must
explain clearly to students that the internally assessed work must be entirely their own. Where
collaboration between students is permitted, the difference between collaboration and collusion must be clear to all students.
All work submitted to the IB for moderation or assessment must be authenticated by a teacher, and must
not include any known instances of suspected or confirmed malpractice. Each student must confirm that
the work is his or her authentic work and constitutes the final version of that work. Once a student has
officially submitted the final version of the work it cannot be retracted. The requirement to confirm the
authenticity of work applies to the work of all students, not just the sample work that will be submitted to
the IB for the purpose of moderation. For further details refer to the IB publications Academic integrity,
Diploma Programme: From principles into practice and the relevant articles in the “General regulations”
section in Diploma Programme Assessment procedures.
Authenticity may be checked by discussion with the student on the content of the work, and scrutiny of one or more of the following.
•
The student’s initial proposal •
The first draft of the written work •
The references cited
Assessment
Internal assessment 51
Business management guide

=== Page 58 ===
•
The style of writing compared with work known to be that of the student •
The analysis of the work by a web-based plagiarism detection service such as www.turnitin.com
The same piece of work cannot be submitted to meet the requirements of both the IA and the EE.
Time allocation
IA is an integral part of the business management course, contributing 30% to the final assessment in the
SL course and 20% to the final assessment in the HL course. This weighting should be reflected in the time
that is allocated to teaching the knowledge, skills and understanding required to undertake the work, as
well as the total time allocated to carry out the work.
It is recommended that a total of approximately 20 hours (SL/HL) of teaching time should be allocated to the work. This should include:
•
time for the teacher to explain to students the requirements of the IA •
class time for students to work on the IA component and ask questions •
time for consultation between the teacher and each student •
time to review, monitor progress and to check authenticity.
Requirements and recommendations
It is important for the integrity of the moderation process that the IA by the teacher is based on the same
evidence as that available to the moderator. When there is more than one teacher teaching students in this
component, internal standardization must take place.
Using assessment criteria for internal assessment
For the IA, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion has level
descriptors describing specific achievement levels, together with an appropriate range of marks. The level
descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure to achieve may be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL against the criteria using the level descriptors.
•
The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.
•
The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by
the student, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be made
when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark awarded
should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is not
necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.
•
When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors for each criterion until
they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a
piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the
one that more appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.
•
Where there are two or more marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper marks if
the student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent; the work may be close to
achieving marks in the level above. Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work
demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in the level below.
•
Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.
•
Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary but should concentrate on identifying the
appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.
Internal assessment 52
Business management guide

=== Page 59 ===
•
The highest-level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by a
student. Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of the work being assessed.
•
A student who attains a high achievement level in relation to one criterion will not necessarily attain
high achievement levels in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a student who attains a low
achievement level for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the other
criteria. Teachers should not assume that the overall assessment of the students will produce any particular distribution of marks.
•
It is recommended that the assessment criteria be made available to students.
Internal assessment details—SL and HL
Business research project
Duration: 20 hours
Weighting: 30% SL and 20% HL
Introduction
The IA is a research project in which students apply appropriate business management tools and theories
to a real organizational issue or problem using a conceptual lens.
Requirements
The students are required to:
•
select a real business issue or problem for their business research project that relates to any part of the syllabus •
refer directly to a single business organization but may consider industry-wide issues that impact on that organization •
provide a research question for the business research project that could either be forward looking or backward looking •
base their research on primary and/or secondary research, selected for its suitability, depth and breadth •
attach to the business research project three to five supporting documents from which the majority of the information for the project has been obtained •
produce a business research project that does not exceed 1,800 words •
fully reference all supporting documents and additional sources and include them in a bibliography.
Key concept
The business research project must use only one of the four key concepts (change, creativity, ethics or
sustainability) as a lens through which to analyse the IA. This key concept may or may not be stated in the
research question; however, it must be clearly indicated on the title page which key concept was used. Five
marks are available for the identification and use of a relevant key concept; for these marks to be awarded,
students must make explicit the conceptual lens they are applying to their work.
Role of teacher’s guidance
With the teacher’s support, students should choose an issue or problem for investigation, and develop a title in the form of a research question.
The teacher should approve students’ questions before work is started, to ensure that they are suitable for
investigation and allow access to all levels of the assessment criteria. It is highly advisable that every
student is supplied with a copy of the assessment criteria. The teacher should also guide students in the selection of appropriate supporting documents.
Internal assessment 53
Business management guide

=== Page 60 ===
Throughout the IA process, students and the teacher should engage in dialogue supportive of the students’
work. The teacher should comment on the students’ work plans and first draft of the project as part of the learning process.
If more than one student chooses the same organization for their research, it is the responsibility of the
teacher to ensure that the business research projects reflect the students’ own individual research, interpretation and analysis.
If a student also writes an EE in business management, it is the responsibility of the teacher to ensure that
the student’s IA and EE are distinct pieces of work using different research approaches. As there are
different requirements and assessment criteria, students should choose different organizations for these different tasks.
Examples of appropriate questions
Examples of appropriate questions for the business research project might be as follows.
•
Should company Y change its manufacturing to outsourcing?
The project could then examine areas within business management such as operations management
and human resource management using change as a conceptual lens.
•
How can airline X successfully target segment Y?
The project could then examine business management topics such as market segmentation,
promotion, and measure of financial success using sustainability as a conceptual lens.
Supporting documents
The selection of supporting documents is very important. To achieve the highest levels of each assessment
criterion, it is strongly recommended that the supporting documents present a range of ideas and views.
For example, the selection of three to five documents published by a single company, or three to five
surveys of similar populations, would not provide balance or objectivity.
Relevant supporting documents must be contemporary in nature and published within a maximum of
three years prior to the submission of the business research project to the IB. Submission of the business
research project occurs in April or October of the final year of the course, depending on the examination session of the school.
A maximum of one of the supporting documents may be a transcript of video or audio material. The
transcript must provide the essential points of the video or audio file used for the purposes of the project.
Only video or audio material published by a reliable organization should be used (such as the business
organization itself, an organization commissioned by the business or an NGO). Particular attention needs to
be paid to referencing the original video or audio file so that this may be traced.
The project can be based on primary and/or secondary sources that will form the basis of the supporting documents.
Primary sources provide first-hand information or direct evidence for the research. Examples of primary
sources include:
•
face-to-face and online surveys/questionnaires; students should include a blank copy of the questionnaire and a tally/summary of responses •
face-to-face and online interviews; students should include a copy of the interview questions and summary of the responses •
focus group discussions; students should include a copy of the focus group questions and summary of the findings.
Secondary sources provide second-hand information or already existing data for the research. Examples of secondary sources include:
•
articles from the local, national or international press • business accounts • business plans
Internal assessment 54
Business management guide

=== Page 61 ===
• extracts from company websites • transcripts of a relevant audio-visual file • financial reports • government and other statistics • journal publications • market research surveys • mission statements.
Students must select three to five of their own supporting documents, which must not be provided to the
student by the teacher. Providing supporting documents with many pages is highly discouraged and hence
it is recommended that no one supporting document should exceed the equivalent of five A4 pages.
Students must highlight the parts of each supporting document that relate directly to their project. Any
highlighted parts of supporting documents that are not in the language for which the student is registered must be translated.
Students should label each supporting document clearly, such as “Supporting document 1”, “Supporting
document 2”, and so on. This will help with referencing in the project. These should be located at the appropriate section at the end of the document.
It is expected that students will include in-text citations/references of the supporting documents and a
bibliography, which should be formatted in an appropriate way. Refer to the IB publication Effective citing and referencing for further guidance.
Any additional sources such as textbooks and class notes must be referenced but will not be accepted as supporting documents.
Structure
The business research project is intended to be a structured piece of well-organized writing that effectively
presents findings and conclusions. There are many different ways that a student might approach the
project, but students should ensure that the submitted business research project evidences the following elements.
•
An introduction that sets the context. The introduction should briefly demonstrate some background
information about the business organization, give a clear outline of the issue or problem under
investigation and explain the methodology used to investigate this issue or problem.
•
The main body of the project in which findings from the supporting documents should be presented
and analysed with the help of relevant business management tools and theories including integrating
the key concept. The findings should also be interpreted: what main themes emerge from the analysis
of the supporting documents, and why and how are they helpful (or not) to answering the research
question? An evaluative approach to this discussion of findings should be pursued, for example, what
are the strengths and weaknesses of the various positions on the issue or problem and what are their implications?
•
A conclusion that answers the research question. In the conclusion, the research question should be
explicitly answered. The conclusion should not introduce facts or arguments that have not been
discussed in previous sections of the project. Rather, it is good practice to include those aspects of the
research question that have not been fully answered in the project or that might need further
investigation in order to be judged more effectively.
Presentation
Effectively presented projects require a title page, an accurate table of contents page, appropriate headings and sub-headings and numbered pages.
For the presentation of references and bibliography, please see the information on acknowledging the
ideas or work of another person in the “The Diploma Programme” section of this subject guide.

Internal assessment criteria
The business research project is assessed against seven criteria that are related to the assessment objectives for the business management course.
When the work to be assessed has been read, the descriptors for each criterion should be studied until a
descriptor is reached that most appropriately describes the achievement level. If a piece of work seems to
fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the one that more appropriately describes the student’s work chosen.
There are seven assessment criteria for the business research project.
•
Criterion A: Integration of a key concept •
Criterion B: Supporting documents •
Criterion C: Selection and application of tools and theories •
Criterion D: Analysis and evaluation •
Criterion E: Conclusions •
