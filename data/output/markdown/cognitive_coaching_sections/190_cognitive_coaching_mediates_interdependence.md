## Cognitive Coaching Mediates Interdependence

Learning to think interdependently and work collaboratively requires coaching (Knowles, Holton, and Swanson 2005, 3). Coaches help others to grow and develop as collaborative thinkers. Developing interdependent thinkers requires the initiated and sustained facilitation of adaptive learning. According to Knowles, adults need:

- To know the 'why, what, and how' of things
- To be self-directed
- The resource of prior experiences as influences on their mental models
- A readiness to learn when information is connected to their life and the learning is developmental
- An orientation to learning that is problem centered and contextual
- A motivation to learn for both intrinsic values and personal payoff

Coaches, therefore, intentionally direct their mediative questions to cause others to think interdependently. For example:

- What do you see as some benefits of allowing the group to come to consensus about the agenda?
- What might you have to give up in order to have the group unified on this approach?
- What might be some of the common values that you and Maryann share?
- What might it take to build group commitment to this plan?
- How might you lend your knowledge and resources to the group's accomplishment of its goals?
- With whom might you team to work on this task?
- As you consider John's strengths, how might he make his best contribution to this task?
- While you and Maryann disagree about how best to work with this student, how might you transcend your differences and learn from each other?
- Because you want as many interested parties involved as possible, who else might you involve in solving this problem?
