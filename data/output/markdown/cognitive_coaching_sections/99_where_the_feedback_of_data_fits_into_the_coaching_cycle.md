## Where the Feedback of Data Fits into the Coaching Cycle

The coach meets with a teacher for a planning conversation. The coach invites the teacher to identify what information is desired, determine when it should be collected, and to specify in what format the data will be recorded. As part of the process, coaches and coachees should agree on documentation methods so that the coachee is not only aware of the goals but can also monitor and celebrate his/her successes. As the coachees monitor their goals, they can modify their strategies if they are not producing success. Examples might include the following:

- Tell me what you want me to record about student responses that will be of help to your understanding of their higher-level thinking.
- So, my job is to keep a tally on this seating chart of which students are on task and which students are off task.
- When in the lesson do you want me to record your directions? Just at the beginning when you outline their assignment, or throughout the entire lesson whenever you give a direction?

During the lesson, the coach observes and records data that the teacher requested during the planning conversation. For example, a coach can

record data with video, audio, classroom maps, time-on-task charts, and verbatim scripts of teachers' or students' statements. (Note: There are numerous electronic videos as well as audio and written classroom observational tools available on the Web. We recommend those that promote self-directedness, that are nonjudgmental, that make sense to the teacher being observed, that are suitable for their content and grade level, and that are designed to collect the data that is relevant to the teacher.)

Because the ultimate goal of the coach is to mediate another's capacity for self-coaching and self-modification, the coach may also mediate the colleague's gathering of data. For example, during a planning conversation the coach might say the following:

- What information do you have about these students that will guide your lesson design?
- What indicators will you be aware of to let you know you are achieving the meeting's goals?
- How will you monitor your own pacing to accomplish your agenda within the time constraints?

After the lesson, the coach conducts a reflecting conversation. The coach provides the coachee with the desired data nonjudgmentally. (See examples in 'Providing Nonjudgmental Data' in the following pages.) The coach poses mediative questions focusing on the information desired by the coachee during the planning conversation and gathered by the coach during the lesson. The coach mediates the acquisition of data by drawing forth and focusing on the information gathered by the coachee during the lesson:

- What indicators were you aware of that let you know the group understood its task?
- What data were you collecting during the lesson that informed your decision to change the plan?
- What indicators were you aware of that let you know the group was engaged?
- Given this data, how do you think the class responded to your lesson?

Efficacious, craftsmanlike teachers remain open to continuous learning. They gather data through conscious observation of feelings attitudes and skills, through observations and interviews with others, and by collecting evidence showing the effects of their efforts in the classroom environment.

The data are analyzed, interpreted, and internalized. Based on the analysis, the teachers modify their actions to more closely achieve the goals. Thus individuals become continually self-renewing and self-modifying.

What is known about effective feedback?

- For feedback to be effective, it must be neutral. If it is overly anecdotal, the discussion wanders and becomes personal.
- If it is quantitative based on previously agreed indicators of how well the process works, the chances of hearing it are improved.
- People need feedback so desperately that, in the absence of actual feedback, they will invent it.
- Data energizes learning. Humans learn and grow when they have the opportunity to consider external and internal data. External data include feedback from peers, teachers, coaches, personal experiences, and/or test results.
- Neither external nor internal data are useful for learning unless feedback is frequent and stated in constructive terms. Feedback given too long after an assessment or learning event won't influence a learner in the same way as data offered almost immediately.
- The term 'internal data' describes information gained from feedback and personal reflection.

To become self-directed, teachers need opportunities to generate data and to self-evaluate. They must learn how to compare their current performance to previous performances, and they must learn how to analyze their performance in terms of benchmarks for effective performance.
