The five “C” goal areas (Communication, Cultures, Connections, Comparisons, and Communities)
stress the application of learning a language beyond the instructional setting. The goal is to
prepare learners to apply the skills and understandings measured by the Standards, to bring a
global competence to their future careers and experiences.
The National Standards for Learning Languages have been
revised based on what language educators have learned
from more than 15 years of implementing the Standards.
The guiding principle was to clarify what language learners
would do to demonstrate progress on each Standard.
These revised Standards include language to reflect the cur rent educational landscape, including:
•	 Common Core State Standards •	 College and Career Readiness •	 21st century skills
These Standards are equally applicable to:
•	 learners at all levels, from pre-kindergarten through post secondary levels
•	 native speakers and heritage speakers, including ESL students •	 American Sign Language •	 Classical Languages (Latin and Greek)
The 2011 report, A Decade of  Foreign Language Standards: Im pact, Influence, and Future Directions, provided evidence of and
support for the following concepts which influenced these
revisions:
•	 The National Standards are influencing language learning
from elementary, through secondary, to postsecondary levels.
•	 The integrated nature of the five “C” goal areas has been accepted by the profession.
•	 Educators asked for more description of what language
learners should know and be able to do in the goal areas of Connections and Communities.
•	 Over 40 states have used the five “C” goal areas to create
state standards for learning languages (identifiable even if configured in slightly different ways).
•	 Some state documents are beginning to describe cultural outcomes in terms of processes of observation and experience.
•	 Many local curricula are also aligned with the five “C” goal areas and the details of the 11 standards.
Based on this consensus from all levels of language
educators, the five goal areas and the 11 standards
have been maintained. The World-Readiness Standards
for Learning Languages clarify and better illustrate each
goal area and standard in order to guide implementation
and influence assessment, curriculum, and instruction.
Responses to the online feedback survey gave overwhelming support to the proposed revisions:
•	 93.4% of respondents said the “refreshed” Standards describe appropriate (39.1%) or very appropriate expectations (54.3%) for language learners.
•	 94.9% of respondents said the “refreshed” Standards provide equally clear (10.9%), somewhat clearer (26.8%), or much clearer direction (57.2%) for language educators and learners.
In response to additional suggestions from the feedback and
comments received, specific descriptions of performance at
each level (Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Superior),
sample indicators of progress, and sample learning scenarios
will be the next areas addressed in this revision process.
