## Clarifying

We are prepared to see, and we see easily, things for which our language and culture hand us ready-made labels. When those labels are lacking, even though the phenomena may be all around us, we may quite easily fail to see them at all. The perceptual attractors that we each possess (some coming from without, some coming from within, some on the scale of mere words, some on a much grander scale) are the filters through which we scan and sort reality, and thereby they determine what we perceive on high and low levels.

-D. Hofstadter (2000)

The brain and central nervous system filter an enormous amount of sensory input. A million bits of information per minute come pouring into the brain-and we certainly can't attend to it all. Instead we generalize, fitting information into already stored patterns and categories. Sometimes we delete, or literally stop data from coming in-for example, we see bugs and dirt on a windshield but look through them to focus on the road and other cars. At other times we distort, shaping information to fit our preconceived structures and beliefs. There is a story about a man who thought he was a corpse. After six months, his psychiatrist asked him if corpses could bleed. The patient said, 'Of course not!' The doctor pricked the patient's finger and squeezed out some blood. The patient stared at it and exclaimed, 'What do you know? Corpses do bleed!'

Because our brains easily filter and distort information, it's important to understand some of the cognitive reasons that clarifying is essential. The skillful coach looks for the speech patterns described in the following.

Vague nouns or pronouns . When the teacher talks about 'the textbooks,' she has deleted information about which textbooks she's

referring to. The coach can ask, 'Which textbooks, specifically?' Clarifying vague nouns and pronouns supplies missing data and provides more precise information. When the teacher says 'they . . .,' the coach can get a better understanding by asking, 'Who specifically is 'they'?'

Vague verbs . These refer to unspecified action words, such as think and understand , and they also signal deleted information. When the coach hears, 'I want students to understand,' he can ask, 'Understand how, specifically?' to clarify the performance. 'Which students?' will clarify the audience. 'What will you see them doing when they are understanding?' tells the coach exactly what the teacher is looking for.

Comparisons . Distortions or generalities will sometimes be masked by comparisons. Often, the teacher will not elaborate to whom or to what she is comparing students. For example, if the teacher says, 'The class is much easier,' the coach can clarify, 'Easier than what?' Or if the teacher says, 'Rebecca's getting along much better,' the coach can ask, 'Better than what?'

Rule words . Phrases like 'I can't,' 'We shouldn't,' 'It happens all the time,' or 'Nobody does that' should alert the coach that the teacher is limiting his thinking and possibly working with distorted perceptions. Skillful coaches challenge this mind-set. When a teacher says, 'I can't,' the coach can respond, 'What's stopping you?' When the teacher says, 'We shouldn't,' one response is 'What would happen if we did? Who made up that rule?' 'What other options might you have?'

Universal quantifiers . Terms such as e verybody , all the time , nobody , never , and always also limit thinking. Statements employing these terms can be challenged with intonation. If the teacher says, 'Nobody around here does that,' the coach may simply clarify by saying, 'On what data are you basing that?' Most people will recognize that they have overgeneralized. Or the coach can ask for exception: 'Nobody around here does that? Can you think of someone who does?' This, too, leads the teacher to see that she has generalized.

Clarifying is an effective skill to call on when the speaker uses a vague concept or a vocabulary that the listener doesn't understand. The purpose of clarifying is to invite the speaker to illuminate, elaborate, and become more precise in his meaning. Clarifying helps both the listener to better understand the speaker and the speaker become clearer about his intentions. Some examples of clarifying include the following:

- Say more about that.
- What will students be doing if they are comprehending the story?

- Which students, specifically?
- When you say this class is better, better than what?
- When you say 'the administrators,' which administrators do you mean?
- What do you mean by 'appreciate'?
