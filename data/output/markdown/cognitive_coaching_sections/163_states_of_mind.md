## States of Mind

As we develop soul in our work we need to recognize our dual identity: we are both individuals and members of a group. Indeed, finding the soul of work involves the balance and integration of apparent opposites, such as head and heart, intellect and intuition, and self and group. This process is not so much based on the 'shoulds' but upon 'what is.' It is my belief that as we attend to the soul of work we will find we feel more complete.

I n this chapter, we look beyond surface behaviors of thinking and teaching to discover the sources of excellence that drive human performance. Our aim is to focus the coach's capacities on mediating the energy sources that fuel self-directed learning, behavior, and, ultimately, the development of capacities for effective action in holonomous settings. The five states of mind we describe are the wellsprings that nurture all high-performing individuals, groups, and organizations. They are beacons guiding us toward increasingly authentic, congruent, and ethical behavior (Costa and Garmston 2002)

First, we revisit the concept of holonomy (the state of being simultaneously a part and a whole) and the tensions that the paradox of holonomy produces. Next, we explore five states of mind that people draw upon to perform at their best and to resolve such tensions. Finally, we offer

ideas for mediating these states of mind.
