## Flexibility as an Innate Drive

To live is to change. Humans have survived over eons because of their capacity to adapt to changing environments, needs, and technologies. An amazing discovery about the human brain is its plasticity-its ability to 'rewire,' change, and even repair itself to become smarter. Researchers have described the brain's role in cognitive flexibility as it adjusts thinking from old situations to the new, overcoming responses that have become habitual (Moore and Malinowski 2009), and its relationship to executive functioning, planning, and working memory (Miyake et al. 2000).

Humans are a unique form of life because they can perceive from multiple perspectives and can deliberately change, adapt, expand, and control their repertoire of response patterns. Located in the prefrontal cortex, response flexibility enables the mind to attend and assess the subtle verbal and nonverbal cues, and then to modify internal external reactions accordingly. Flexibility is the mind's ability to deal with human differences-conflicting ideas, alternative perspectives, divergent points of

view, and collective problem solving.
