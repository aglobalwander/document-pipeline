## TRUST IN THE COACHING PROCESS

Trust building begins with the first encounter, when the colleague realizes that the coach is interested, that the coach is an empathic listener, and that the relationship is nonevaluative. Increasingly, as the coach and the teacher work together in a nonthreatening relationship, they both place greater value on the coaching process. They realize that the intent of the process is to grow intellectually, to learn more about learning, and to mutually increase their capacity for self-improvement. They realize that the process is not one that the 'superior' does to the 'inferior'; rather, they are two

dedicated professionals striving to solve problems, improve learning, and make the curriculum more vibrant. Furthermore, the teacher soon realizes that the coach is working at the coaching processes as hard as the teacher is working at the teaching process.

In time, we find that teachers begin to request the coaching process with phrases like the following:

- 'That felt good.'
- 'You really made me think.'
- 'Could you come back?'
- 'Would you teach me how to coach like that?'

Soon the process begins to spread. Word gets around through the school grapevine. Principals call each other, requesting to be Cognitively Coached through an upcoming parent conference. The director of staff development calls a principal, asking to be coached through a forthcoming in-service presentation. Teachers in grade-level or department meetings soon find that they are coaching each other spontaneously, beyond the classroom, situation free.

In chapter 3, we described eight behaviors that contribute to the intellectual growth and the engagement of cognition in others. Many of these same nonjudgmental behaviors contribute to a trusting relationship as well. In fact, we know that the neocortex of the brain shuts down by degrees under stress. The greater the stress, the greater the shutdown. Generally, human males will move toward freeze, fight, flee, or flight; females tend and befriend. Under great stress, we lash out, run away in terror, or freeze up. or we lash out. Physical rapport, subtleties of body language, voice tone, implied value judgments, and embedded presuppositions in our language all have an effect on the comfort and thinking of others. To communicate with skill and grace, we must communicate with the total body-brain system. The systems that process nonverbal signals and feelings are as important to thinking processes as they are to establishing a trusting relationship.
