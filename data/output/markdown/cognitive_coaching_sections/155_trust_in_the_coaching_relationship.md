## Trust in the Coaching Relationship

Be transparent, focus on the other, seek a collaborative partnership, and view the relationship as long term, not a temporary interaction.

-Charles Green

Nearly all relationship difficulties are rooted in conflicting or ambiguous expectations surrounding roles and goals. Paramount are perceptions of unequal status, which can arouse the limbic system and set the neocortex into a defensive mode (Rock 2009). Whether we are assigning tasks at work or choosing a decision-making process for a meeting, we can be certain that unclear expectations will lead to misunderstanding, disappointment, and decreased trust.

As described in the chapter 3, certainty is another social need of the brain (Rock 2009), and coaches provide this by making structuring comments that clarify expectations. For example:

- 'I'm not going to give you advice. Let's explore some alternatives together.'
- 'My job is not to evaluate you but to help you reflect on your teaching.'

Clear expectations are most important dealing with the purposes and forms of classroom observations. When principals perform the two supervisory functions of coaching and evaluation, it's important to be clear about the goals of a classroom visit. Confusion, suspicion, and even hostility arise when a teacher is uncertain which support function is occurring, coaching or evaluation.

When mentor teachers are responsible for the dual functions of consulting and coaching, again, clarity about intention is important. Peer assistance and other ongoing staff development efforts send a signal that this is a learning community for all teachers. Within that context, peer assistance may be seen as an expression of continuous learning, with recognition that teachers, too, are individuals. Some may be at different stages in their development and require different types of support.

Strategically, we would recommend that peer assistance programs, in which teachers are mentoring and coaching each other, be part of an ongoing, well-developed professional development system (Woods 1997). This allows time for collective learning about how to give and receive support without the threat of evaluation.
