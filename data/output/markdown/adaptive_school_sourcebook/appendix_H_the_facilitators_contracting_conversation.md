| Clarify the desired state for the intermediate client, the primary client, and the ultimate clients. | • Inquire about the client's ultimate goals. • Ask how the client will know that the goals have been achieved. • Present the data that you as a facilitator have gathered from other sources that might influence the client's framing of outcomes. • Assist in suggesting additional behavioral descriptors of the desired state.                                                                                                 |

| Describe what you can and cannot offer.                                 | Describe the services that you feel qualified to provide that are appropriate to your understanding of the client's wants and to achieving the desired state. Describe the support services required for project success. Clarify any constraints you believe you will have in this relationship.

| Define the principles and values that will guide the facilitation work. | Who will decide what? Who will recommend what? What is within and beyond the scope of the group's authority?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Get an agreement and test its strength.                                 | Many facilitation contracts are faulty for one of three reasons: 1. The client felt some kind of coercion, however subtle or indirect. 2. The client agreed to the arrangements but increasingly felt inadequate control over what was happening. 3. The client talks a more participative game about decision making than he or she is really comfortable with. Ask 'Is this project something you really want to see happening? Are you fully satisfied with the way we have set things up? Do you feel you have enough control over how this project is going to proceed?' |
| Provide support.                                                        | Make genuine supportive statements about the client's willingness to proceed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Summarize the next steps.                                               | Clarify who will do what by when.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
