High School Outcomes (Grades 9 – 12)
By the end of high school, the learner will be college/career-ready, as demonstrated by the ability to plan and implement different types of person al fitness programs; demonstrate competency in two or more lifetime activities; describe key concepts associated with successful participation in
physical activity; model responsible behavior while engaged in physical activity; and engage in physical activities that meet the need for self-expres sion, challenge, social interaction and enjoyment.
Note:  High school outcomes have been organized into two levels.  Level 1 indicates the minimum knowledge and skills that students must attain to be college/
career-ready.  Level 2 allows students to build on Level 1 competencies by augmenting knowledge and skills considered desirable for college/career readiness.
Note: Swimming skills and water-safety activities should be taught of facilities permit.
