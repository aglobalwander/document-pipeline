What elements of literacy lead to higher levels of understanding in the Interpretive Mode?
Learners move along the proﬁ ciency continuum at different speeds in listening, reading or viewing. Learners bring prior skills and experience in L1 and L2 to the
Interpretive mode. Factors that impact how well learners understand texts include:
a) text complexity or length
b) familiarity with topic and background knowledge
c)  ability to use literacy strategies such as recognizing key words, detecting the main idea, identifying supporting details, noting organizational features, guessing
meaning from context, identifying logical inferences, identifying the author’s perspective and cultural perspectives/norms.
