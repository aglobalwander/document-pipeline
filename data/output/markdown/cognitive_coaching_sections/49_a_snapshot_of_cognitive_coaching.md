## A SNAPSHOT OF COGNITIVE COACHING

Research demonstrates that teachers with higher conceptual levels are more adaptive and flexible in their teaching style. They act in accordance with a disciplined commitment to human values (Sprinthall and TheisSprinthall 1982), and they produce higher-achieving students who are more cooperative and involved in their work (Harvey 1967). Borg (2009), citing studies on teacher cognition, notes that interest in this field faded after the 1980s, when more behaviorist conceptions of teaching became popular. Cognitive Coaching increases the capacities for sound decision making and self-directedness, which helps to achieve goals like these (Edwards 2015).

At one level, Cognitive Coaching is a simple model for conversations about planning, reflecting, or problem resolving. At deeper levels, Cognitive Coaching serves as the nucleus for professional communities that honor autonomy, encourage interdependence, and produce high achievement. Cognitive Coaching is a form of dialogue that provides a space for self-reflection, for revising and refining positions and selfconcepts, where a colleague is invited to see him/herself in a new light. Cognitive Coaching is a nonjudgmental, developmental, reflective model

derived from a blend of the psychological orientations of cognitive theorists and the interpersonal bonding of humanists such as Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow. The model is informed by current work in brain research, constructivist learning theory, and practices that best promote learning (information about which is expanded in chapter 9).

Fundamental to the model is the focus on a practitioner's cognitive development. This focus is based on the belief that growth is achieved through the development of intellectual functioning. Therefore, the coaching interaction focuses on mediating a practitioner's thinking, perceptions, beliefs, and assumptions toward the goals of self-directed learning and increased complexity of cognitive processing.

Cognitive Coaching strengthens professional performance by enhancing one's ability to examine familiar patterns of practice and consider underlying assumptions that guide and direct action. Cognitive Coaching's unique contribution is that it influences another person's thought processes. Cognitive Coaching is systematic, rigorous, and data based. The purpose of this model is to enhance an individual's capacity for selfdirected learning through self-management, self-monitoring, and selfmodification.

We find a useful metaphor for the essence of Cognitive Coaching in the story of a boy watching a butterfly emerge from its chrysalis:

The boy observed the chrysalis closely each day until the casing broke away and a small opening appeared. The boy could see the butterfly's head, and, as the butterfly began to emerge, an antenna appeared, then one leg.

The boy watched the butterfly for several hours as it struggled to force its body through the small aperture. Then the butterfly seemed to stop making any progress. It appeared as if the butterfly could go no farther. So the boy decided to help, not realizing that it was the struggle itself that gave the butterfly strength. He scratched away the remaining scales of the confining cocoon with his thumbnail, and the butterfly easily emerged. However, it had a swollen body, small, shriveled wings, and bent legs.

So, too, the challenges and ultimate achievements of Cognitive Coaching make educators stronger and better equipped to fulfill their roles in schools today.
