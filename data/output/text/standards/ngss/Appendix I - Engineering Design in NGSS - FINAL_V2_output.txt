APPENDIX I – Engineering Design in the NGSS
The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) represent a commitment to integrate
engineering design into the structure of science education by raising engineering design to the
same level as scientific inquiry when teaching science disciplines at all levels, from kindergarten
to grade 12. There are both practical and inspirational reasons for including engineering design as an essential element of science education.
We anticipate that the insights gained and interests provoked from studying and
engaging in the practices of science and engineering during their K-12 schooling should
help students see how science and engineering are instrumental in addressing major
challenges that confront society today, such as generating sufficient energy, preventing
and treating diseases, maintaining supplies of clean water and food, and solving the
problems of global environmental change. (NRC 2012, p. 9).
Providing students a foundation in engineering design allows them to better engage in and aspire
to solve the major societal and environmental challenges they will face in the decades ahead.
Key Definitions
One of the problems of prior standards has been the lack of clear and consistent definitions of the
terms science, engineering, and technology. A Framework for K-12 Science Education has defined these terms as follows:
In the K–12 context, “science” is generally taken to mean the traditional natural
sciences: physics, chemistry, biology, and (more recently) earth, space, and
environmental sciences . . . . We use the term “engineering” in a very broad sense to
mean any engagement in a systematic practice of design to achieve solutions to
particular human problems. Likewise, we broadly use the term “technology” to include
all types of human-made systems and processes—not in the limited sense often used in
schools that equates technology with modern computational and communications
devices. Technologies result when engineers apply their understanding of the natural
world and of human behavior to design ways to satisfy human needs and wants. (NRC 2012, p. 11-12)
The Framework’s definitions address two common misconceptions. The first is that engineering
design is not just applied science. As described in Appendix F: Science and Engineering
Practices in the NGSS, the practices of engineering have much in common with the practices of
science, although engineering design has a different purpose and product than scientific inquiry.
The second misconception is that technology describes all the ways that people have modified
the natural world to meet their needs and wants.  Technology does not just refer to computers or electronic devices.
The purpose of defining “engineering” more broadly in the Framework and NGSS is to
emphasize engineering design practices that all citizens should learn. For example, students are
expected to be able to define problems—situations that people wish to change—by specifying
criteria and constraints for acceptable solutions; generating and evaluating multiple solutions;
building and testing prototypes; and optimizing a solution. These practices have not been
explicitly included in science standards until now.

Engineering Design in the Framework
The term “engineering design” has replaced the older term “technological design,” consistent
with the definition of engineering as a systematic practice for solving problems, and technology
as the result of that practice.  According to the Framework: “From a teaching and learning point
of view, it is the iterative cycle of design that offers the greatest potential for applying science
knowledge in the classroom and engaging in engineering practices” (NRC 2012, pp. 201-2). The
Framework recommends that students explicitly learn how to engage in engineering design practices to solve problems.
The Framework also projects a vision of engineering design in the science curriculum, and of
what students can accomplish from early school years to high school:
In some ways, children are natural engineers. They spontaneously build sand castles,
dollhouses, and hamster enclosures, and they use a variety of tools and materials for
their own playful purposes. …Children’s capabilities to design structures can then be
enhanced by having them pay attention to points of failure and asking them to create
and test redesigns of the bridge so that it is stronger. (NRC, 2012, p. 70).
By the time these students leave high school, they can “undertake more complex
engineering design projects related to major global, national, or local issues” (NRC,
2012, p. 71). The core idea of engineering design includes three component ideas:
A.  Defining and delimiting engineering problems involves stating the problem to be
solved as clearly as possible in terms of criteria for success, and constraints or limits.
B.  Designing solutions to engineering problems begins with generating a number of
different possible solutions, then evaluating potential solutions to see which ones best meet the criteria and constraints of the problem.
C.  Optimizing the design solution involves a process in which solutions are systematically
tested and refined and the final design is improved by trading off less important features for those that are more important.
It is important to point out that these component ideas do not always follow in order, any more
than do the “steps” of scientific inquiry.  At any stage, a problem-solver can redefine the problem
or generate new solutions to replace an idea that just isn’t working out.
Engineering Design in Relation to Student Diversity
The NGSS inclusion of engineering with science has major implications for non-dominant
student groups. From a pedagogical perspective, the focus on engineering is inclusive of students
who may have traditionally been marginalized in the science classroom or experienced science as
not being relevant to their lives or future. By asking questions and solving meaningful problems
through engineering in local contexts (e.g., watershed planning, medical equipment, instruments
for communication for the Deaf), diverse students deepen their science knowledge, come to view
science as relevant to their lives and future, and engage in science in socially relevant and transformative ways.
From a global perspective, engineering offers opportunities for “innovation” and “creativity” at
the K-12 level. Engineering is a field that is critical to undertaking the world’s challenges, and

exposure to engineering activities (e.g., robotics and invention competitions) can spark interest in
the study of STEM or future careers (National Science Foundation, 2010). This early
engagement is particularly important for students who have traditionally not considered science
as a possible career choice, including females and students from multiple languages and cultures in this global community.
Engineering Design in the NGSS
In the NGSS, engineering design is integrated throughout the document. First, a fair number of
standards in the three disciplinary areas of life, physical, and Earth and space science begin with
an engineering practice. In these standards, students demonstrate their understanding of science
through the application of engineering practices.  Second, the NGSS also include separate
standards for engineering design at the K-2, 3-5, 6-8, and 9-12 grade levels. This multi-pronged
approach, including engineering design both as a set of practices and as a set of core ideas, is
consistent with the original intention of the Framework.
It is important to point out that the NGSS do not put forward a full set of standards for
engineering education, but rather include only practices and ideas about engineering design that
are considered necessary for literate citizens. The standards for engineering design reflect the
three component ideas of the Framework and progress at each grade span.
Grades K-2
Engineering design in the earliest grades introduces students to “problems” as situations that
people want to change.  They can use tools and materials to solve simple problems, use different
representations to convey solutions, and compare different solutions to a problem and determine
which is best.  Students in all grade levels are not expected to come up with original solutions,
although original solutions are always welcome. Emphasis is on thinking through the needs or
goals that need to be met, and which solutions best meet those needs and goals.

Define
Identify situations that people want to change as problems that can be solved through engineering
Develop solutions
Convey possible solutions through visual or physical representations
Optimize
Compare solutions, test them, and evaluate each

Grades 3-5
At the upper elementary grades, engineering design engages students in more formalized
problem solving. Students define a problem using criteria for success and constraints or limits of
possible solutions.  Students research and consider multiple possible solutions to a given
problem. Generating and testing solutions also becomes more rigorous as the students learn to
optimize solutions by revising them several times to obtain the best possible design.

Grades 6-8
At the middle school level, students learn to sharpen the focus of problems by precisely
specifying criteria and constraints of successful solutions, taking into account not only what
needs the problem is intended to meet, but also the larger context within which the problem is
defined, including limits to possible solutions.  Students can identify elements of different
solutions and combine them to create new solutions. Students at this level are expected to use
systematic methods to compare different solutions to see which best meet criteria and
constraints, and to test and revise solutions a number of times in order to arrive at an optimal design.
Define
Specify criteria and constraints that a possible solution to a simple problem must meet
Develop solutions
Research and explore multiple possible solutions
Optimize
Improve a solution based on results of simple tests, including failure points

Grades 9-12
Engineering design at the high school level engages students in complex problems that include
issues of social and global significance. Such problems need to be broken down into simpler
problems to be tackled one at a time.  Students are also expected to quantify criteria and
constraints so that it will be possible to use quantitative methods to compare the potential of
different solutions. While creativity in solving problems is valued, emphasis is on identifying the
best solution to a problem, which often involves researching how others have solved it before.
Students are expected to use mathematics and/or computer simulations to test solutions under
different conditions, prioritize criteria, consider trade-offs, and assess social and environmental impacts.
Define
Attend to precision of criteria and constraints and considerations likely to limit possible solutions
Develop solutions
Combine parts of different solutions to create new solutions
Optimize
Use systematic processes to iteratively test and refine a solution

Conclusion
The inclusion of engineering design within the fabric of the NGSS has profound implications for
curriculum, teaching, and assessment. All students need opportunities to acquire engineering
design practices and concepts alongside the practices and concepts of science.
The decision to integrate engineering design into the science disciplines is not intended either to
encourage or discourage development of engineering courses. In recent years, many middle and
high schools have introduced engineering courses that build students’ engineering skill, engage
them in experiences using a variety of technologies, and provide information on a range of
engineering careers. The engineering design standards included in the NGSS could certainly be a
component of such courses but most likely do not represent the full scope of such courses or an
engineering pathway. Rather, the purpose of the NGSS is to emphasize the key knowledge and
skills that all students need in order to engage fully as workers, consumers, and citizens in 21st century society.
