## SIX DOMAINS OF PROFESSIONAL INQUIRY

The true delight is in the finding out rather than in the knowing.

- -Isaac Asimov, Russian-born American author and biochemist

Although the accumulated knowledge in each domain is vast, there is still more to learn-it is never 'mastered.' In this chapter, we organize and address the interacting fields of teaching knowledge under six domains of continuing inquiry. The effective coach is familiar with each of these domains and how each one influences a teacher's work in and out of the classroom. Coaches, therefore, encourage teachers to continuously experiment, innovate, learn more about, and synthesize the results into

new patterns and practices.
