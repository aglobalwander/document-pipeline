The IB Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous, academically challenging and
balanced programme of education designed to prepare students aged 16 to 19
for success at university and life beyond. The DP aims to encourage students to be
knowledgeable, inquiring, caring and compassionate, and to develop intercultural
understanding, open-mindedness and the attitudes necessary to respect and evalu ate a range of viewpoints. Approaches to teaching and learning (ATL) are deliberate
strategies, skills and attitudes that permeate the teaching and learning environment.
In the DP, students develop skills from five ATL categories: thinking, research, social, self-management and communication.
To ensure both breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding, students must
choose six courses from six distinct groups: 1) studies in language and literature; 2)
language acquisition; 3) individuals and societies; 4) sciences; 5) mathematics; 6) the
arts. Students may choose to replace the arts course with a second course from one
of the other five groups. At least three, and not more than four, subjects are taken at
higher level (240 recommended teaching hours), while the remaining are taken at
standard level (150 recommended teaching hours). In addition, three core
elements—the extended essay, theory of knowledge and creativity, activity,
service—are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.
These DP subject briefs illustrate four key course components.

I. Course description and aims
The DP global politics course explores fundamental political concepts
such as power, equality, sustainability and peace in a range of contexts.
It allows students to develop an understanding of the local, national, in ternational and global dimensions of political activity and processes, as
well as to explore political issues affecting their own lives. The course
helps students to understand abstract political concepts by grounding
them in real-world examples and case studies. It also invites comparison
between such examples and case studies to ensure a wider and trans national perspective.
Teachers explicitly teach thinking and research skills such as compre hension, text analysis, transfer, and use of primary sources. The study of
global politics enables students to critically engage with different and
new perspectives and approaches to politics in order to comprehend
the challenges of the changing world and become aware of their role in it as active global citizens.
The aims of the global politics course are to enable students to:
• understand key political concepts and contemporary political issues in a range of contexts
• develop an understanding of the local, national, international and global dimensions of political activity
• understand, appreciate and critically engage with a variety of perspectives and approaches in global politics
• appreciate the complex and interconnected nature of many
political issues, and develop the capacity to interpret competing and contestable claims regarding those issues.
