## THE IMPACT OF COGNITIVE COACHING ON TEACHERS' PERSONAL LIVES

Teachers reported that Cognitive Coaching not only impacted them professionally, it impacted them personally. In an early study, teachers listed usability of skills in all areas of their lives as the number one source of satisfaction with Cognitive Coaching. They listed self-growth as the second source of satisfaction (Edwards and Newton 1994a).

Awakuni (1995) conducted a study in which teachers participated in Cognitive Coaching for a year. Teachers reported having increased confidence in themselves and a greater sense of self. In a study by Clinard et al. (1995), teachers who used Cognitive Coaching with student teachers grew in their positive feelings about themselves, and they altered their

attitudes with people in their families.

In Schlosser's (1998) study, teachers indicated that they first used Cognitive Coaching in their personal lives before using it in their professional lives because trust had already been established in those relationships. In another study, teachers who had taken eight days of Cognitive Coaching training indicated that they had developed personally as a result of the training (Beltman 2009).

Wooten Burnett (2015) studied seven physical education teacher candidates in a master's program who received three cycles of Cognitive Coaching (three planning conversations and three reflecting conversations) over a period of six weeks. Seven teachers participated in the control group. She also collected data from semistructured interviews, an openended survey, and the three cycles of planning and reflecting conversations. The participants indicated that the coaching they received 'helped them become more aware of their self-development' (97) and that it had helped them grow personally.
