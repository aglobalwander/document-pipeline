Human beings, not human doings\n\nASKS WHO AM I / WHO ARE WE?\n\n## Values/beliefs-WHY of the work\n\nYour personal/collective value system 'we believe in developing community' so we value collaboration provide moral imperative for other levels\n\nCapabilities-HOW do we use skills that we have? metacognition - How make choices about strategies, mental maps, 4 group member capabilities- consciousness around capabilities metacognitive awareness and guides behavior did skill not know what to do with it\n\nHOWmetacognitive--planning, monitoring, direction for how I select my behaviors, knowledge, steering wheels, support.\n\nWhat guides direction of how we do something (paraphrasing-living into capability of it)\n\nAbility how to do it. Capability have power/will to do it\n\nUnder what conditions do I do this? Strategies selecting context, timing, etc. Why choose this strategy?\n\nGuides behavioral choice, steering wheel-kill people with these strategies metacognitive ability how to design lessons in expanded time; street skills of PPP / norms mental model in new context (dialogue)\n\nBehaviors-WHAT individuals / groups do WHAT behaviors should we engage? Application of skills /knowledge to actions and reactions Attending, paraphrasing, making meaning, etc.\n\nPD for PBL, hands on, etc.\n\nbehaviors effect environment more invested skills of PPP influences how we structure work we do (rapport)\n\nenvironment-WHERE and WHEN physical surroundings classroom, building, books, time schedules, things, room temperature, lighting Move stuff around HS block scheduling-study ways for extended time models new schedule\n\nEnvironment more powerful than previously thought attention to social, affective, and cognitive aspects -&gt; perturb, organize, and shape cultural context engagement / success in individual / collective learning, meaning making, leadership, and community building\n\nEnvironment creates, expands, and sustains the organization's capacity for adaptivity\n\nClimate, culture designing the surround, creating small fires, where we do things; influential value moves stuff around\n\nUnpack the information using a 10:2. The Dilts information may be unpacked from smallest to largest or largest to smallest, depending on trainer preference.\n\nIdentity is the WHO of the work and holds the sense of self. Asks, 'Who am I/Who are we?' Asks, 'who do we need to be to live into our mission?'\n\nValues/Beliefs is the WHY of the work. This level provides the moral imperative for the other levels. It's about getting into our value system. It's about seeing powerful results when doing good things for kids. An example of the connection between values and beliefs might be: We believe in developing community so we value collaboration.\n\nCapabilities is HOW we use the skills that we have.\n\nIt's about employing strategies, mental maps, and metacognition around the 4 group member capabilities. It's how our metacognition and awareness guides our behavior in planning, monitoring, directing how I select my behaviors.\n\nBehaviors is the WHAT that individuals and groups do by asking what behaviors should they engage in? It's the application of skills and knowledge to actions. It's attending, paraphrasing, making meaning, etc. An example of how we develop behaviors: We provide professional development so people can use a program/process (PBL, hands on, etc.) with high skill.\n\nenvironment is the physical surroundings. It's the classroom, the building, the books, the time schedules, the room temperature, the lighting. It's the things we use to influence our outcomes. It's about moving stuff around. An example: HS block scheduling to find ways for extended time for student/adult engagement. environment is technical changes.\n\nEnvironment is more powerful than previously thought. Environment is attention to social, affective, and cognitive aspects that disturb, organize, and shape the cultural context. It is engagement and success in individual and collective learning, meaning making, leadership, and community building. Environment creates, expands, and sustains the organization's capacity for adaptivity.\n\nDilts' Levels of Influence are a lens for intervening, influencing, sustaining learning that creates change in complex systems.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nThe most powerful ways to change behaviors is to change identity (Costa and Garmston) \u2026who we believe we are in relation to others, tasks, and all situations directly influences our perception, attitude, sense-making decision making, and behavioral choices.\n\nPairs process. Respond to question on the slide.\n\nHuman beings, not human doings\n\nmost powerful way -&gt; change behaviors -&gt; change identity\n\nwho we believe we are in relation to others, tasks, situations -&gt; influences our perception, attitude, sense-making, behavioral choices\n\nIdentity - container that holds everything!\n\nput PD energies -&gt; changing behaviors now know -&gt; least likely way - build ownership / lasting behavioral change\n\nchange identity -&gt; influence behaviors, capabilities, beliefs, values Identity is the container that holds everything!\n\nFocusing Questions - designed to support groups in being clear about identity containers and what's inside.\n\nCC SM -&gt; identity container is mediator of thinking\n\nIdentity-sense of self  ASKS WHO AM I/WE? 'WHO do we need to be to live into our mission?'\n\n## Values/beliefs-WHY of the work\n\n'we believe in developing community'  so we value collaboration provide moral imperative for other levels\n\nCapabilities-HOW use skills that we have? strategies, mental maps, metacognition 4 group member capabilities guide/direct behavior\n\nBehaviors/Skills-WHAT individuals/groups do WHAT behaviors should we engage? Application of skills\n\n## Environment-physical surroundings WHERE and WHEN\n\nThe Focusing Questions you learned on Day 1 are designed to support groups in being clear about their identity containers and what's inside.\n\nIn addition to the Focusing Questions you learned yesterday, other supportive questions might be: What beliefs and values might we need to hold (or challenge) to become collaborators and inquirers? What capabilities are important for us to become collaborators, inquirers, and leaders?\n\nOptional: For those of you who know the Cognitive Coaching SM work, the identity container is a mediator of thinking.\n\nAnswer questions from large group.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nIndividually think about a group with which you work. How might you influence that group's ownership of its identity as collaborators, inquirers, and leaders?\n\nShare a couple of ideas from your journal with elbow partner.\n\n'book end' to goal concept\n\nUsing strategies with wrong identity -&gt; torture heck out of people\n\nDebrief: What insights might you be having?\n\n## Why Adaptivity is Important: PRINCIPLES OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS\n\nLG, p. 38\n\n## OPTIONAL\n\n## What?\n\nStation-Naming\n\n## Why?\n\nRemind participants where we are on the agenda.\n\nComes from tradition of conductors on trains announcing the next stops.\n\n## How?\n\nUse charted agenda, or slide\n\nWhat? Principles that govern complex systems\n\n## Form is\n\n1 -ways structure our organizations\n\n2 -ways do our work\n\nB's: bells, buses, beans, bathrooms, behinds in seats\n\n## To change form-&gt;need to clarify identity\n\nWHAT?\n\nThe principles of complex systems are the 'Why' of adaptivity.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nThis is where you have been and this is where you are going\u2026Yesterday you had an opportunity to explore what adaptivity is, to begin to construct meaning for why being adaptive is important, and with the focusing questions, to begin the journey of 'how.' And now you are going to go deeper into the 'WHY.'\n\n## WHAT?\n\nfrom WHAT of adaptivity -&gt; WHY principles of complex systems are 'Why' of adaptivity\n\n## WHY?\n\nbig ideas of how complex systems function\n\nWHY?\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nWhenever people come together, a complex adaptive system is formed. When you are with your family, it is a complex system. When you are with a three-year-old, it is a complex system. When you are in a meeting, it is a complex system. When you are in a classroom, we all know it is a complex system. GLYPH&lt;0&gt; Organizations and communities are complex systems. And you can't opt out.  You are always immersed in a complex system.\n\nSome things are complicated\u2026\n\nHave direct cause and effect relationships. The sum of the parts always adds up to the whole.\n\nRun 'like clockwork' or 'a well-oiled machine'\n\nRequire technical, managerial, logical/sequential skills.\n\n## WHAT?\n\nBridge, transition to adaptive systems.\n\n## WHY?\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nWhen people come together, it is a system. If you are in a community or a family or in a school, you are in a complex system. You can't opt out. Since we are all immersed in a complex system, why not learn about the principles that govern complex systems so we can influence, be adaptive, and support resourcefulness within the system?\n\n## HOW?\n\nIn a moment, you will engage in a strategy that exemplifies complex systems. It is a silent activity.\n\nYou will stop at a signal and (without talking) assess your success.\n\nSo why not learn the principles that govern these systems to influence and support adaptivity and resourcefulness? Adaptive Systems are complex.\n\n## TRAINERS NOTE:\n\nStrategy may be done twice to emphasize 'more data do not lead to better predictions,' depending on trainer's preference.\n\n## Silent process\n\nStop at signal and (without talking) assess your success\n\n## WHAT?\n\nThe Triangle strategy\n\n## WHY?\n\nUnderstand how the big ideas of how complex principles function\n\n## HOW?\n\nClearly give the participants the directions on the screen.  Unpacking them as needed.\n\n## Optional:\n\nDo the strategy a second time with participants being able to use NONVERBALS only. This offers participants 'more data' to complete their equilateral triangles. This may surface an understanding of principle number one.\n\n## Principles of Complex Systems, p. 38\n\n- 1. More data do not lead to better predictions.\n- 2. Everything influences everything else.\n- 3. Tiny events create major disturbances.\n- 4. You don't have to touch everyone to make a difference.\n- 5. Both things and energy matter.\n\nWhat connections are you making between this strategy and these complex principles?\n\n\u00a92025 Adaptive Schools Seminars\n\nGroups offer EXAMPLES of each that they experienced\n\nTables, chairs, just stop, cursing, slows down and takes off\n\n1-digitized Doplar weather systems and still wrong.

In principle one, more data will not lead to better prediction or better choices. What would make a difference, if you could have talked to each other - it is Data Driven Dialogue that makes a difference in complex systems.\n\nContinue to reveal the other four principles.\n\nAsk the question about connections and respond to insights.\n\nFaith in self-organizing in complex systems\n\n## Choose 1 principle\n\n-howwill you use that principle this week / year with adults / students\n\nReveal slide and ask participants to respond to the question at the bottom of the slide.\n\n## WHAT?\n\nStand and Share Strategy - A Response Management Strategy\n\n## WHY?\n\nParticipants take ownership of the group.\n\nIt removes the attention and focus away from the presenter/facilitator supporting selfdirectedness.\n\n## HOW?\n\nAfter the presenter poses a question to the group, participants are invited to stand and share their comments whenever they are ready.  If more than one person stands at one time, participants are instructed to negotiate the floor.\n\nconstruct meaning with group capabilities\n\nscaffolded structure -&gt; experience listening to others talking\n\nA Structured Dialogue Experience:\n\nFirst Turn/Last Turn\n\nLG, pp. 39-41\n\n## OPTIONAL\n\n## What?\n\nStation-Naming\n\n## Why?\n\nRemind participants where we are on the agenda.\n\nComes from tradition of conductors on trains announcing the next stops.\n\n## How?\n\nUse charted agenda, or slide.\n\nBig picture:  Groups of 4 for First Turn/Last Turn\n\nVisual paragraphing model:\n\n1.What's 1 st thing?\n\n2.If can't find partner, go where?\n\n3.Find artichoke partner, do what?\n\n4.After find another pair, do what?\n\n## GROUPING FOR FIRST TURN/LAST TURN\n\n## WHAT?\n\nGroups of 4 with partners selected earlier\n\n## WHY?\n\nAn opportunity to hear different perspectives on a topic\n\n## HOW?\n\nFractal Partners and Pair Square\n\nNow talking about the HOW of adaptivity\n\nCapabilities-HOW do we use skills that we have? (Dilts)\n\nCapabilities are strategies, mental maps, metacognition\n\n4 group member capabilities-develop consciousness around these awareness that guides / directs behavior\n\nHOW?\n\nFirst Turn/Last Turn\n\nGroups of four.\n\nShow Adaptive 'What? Why? How? slide.\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nThe Four Group Member Capabilities that you read about support groups in becoming adaptive and sustaining adaptivity. The process we will use also supports that. First Turn/Last Turn is a scaffold for dialogue. The notion of 'scaffold' was given to us by Jerome Bruner as a temporary structure to support learning. Many scaffolds are used in classrooms, for writing a paragraph, lab sheets in science, and protocols for working math problems .\n\nThe First Turn, Last Turn scaffold supports groups in breaking unproductive conversation patterns and developing dialogue listening and linguistic patterns. Skilled groups also use it when the topic is hard to talk about. For these reasons it is highly structured.\n\n.\n\nThrough First Turn/Last Turn members can experience that it is not necessary to sell an idea to influence, and that listening to understand and learn from others is the work of group members.\n\nWHAT?\n\nGroup Member Capabilities text that was read for homework\n\nWHY?\n\nGroup-Member Capabilities help people in a complex system become and remain adaptive. They support group members in being skillful and resourceful.\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nThe Four Group Member Capabilities that you read about support groups in becoming adaptive and sustaining adaptivity.\n\n## What\n\nFirst Turn/Last Turn around content: Group Member Capabilities\n\n## Why\n\nexperience a structured dialogue while learning about capabilities that group members need\n\nHow\n\nTight structures for skilled groups when topic is tough. Also for inexperienced groups, groups who don't know each other, groups who don't like each other\n\nTight structure and is scaffold for dialogue 'scaffold'-Jerome Bruner-temporary structure to support learning in classrooms-tight structure equates to writing, lab sheets, math protocols Listening (not composing / saying) is THE work of group members.\n\nNot to sell idea or influence not everyone will get turn to be first person, but all have chance to speak\n\n10-12 minutes.\n\nStrategy-start the starter. Geographical starter (can keep eye on progress).\n\nStarters, place idea on table.\n\nIn what ways is this different from conversations we are used to?\n\n- \u2022Scaffold is support in learning to dialogue\n- \u2022Dialogue-&gt;understanding-&gt;greatest skill for understanding is listening\n- \u00b7Highly structured-bite marks on tongue? Learning to dialogue, holds us in place\n- \u2022Prevents stepping on other's talk\n- \u2022Everyone has place in scaffold\n- \u20221st person is listening and then gets to comment\n\nSuggested Language:\n\n## WHY?\n\nFirst Turn/Last Turn is a scaffold for dialogue. The notion of 'scaffold' was given to us by Jerome Bruner as a temporary structure to support learning.\n\nThe First Turn, Last Turn scaffold supports groups in breaking unproductive conversation patterns and developing dialogue listening and linguistic patterns.\n\nSkilled groups also use it when the topic is hard to talk about. For these reasons it is highly structured.\n\nThrough First Turn/Last Turn, members recognize that it is not necessary to sell an idea to influence, and that listening to understand and learn from others is the work of group members.\n\nFirst Turn/Last Turn will allow you to experience a structured dialogue while learning about capabilities that group members need.\n\nHOW?\n\nGive directions on the slide noting the following:\n\n## Tips:\n\nAllow group to take a few minutes to skim the text in case someone didn't read for homework and gives them a few minutes to gather a few items.\n\nIn directions, include language like: Because of time, each of you may not initiate an item, but each will participate fully in the round robin process of making comments.\n\nFinish round, drop scaffold, turn to question on screen\n\n1-Always have intentions. Get all green lights from brain when set intention. Intentions open up that part of brain. actually scans for intentions. 'Okay, let's do that.'\n\nIf said to brain-I'm going to buy a red car because I want an unusual color. When driving, brain will scan for opportunities to see red cars. Called reticular activating system of brain.\n\nSet intention to be bored in meeting. 'I sure hate meetings.' Brain says, me too! will be bored.\n\nCapabilities is the How of Dilts\n\nTalk about the first principle, using this as a reference.\n\n## OPTIONAL\n\n## WHAT?\n\nThe Pyramid of Influence\n\n## WHY?\n\nIt supports understanding and application of the first group member capability.\n\n## HOW?\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nThe first capability is to Know One's Intention and Choose Congruent Behaviors.\n\nRecall that one of the keys to listening for understanding is intention: the intention to understand, rather than respond.\n\n## 1st click\n\nAll of what we do, in fact, is driven by intention. The challenge is that some is conscious, some is not.\n\n## 2nd click\n\nIntention focuses our attention: what we focus on.\n\n## 3rd click\n\n\u2026which in turn influences our actions. We call this metacognitive map, 'The Pyramid of Influence.'\n\n2-Autobiographical listening-&gt;kindergarten 'me too'.  Time waster.  Stops groups moving forward.\n\n- \u00b7 Inquisitive.  Soap opera-&gt;personal curiosity.  That kid?  Siblings?  Tired of that family. Stops group moving forward.  Ask: how might we support group in making decisions, create shared meaning, move forward?\n- \u00b7 Solution listening-&gt;are educators, always solving.  Before understanding, have solution.  Enter room with solution.  Deciding too soon, decisions don't stay made.\n\n3-quiet / speak up.  Silence will help group more?  Speaking up help more?  Impulse control, rehearse / think how impact.  Mature participation\n\n4-'It's the group's group.'-Applying these capabilities actualizes this principle.\n\nWhat are some implications about group member capabilities for you and work?\n\n## SMALL GROUP PROCESS\n\nGroup members offer reflective comments in response to the question on the slide.\n\n## TRAINER NOTE:\n\nPresenter may comment of additional capabilities.",
