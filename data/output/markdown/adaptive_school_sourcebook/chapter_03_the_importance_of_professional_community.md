## Chapter 3

## The Importance of Professional Community

T working cultures of schools. The word he  term professional  community is  striking  when  it  is  applied  to  the professional has its roots in profess , meaning to declare, to own, and to claim some body of knowledge; it therefore implies a level of expertise with a strong technical core that can be clearly  articulated  by  practitioners.  The  word community has  its  roots  in  the word common , and its relationship to the word communicate implies that this is a shared body of expertise. The practitioners in a professional community talk regularly about their collective practice and work together to extend and effectively apply this knowledge base.

Developing shared expertise and working with  common  purpose  are  vividly  present in  the  schools  that  are  beating  the  odds  and making a difference for student learning both internationally  and  in  North  America  (Bryk and  Schneider,  2002;  Dufour,  Eaker,  and Baker, 1998; Louis, Marks, and Kruse, 1996; McLaughlin  and  Talbert,  2006;  Hargreaves and Fullan, 2012).

Unfortunately,  the  notion  of  shared  practice within a school or a district is still not as universal  as  we  would  like.  Richard  Elmore (2000)  pointed  out  that  schools  and  schooling  are  governed  by  the  principle  of  'loose coupling'  (p.  6),  with  many  decisions  about what  and  how  to  teach  residing  in  individual classrooms and not in the surrounding organization. Loose coupling tied to a weak technical core is a recipe for disaster. The effects of both effective  and  ineffective  teachers  are  felt  for years. The issue, then, is how to enhance and spread  good  practice  throughout  the  school to  produce  cumulative  and  lasting  effects  for all  learners,  not  just  those  who  are  fortunate enough  to  learn  the  material  the  way  it  is presently  taught.  Fresh  studies  are  emerging that  document  student  gains  as  a  result  of high-functioning  teacher  learning  communities. As one example, research investigating the extent to which teachers' collaborative school improvement  practices  are  related  to  student achievement was conducted from a sample of 2,536 fourth-grade students in forty-seven elementary schools in a large urban school district in the mid-western United States. Schools with greater levels of teacher collaboration produced higher  achievement  in  mathematics  and  reading  than  those  with  lesser  amounts  (Goddard, Goddard,  and  Tschannen-Moran,  2007).  In John Hattie's meta-analysis of more than eight hundred studies, teacher collaboration is an important characteristic for three of nine teaching standards (Hattie, 2009).

One of the most stable factors in schools over  the  years  has  been  the  relative  isolation of teachers from one another throughout their workday  and  work  year.  Working  lives  in which  autonomous  teachers  are  organized  by a culture of individualism are still common. In some of these schools teachers live episodically

from  one  year  to  the  next  and  seek  routines that are efficient and energy conserving. Caution  about  intruding  in  others'  territory  and guardedness  or  resistance  about  changes  in curriculum and instruction are normal. Teachers in these schools work hard, but with little sense  of  their  potential  collective  power.  We have  worked  in  many  of  these  schools,  from the  west  to  the  east  coasts  in  North America and  in  a  some  international  settings.  Despite leadership efforts, and various forms of professional development, many classroom practices remain fundamentally unchanged even though teacher collaboration is undoubtedly linked to improving student learning outcomes.

The  Professional  Learning  Community (PLC)  movement  (Teacher  Learning  Community  in  the  United  Kingdom)  organizes practices  around  the  premise  of  improving learning by improving teaching practice. Richard Dufour, a champion of PLCs, cautions that the  term  has  been  used  so  loosely  that  it  is forfeiting meaning (Dufour, 2004). And while PLCs  are  not  what  we  are  describing  in  this book,  research  in  this  area  sheds  some  light on two questions related to teacher collaboaraton.  First,  does  collaboration  change  teaching practices, and second, do changes in practices improve  student  learning?  (Vescio,  Ross,  and Adams, 2008). Only recently have researchers gathered empirical data on these two questions, and the short answer to these queries is yes.

In  their  award-winning  book  Hargreaves and Fullan (2012) declare that one can't grow much  human  talent  by  focusing  on  individuals.  They  envision  a  pathway  to  schools  with high-quality  teachers  and  teaching.  They  remind readers of Leana's (2011) finding that  patterns  of  interaction  among  teachers and between teachers and administrators that are focused on student learning make a large and measurable difference in student achievement and sustained improvement. (p. 34)

These  patterns  of  interaction  are  the  basis  of social  capital  in  schools.  In  a  sense,  helping schools bring into being the structures and social  capital  necessary for profoundly effective teaching is the purpose of this book.

Hargreaves  and  Fullan  (2012)  are  envisioning  communities  of  practice.  'Communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern, a set of problems, or a passion about a topic, and who deepen their knowledge and expertise in this area by interacting on an ongoing basis' (p. 4). Communities of practice is a concept first proposed by cognitive anthropologists Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger in 1991. Members  in  these  communities  collectively learn in order to do better that which they are passionate  about.  Wenger  (1998)  described such groups as having shared norms and collaborative  relations;  a  shared  understanding of what binds them together and shared repertoire,  literally  creating  a  communal  resource. Hargreaves and Fullan (2012) note that first it is about developing trust and relationships and second,  collaborative  work  will  benefit  'from deliberate  arrangements  of  meetings,  teams, structures and protocols' (p. 127). But if these are built in the absence of commitment, all this will be ineffective. 'First,' by the way, is not a statement of sequence, rather it is statement of primary focus while doing shared work around teaching and learning.

## The Elements of Professional Community

In our work, we are becoming increasingly optimistic that schools as professional communities  hold  rich  promise  for  meaningful  staff engagement  leading  to  increases  in  student learning.  Our  intent  is  to  share  what  we  are learning  in  this  area.  We  offer  ways  to  build professional  communities  in  schools  so  that teachers and administrators can talk about difficult things, ask hard questions about teaching and learning practices, and adults can actively learn from one another.

The  fundamental  definition  of  adaptivity, the  principles  of  complex  systems  and

focusing  questions  introduced  in  chapter  1, directly apply to the work of developing robust professional  communities  in  schools.  These factors interact to produce adaptivity and work together  to  energize  the  emergence  of  a  professional  community.  The  combined  effects of  these  relationships  (figure  3.1)  produce  increased student learning.

Figure 3.1 . Adaptive Schools and Professional Community

Six  factors  work  in  concert  to  produce a  sense  of  shared  responsibility  for  student success that successfully delivers results. They are  a  prime  example  of  the  complex  systems principle that everything influences everything else. Each principle on its own is important, but not sufficient for the task of energizing instructional  improvements.  The  emerging  research base supports the importance of these essential elements  of  professional  community.  The  six factors are as follows:

- 1. Compelling purpose, shared standards, and academic focus;
- 2. Collective efficacy and shared responsibility for student learning;
- 3. Social  capital  emerging  from  teacher  talk about learning and improving said learning;
- 4. Collaborative cultures communally applying effective teaching practices;
- 5. Relational trust in one another, in students, and in parents;
- 6. Individual  and  group  learning  based  on ongoing assessment and feedback.

These shared efforts produce school-wide gains in student achievement. When teachers take  collective  responsibility  for  students, they  conceive  their  work  to  be  a  joint  enterprise (Little, 1990). They have a greater sense of personal and collective efficacy and assume that learning is a result of school rather than nonschool factors (Lee and Smith, 1996). In high  schools  where  this  sense  of  collective responsibility was strong, students have been found  to  have  larger  gains  in  mathematics, reading,  history,  and  science  than  in  schools where the collective sense was weaker. These outcomes  were  especially  true  for  minority students  and  students  from  low  socioeconomic backgrounds.

## Compelling Purpose, Shared Standards, and Academic Focus

Communities  come  into  existence  and thrive because  of  a  common  purpose  for working  together. A  group's  compelling  purpose  establishes  reciprocal  expectations  for its  members.  International  evidence  suggests that educational  reform's  progress  depends on  teachers'  individual  and  collective  capacity  and its link with school-wide capacity for promoting pupils' learning (Stall et al., 2006). Compelling  purposes,  however,  do  not  mean a race to the top. Andy Hargreaves notes that while Singapore schools are consistently rated among the best in the world, they have not set goals to be the best. Rather, they have set goals to be effective, and like other successful organizations, aim for 2 percent annual gains. They teach less so students can learn more. Teacher innovation flourishes in their collaborative cultures. Teachers give away their best ideas and then invent new ones

Teachers'  professional  communities  operate  with  a  sense  of  moral  authority  and moral responsibility for making a difference in  the  lives  of  students.  Such  purpose  is grounded in clearly articulated standards for both student and teacher performance. Defining  and  refining  the  meaning  of  doing  good work  is  the  task  of  a  professional  learning community.

## Collective Efficacy and Shared Responsibility for Student Learning

Collective  efficacy  refers  to  the  shared sense  that  teacher  knowledge  and  effort  will overcome  obstacles  to  student  learning.  Such efficacy  is  achieved  through  four  routes:  (1) direct experience in which a group overcomes difficulties  through  persistent  effort;  (2)  vicarious  experience,  the  observation  of  others' successful  experiences;  (3)  social  persuasion in  which  members  are  persuaded  they  have what it takes to make a difference and the students they are working with have the capacity to  learn;  and  (4)  personal  emotional  states,  in which the sense of feeling good about what one is  accomplishing  is  a  further  reinforcement. This raises confidence, which in turn reinforces the practice of working hard. Stress can weaken

this affect, and weaken the sense of collective efficacy (Holanda, et al. 2014).

The personal efficacy of individual teachers  is  a  well-studied  phenomenon.  Teachers with stronger personal efficacy beliefs consistently outperform teachers in the same settings with weaker beliefs. They also work harder and experience less stress. Participating in decision making contributes strongly to teachers' beliefs in  the  capabilities  of  their  peers,  fosters  commitment to school goals, and promotes gains in student achievement. A group of high-efficacy teachers, however, is not the same as a group with collective efficacy.

Collective efficacy, however, is not a panacea.  Parker  (1994)-and  other,  earlier  researchers-found  that  collective  efficacy  can partially counteract the negative effects of low socioeconomic conditions.

## Social Capital Emerging from Teacher Talk about Learning and Improving Said Learning

One  invests  capital  to  reap  returns.  In schools,  social  capital  develops  from  the  frequency with which teachers and others engage in conversations about student work and teaching practices related to that work (Hargreaves and Fullan, 2012). Social capital improves the teaching  performance  of  all  teachers.  Schools with  rich  social  capital  invest  in  teacher  development; not only in pedagogy, but collegial practices which themselves further inform collective  teaching  practices.  Trust,  reciprocity, information,  and  cooperation  are  associated with these social networks.

Talent is the human capital teachers bring to their work. Regardless of starting levels, human capital grows in relationship to social capital, in magnitudes not possible through attention to individual teacher development. Social capital raises the aspirational and performance bar for everyone. Two parallel dimensions are related to social capital: decisional capital and cognitive capital. Decisional capital rises from the  professional  decision  making  of  teachers when they are  treated  as  professionals,  rather than being treated as workers who need to be told what and how to teach. Costa, Garmston, and Zimmerman (2014) assert that training in reflection, not teacher assessment, is a driving force  for  self-directed  learning.  Not  only  is teaching complex requiring agile thinking, but also sustainable decisions made by groups require similar competencies.

## Collaborative Cultures Communally Applying Effective Teaching Practices

<!-- image -->

The  norm  of  privacy  has  deep  roots  in 'real'  schools.  Once  the  classroom  door  is closed,  the  teacher  is God.  In  this  sphere of  autonomy  lies  both  greatness  and  sorrow. Within  the  zone  of  isolation,  some  teachers still find  ways  to  develop  craft  knowledge, content  knowledge,  and  compassion  for  their students. These extraordinary individuals manage to stimulate their teaching and continually renew their passion for daily interactions with young minds. All too often, however, this same isolation buffers mediocrity and hides high performers from those who might learn from their modeling, consultation, and coaching.

When  practice  is  deprivatized,  teachers visit one another's classrooms to observe master teaching, to coach each other, to mentor, and to solve problems in the living laboratory of instructional space. Students are the beneficiaries of shared teaching repertoires. Although many schools  and  districts  have  spent  much  time and  energy  developing  coherent  curriculum maps,  shared  instructional  maps  are  equally

important. When a student proceeds to the next grade  or  next  subject  in  a  secondary  school, having  possession  of  a  predictable  learning repertoire (such as an understanding of a palette  of  graphic  organizers),  energizes  learning and increases success-especially for the least successful learners.

By  developing  communities  of  practice, teachers  establish  a  working  zone  between the macro  world  of  district  initiatives  and resources  and  the  micro  world  of  their  classrooms (McLaughlin and Talbert, 2006). In this way they develop more coherent instructional approaches  that  represent  shared  understandings of their unique setting.

## Relational Trust in One Another, in Students, and in Parents

In their work on the effects of academic optimism on student achievement Hoy, Tarter, and Woolfolk-Hoy  (2006)  point  out  that  collective efficacy  is  the  cognitive  side  of  the  equation; academic emphasis is the  behavioral  side;  and faculty trust in one another, in students, and in parents is the affective side. Given the powerful biochemical connections between thinking and feeling in our bodies and our brains, it is difficult to separate these functions in practice.

Trust  is  the  glue  that  binds  community members to one another. This is equally true for teacher communities, classroom communities, and parent communities. When all three parties hold  high  expectations  for  their  relationships, and these expectations are grounded in shared goals and values, trust is  a  powerful  resource for learning.

Bryk and Schneider (2002), in their seminal work in Chicago schools, name four criteria for the discernment of relational trust: respect, competence,  personal  regard  for  others,  and integrity. Respect comes in  the  form  of  basic civility  and  a  willingness  to  listen  deeply  to what each person has to say. Parents, students, and teachers need opportunities to talk with and influence  each  other  and  to  believe  that  they can  positively  affect  educational  outcomes.

Competence is  the  sense  that  each  party  has the  ability  to  carry  out  its  appropriate  roles and produce desired outcomes. This applies to both academic results and teacher-student relationships. When gross incompetence goes unchecked, it erodes trust and undermines shared efforts  toward  improving  learning. Personal regard for others deepens  relational  trust. We are a social species, wired for relationships and reciprocity. Mutual support and mutual caring fuel  these  associations.  Extending  ourselves to  and  for  others  is  like  making  a  deposit  in the  trust  account;  the  interest  in  this  account compounds with each deposit. Integrity is  the congruence between saying and doing. In trusting relationships, this means we believe that a sense of morality and ethics is operating in others and in the ways we are relating. Following through with agreements and commitments is a key aspect of integrity.

## Individual and Group Learning Based on Ongoing Assessment and Feedback

'Learning  is  a  basic,  adaptive  function  of humans. More than any other species, people are designed to be flexible learners and active agents in  acquiring knowledge and skills' (Bransford, Brown, and Cocking, 1999, p. xi). Cognitive science tells us that learning is socially constructed and  individually  integrated;  learning  therefore requires engaging with other learners and is an active  process  for  all  involved.  Individual  and collective learning is one of the key characteristics of effective professional learning communities (Bolam et al., 2005).

For adult groups, learning how to learn together requires conscious attention, purposeful structures, and meaningful feedback. One form of  feedback  arises  when  teachers  look  at  student work together to explore what is working and  what  might  require  modification  in  their curricular and instructional approaches. Groups apply another form of feedback when they take time to reflect on their own processes and outcomes to consider which practices to continue, which to abandon, and which to modify.

From  time  to  time  a  group  or  team  will share with us that it has some great number of years of combined teaching experience. Their assumption  is  that  learning  is  additive,  when in  fact  the  group  members  have  merely  been involved  in  side-by-side  processes.  Engaging in parallel play without feedback and reflection is usually a poor teacher.

## Developing Teachers' Professional Communities

our  experiences  with  schools  the  past  several years, we offer the following four frameworks as organizers for this journey:

- · Twin goals: developing organizational capacities  and  developing  professional  capacities;
- · Four 'hats': facilitating, presenting, coaching, and consulting;
- · Five  energy  sources:  efficacy,  flexibility, craftsmanship,  consciousness,  and  interdependence;

Despite the existence of these descriptors of schools that make a difference for students, the  question  of  how  we  get  there  remains. Schools  require  frameworks,  role  clarity,  and self-renewing  tool  kits  for  collaborative  practice.  Based  on  our  understanding  of  the  literature  on  school  change,  organizational  development, and teaching and learning, as well as

- · Seven  norms  of  collaboration:  pausing, paraphrasing, posing questions, providing data,  placing  ideas  on  the  table,  paying attention to self and others, and presuming positive intentions.

Figure 3.3 shows the interaction of the first three frameworks.

Figure 3.2. Adaptive Schools

<!-- image -->

To address problems in languishing schools, districts and schools must continually apply energy and resources to both production and production capacities. Leaders of adaptive schools  simultaneously  develop  two  goals  related  to  the  organization's  ongoing  need  for self-improvement.  The  first  goal  expands  six organizational  capacities  for  adaptivity.  The second goal strengthens six professional capacities for adaptivity. These twelve capacities for organizational  and  professional  adaptivity  are the source of and focus for reflective dialogue in  professional  communities.  Exploration  of these twelve areas helps communities to focus their work and strengthen their ties to one another. We offer them here as lenses for examining schools and teaching practice in the hope that they will become focal points for important dialogues  and  discussions  in  schools,  departments, teams, and governing councils. We will provide brief descriptions here and elaborate on them in chapter 13.

## The Languishing High School

At  the  languishing  high  school,  many students  proactively  disengage  from  learning. They slump in their seats on the days that they even bother to come to class. Students ignore homework assignments, and remediation needs outweigh the coverage of new material. External  rewards  such  as  grades,  honor  rolls,  and college  admissions requirements hold little or no  motivational  power.  Teachers  are  attempting  to  deal  with  this  situation  by  embracing tradition,  enforcing  standards,  and  struggling to  maintain  the  integrity  of  teaching  methods and materials. The net result of all these interactions  includes  departments with abnormally high  failure  rates,  decreased  enrollments  in advanced  courses,  falling  attendance,  and  increased dropout rates. Staff morale and teacher efficacy plummet.

This is a classic situation in which the five principles of complex systems (see chapter 1) are at work:

- 1. More data do not lead to better predictions. Additional  surveys  and  reports  about  attendance,  dropout  rates,  test  scores,  and staff attitudes will not improve this school.
- 2. Everything influences everything else. Tough standards only raise the bar higher for students who lack basic jumping skills. Poor  student  performance  lowers  expectations and  teachers'  professional  pride and  sense  of  purpose.  Parental  concerns and  complaints  cause  defensiveness  and withdrawal.
- 3. Tiny  events  create  major  disturbances. Student expulsions, a dropped section of an  honors  course,  and  half-full  classes create ripple effects throughout life in the school.
- 4. You  don't  have  to  touch  everyone  in  the system to make a difference. A belief that everyone in the school must be ready for change  before  any  action  can  be  taken blocks movement and innovation.
- 5. Both things and energy matter. Rules, routines,  and  procedures  will  count  for  little unless  you  also  attend  to  the  qualities  of human relationships in the school.

## Organizational Capacities for Adaptivity

The six organizational capacities for adaptivity are (1) vision, values, and goal focus; (2) systems  thinking;  (3)  initiating  and  managing adaptation; (4) interpreting and using data; (5) developing and maintaining collaborative cultures; and (6) gathering and focusing resources.

## Vision, Values, and Goal Focus

Clarity of vison, values, and goals is a hallmark of successful schools. The most important goals are the academic goals for the students. These  in  turn  are  an  expression  of  the  value system that governs the organization. Healthy

schools  and  organizations  hold  a  vision  for themselves of how they wish to operate in the world. This is a vision of values and goals in action. Such a vision is informed by real-world measures  of  student  achievement  and  other goal accomplishments.

At  the  languishing  high  school,  vision, values, and goals require rethinking and refocusing. English literature might not be the most appropriate course to teach students who have fundamental literacy needs.

## Systems Thinking

Systems  thinking  and  vision,  values,  and goal focus are the major organizers of adaptivity. Helping others to see systems places the work of schools in a larger context. This framework reveals influential interactions and helps to answer the  question  'What  part  of  the  system  can  we influence to create positive change?'

Adaptve schools engage in systems thinking. Whether explicitly labeled as such or not, this is what professional communities do.

## Initiating and Managing Adaptation

Adaptation is the work of leaders at all levels  of  the  school  and  professional  community. Inquiry  is  an  essential  tool  of  adaptation.  The three focusing questions offered in chapter 1 are resources: 'Who are we?' 'Why are we doing this?' and 'Why are we doing this, this way?'

## Interpreting and Using Data

Data  have  no  meaning  on  their  own. Meaning is a result of human interaction with data.  Many  schools  are  data-rich  and  meaning-poor. Adaptive groups develop the capacity to discern what data are worth paying attention to and what collaborative practices help people to engage with data in ways that increase ownership  and  willingness  to  act  on  conclusions. (See chapter 11.)

The  languishing  high  school  usually  has enough data about the system, but little knowl- edge.  Knowledge,  meaning,  and  commitment result from dialogue and discussion about what story is told by the data. Without organized story making, people in organizations make up their own explanations for events. Part of the reason for this is protection from unwanted truths.

## Developing and Maintaining Collaborative Cultures

Collaboration  is  the  essence  of  teachers' professional  community  in  schools.  Collaboration,  social  captital,  and  group  development work hand in hand. In chapter 10 we will discuss ways to help groups become more interdependent and cohesive.

Collaboration operates within and between groups. When students work with units of measure as they quantify lab materials, interdependence connects the math teachers to the science teachers.  Success  in  the  lab  builds  on  math skills learned in other settings. Laboratory applications further reinforce the practical nature of algorithms learned in math class.

A sense of collaboration is lacking at the low-performing high school. The teachers and the departments feel besieged, hunkering down and fighting their own fights for some sense of accomplishment and dignity. The students and the  teachers  do  not  see  themselves  aligned  in a shared task. Each sees the other as an adversary,  with  small  victories  and  losses  accumulating on a daily basis. Each carries an identity as a teacher of a discipline or grade level, not as part of a team dedicated to student success.

## Gathering and Focusing Resources

Time, money, and human energy are some of the resources that support goal accomplishment  in  schools.  Overload  and  fragmentation are  the  enemies  of  success.  Resources  must be focused where they will make the greatest difference. Ultimately this leads to some hard decisions  in  schools.  Resource  allocation  and goal accomplishment are directly linked. What receives attention gets done.

This last organizational capacity for adaptivity cannot work without clarity in the others. Values and goals point out resource needs. Systems thinking frames where to target resources. To initiate and manage adaptation means to apply and manage resources. All this is missing at the languishing high school. Energy, time, and money are thrown at problems to fix the most visible ones.  Doing  anything  is  considered good enough. The goal is to protect individuals and the organization from the accusation of not working  hard  enough.  Without  a  clear  focus and without honest feedback systems, however, this only saps resources and increases the magnitude of the problems.

## Professional Capacities for Adaptivity

The  six  professional  capacities  for  adaptivity are (1) collegial interaction; (2) cognitive processes of instruction; (3) knowledge of the structure of the discipline; (4) self-knowledge, values, standards, and beliefs; (5) a repertoire of teaching skills; and (6) knowing about students and how they learn.

## Collegial Interaction

In many respects, collaboration needs to be  taught.  Past  practices  and  workplace  culture  influence  the  capacity  for  collaboration. So  does  gender  and  school  organization  (elementary, middle, or high). Attitudes, knowledge, skills, and practices can be taught; these are the focus of chapters 4, 5, 6, and 10. The capacity  to  be  a  colleague  is  different  from other  capacities  of  good  teaching.  It  draws upon  craft  knowledge,  self-knowledge,  and interpersonal skills to form a web of reciprocal relationships and services.

Norms of privatism are strong at the languishing high school. Each teacher operates as an independent artisan. There is no craft guild with  which  to  share  professional  knowledge and  concerns.  Small  breakthroughs  with  stu- dents are personal victories to be savored and fleetingly enjoyed in quiet moments.

## Cognitive Processes of Instruction

Instructional thinking occurs in four phases: planning, teaching, analyzing and evaluating, and applying what has been learned to future work.

The  more  cognitively  adept  a  teacher  is, the better the results are in classrooms and with colleagues. This capacity includes the abilities to  manage  multiple  goals  simultaneously,  to align one's work with that of one's colleagues, and to learn from experience in the classroom (Costa and Garmston 2015).

Teachers  in  the  languishing  high  school feel as if they have no time to reflect. The pace of  survival  puts  action  ahead  of  reflection  on most  personal  and  collective  agendas.  Peer coaching programs sputter out in the press for time. Formal supervision is pro forma and ritualized. Administrators are mostly satisfied with teachers who 'keep the lid on' in a classroom and keep kids out of the office.

## Knowledge of the Structure of the Discipline

Knowledge  of  the  structure  of  the  discipline moves  beyond  content  knowledge, which is necessary but not sufficient for good teaching.  The  former  involves  knowing  the organizing  schema  of  the  field,  including  the significant ideas in the discipline and how they relate  to  one  another. Anticipating major misconceptions and barriers to learning and understanding the significant ideas are also important here. These inform curricular choices and the selection and use of resource materials.

Little attention has been given to matters of curriculum  at  the  low-performing  high school  beyond  periodic  textbook  adoptions. Teachers' knowledge of their fields is not always up to date. In fact, more than a quarter of the staff might be teaching outside their areas

of certification or in areas in which they did not major in college.

## Self-Knowledge, Values, Standards, and Beliefs

The knowledge of what one stands for is the  most  important  assest  a  professional  educator has to maintain a steady course through the  ups  and  downs  of  life  in  schools.  Having clarity about personal standards for good work and good behavior and effectively

A  lack  of  deep  professional  interaction does not serve teachers in the languishing high school. Many are unsure of themselves and insecure in the changing world in which they find themselves.  Old  touchstones,  such  as  grades, course syllabi, and school traditions no longer provide comfort and a sense of purpose in the world.  Some  cling  tightly  to  known  elements even in the face of evidence of their negative effects. The comforts of the past hold memories of the way things are supposed to be.

## A Repertoire of Teaching Skills

In  chess,  the  queen  is  the  most  powerful piece  on  the  board  because  she  has  the  most flexibility of movement: She can move forward or  backward, left or right, and diagonally, for any  number  of  spaces.  Like  a  chess  queen, teachers with an expanded repertoire of teaching skills have the most flexibility of movement and thus the most options.

No one knows it all in the classroom. Craft knowledge is a lifetime in the making. There is always something new to invent and learn as research, technology, and professional practice continually  expand  both  the  knowledge  base of  teaching  and  the  answers  to  the  questions about  what  works  and  why.  Teachers  at  the low-performing high school cling to old ways of  doing  business  in  the  classroom.  Lectures, videos,  reading  from  textbooks,  note  taking, and quizzes prevail. Students play out their part of  the  ritual,  minimally  complying  with  this production.  Alternative  teaching  techniques such as simulations and project-based learning are usually rejected as 'not my style.'

## Knowing about Students and How They Learn

Just as educators can never know enough about  the  structure  of  their  disciplines,  themselves,  and  their  teaching  repertoire,  they  can never  know  all  there  is  to  know  about  their students  and  how  they  learn. This  capacity  is divided into two parts. The first, knowing about students, means knowing them as people-who they are and where they come from. This is the stuff of genuine relationships that nurture and motivate  learning.  The  second  part,  knowing how students learn, is informed by knowledge of learning  styles,  developmental  stages  of intellectual  growth,  cultural  differences,  and gender differences.

Students in the low-performing high school  are  often  viewed  as  problems  to  overcome. They are the objects of instruction, not the  constructors  of  meaning.  All  too  often, relationships  between  teachers  and  students are strained in the battle for power and control. Each side needs the other but does not always know how to cross the gap that divides them.

## The Four 'Hats' of Shared Leadership

In  adaptive  schools,  all  players  learn  to 'wear  four  hats,'  or  play  four  roles.  By all players we mean administrators, teachers, support staff, students, and, when appropriate, parents. In such schools all the players must have the knowledge and skills to manage themselves and influence and lead others.

Leadership is a function, not a role and is a shared function in meetings, staff development activities, action  research,  and  classrooms. Recognizing  the  'hats'  and  knowing  when and how to change them is shared knowledge within  the  organization.  When  values,  roles, and  work  relationships  are  clear,  decisions about appropriate behavior are easy. We offer

definitions to illustrate the major  functions of  four  leadership  roles  and  the  distinctions among the roles. See Costa and Garmston, and Zimmerman (2014) for extended discussion on how each of these functions can contribute to the development of cognitive capital.

## Facilitating

To  facilitate  means  'to  make  easier.'  A facilitator  conducts  a  meeting  in  which  the purpose  is  dialogue,  shared  decision  making, planning,  or  problem  solving.  The  facilitator directs the processes  used  in  the  meeting, choreographs  the  energy  within  the  group, and maintains a focus on one content and one process at a time. Ideally the facilitator is not the  person  with  role  or  knowledge  authority (described in chapter 8). The role of facilitator is central to the ideas in this book. Many of the templates,  tools,  and  strategies  provided  here apply  to  it.  We  have  therefore  elaborated  on this role in chapter 8.

## Presenting

To  present  is  to  teach.  A  presenter's goals  are  to  extend  and  enrich  knowledge, skills,  or  attitudes  and  to  enable  these  to  be applied  in  people's  work.  A  presenter  may adopt many stances-expert, colleague, novice,  or  friend-and  use  many  strategies  of presentation-lectures,  cooperative  learning, study groups, or simulations. Touchstones of effective  presentations  include  clarity  of  instructional outcomes, of standards for success, and ways to assess learning (Garmston, 2005; Garmston and Wellman, 1992).

## Coaching

To  coach  is  to  help  a  group  take  action toward its goals while simultaneously helping it  to  develop  expertise  in  planning,  reflecting, problem  solving,  and  decision-making.  The coach  takes  a  nonjudgmental  stance  and  uses open-ended  questions,  pausing,  paraphrasing, and probing for specificity. The skillful coach focuses on group members' perceptions, thinking,  and  decision-making  processes  to  mediate  resources  for  self-directedness  (Costa  and Garmston, 2015).

## Consulting

To  consult  is  to  have  your  expertise  be used  by  others. A  consultant  can  be  an  information  specialist  or  an  advocate  for  content or  process.  As  an  information  specialist,  the consultant delivers technical knowledge to the group.  As  a  content  advocate,  the  consultant encourages  group  members  to  use  a  certain instructional  strategy,  adopt  a  particular  curriculum, or purchase a specific brand of computer.  As  a  process  advocate,  the  consultant influences  the  group's  methodology,  such  as by recommending an open rather than a closed meeting  to  increase  trust  in  the  system.  To effectively consult, one must have trust, commonly  defined  goals,  and  the  group's  desired outcomes clearly in mind (Block, 1981).

## Marshaling the Energy for Changing Schools

Carl  Glickman  (1998)  writes  that  without  the  will  to  change  for  the  better,  all  re-

sources  and  management  schemes  will  have little effect. 'This issue of will-wanting to be better-is critical  to  understanding  how  longterm policies, allocation of resources, and work conditions can or cannot work' (p. 3).

Two  major  problems  related  to  change confront  all  groups.  One  is  adapting  to  and surviving  in  the  external  environment.  The other is developing internally to support daily functioning and increase the capacity to adapt (Shein,  1992).  Groups  either  develop  toward greater inclusion and effectiveness or dissolve through fragmentation and disarray. Changing the  structure  of  the  group  or  teaching  group members  skills  does  not  guarantee  growth toward  increased  group  performance.  Helping  members to pay attention to basic energy sources within the group encourages the development of these resources and permits learned skills  to  be  applied  and  structures  to  be  reinvented for greater impact.

Group development is  accelerated  by  the following five intervention approaches, which we will elaborate on in chapter 10.

- 1. Structure  the  environment  to  release  and enhance energy sources.
- 2. Teach  about  the  five  energy  sources  of high-performing groups.
- 3. Mediate selected intervention points.
- 4. Model the five energy sources.
- 5. Monitor evidence and artifacts of selected energy sources.

The  five  energy  sources,  drawn  from  the work of Costa and Garmston (2015) and members of the Institute for Intelligent Behavior, are discussed below.

## Efficacy

The group believes in its capacity to produce  results  and  stays  the  course  through internal  and  external  difficulties  to  achieve goals.  The  group  aligns  energies  within  itself in pursuit of its outcomes.

## Flexibility

The group regards situations from multiple perspectives, works creatively with uncertainty and  ambiguity,  and  values  and  utilizes  differences within itself and the larger community of which it is part. The group attends to rational and intuitive ways of working.

## Craftsmanship

The  group  strives  for  clarity  in  its  values,  goals,  and  standards.  It  applies  these  as criteria  for  its  planning,  actions,  reflections, and refinements. It attends to both short- and long-term  time  perspectives.  It  continually refines  communication  processes  within  and beyond the group.

## Consciousness

The group monitors its decisions, actions, and reflections based on its values, norms, and common goals. Members are aware of the impact  of  their  actions  on  each  other,  the  entire group, and outside individuals and groups.

## Interdependence

The group values its internal and external relationships. It seeks reciprocal influence and learning.  Members  treat  conflict  as  an  opportunity  to  learn  about  themselves,  their  own group,  and  other  groups.  The  group  trusts  its interactions and the processes of dialogue and discussion.

## Simple Rules Govern Complex Behavior

In  this  book  we  are  attempting  to  frame the complex work of developing and facilitating collaborative groups. Although the frameworks, lenses, and tools we offer might seem a bit overwhelming at first, underneath them are some simple principles that guide our work.

This  simplicity  is  illustrated  in  a  story related  by  M.  Mitchell  Waldrop  in  his  book Complexity: The Emerging Science at the Edge of  Order  and  Chaos (1992).  Complexity  is the study of intricate dynamical systems. It is an  integrative  science  in  which  economists, biologists, ecologists, meteorologists, and specialists  from  other  fields  connect  to  explore the  underlying  principles  that  govern  natural and human systems. Much of the work is done using high-powered computers to simulate natural and designed systems.

Craig Reynolds of the Symbolics Corporation in Los Angeles is one such researcher. He designed a computer program that captures the essence  of  the  flocking  behavior  of  birds,  the herding  behavior  of  sheep,  and  the  schooling behavior  of  fish.  The  elegance  of  his  design was in not trying to build rules into the group. Instead,  the  rules  resided  within  the  individuals.  He  created  a  collection  of  autonomous, birdlike  agents  he  called boids .  Each  'boid' was programmed with three simple rules:

- 1. Maintain a minimum distance from other objects in the environment, including other 'boids.'
- 2. Match the velocity of other 'boids' in your vicinity.
- 3. Move toward the perceived center  of  the mass of other 'boids' in your vicinity.

There  was  no  superintendent  of  'boids.' None of  these  rules  said  to  form  a  flock,  yet flocks  formed  every  time  the  program  ran. 'Boids'  would  at  first  be  scattered  around the  computer  screen  but  would  soon  flock up.  Flocks  were  able  to  fly  around  obstacles or  break  into  subflocks  to  fly  around  objects, coming  together  again  on  the  other  side.  On one occasion a 'boid' banged into a pole, lost its  bearings  momentarily,  then  darted  forward to rejoin the flock.

If  simple  rules  govern  complex  behavior in  groups,  what  might  be  some  simple  rules for group members to follow? We propose the following:

- 1. Take care of me . It is each group member's groundedness,  resourcefulness,  and  energy that develops the synergy that makes high-performing groups possible.
- 2. Take care of us . It is our interdependence, interactions, and caring for each other and the group that motivates us to want to continue to work together.
- 3. Take  care  of  our  values .  It  is  our  values that  drive  our  goal  clarity  about  who  we are, how we want to be together, and what we will accomplish for students.

In chapters 4 and 5 we explore these simple rules in action as we discuss group-member capabilities, the seven norms of collaboration, and two ways of talking in groups.

Who  teachers  are  to  one  another  is  as important  as  who  they  are  to  their  students. In high-performing  and  improving  schools, studies  show  that  collaboration  is  the  norm. We  are  not  talking  here  about  project-based collaboration  or  the  'contrived  collegiality' described  by  Hargreaves  and  Dawe  (1990)  in which administrators create tasks and agendas to occupy teachers' collective energies. Rather, we are referring to sharing expertise and perspectives  on  teaching  and  learning  processes, examining data on students, and developing a sense  of  mutual  support  and  shared  responsibility for effective instruction.
