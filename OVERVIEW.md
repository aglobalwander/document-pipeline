# Document Processing Pipeline - Simplified Overview

This document provides a simple explanation of the document processing pipeline for a non-technical audience.

## What is the Document Processing Pipeline?

Imagine you have a lot of different files – like reports, articles, audio recordings, pictures, and videos – and you need to get information out of them or organize them in a smart way. That's where the Document Processing Pipeline comes in!

It's like a smart system that can read and understand many different types of files and turn them into useful formats or store them so you can easily find and use the information later.

## How Does it Work (Simply)?

The pipeline works in steps:

1.  **It Reads Your Files:** It can take in various file types, like PDFs, Word documents, text files, audio files (like MP3s or WAVs), images (like JPGs or PNGs), and videos (like MP4s).
2.  **It Processes the Content:** Depending on the file type, it can do things like:
    *   Convert spoken words in audio or video into text (transcription).
    *   Read text from images or scanned documents (OCR).
    *   Clean up the text to make it easier to understand.
3.  **It Transforms the Information:** It can then turn the processed information into different useful formats:
    *   Plain text.
    *   Formatted reports (using Markdown).
    *   Structured data (like JSON), which is great for organizing information.
4.  **It Can Store Information Smartly:** It can also send the processed information to a special database (called a vector database, like Weaviate) that makes it really easy to search and find related information quickly.

Here's a simple picture of the process:

## What Can You Use It For?

This pipeline can be used for many things, such as:

*   Converting meeting recordings into searchable text.
*   Extracting information from scanned documents or images.
*   Turning reports into well-formatted documents.
*   Organizing a large collection of documents and media for easy searching.
