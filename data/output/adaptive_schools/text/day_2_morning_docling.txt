Inclusion Activity with shoulder partner:

Plan this 30-second speech:  Somebody just walked in.  Why are you all here?  What is this AS work about?  What speech might you give them?

Day 1-reminder: theory--professional communities, adaptivity (changing form while clarifying identity), 2 ways of talking

Day 2- adults taking time to grow themselves

Assessing own personal skills around 7 norms -&gt;deep on 2 -&gt; safely talk about hard stuff.

NOT develop expertise through sitting together--&gt; developed through consciously and deliberately focusing on group's skills, interactions, needs for growth, etc. Group only as strong as each  member-&gt;develop members get more done with shorter amount of time with more pleasure

## WHY?

groups can become better at their work. Individuals and groups need to develop resources for generating, organizing, and analyzing ideas for adapting to change. Necessary knowledge includes norms of collaboration, information about group development, living effectively with conflict, and guiding principles for creating professional community.

- · Individuals and groups need to develop resources for generating, organizing, and analyzing ideas for becoming adaptive to change.
- · An important presupposition in this domain is that both individual and group orientations are necessary to produce and implement innovations.
- · Necessary knowledge includes information about group development, and living effectively with conflict,
- · the importance of professional community, and
- · guiding principles for creating that community.

## Turn to an elbow partner and respond to this question:

Imagine that there is the word 'WHEN' at the end of this quotation, how might you complete the stem?

Closing comment: Group development requires intentionality.

Learnable skill

What: expand toolkit

Why: Engage materials directly, meaning making, more engagement in pairs than in groups.

goal of AS

## WHY?

## reconnecting to content

more than treasure chest of strategies / moves

-&gt;examine its identity. significance of identity for individuals, groups, organizations

## HOW?

Not focus on traditional, linear challenges, but focus on complex, non-linear, human challenges

Invites to clarify identities as collaborators, inquirers, and leaders while changing form to congruently align with that identity.

About developing strong systems -&gt; collaborative faculties are capable of meeting certain challenges of today / uncertain challenges of tomorrow.

Share Fullan quotation in two parts on slide. 'All the good work we're doing in schools is just tinkering…'

Pause and share second part, '…unless we clarify our identities as collaborators and inquirers.'

Collaborating and inquiring are critical aspects of creating and sustain Adaptive Schools.

Elbow Partners respond to each bolded title in the goal.

Give directions on slide.

What: opportunity-new skills taught in isolation used in an integrated, authentic context.

Why: Organize / integrate day's learning

How: 15-20 minutes of dialogue time-pausing every 5 minutes to ask them to internally reflect on the Norms they have been using

## Intellectual humility-suspension

Do I think more like a soldier or a scout?

Do I want to understand or just be right?

Do I seek opposing views?

Do I enjoy the pleasant surprise of discovering I am mistaken?

DIALOGUE PRACTICE OPTIONAL WHAT? Dialogue Practice (Time permitting)

## WHY?

An opportunity to use the new skills that have been taught in isolation in an integrated, authentic context

Organize and integrate the day's learning

HOW?

Provide 15 minutes of dialogue time practicing Pausing and Paraphrasing.

## Suggested Language:

You're going to have an opportunity to integrate the learning you've been doing this afternoon in a dialogue.

## Dilts' Domains of Influence in Learning, pp. 15-16

## Gregory Bateson-Robert Dilts

Identity-sense of self 'WHO do we need to be to live into our mission?' Human beings, not human doings

ASKS WHO AM I / WHO ARE WE?

## Values/beliefs-WHY of the work

Your personal/collective value system 'we believe in developing community' so we value collaboration provide moral imperative for other levels

Capabilities-HOW do we use skills that we have? metacognition - How make choices about strategies, mental maps, 4 group member capabilities- consciousness around capabilities metacognitive awareness and guides behavior did skill not know what to do with it

HOWmetacognitive--planning, monitoring, direction for how I select my behaviors, knowledge, steering wheels, support.

What guides direction of how we do something (paraphrasing-living into capability of it)

Ability how to do it. Capability have power/will to do it

Under what conditions do I do this? Strategies selecting context, timing, etc. Why choose this strategy?

Guides behavioral choice, steering wheel-kill people with these strategies metacognitive ability how to design lessons in expanded time; street skills of PPP / norms mental model in new context (dialogue)

Behaviors-WHAT individuals / groups do WHAT behaviors should we engage? Application of skills /knowledge to actions and reactions Attending, paraphrasing, making meaning, etc.

PD for PBL, hands on, etc.

behaviors effect environment more invested skills of PPP influences how we structure work we do (rapport)

environment-WHERE and WHEN physical surroundings classroom, building, books, time schedules, things, room temperature, lighting Move stuff around HS block scheduling-study ways for extended time models new schedule

Environment more powerful than previously thought attention to social, affective, and cognitive aspects -&gt; perturb, organize, and shape cultural context engagement / success in individual / collective learning, meaning making, leadership, and community building

Environment creates, expands, and sustains the organization's capacity for adaptivity

Climate, culture designing the surround, creating small fires, where we do things; influential value moves stuff around

Unpack the information using a 10:2. The Dilts information may be unpacked from smallest to largest or largest to smallest, depending on trainer preference.

Identity is the WHO of the work and holds the sense of self. Asks, 'Who am I/Who are we?' Asks, 'who do we need to be to live into our mission?'

Values/Beliefs is the WHY of the work. This level provides the moral imperative for the other levels. It's about getting into our value system. It's about seeing powerful results when doing good things for kids. An example of the connection between values and beliefs might be: We believe in developing community so we value collaboration.

Capabilities is HOW we use the skills that we have.

It's about employing strategies, mental maps, and metacognition around the 4 group member capabilities. It's how our metacognition and awareness guides our behavior in planning, monitoring, directing how I select my behaviors.

Behaviors is the WHAT that individuals and groups do by asking what behaviors should they engage in? It's the application of skills and knowledge to actions. It's attending, paraphrasing, making meaning, etc. An example of how we develop behaviors: We provide professional development so people can use a program/process (PBL, hands on, etc.) with high skill.

environment is the physical surroundings. It's the classroom, the building, the books, the time schedules, the room temperature, the lighting. It's the things we use to influence our outcomes. It's about moving stuff around. An example: HS block scheduling to find ways for extended time for student/adult engagement. environment is technical changes.

Environment is more powerful than previously thought. Environment is attention to social, affective, and cognitive aspects that disturb, organize, and shape the cultural context. It is engagement and success in individual and collective learning, meaning making, leadership, and community building. Environment creates, expands, and sustains the organization's capacity for adaptivity.

Dilts' Levels of Influence are a lens for intervening, influencing, sustaining learning that creates change in complex systems.

## Suggested Language:

The most powerful ways to change behaviors is to change identity (Costa and Garmston) …who we believe we are in relation to others, tasks, and all situations directly influences our perception, attitude, sense-making decision making, and behavioral choices.

Pairs process. Respond to question on the slide.

Human beings, not human doings

most powerful way -&gt; change behaviors -&gt; change identity

who we believe we are in relation to others, tasks, situations -&gt; influences our perception, attitude, sense-making, behavioral choices

Identity - container that holds everything!

put PD energies -&gt; changing behaviors now know -&gt; least likely way - build ownership / lasting behavioral change

change identity -&gt; influence behaviors, capabilities, beliefs, values Identity is the container that holds everything!

Focusing Questions - designed to support groups in being clear about identity containers and what's inside.

CC SM -&gt; identity container is mediator of thinking

Identity-sense of self  ASKS WHO AM I/WE? 'WHO do we need to be to live into our mission?'

## Values/beliefs-WHY of the work

'we believe in developing community'  so we value collaboration provide moral imperative for other levels

Capabilities-HOW use skills that we have? strategies, mental maps, metacognition 4 group member capabilities guide/direct behavior

Behaviors/Skills-WHAT individuals/groups do WHAT behaviors should we engage? Application of skills

## Environment-physical surroundings WHERE and WHEN

The Focusing Questions you learned on Day 1 are designed to support groups in being clear about their identity containers and what's inside.

In addition to the Focusing Questions you learned yesterday, other supportive questions might be: What beliefs and values might we need to hold (or challenge) to become collaborators and inquirers? What capabilities are important for us to become collaborators, inquirers, and leaders?

Optional: For those of you who know the Cognitive Coaching SM work, the identity container is a mediator of thinking.

Answer questions from large group.

## Suggested Language:

Individually think about a group with which you work. How might you influence that group's ownership of its identity as collaborators, inquirers, and leaders?

Share a couple of ideas from your journal with elbow partner.

'book end' to goal concept

Using strategies with wrong identity -&gt; torture heck out of people

Debrief: What insights might you be having?

## Why Adaptivity is Important: PRINCIPLES OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS

LG, p. 38

## OPTIONAL

## What?

Station-Naming

## Why?

Remind participants where we are on the agenda.

Comes from tradition of conductors on trains announcing the next stops.

## How?

Use charted agenda, or slide

What? Principles that govern complex systems

## Form is

1 -ways structure our organizations

2 -ways do our work

B's: bells, buses, beans, bathrooms, behinds in seats

## To change form-&gt;need to clarify identity

WHAT?

The principles of complex systems are the 'Why' of adaptivity.

## Suggested Language:

This is where you have been and this is where you are going…Yesterday you had an opportunity to explore what adaptivity is, to begin to construct meaning for why being adaptive is important, and with the focusing questions, to begin the journey of 'how.' And now you are going to go deeper into the 'WHY.'

## WHAT?

from WHAT of adaptivity -&gt; WHY principles of complex systems are 'Why' of adaptivity

## WHY?

big ideas of how complex systems function

WHY?

## Suggested Language:

Whenever people come together, a complex adaptive system is formed. When you are with your family, it is a complex system. When you are with a three-year-old, it is a complex system. When you are in a meeting, it is a complex system. When you are in a classroom, we all know it is a complex system. GLYPH&lt;0&gt; Organizations and communities are complex systems. And you can't opt out.  You are always immersed in a complex system.

Some things are complicated…

Have direct cause and effect relationships. The sum of the parts always adds up to the whole.

Run 'like clockwork' or 'a well-oiled machine'

Require technical, managerial, logical/sequential skills.

## WHAT?

Bridge, transition to adaptive systems.

## WHY?

## Suggested Language:

When people come together, it is a system. If you are in a community or a family or in a school, you are in a complex system. You can't opt out. Since we are all immersed in a complex system, why not learn about the principles that govern complex systems so we can influence, be adaptive, and support resourcefulness within the system?

## HOW?

In a moment, you will engage in a strategy that exemplifies complex systems. It is a silent activity.

You will stop at a signal and (without talking) assess your success.

So why not learn the principles that govern these systems to influence and support adaptivity and resourcefulness? Adaptive Systems are complex.

## TRAINERS NOTE:

Strategy may be done twice to emphasize 'more data do not lead to better predictions,' depending on trainer's preference.

## Silent process

Stop at signal and (without talking) assess your success

## WHAT?

The Triangle strategy

## WHY?

Understand how the big ideas of how complex principles function

## HOW?

Clearly give the participants the directions on the screen.  Unpacking them as needed.

## Optional:

Do the strategy a second time with participants being able to use NONVERBALS only. This offers participants 'more data' to complete their equilateral triangles. This may surface an understanding of principle number one.

## Principles of Complex Systems, p. 38

- 1. More data do not lead to better predictions.
- 2. Everything influences everything else.
- 3. Tiny events create major disturbances.
- 4. You don't have to touch everyone to make a difference.
- 5. Both things and energy matter.

What connections are you making between this strategy and these complex principles?

Groups offer EXAMPLES of each that they experienced

Tables, chairs, just stop, cursing, slows down and takes off

1-digitized Doplar weather systems and still wrong. Meteorologists - more data -&gt; any time in history -&gt; models break down outside 4-day window Changing moment to moment.

Want it to behave, but won't.

## schools

keep gathering data -&gt; Know Johnny couldn't read

Data rich -&gt; interpretation / action poor.

Interpret -&gt; data-driven dialogue and act on in discussion

I did this before and I thought I could predict with more data and it still didn't work.

2 - touch one thing -&gt; touch everything Touch in good way -&gt; echoes fractally in good way through system

Affective climates in school buildings / classrooms influence how adults / students feel about work

In collaborative groups, one person paraphrasing models respectful listening ands influences behavior and thinking;

- 3 - temperature changes affect wind -&gt; affects precipitation -&gt; influences weather patterns

tiny trim tabs - small rudders built onto rudders of large ships that changes direction of ship Who are the trim tabs in your organization?

feel too small to impact big things -&gt; not true

Pick 1 strategy -&gt; work on it -&gt; big disturbance 1 norm / week - paraphrasing everybody

- 4 -Start with people who are ready

-Middle school teachers courtesy

- 5-Things = tasks must get done (books, bells, beans, bathrooms, behinds)

Energy = how you get it done

#1 energy piece is relationship caring / commitment moves minds and produces learning

Can have all technology / resources but what if morale is low?

Choose 1 principle

-how will you use that principle this week / year with adults / students wind / rain = things - their energy moves windmills, sprouts plants

Suggested Language:

As you come back to the tables, consider some of the things that you are noticing and share with your table group.

Give processing time.

Reveal the first principle:

If I had given you more information in the directions or historical background on this strategy, how might that have helped? In principle one, more data will not lead to better prediction or better choices. What would make a difference, if you could have talked to each other - it is Data Driven Dialogue that makes a difference in complex systems.

Continue to reveal the other four principles.

Ask the question about connections and respond to insights.

Faith in self-organizing in complex systems

## Choose 1 principle

-howwill you use that principle this week / year with adults / students

Reveal slide and ask participants to respond to the question at the bottom of the slide.

## WHAT?

Stand and Share Strategy - A Response Management Strategy

## WHY?

Participants take ownership of the group.

It removes the attention and focus away from the presenter/facilitator supporting selfdirectedness.

## HOW?

After the presenter poses a question to the group, participants are invited to stand and share their comments whenever they are ready.  If more than one person stands at one time, participants are instructed to negotiate the floor.

construct meaning with group capabilities

scaffolded structure -&gt; experience listening to others talking

A Structured Dialogue Experience:

First Turn/Last Turn

LG, pp. 39-41

## OPTIONAL

## What?

Station-Naming

## Why?

Remind participants where we are on the agenda.

Comes from tradition of conductors on trains announcing the next stops.

## How?

Use charted agenda, or slide.

Big picture:  Groups of 4 for First Turn/Last Turn

Visual paragraphing model:

1.What's 1 st thing?

2.If can't find partner, go where?

3.Find artichoke partner, do what?

4.After find another pair, do what?

## GROUPING FOR FIRST TURN/LAST TURN

## WHAT?

Groups of 4 with partners selected earlier

## WHY?

An opportunity to hear different perspectives on a topic

## HOW?

Fractal Partners and Pair Square

Now talking about the HOW of adaptivity

Capabilities-HOW do we use skills that we have? (Dilts)

Capabilities are strategies, mental maps, metacognition

4 group member capabilities-develop consciousness around these awareness that guides / directs behavior

HOW?

First Turn/Last Turn

Groups of four.

Show Adaptive 'What? Why? How? slide.

Suggested Language:

The Four Group Member Capabilities that you read about support groups in becoming adaptive and sustaining adaptivity. The process we will use also supports that. First Turn/Last Turn is a scaffold for dialogue. The notion of 'scaffold' was given to us by Jerome Bruner as a temporary structure to support learning. Many scaffolds are used in classrooms, for writing a paragraph, lab sheets in science, and protocols for working math problems .

The First Turn, Last Turn scaffold supports groups in breaking unproductive conversation patterns and developing dialogue listening and linguistic patterns. Skilled groups also use it when the topic is hard to talk about. For these reasons it is highly structured.

.

Through First Turn/Last Turn members can experience that it is not necessary to sell an idea to influence, and that listening to understand and learn from others is the work of group members.

WHAT?

Group Member Capabilities text that was read for homework

WHY?

Group-Member Capabilities help people in a complex system become and remain adaptive. They support group members in being skillful and resourceful.

Suggested Language:

The Four Group Member Capabilities that you read about support groups in becoming adaptive and sustaining adaptivity.

## What

First Turn/Last Turn around content: Group Member Capabilities

## Why

experience a structured dialogue while learning about capabilities that group members need

How

Tight structures for skilled groups when topic is tough. Also for inexperienced groups, groups who don't know each other, groups who don't like each other

Tight structure and is scaffold for dialogue 'scaffold'-Jerome Bruner-temporary structure to support learning in classrooms-tight structure equates to writing, lab sheets, math protocols Listening (not composing / saying) is THE work of group members.

Not to sell idea or influence not everyone will get turn to be first person, but all have chance to speak

10-12 minutes.

Strategy-start the starter. Geographical starter (can keep eye on progress).

Starters, place idea on table.

In what ways is this different from conversations we are used to?

- •Scaffold is support in learning to dialogue
- •Dialogue-&gt;understanding-&gt;greatest skill for understanding is listening
- ·Highly structured-bite marks on tongue? Learning to dialogue, holds us in place
- •Prevents stepping on other's talk
- •Everyone has place in scaffold
- •1st person is listening and then gets to comment

Suggested Language:

## WHY?

First Turn/Last Turn is a scaffold for dialogue. The notion of 'scaffold' was given to us by Jerome Bruner as a temporary structure to support learning.

The First Turn, Last Turn scaffold supports groups in breaking unproductive conversation patterns and developing dialogue listening and linguistic patterns.

Skilled groups also use it when the topic is hard to talk about. For these reasons it is highly structured.

Through First Turn/Last Turn, members recognize that it is not necessary to sell an idea to influence, and that listening to understand and learn from others is the work of group members.

First Turn/Last Turn will allow you to experience a structured dialogue while learning about capabilities that group members need.

HOW?

Give directions on the slide noting the following:

## Tips:

Allow group to take a few minutes to skim the text in case someone didn't read for homework and gives them a few minutes to gather a few items.

In directions, include language like: Because of time, each of you may not initiate an item, but each will participate fully in the round robin process of making comments.

Finish round, drop scaffold, turn to question on screen

1-Always have intentions. Get all green lights from brain when set intention. Intentions open up that part of brain. actually scans for intentions. 'Okay, let's do that.'

If said to brain-I'm going to buy a red car because I want an unusual color. When driving, brain will scan for opportunities to see red cars. Called reticular activating system of brain.

Set intention to be bored in meeting. 'I sure hate meetings.' Brain says, me too! will be bored.

Capabilities is the How of Dilts

Talk about the first principle, using this as a reference.

## OPTIONAL

## WHAT?

The Pyramid of Influence

## WHY?

It supports understanding and application of the first group member capability.

## HOW?

## Suggested Language:

The first capability is to Know One's Intention and Choose Congruent Behaviors.

Recall that one of the keys to listening for understanding is intention: the intention to understand, rather than respond.

## 1st click

All of what we do, in fact, is driven by intention. The challenge is that some is conscious, some is not.

## 2nd click

Intention focuses our attention: what we focus on.

## 3rd click

…which in turn influences our actions. We call this metacognitive map, 'The Pyramid of Influence.'

2-Autobiographical listening-&gt;kindergarten 'me too'.  Time waster.  Stops groups moving forward.

- · Inquisitive.  Soap opera-&gt;personal curiosity.  That kid?  Siblings?  Tired of that family. Stops group moving forward.  Ask: how might we support group in making decisions, create shared meaning, move forward?
- · Solution listening-&gt;are educators, always solving.  Before understanding, have solution.  Enter room with solution.  Deciding too soon, decisions don't stay made.

3-quiet / speak up.  Silence will help group more?  Speaking up help more?  Impulse control, rehearse / think how impact.  Mature participation

4-'It's the group's group.'-Applying these capabilities actualizes this principle.

What are some implications about group member capabilities for you and work?

## SMALL GROUP PROCESS

Group members offer reflective comments in response to the question on the slide.

## TRAINER NOTE:

Presenter may comment of additional capabilities.
