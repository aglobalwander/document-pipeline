## Meaning and Manifestations of Consciousness

The mark of people who are in control of consciousness is their ability to focus attention at will, to pay attention to their intentions, to deflect distractions, to concentrate for as long as it takes to achieve a goal. Expanding consciousness informs improvement and helps to expose blind spots and bring up new ideas. Developing effective thinking therefore requires the development of consciousness, a priceless resource (Csikszentmihalyi 1990).

Those who exercise consciousness monitor their own values, intentions, thoughts, and behaviors and their effects on others and the environment. 'Moral behaviors are a skill set, acquired over repeated practice sessions and over a long time, informed by consciously articulated principles and reasons but otherwise 'second natured' into the cognitive unconscious' (Damasio 2010, 271). This is an apt description on the evolution of a mediator. They have well-defined value systems that they can articulate. They generate, hold, and apply internal criteria for decisions they make, and they can articulate the rationale behind their actions and thoughts. They practice mental rehearsal and the editing of mental pictures in the process of seeking improved strategies.

Consciousness means knowing what and how we are thinking about our work in the moment and being aware of our actions and their effects on others and on the environment. Consciousness is the central clearinghouse for executive decision making. This state of mind is a prerequisite for selfcontrol and self-direction. Through consciousness we are metacognitively aware that certain events are occurring, and we are able to try and direct their course.

Consciousness is the medium in which all states of mind are mediated. To make personal change, one must be conscious of one's own inner workings (Vaida 2014). To mediate consciousness in others, we must be attentive to both verbal and nonverbal communications in order to help others locate the words that represent their experiences.

Recently Bob was on safari in the Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania. Late one morning, he stepped from his Range Rover to observe some plant life more closely. Suddenly, a glowering hippopotamus-weighing 5,000 to 6,000 pounds and with lower canine teeth 18 inches long-emerged from a waterhole. Grunting and snorting, glistening and frightening, the hippo

charged. Terrified, Bob dashed for the Range Rover and safety.

What happened in those few seconds? Bob's brain detected threat and, with lightning speed, conjured up a few response options, selected one, and acted. Neural and chemical aspects of the brain's response caused profound bodily changes-surges in metabolic rate and energy. The overall biochemical profile of his body fluctuated rapidly, evoking changes in both brain and body, skeletal muscles contracting. His frightened eyes absorbed the scene connecting the retina and the brain's visual cortices to reactions in his viscera. In time, this memory will become a neural record of many of the changes that occurred, some in the brain itself and some in the body.

Although teaching is rarely this exciting, the same neurochemical processes ignite when a threat or any intense experience is perceived. Cognitive Coaches must realize that 'cognitive' always has an 'emotional' component. Emotions and the viscera often perform an important role in perception and decision making. This is true in situations of clear and immediate danger, like a charging hippopotamus. It is also true in less obvious dangers, like perceived ego risk in a conversation.

The following are some characteristics of consciousness:

- The capacity for consciousness lies in our neurobiology.
- The development of consciousness is influenced by mediational relationships, personal intention, and practice.
- Consciousness is involved when deliberate, rather than automatic, control or intervention is needed.
- We are consciously aware of only a small part of what our minds are taking in at any given time.
- Conscious processes occur one at a time, take effort, and are inefficient.
- Consciousness is not devalued by the presence of nonconscious processes; that is, both are important sources guiding human experience.
- Conscious processes are necessary transit zones in which to unlearn old patterns and learn new ones at an unconscious level.
- Consciousness provides us with a unique, consistent interpretation while unconscious processes produce contradictory interpretations of experience.
- We can be aware of something without really being aware of it. As an example, you are probably not aware of the position of your left ear until we've called attention to it, yet it is never out of your

unconscious awareness.

- Consciousness can be strengthened through self-observation.
