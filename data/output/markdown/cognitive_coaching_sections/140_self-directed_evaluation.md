## Self-Directed Evaluation

There is little research that indicates traditional evaluation supports growth; there is, however, a substantial body of research indicating Cognitive Coaching supports growth (see chapter 14). Integrating the principle of self-directed learning and the tools and maps of Cognitive Coaching into the evaluation process brings a growth-producing dimension often missing from traditional evaluation processes.

So, while many school districts are adopting and implementing new professional performance review protocols for use in the evaluation process (see chapter 13 and appendix D), the challenge is to successfully implement the evaluation plans in a way that supports growth and learning. The maps and tools of Cognitive Coaching offer the skill set needed for administrators, supervisors, and sometimes peers to conduct self-directed evaluation.

Self-directed evaluators use structures and skills that engage the

professional's thinking about his/her performance. In self-directed evaluation, the evaluator intentionally builds the capacity of the professional for self-managing, self-monitoring, and self-modifying behaviors. According to Costa and Kallick (2004, 51-57), self-directed people can:

- Clarify outcomes and gather relevant data
- Think flexibly
- Develop alternative strategies
- Draw on past knowledge
- Think about their thinking
- Persevere in generating alternative action plans
- Know how and where to turn when perplexed
- Reflect on experience and evaluate
- Analyze and construct meaning
- Be open to continuous learning
- Readily admit they have more to learn
- Change themselves

We see these behaviors as the outcomes of self-directed evaluation. When teachers display these behaviors, students achieve at higher levels (Hattie 2003).

The professional performance review protocols offer the what; selfdirected evaluation offers the how.

Cognitive Coaching is particularly appropriate for a growth-producing evaluation process for five reasons. Cognitive Coaching is:

- 1.  Procedural and conditional knowledge, in addition to declarative knowledge
- 2.  Focused on the thinking that produces behavior
- 3.  Research based and congruent with current neuroscience
- 4.  A growth mind-set
- 5.  Trust based

The evaluator's primary role, then, is to engage thinking that results in self-modification that will sustain longer-lasting change. Far more important than simply advising people about what to do are developing rapport, listening, and posing questions that support thinking. Cognitive Coaching provides evaluators with the conversation structures and skills to engage teachers' thinking so they can be self-managing, self-monitoring,

and self-modifying.
