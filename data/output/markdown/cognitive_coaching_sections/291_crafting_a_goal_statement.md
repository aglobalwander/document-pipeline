## Crafting a Goal Statement

Leading without pacing is ineffective. Most people can describe what they don't like. It is only when we are resourceful that we can describe what we want instead. Pacing 'listens below the story.' During the goal stage, pacing tests the coach's understanding of a desired state. The goal statement helps the person see the problem differently. Of the four elements in the pace, formulating an appropriate goal statement is the most complex. A well-formed goal statement does the following:

- It is stated with artful vagueness. ('You want to be in control, be confident, have satisfaction.') If the goal is stated with too much specificity, it narrows the solution possibilities and increases the likelihood that it does not represent the person's goal. Vague language here allows the coach to engage the energy of the person being coached to move forward. It does not matter yet if the pictures formed by 'confident' mean different things to the coach and the partner.
- It uses verb forms of be, have, or feel, but never do. The latter is used in reference to an action or a plan, not a goal. A useful goal statement is always about a destination (what the person will be or have when satisfied), not a journey (what he or she might do to get there).
- It is stated in positive form (what the person wants, rather than doesn't want).
- It is brief and stated with simple language.
- It acknowledges feelings. (This is sometimes communicated through

posture, facial expression, or tone of voice.)

- It assumes nobility of intention on the part of the person being paced.
- It may identify two or more goals that are seemingly incompatible: 'You want to be accountable for test results but at the same time be true to your responsibilities to students.'
- It is about the person being coached, not a third party.

To craft a goal statement, the coach listens for an unexpressed yearning to resolve the tension. What might the person feel, be, or have if the challenging situation were resolved? Search for the tension arising from the drive for self-assertion. Another way to listen is to search for contrasting emotions. If the person is sad, perhaps he or she wants to be happy. If she is feeling disconnected, then she may want to be connected. If he is feeling powerless, he may want to have control.
