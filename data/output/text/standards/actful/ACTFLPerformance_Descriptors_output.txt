The ACTFL Performance Descriptors for Language
Learners were built on the solid foundation provid ed by the original task force that produced the 1998
ACTFL Performance Guidelines for K–12 Learners. The
members of that task force forged new ground to help
educators implement the standards, providing import ant descriptions of how language learners demonstrate
performance of the three modes of communication in
instructional settings. Informed by the ACTFL Profi ciency Guidelines, the 1998 task force carefully identi fied appropriate learning targets that impacted instruc tion and assessment in language classrooms across the U.S. and beyond. The new ACTFL Performance
Descriptors for Language Leaners benefited from the experience of language educators implementing the original guidelines.
ACTFL acknowledges the authors of the 1998 ACTFL

Acknowledgements
Language learning is complex. Many factors impact how well language learners will acquire
communication skills and how quickly they will reach different ranges of performance. These
factors include where one learns language, whether in an instructional setting or immersed in the
language or culture; how one learns, whether through explicit instruction about the language or
through authentic experiences using the language; when one learns, as the age and cognitive
development of language learners impact the speed of reaching each range of performance;
and finally, why one is learning a language, whether motivated by extrinsic factors such as
grades and requirements or intrinsic factors such as the language learner’s heritage or intended uses of the language.

The ACTFL Performance Descriptors for Language
Learners are designed to describe language perfor mance that is the result of explicit instruction in an instructional setting. A companion to the ACTFL
Proficiency Guidelines, a document that describes
broad, general language proficiency regardless of when, where or how language is acquired, the ACTFL Per formance Descriptors for Language Learners provide more detailed and more granular information about language learners.
The Standards for Foreign Language Learning (1996,
1999, 2006), describe what students need to know and
be able to do as they learn another language, defining
the “what” of language education. The ACTFL Perfor mance Guidelines for K–12 Learners (1998) first
described “how well” language learners were expected to do the “what” from the content standards.
The ACTFL Performance Descriptors for Language
Learners are an update and revision to the 1998
Performance Guidelines.
The current Standards for Foreign Language Learning
are written for K–16 and include language-specific
progress indicators for elementary, secondary, and
postsecondary learners. Likewise, these Performance
Descriptors apply to language learners across the same
span of ages and grade levels, identifying a continu um of language learning, which will prove useful in addressing articulation across all institutions.
Language learners in instructional settings from pre kindergarten through graduate studies are in a contin uous process of cognitive development that influences
their ability to perform language tasks. Learning targets
need to consider the age appropriateness and cognitive
development of the language learners and may require
varying amounts of time to achieve. The description
of three ranges of performance (Novice, Intermedi ate, and Advanced) allows users of these Performance
Descriptors to identify appropriate learning targets for
language learners who begin at any age or grade level
(prekindergarten, elementary school, middle school,
high school, or postsecondary institutions) and whose language learning continues for varying amounts of time.
Since the original publication date of the 1998 K–12
Guidelines, learning environments have changed. These new Performance Descriptors reflect how language
learners perform whether learning in classrooms, on line, through independent project-based learning, or in blended environments.

The Performance Descriptors form a roadmap for
teaching and learning, helping teachers create perfor mance tasks targeted to the appropriate performance
range, while challenging learners to also use strategies
from the next higher range. In an instructional envi ronment, the content and tasks are controlled, result ing in higher expectations of learners’ performance
compared to how they perform in a non-instructional
environment. For example, Novice language learners use highly practiced and memorized sentences and
questions within the supportive learning environment
and within known contexts even though they are not yet Intermediate level language users.
These Performance Descriptors also help educators
set realistic expectations at the summative assessment
level. The ability to look ahead to the next range of per formance allows instructors to create assessments that
show what the language learner is able to do within the
learner’s current range as well as how well the learner is able to perform in the next higher range.

ACTFL Performance Descriptors for Language Learners 4
In describing language ability, the terms performance
and proficiency both refer to evidence of what a lan guage user is able to do with language. Similar strate gies can be used when teaching for both performance
and proficiency. Likewise, assessments of both perfor mance and proficiency reflect purposeful communica tion tasks, mirroring real-world uses of language. There
are also significant differences between performance and proficiency. What does each indicate?
Performance
Performance is the ability to use language that has
been learned and practiced in an instructional setting.
Coached by an instructor, whether in a classroom or
online, or guided by instructional materials, perfor mance refers to language ability that has been practiced
and is within familiar contexts and content areas.  The
practice and assessment of performance should reflect
authentic, real world use of language, even though
the language is learned and practiced in some type of
learning environment.  Best practices for assessment of
performance suggest that assessment be conducted in the same communicative manner in which the lan guage was learned, practiced or rehearsed.  To prepare
for an assessment of performance, language learners
need to practice the language functions, structures,
and vocabulary they will apply on the assessment tasks,
rather than practicing and memorizing exactly what
will be on the assessment.  Educators should provide
language learners with practice of a variety of tasks
related to the curriculum.  In this way, learners will be
ready to apply these elements in the context of the new
tasks they will face on the performance assessment.  To
help language learners transfer their language skills,
instruction needs to focus on real world-like tasks with
the anticipation that learners will be prepared to do the
same outside the instructional setting (as in a demon stration of proficiency).
In assessing performance, a language learner is eval uated against the description of the features of the
domains of a given range within those contexts and
content areas that have been learned and practiced.
Demonstration of performance within a specific range
may provide some indication of how the language user
might perform on a proficiency assessment and indeed
might point toward a proficiency level, but perfor mance is not the same as proficiency.  The language a
learner produces on a collective set of performances
generally correlates to a proficiency level, that is, the
ratings that a language learner receives on a variety of
performance assessments provides evidence of how the
learner will be rated on an assessment of proficiency.
Proficiency
Proficiency is the ability to use language in real world
situations in a spontaneous interaction and non-re hearsed context and in a manner acceptable and
appropriate to native speakers of the language. Pro ficiency demonstrates what a language user is able to
do regardless of where, when or how the language was acquired. The demonstration is independent of how
the language was learned; the context may or may not
be familiar; the evaluation of proficiency is not limited
to the content of a particular curriculum that has been taught and learned.
An assessment of proficiency determines if the lan guage user provides sufficient evidence of all of the
assessment criteria of a particular level according to the
ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines. The individual must do
everything expected at a level in a sustained fashion,
that is, all of the time, in order to be rated at that level.

Assessing Performance vs. Assessing Proficiency: How are these assessments different?
Assessing Performance
Assessing Proficiency • Based on Instruction: Describes what the language learner can demonstrate based on what was learned
• Practiced: Tasks are derived from the language functions and vocabulary that learners have practiced or rehearsed but which are applied to other tasks within familiar contexts • Familiar Content and Context: Content based on what was learned, practiced, or rehearsed; all within a context similar but not identical to how learned • Demonstrated performance: To be evaluated within a range, must be able to demonstrate the features of the domains of a given range in those contexts and content areas that have been learned and practiced.
• Independent of specific instruction
or curriculum: Describes what the language user can do regardless of where, when or how the language was acquired
• Spontaneous: Tasks are non-rehearsed situations • Broad Content and Context:
Context and content are those that are appropriate for the given level • Sustained performance across all the tasks and contexts for the level:
To be at a level, must demonstrate consistent patterns of all the criteria for a given level, all of the time

Novice Range
Intermediate Range
Advanced Range
The ACTFL Performance Descriptors for Language
Learners describe how language learners use language
across three ranges of performance (Novice, Interme diate, and Advanced), in three modes of communica tion (interpersonal, interpretive, and presentational), and according to certain language features.
According to Ranges of Performance
Each range is defined by a set of features for the range
explaining what the language learner is able to do, in what contexts and content areas, how much and
what kind of language the learner is able to produce
or understand, the expectations of accuracy, and what
strategies the language learner uses to communicate.
The three ranges take into consideration that the learn ing environment is controlled and articulated, allow ing learners to demonstrate greater control of certain
features of a level when these have been practiced in familiar contexts.
A language learner who demonstrates the overall
features for a given range, whether most of the time or
all of the time, would be considered to be in that range
of performance. In a proficiency context, a language
user who meets the criteria for the Intermediate level,
but is not able to do so for some content areas or tasks
all of the time in spontaneous, unrehearsed, language
use would be rated Novice High. In the Performance
Descriptors, the same profile would place the learner
as entering into the Intermediate range because most
of the time, and for those tasks and content areas that
have been learned and practiced, the performance is in
the Intermediate range as defined by the performance
domains (see page 8). Likewise, the language learner
who meets the criteria for the Advanced range most of
the time (and who would be rated Intermediate-High on a proficiency scale) would be considered to be entering into the Advanced range of performance.
The Superior range of performance is not addressed
in these Performance Descriptors because within and beyond the Advanced range, performance and profi ciency tend to merge. Once students sustain language
ability beyond the Advanced range, where contexts and
content areas are defined in general and broad terms,
the ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines should be used to describe language abilities.
3  How the Performance Descriptors Are Organized
Over time and with practice, learner’s performance gradually takes
on the characteristics of the next higher range of performance.

=== Page 9 ===
ACTFL Performance Descriptors for Language Learners 7
According to Modes of Communication
The three modes of communication provide the orga nizing principle for describing language performance
across three ranges of performance: Novice, Intermedi ate, and Advanced. The ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines
were developed for purposes of assessment across four
skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing) and
originated prior to the Standards. The 2012 revision of
the Proficiency Guidelines considers how each skill is
used, for example, describing both interpersonal and
presentational aspects of speaking. The Performance
Descriptors embrace the communicative purpose behind the three modes of communication, describ ing how a language learner performs to achieve each
communicative purpose: interpersonal, interpretive,
and presentational. The language functions are ap propriately matched to the mode of communication
(e.g., in the Intermediate range, a hallmark function
for Interpersonal is the ability to ask, understand, and
answer questions; for Interpretive, a key function is to
comprehend main ideas and identify some supporting
details; for Presentational, an essential function is the
ability to present information by creating with lan guage). One can also observe significant differences in
the communication strategies that language learners use in each of the modes.
Three Modes of Communication
Interpersonal
Interpretive
Presentational
Active negotiation of meaning among individuals
Interpretation of what the author, speaker, or producer wants the receiver of the message to understand
Creation of messages to inform, explain, persuade, or narrate
Participants observe and monitor one another to see how their meanings and intentions are being communicated
One-way communication with no recourse to the active negotiation of meaning with the writer, speaker, or producer
One-way communication intended to facilitate interpretation by members of the other culture where no direct opportunity for the active negotiation of meaning between members of the two cultures exists
Adjustments and clarifications are made accordingly
Interpretation differs from comprehension and translation in that interpretation implies the ability to read (or listen or view) “between the lines,” including understanding from within the cultural mindset or perspective
To ensure the intended audience is successful in its interpretation, the “presenter” needs knowledge of the audience’s language and culture
Speaking and listening (conversation); reading and writing (text messages or via social media)
Reading (websites, stories, articles), listening (speeches, messages, songs), or viewing (video clips) of authentic materials
Writing (messages, articles, reports), speaking (telling a story, giving a speech, describing a poster), or visually representing (video or PowerPoint)

An overarching description of the range highlights the
key points that distinguish the performance of Novice,
Intermediate, and Advanced language learners. The
description outlines the range of performance for the
What are the parameters for the language learner’s performance?
Domain
Examples
What it describes
Functions • Ask formulaic questions • Initiate, maintain, and end a conversation • Create with language • Narrate and describe • Make inferences
Functions are the global tasks the learner can perform in the language
Contexts and Content • Oneself • One’s immediate environment • General interest • Work-related
Contexts are situations within which the learner can function; Content is the topics which the learner can understand and discuss
Text Type • Words • Phrases • Sentences • Questions • Strings of sentences • Connected sentences • Paragraphs
Text type controlled by the learner is that which the
learner is able to understand and produce in order to perform the functions of the level given mode of communication: interpersonal, interpretive, or presentational.
The first three domains describe the parameters for the language learner’s performance in each range:

for the level, within the corresponding contexts and
content for the level, using the text type(s) appropriate
for that level. An overarching description of these four

=== Page 12 ===
ACTFL Performance Descriptors for Language Learners 10 4  How To Use the Performance Descriptors
To Inform Classroom Instruction and Assessment while simultaneously targeting the functions and
contexts of the Intermediate range. Novice students
need to experience Intermediate language in controlled
and supported activities in order to gradually acquire
the knowledge and strategies they will need in order to
become confident and independent users of language
in the Intermediate range. Instructors should consider
recycling content and contexts at the next higher level
of functions, providing multiple opportunities for
learners to expand into the next performance range, developing stronger language control, vocabulary, communication strategies, and cultural awareness.
Unique Applications to Classical Languages
The Performance Descriptors are also intended to be
applied to the classical languages (Latin and Greek).
While often falsely assumed that students of Latin and
classical Greek spend all of their instructional time
reading and translating, these Performance Descriptors
provide a further context for a more comprehensive
view of the instructional components to be found in
such classes. The importance of the three modes of
communication as an applicable principle to the learn ing of the classical languages is evident in the com munication standards from the Standards for Classical
Languages:
• Students read, understand and interpret Latin or Greek
• Students use orally, listen to, and write Latin or Greek as part of the language learning process.
Therefore, while reading and understanding the writ ten messages of the ancient world is a key to commu nication in the study of Latin and classical Greek, the
oral use of the language can also be employed to help
students avoid reading or translating word-for-word
as they must listen in “chunks” (several words holding the meaning or phrases) and respond spontaneously
during oral communication. This practice also builds
student interest and heightens understanding of and
appreciation for the languages and their cultures.
The Performance Descriptors provide guidance for
instruction. They match the progression of language
learning and inform the planning and sequencing of
instruction. These descriptions of performance provide
an outline to identify instructional outcomes. Educa tors use these performance outcomes as the starting
point for planning instruction, in a backward design
model. With a clear focus on what performance should
look like at the end of a unit, instructional and practice
activities drive toward those outcomes. This outline
describes the range of performance broadly enough for
instructors to adapt to language learners of all ages; the
instructors then guide language learning by consider ing the cognitive and developmental appropriateness of
their learning activities, their multiple ways to practice
language skills, and their variety of assessments.
In instruction, activities are scaffolded, that is support ed by the instructor by pre-teaching critical elements
such as key vocabulary or a new structure or practice
of a language function. With such support, language
learners are helped to perform at the next range by
learning to use language at that next level. As the
support is removed, language learners gradually over
time become able to demonstrate that performance on
their own. In this way, language learners begin to show
characteristics of the next range as they approach the top end of their current performance range.
Instruction targets the next level and assessment
provides language learners with the opportunity to
show what they can do – with or without assistance in
the form of a controlled context or content, practice
and preparation, or rephrasing and paraphrasing to
increase comprehension. Instructors need to target
instruction across two ranges, broadening learners’ performance at their current range and working to
develop some abilities at the next higher range. Novice
students, for example, need instruction and practice
to improve their performance within the Novice level

=== Page 13 ===
ACTFL Performance Descriptors for Language Learners 11
Unique Applications to American Sign Language (ASL)
These Performance Descriptors are equally applicable
to learners of ASL, with slight adaptations according
to each mode of communication. In the interpersonal
mode (signing), the visual language signed underscores
the communicative importance of facial gestures and
other physical clues to meaning, but learners employ
basically the same communication strategies as other
languages within each of the ranges of performance.
The word “interpretive” needs special definition for
ASL: its use to identify a mode of communication
denotes receptive language or understanding, rather
than the act of serving as an ASL interpreter. The “text”
is either live or recorded, such as a signed message,
commentary, discussion, song, or play. In the presenta tional mode users of ASL use the same communication
strategies as other languages; however, educators may
act more as coaches to assist ASL language learners
with the editing and revising process in the presenta tional mode. Examples of ASL presentational or pro ductive language include messages, stories, or videos.
Language educators and learners need to remember
that the levels of cultural awareness as described in the
Performance Descriptors are as important in ASL and within the Deaf community as in other languages and cultures.

=== Page 14 ===
ACTFL Performance Descriptors for Language Learners 12
Language educators often face undue pressure and
language learners may face unreasonable expectations when unrealistic language outcomes are set for
achievement in short periods of instructional time.
Students require carefully planned and well-sequenced learning opportunities that provide practice in
using the language in order to internalize language
competencies. Time on task is a critical factor in developing performance — time spent meaningfully
engaged in active skill getting and skill using in the
target language by both the teacher and the learner.
ACTFL’s position statement sets the goal of 90% or
more of target language use by the teacher and the learners both inside and outside the classroom.
The chart (on the next page) graphically illustrates the influence of time-on-task on language performance
and shows what outcomes are reasonable to expect of
students who begin language instruction at various points in the K–16 spectrum. The outcomes depict ed in this chart reflect general approximations based
on performance testing and indicate targets that are
possible for all students, given standards-based pro grams with continuity of instruction, sufficient time
on task, and learning focused on performance. While performance outcomes may vary according to the
mode of communication, the expectations in this chart represent a composite of performance outcomes for
interpersonal, interpretive, and presentational com munication. The most common program model for
language learning in this country continues to be two
years of instruction at the secondary level. This model
limits students to performance in the Novice range.
In an increasing number of standards-based, perfor mance-based programs with continuity and sufficient
time on task (e.g., beginning in the elementary grades
with at least 90 minutes of instruction per week and
continuing through the secondary years), learners are
reaching the Advanced range of performance. Evidence
is emerging that elementary immersion programs are
able to produce students that are performing well into
the Intermediate range by middle school and exiting high school in the Advanced range. These students
have the potential to exit postsecondary programs ap proaching or at the Superior level of proficiency. Such
comparisons are given with the caution that reaching
each range of performance is more than simply match ing hours or years of instruction. The age and cognitive
development of the language learners greatly impacts
language learning. The level of literacy and language
performance in the learners’ native language impacts
their development of literacy and language perfor mance in additional languages.
Performance Outcomes May Vary from Language to Language and from Mode to Mode
The Performance Descriptors have been written to
describe realistic language performance for students
at the various benchmarks along the instructional se quence, but language learners may experience different
rates of progress through different modes depending
on how similar their native language is to the new
language. Students whose native language is English
find many similarities between English and languages
using a familiar alphabet such as French, German, and
Spanish. These similarities aid the learner in acquisi tion of the new language as many of the same literacy
strategies may be employed to understand written and
spoken communication. When the language is similar,
cognates become a very useful tool to unlock meaning and to help one remember vocabulary.
Conversely, when students encounter languages with
minimal similarity to their native language, some new
strategies need to be employed to understand and to be understood. American students learning Arabic,
Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Swahili,
or Urdu face different language learning challenges:
unfamiliar sounds, different writing systems, and new
grammars. These linguistic features, which oftentimes
cannot be linked to anything the language learners
know in their native language, generally extend the

ACTFL Performance Descriptors for Language Learners 13
language acquisition process. However, these challeng es vary according to the mode of communication and
should not change the focus on teaching for perfor mance. With every language, some elements will be
easier than others to learn. For example, when learning languages whose writing systems are unfamiliar to
them, learners face the greatest challenge in interpre tive reading and presentational writing, and less of a
challenge with interpersonal listening and speaking.
Heritage speakers of a language learn to use their
heritage language through a variety of means, often through family and community interactions, some times more formally in an instructional setting, The
modes of communication provide educators of heritage
speakers with a useful analytical tool to determine an instructional emphasis. Interpersonal communi cation and interpretive listening tend to be strengths
for many heritage speakers. At the same time, some
heritage speakers may benefit from focused support in
the modes of presentational writing and interpretive
reading if prior language experiences were not in an instructional setting.
How to Use This Chart
This document and chart provide guidance to ed ucators as they reflect on their language learning
curriculum and assessments. A useful approach is to
compare student evidence from performance tasks and
assessments to this chart in order to reflect on students’
use of language. Are students performing at a level
consistent with the time and effort spent? Are students
“on track” to reach the expected level of performance?
Alternatively, educators may read the Performance
Descriptors and determine that their students do not
perform at a level consistent with the time and effort
spent and, therefore, seek ways of modifying their
program so that students reach the targeted levels of language performance.
Language learners also benefit by understanding the
Performance Descriptors and the targeted expectations
shown in this chart. The ranges of performance de scribe a pathway for learners to keep track of progress
made, to identify domains needing additional practice,
and to gain a clear understanding of how to move into
the next higher range of performance. By collecting
and reflecting on evidence of performance, language
learners are able to set their own language learning
targets, motivating them to improve their performance.
