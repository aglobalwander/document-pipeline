About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking
AP courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and
AP Exams are developed and scored by college faculty
and experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges
and universities in the United States grant credit,
advanced placement, or both on the basis of successful
AP Exam scores; more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the
content and science practices that are the focus of the corresponding college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also organizes the content and
science practices into a series of units that represent
a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks
and that many AP teachers have told us they follow in
order to focus their instruction. The intention of this
publication is to respect teachers’ time and expertise
by providing a roadmap that they can modify and adapt
to their local priorities and preferences. Moreover, by
organizing the AP course content and science practices
into units, the AP Program is able to provide teachers and students with free formative assessments—
Personal Progress Checks—that teachers can assign throughout the year to measure student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop science practices.
Enrolling Students:
Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically
challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to equitable preparation and
access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses:
The AP Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle that each school implements its own curriculum that will enable students to develop the content
understandings and science practices described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP courses
must participate in the AP Course Audit, a process through which AP teachers’ course materials are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.

AP Physics 2: Algebra-Based Course and Exam Description

=== Page 9 ===
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the
AP teacher and the school principal (or designated
administrator) to confirm awareness and understanding
of the curricular and resource requirements. A syllabus
or course outline, detailing how course requirements
are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and science practices that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The
AP Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor;
all AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision,
piloting, and analysis to ensure that questions are
accurate, fair, and valid and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges) and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development,
College Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher
education institutions. This feedback is carefully
considered to ensure that AP courses and exams are
able to provide students with a college-level learning
experience and the opportunity to demonstrate their
qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam
development process, relies on the expertise of both
AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice
questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course performance
assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands
of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are
scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion
is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained,
and their work is monitored throughout the Reading
for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief
Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers
in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of
the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a curve.
Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which means that
every student who meets the criteria for an AP score of
2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no matter how many
students that is. The criteria for the number of points
students must earn on the AP Exam to receive scores
of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently
validates for credit and placement purposes—include:
§§ The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
§§ The number of points researchers have found to be predictive that an AP student will succeed when placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
§§ Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP scores as follows:
AP Score
Credit
Recommendation
College Grade
Equivalent 5
Extremely well qualified
A 4

B-, C+, C 2

While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for
scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and universities.
To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/placement
policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org /creditpolicies
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score the free-response sections of the AP Exams.
Ninety-eight percent of surveyed educators who took
part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an
AP Reader, including opportunities to:
§§ Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
§§ Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure
to the quality and depth of the responses from the entire pool of AP Exam takers and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
§§ Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for readers who travel.
§§ Score from home: AP Readers have online distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects. Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
§§ Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs):
AP Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and science practices, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide
suggests sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds science practice instruction across
units, organizes content into topics, and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and science
practices through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect
answers, as well as free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal
Progress Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate
teacher effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds
for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
science practices that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress
over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to
use in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course topics and science
practices, create customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable
students to practice and get feedback on each question.
*To report misuses, please call, 877-274-6474  (International: +1-212-632-1781).

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
§§ Teachers and students sign in to, or create, their College Board accounts.
§§ Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
§§ Teachers or AP coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
§§ Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP coordinator.
§§ Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and
AP coordinators to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following
additional benefits:
§§ Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
§§ Streamlined exam ordering: AP coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
§§ Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student
pack. The AP ID connects student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
§§ Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

Model
Integrating AP resources throughout the course can help students develop the course
science practices and conceptual understandings. The instructional model outlined below
shows possible ways to incorporate AP resources into the classroom.
Plan
Teachers may consider the following approaches as they plan their instruction before teaching each unit.
§§ Review the overview at the start of each unit guide to identify essential questions,
conceptual understandings, and science practices for each unit.
§§ Use the Unit at a Glance table to identify related topics that build toward a common
understanding, and then plan appropriate pacing for students.
§§ Identify useful strategies in the Instructional Approaches section to help teach the concepts and science practices.
Teach
When teaching, supporting resources can be used to build students’ conceptual understanding and mastery of science practices.
§§ Use the topic pages in the unit guides to identify the required content.
§§ Integrate the content with a science practice, considering any appropriate scaffolding.
§§ Employ any of the instructional strategies previously identified.
§§ Use the available resources on the topic pages to bring a variety of assets into the classroom.
Assess
Teachers can measure student understanding of the content and science practices covered
in the unit and provide actionable feedback to students.
§§ At the end of each unit, use AP Classroom to assign students the online Personal Progress
Checks as homework or as an in-class task.
§§ Provide question-level feedback to students through answer rationales; provide unit- and
science practice-level feedback using the progress dashboard.
§§ Create additional practice opportunities using the AP Question Bank and assign them through AP Classroom.

About the
AP Physics 2 Course
AP Physics 2 is an algebra-based, introductory college-level physics course. Students
cultivate their understanding of physics through inquiry-based investigations as they explore
these topics: fluids; thermodynamics; electrical force, field, and potential; electric circuits;
magnetism and electromagnetic induction; geometric and physical optics; and quantum, atomic, and nuclear physics.
College Course Equivalent
AP Physics 2 is a full-year course that is the equivalent of a second-semester introductory college course in algebra-based physics.
Prerequisites
Students should have completed AP Physics 1 or a comparable introductory physics course
and should have taken or be concurrently taking pre-calculus or an equivalent course.
Laboratory Requirement
This course requires that twenty-five percent of instructional time will be spent in
hands-on laboratory work, with an emphasis on inquiry-based investigations that provide
students with opportunities to demonstrate foundational physics principles and apply the science practices.
Inquiry-based laboratory experiences support the AP Physics 2 course and AP Course
Audit curricular requirements by providing opportunities for students to engage in the seven
science practices as they design plans for experiments, make predictions, collect and analyze
data, apply mathematical routines, develop explanations, and communicate about their work.
Colleges may require students to present their laboratory materials from AP science courses
before granting college credit for laboratory work, so students should be encouraged to retain
their laboratory notebooks, reports, and other materials.

Introduction
The AP Physics 2 course outlined in this framework reflects a commitment
to what physics teachers, professors, and researchers have agreed is the
main goal of a college-level physics survey course: to help students develop
a deep understanding of the foundational principles that shape classical
mechanics and modern physics. By confronting complex physical situations
or scenarios, the course is designed to enable students to develop the ability
to reason about physical phenomena using important science practices, such
as explaining relationships, applying and justifying the use of mathematical
routines, designing experiments, analyzing data, and making connections across multiple topics within the course.
To foster this deeper level of learning, the AP Physics 2 course defines concepts, skills, and understandings
required by representative colleges and universities for granting college credit and placement. Students will
practice reasoning skills used by physicists by discussing and debating, with peers, the physical phenomena
investigated in class, as well as by designing and conducting inquiry-based laboratory investigations to solve
problems through first-hand observations, data collection, analysis, and interpretation.
This document is not a complete curriculum. Teachers create their own local curriculum by selecting, for each
concept, content that enables students to explore the course learning objectives and meets state or local
requirements. The result is a course that prepares students for college credit and placement.

Course Framework
Components
Overview
This course framework provides a clear and detailed description of the course
requirements necessary for student success. The framework specifies what
students must know, be able to do, and understand to qualify for college credit or placement.
The course framework includes two essential components:
1   SCIENCE PRACTICES
The science practices are central to the study and practice of physics.
Students should develop and apply the described practices on a regular basis over the span of the course.
2   COURSE CONTENT
The course content is organized into commonly taught units of study that
provide a suggested sequence for the course and detail required content
and conceptual understandings that colleges and universities typically
expect students to master to qualify for college credit and/or placement.
This content is grounded in big ideas, which are cross-cutting concepts
that build conceptual understanding and spiral throughout the course.

Course
Content
Based on the Understanding by Design® (Wiggins and McTighe) model, this course
framework provides a clear and detailed description of the course requirements
necessary for student success. The framework specifies what students must know,
be able to do, and understand, with a focus on seven big ideas that encompass
core principles, theories, and processes of the discipline. The framework also
encourages instruction that prepares students to make connections across
domains through a broader way of thinking about the physical world.
Big Ideas
The big ideas serve as the foundation of the course and allow students to create
meaningful connections among concepts. They are often abstract concepts or
themes that become threads that run throughout the course. Revisiting the big
ideas and applying them in a variety of contexts allows students to develop deeper
conceptual understanding. Below are the big ideas of the course and a brief description of each.
2
BIG IDEA 1: SYSTEMS (SYS)
Objects and systems have properties such as mass and charge. Systems may have internal structure.
BIG IDEA 2: FIELDS (FLD)
Fields existing in space can be used to explain interactions.
BIG IDEA 3: FORCE INTERACTIONS (INT)
The interactions of an object with other objects can be described by forces.
BIG IDEA 4: CHANGE (CHA)
Interactions between systems can result in changes in those systems.
BIG IDEA 5: CONSERVATION (CON)
Changes that occur as a result of interactions are constrained by conservation laws.

AP PHYSICS 2
Unit
Guides
Introduction
Designed with input from the community of AP Physics 2 educators, the
unit guides offer teachers helpful guidance in building students’ science
practices and knowledge. The suggested sequence was identified through
a thorough analysis of the syllabi of highly effective AP teachers and the organization of typical college textbooks.
This unit structure respects new AP teachers’ time by providing one
possible sequence they can adopt or modify rather than having to build
from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units enable the AP
Program to provide interested teachers with formative assessments—the
Personal Progress Checks—that they can assign their students at the end
of each unit to gauge progress toward success on the AP Exam. However,
experienced AP teachers who are satisfied with their current course
organization and exam results should feel no pressure to adopt these units,
which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

Unit Overview contextualizes and situates the key content of
the unit within the scope of the course. It also describes specific
aspects of the science practices that are appropriate to focus on in that unit.
Big ideas serve as the foundation of the course and develop
understanding as they spiral throughout the course. The
essential questions are thought-provoking questions that motivate students and inspire inquiry.
Preparing for the AP Exam provides helpful tips and common
student misunderstandings identified from prior exam data.
Using the Unit Guides
Preparing for the AP Exam
The AP Physics 2 Exam has an experimental design question in the free-response section.
Students must be able to justify their selection of the data needed to answer the question and then design a plan to collect this data.
Students often struggle with knowing where to start when answering an experimental design
question, even if they have previously performed the experiment in class. Use scaffolding
to help students determine the appropriate data to answer a scientific question and to help
students who struggle with this task. Students should first be asked to identify the necessary
data to determine a physical quantity and then dive more deeply into procedural writing. While
this type of scaffolding might seem too basic for AP Physics 2 students, remember that there
is a difference between academically knowing the answer to a question and being able to
write a clear, concise laboratory procedure on the AP Physics 2 Exam.
BIG IDEA 1
Systems SYS § How are the visible properties of materials determined by parts that can’t be seen?
BIG IDEA 3
Force Interactions INT § Why do some objects float and others sink?
BIG IDEA 5
Conservation CON § How can a hydraulic system be modified to do more work?
§ Is it possible for energy or mass to be created or destroyed in systems involving fluids?
Fluids
Unit Overview
In Unit 1, students will consider how a fluid’s internal structure and interactions define its
macroscopic characteristics and how these interactions can be studied if they can’t be seen.
Woven through this unit are essential AP Physics 2 principles, including an emphasis on
representations and models and connecting related knowledge between fundamental ideas.
Unit 1 utilizes familiar force and energy representations (free-body diagrams and energy
bar charts) to describe static and dynamic fluids. As in AP Physics 1, being able to identify
and describe the relationships between physical quantities—and use these relationships as
evidence to justify claims—is a critical skill when answering scientific questions. Students will
once again be encouraged to sharpen their understanding of mathematics and the laws of
physics by being asked to reason with equations to describe a phenomenon.
Although its content is unique, Unit 1 presents thematic threads that weave throughout
the course, including the interactions between systems and the conservation of fundamental quantities.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use these
activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples below
were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways that they
approach teaching some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional Approaches
section beginning on p. 185 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 1.3
Construct an Argument
Search “pressure versus height graph” online and download a graph of air pressure as
a function of elevation. Have students explain why the slope decreases with elevation
(air gets less dense) and use the slope of the graph at one point to estimate the density of air at that elevation.
2 1.5
Desktop Experiment
Obtain an irregularly-shaped metal object for each group (small, inexpensive statues are
a possibility). Give each group a spring scale and access to a deep sink. Have students
use buoyancy principles to calculate the volume and density of the object.
3 1.5
Graph and Switch
Have a student use a rope to raise an object 2 m from the bottom of a 3 m deep pool.
Graph (with numerical scales) tension versus height of the bottom of the object above
the floor of the pool for 0–4 m. Have another student determine the mass, volume, and
density of the object. The shape of the graph from 1 to 3 m also determines whether the
shape is a cube, sphere, or a cone pointing up or down.
4 1.6
Bar Chart
Students draw Bernoulli bar charts for two or more points in a flowing fluid situation.
(Bars are for pressure, gy, and ρ 2 1 v 2
.) Examples: water leaking out of a hole in a
container, water shooting out of a squirt gun, and drinking from a straw.
5 1.6
Desktop Experiment
Obtain a syringe (no needle) or squirt gun for each group. Have each group fill it with water
and squirt the water horizontally. Each group (or person) is to determine how much pressure
(for the squirt gun) or force (for the syringe) they exerted to make the water come out.

TOPIC PAGES
Enduring understandings are the long-term takeaways related
to the big ideas that leave a lasting impression on students.
Students build and earn these understandings over time by
exploring and applying course content throughout the year.
Learning objectives provide clear and detailed articulation of
what students should know and be able to do in order to progress
toward the enduring understandings. Each learning objective is
designed to help teachers integrate science practices [SP] with
specific content and to provide them with clear information on how
students will be expected to demonstrate their knowledge and
skills on the AP Physics 2 Exam. These learning objectives fully
define what will be assessed on the exam. Questions that do not
correspond to one or more learning objectives will not appear on the exam.
Essential knowledge statements describe the knowledge required to perform the learning objective.
Boundary statements provide guidance to teachers regarding
the content boundaries of the AP Physics 1 and 2 courses.
These statements help articulate the contextual differences of
how the same big ideas and enduring understandings are applied
in each course. Boundary statements appear at the end of essential knowledge statements where appropriate.

Preparing for the AP Exam
The AP Physics 2 Exam requires students to be able to re-express key elements of
natural phenomena across multiple representations in the domain. This skill appears in
the Quantitative/Qualitative Translation (QQT), a type of long, free-response question that
requires students to use both words and mathematics to describe and analyze a situation. A
QQT might ask students to work with multiple representations or evaluate another student’s
representations. Representations might include equations, narrative descriptions, graphs, diagrams, and data tables.
Students who have primarily been exposed to numerical problem solving often struggle with
QQTs, because these questions require them to have a more conceptual understanding of
both content and representations. Providing opportunities for students to translate between
different representations (including equations, diagrams, graphs, and written descriptions) will help students perform better on a QQT.

Thermodynamics
Unit Overview
In Unit 2, students will continue to investigate what they cannot see by examining heat,
temperature, and thermal energy in practical contexts such as heat engines, heat pumps, and
refrigerators. The focus of this unit is the study of relationships and change, so it’s important
that students can discuss—in addition to calculate—what happens when a physical scenario
changes, such as the consequences of adding heat to, or removing heat from, a system.
Throughout this unit, students will use representations and models (PV diagrams, energy
bar charts, or free-body diagrams) to construct evidence-based explanations and help
them make predictions and justify claims about new phenomena. These representations
and models will also help students develop connections and transfer their learning across
disciplinary boundaries so that they are able to link, synthesize, and apply ideas they have learned across the sciences and mathematics.
Unit 2 also acquaints students with the second law of thermodynamics, entropy, and how the
behavior of complex systems can be modeled with the mathematics of probability. This will be
explored further in Unit 7 to help support and explain the concepts of modern physics.

The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use these
activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples below
were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways that they

Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 2.2
Desktop Experiment
Give each group a 10 mL syringe with a Luer-Lok tip and a Luer-Lok cap. Instruct students
to set the syringe to 10 mL, cap the end, turn the syringe vertical, and stack books on top.
Students then calculate the absolute pressure of the books plus atmosphere, and make a pressure versus volume graph.
2 2.6
Discussion Groups
Each group is to come up with a way to demonstrate each of the eight thermodynamic
processes (isobaric, isochoric, isothermal, and adiabatic, each in both possible directions)
using cheap-to-obtain/common school or household items. Example: For adiabatic
compression, cap a syringe and push on the plunger really hard (see “fire syringe” for more on this example).
3 2.6
Graph and Switch
Student A describes a three-step cyclical thermodynamic process (e.g., “isochoric heating,
isothermal expansion, isobaric cooling”) and Students B, C, and D make a PV, PT, and VT diagram (respectively) of the cycle.
4 2.7
Construct an Argument/Concept-Oriented Demonstration
Look up “Contigo Autospout Addison Water Bottle” on Amazon and show it to students.
Explain that a person takes this partially filled water bottle up to the top of a mountain,
opens it, and gets sprayed in the face with water. Explain why and whether more water
would spray out if there is more or less water in the bottle (answer: less). Discuss what
would happen if the bottle is taken out of the refrigerator, opened, and the person gets sprayed.
5 2.11
Changing Representations
Show students a single thermodynamic process on a PV/PT/VT diagram and a
molecular-velocity distribution graph for the “initial” state. Have students draw the
distribution for the “final” state or explain why it is the same graph (if it is).

UNIT 3
Unit Overview
Unit 3 begins the study of electromagnetic phenomena at a fundamental level, introducing
students to the concepts of electric charge, electric force, and electric field and potential.
Despite the shift from examining fluids and gases to examining charged particles, the
foundation of this unit continues to focus on relationships, change, and developing the
science practice of making connections between scales, concepts, and representations.
For instance, students will use the concept of equipotential lines to visualize the electric field
and make connections between the isolines on topographic maps for gravitational fields and
equipotential lines for the electric field. This unit will also help students better understand that
interactions between systems result in changes within those systems—allowing students to
further apply energy conservation principles in later units.
Students are encouraged to apply what they know when learning about fields (gravitational
and electric), how fields interact, and the complex concepts of static and dynamic electricity.
This will help students better understand energy conservation principles, as well as develop
the science practice of data analysis. Data analysis is essential in identifying patterns and
relationships between variables and helps students become better prepared to engage in and
craft scientific arguments that describe a mechanism through which a phenomenon occurs.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use these
activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples below
were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways that they
approach teaching some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional Approaches
section beginning on p. 185 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 3.6
Identify Subtasks
Students are shown three known charges at known positions on a line and asked to find
the net force on each charge. Students describe in words what the subtasks are and come
up with a procedure for finding the net force on each charge.
2 3.7
Conflicting Contentions
Show a diagram with two charged spheres hanging from strings anchored to the same
point in the ceiling, with the string for sphere A making a greater angle from the vertical.
One student thinks this is because A has less charge so it is pushed on harder by B, but
another student thinks it is because A has less mass and is pulled down less by gravity.
Which student is right? Explain with free-body diagrams.
3 3.8
Desktop Experiment
A spark occurs when the E-field between two conductors is 3 × 106 V/m. Obtain a Van de
Graaf generator and find the distance from the ball that a grounded rod must be held
to make a spark. Have students use E = V/d to get the potential of the sphere, and use
V = kq/r2 with the radius of the sphere to get the charge of the sphere.
4 3.9
Friends Without Pens
Have students consider a proton P and an alpha particle A released from rest near each
other. Relate the electric and gravitational forces of P→A and A→P. Rank these four forces,
and justify the ranking. How does the acceleration/momentum/kinetic energy of P compare
to A (four times as much, same, four times)? How does the acceleration and velocity of P or A change as they move apart?
5 3.11 3.12
Changing Representations
Given an arrangement of two or three charges (of various signs and either same or
different magnitude), students sketch E-field vector diagrams and potential isolines for the
arrangement. Students can use PhET: Charges and Fields to check their diagrams.

The magnitude of the electric field vector is proportional to the net electric charge of the object(s) creating that field. This includes positive point charges, negative point charges, spherically symmetric charge distributions, and uniformly charged parallel plates.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
2.C.2.1
Qualitatively and semi quantitatively apply the vector relationship between the electric field and the net electric charge creating that field. [SP 2.2, 6.4] continued on next page
2.C.3.1
Explain the inverse square dependence of the electric field surrounding a spherically symmetric, electrically charged object.
[SP 6.2]
2.C.3
The electric field outside a spherically symmetric charged object is radial, and its magnitude varies as the inverse square of the radial distance from the center of that object.
Electric field lines are not in the curriculum.
Students will be expected to rely only on the rough intuitive sense underlying field lines, wherein the field is viewed as analogous to something emanating uniformly from a source.
a.	 The inverse square relation known as
Coulomb’s law gives the magnitude of the electric field at a distance r from the center of a source object of electric charge q as 2 0 1 4 q
E r πε =  .
b.	 This relation is based on a model of the space surrounding a charged source object by considering the radial dependence of the area of the surface of a sphere centered on the source object.

The electric field around dipoles and other systems of electrically charged objects (that can be modeled as point objects) is found by vector addition of the field of each individual
object. Electric dipoles are treated qualitatively
in this course as a teaching analogy to facilitate student understanding of magnetic dipoles.
a.	 When an object is small compared with the distances involved in the problem, or when a larger object is being modeled as a large number of very small constituent particles, these can be modeled as charged objects of negligible size, or “point charges.” b.	 The expression for the electric field due to a point charge can be used to determine the electric field, either qualitatively or quantitatively, around a simple, highly symmetric distribution of point charges.

Preparing for the AP Exam
Students will be challenged to apply the science practices to the learning objectives in
the course framework. These science practices and learning objectives can be addressed in
many ways, including through inquiry-based labs. While inquiry experiments will take more
time than simple verification/confirmation labs, they are important for student success.
Students need to have firsthand experience in designing investigations and analyzing data
instead of simply following a set of instructions given by the teacher.
Students are expected to provide a sequence of statements that is clear, concise, and
orderly and that specifies the steps in the investigation needed to reasonably answer the question or investigate the phenomenon.
On the AP Physics 2 Exam, there is a 12-point experimental design question in the
free-response question section. In addition, there will be 8 to 10 multiple-choice questions
that ask students to think about experimental design.
BIG IDEA 1
Systems  SYS §§ How can what’s inside affect what’s outside?
§§ How can we measure something that has no weight, mass, or temperature?
BIG IDEA 4
Change  CHA §§ How can you change the value of something just by changing its shape?
§§ How does the resistance and capacitance of resistors and capacitors change in response to changes in the physical geometry of the circuit element?
§§ Why are holiday lights usually wired in series, while house lights are usually wired in parallel?
BIG IDEA 5
Conservation  CON §§ How can the electric company justify its claims that it sells “electricity”?
§§ What happens to the charge in a cell phone battery when it “dies”?
Electric Circuits
Unit Overview
Unit 4 revisits the behavior of charged particles, discussed in Unit 3, to deepen students’
understanding of the law of conservation of energy and how it’s applied to electric circuits.
This unit will ask students to do more than calculate for the current, resistance, and voltage
in a simple circuit; it will challenge them to draw connections between the interactions of
systems and the changes that result from those interactions. For example, students will
need to be able to articulate the impact of a light bulb being removed on a circuit consisting
of several light bulbs. They will also need to design an experiment to test if a light bulb is
ohmic or justify how changing the spacing of a capacitor will affect its capacitance. Using
models and representations to analyze physical situations, as well as using mathematical
relationships to justify claims, are critically important science practices in this unit. Unit 4 will
also compel students to discover and understand the relationship between the conservation
of total energy and the conservation of total electric charge in circuits. It will encourage them
to use Kirchhoff’s rules to describe both energy conservation and charge conservation.
Simultaneously, students will also have more opportunities in Unit 4 to expand their data
collection and analysis abilities to include writing clear, concise procedural paragraphs in
addition to revising their reasoning based on new data. In Unit 5, students will expand their
investigations of the symmetry between electric and magnetic fields.

Preparing for the AP Exam
When using physical laws and fundamental ideas of physics as justification for claims,
students need to explain what stays the same as well as what happens when physical
scenarios are modified. Students must be provided with opportunities to investigate changes in systems.
Students also need to be aware that when they are writing justifications for claims, simply
referencing an equation, a law, or a physical principle is not enough. For example, stating
that the force on a charged particle is to the right because of the “right-hand rule” is not
sufficient to earn points on free-response questions. Students must clearly and concisely
describe and use physics-based equations, laws, and principles as evidence to support their reasoning and/or to help justify their claims.

Unit Overview
In Units 3 and 4, students investigated electrostatic forces and fields and how free charges
can be moved through electric fields to produce currents. In Unit 5, students will supplement
that knowledge by exploring the relationships between moving charges and the magnetic
forces and fields they generate. Students will discover the natural symmetry between
electricity and magnetism and make connections between electromagnetic induction and the
underlying principles behind most of the technology in modern society, including telephones, television, computers, and the Internet.
This unit will also build on the representations presented in the previous two units by
introducing the magnetic field diagram to illustrate the effects of static and dynamic magnetic
fields. Students must be able to relate the content and representations that they learned in
previous physics courses. Recalling this content will help students overcome misconceptions,
such as the existence of a centrifugal force. While students should master how to use
specific equations to calculate unknown quantities, it is more important that they are able
to derive new expressions from fundamental principles to help them make predictions in
unfamiliar, applied contexts. In Unit 6, the idea of electromagnetic induction is used to relate
to electromagnetic waves and their oscillating electric and magnetic fields. The concepts
introduced in Unit 5 are greatly expanded upon in AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism.

Students create right-hand-rule questions and then trade with other students and answer
them. Examples: Give charge sign, velocity, and magnetic force directions and determine
magnetic field direction; give velocity, force, and magnetic field directions and determine
charge sign; give velocity and magnetic field directions and determine the direction of an electric field that would cause balanced forces.

Graph and Switch
Student A comes up with two related values in a magnetism-focused situation (examples:
“radius vs. speed of a circling charge in a magnetic field” or “flux through a spinning coil in
a uniform magnetic field as a function of time”). Student B then must sketch the graph and
justify either qualitatively or with symbolic equations.
5 5.8
Discussion Groups
Buy a “Non-Contact Voltage Tester” and hold it up to a wire carrying AC current (it chirps). Hold
it to a battery-powered circuit carrying DC current (no chirp). Have students discuss how this
object could use magnetism and Faraday’s Law principles to detect AC but not DC current.

Preparing for the AP Exam
The last five questions of the multiple-choice section of the AP Physics 2 Exam are multiple correct questions. Students must select both correct answers and none of the incorrect
answers to get credit for these questions. These questions can easily intimidate students
if they have not had the opportunity to practice answering them throughout the year.
A common strategy to tackle multiple-correct questions is to slow down and read the entire
prompt. Students who jump right to the answers will be frustrated by choices that are factually correct but do not answer the question.
Remember: Students will only get credit if they choose both correct answers.

Unit Overview
Although the nature of oscillating electric and magnetic fields, explored in Unit 5, sets
the foundation for this unit’s fundamental topic—electromagnetic waves, or light—Unit 6
demonstrates another distinct shift in both content and the models/representations used
to analyze physical scenarios. In this unit, students will be introduced to the different
ways of thinking about and modeling light, but the ideas and models used in this unit are
fundamentally different from those used earlier in the course, as well as those used in previous physics courses.
This unit presents new challenges for teachers and students, because it introduces many new
types of representations, including ray, wave front, and interference diagrams. It is essential
that students understand how to create and use these diagrams to help answer questions
and to use as evidence for claims. A more complete understanding of the different ways
of thinking about and modeling light will help students analyze data more effectively; they
can then apply this science practice to design a process of data analysis that will help them
determine if the experimental design needs to be altered to produce the needed data to justify claims.
In Unit 7, students will continue to explore the behavior of light as an electromagnetic wave
and examine additional ways of thinking about and modeling light.

The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use these
activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples below
were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways that they

Put orange Jell-O in a rectangular-prism-shaped container made of thin material. Give
students a red laser, a protractor, and paper, and have them determine the index of
refraction of orange Jell-O without touching the Jell-O directly.
2 6.5
Desktop Experiment
Buy a cheap magnifying glass and a cheap light source for each group. Then take several
pairs of object and image distance data, and graph them to find the focal length.
3 6.5
Working Backward
Student A describes a situation with a lens/mirror where the image is real/virtual and larger/
smaller than the object (so, eight possibilities). Student B determines whether the instrument
is converging/diverging and where to put the object (closer than f, between f and 2f, or
beyond 2f) to satisfy Student A’s parameters and draws a ray diagram to support the answer.
4 6.5
Quickwrite
The human eye, without optical deficiencies, will focus the image of a distant object on the
retina. If the object is closer, the eye muscles make the eye lens thicker so that the image
still focuses on the retina. The closer the object, the more the eye muscles force the eye
lens to be thicker. Explain what is happening in terms of so, si, and f, and use equations to support relationships indicated.
5 6.6
Desktop Experiment
Give groups a red/green/purple laser and a cheap diffraction grating. Give wavelength, and
ask for diffraction slit spacing (or vice versa) experimentally. This can also be performed by
finding the width of a human hair or the width of data tracks on a CD or DVD.

Preparing for the AP Exam
Credit for answers in the free-response section depends on the quality of the solutions and
the explanations given. Partial solutions may receive only partial credit, so students should
always show all their work, starting with the fundamental principles of physics. Answers
must be justified through some verbal or mathematical analysis, or full credit will not be given.
In general, it is a good practice to have students annotate their calculations and mathematical
derivations, as well as laboratory setups, etc., for clarity.
To achieve full credit, students must draw from the fundamental principles of physics to answer the question clearly and concisely.

Unit Overview
Unit 7 lays the groundwork for the study of modern physics by resolving the conflicts
and questions that were left unanswered by Newtonian mechanics. While new models
and representations are introduced in Unit 7 (such as the electron level diagram), students
will be able to make connections between the content of this unit and the fundamental
principles of physics, principles of conservation, and models and representations used
earlier in the course. These connections will help students make predictions about a variety
of phenomena—including the rate of radioactive decay or the type of nuclear reaction—
in addition to making and justifying claims with evidence about such phenomena. Students
must be able to connect what they learn in this unit with the fundamental principles of
physics. This is more important than being able to calculate numerical equations. For example,
students will be asked to connect the photoelectric experiment to the ideas of energy conservation and the particle model of light.
Unit 7 represents only the first step into the realm of modern physics. Students who continue
their study of physics in college will have the opportunity to learn about the developments in physics since the dawn of the 20th century.

Get 200 dice and put them in a sealed box. On each “turn,” shake the box so that all dice
are rolled and then open the box and remove all dice that land on 1. Record the remaining
number of dice. Repeat (without putting the dice back in the box) until all dice are removed.
Graph “dice versus turns,” and from it determine the “half-life” of the dice (about 3.8 turns).

Show students a hydrogen discharge tube, and give them a diffraction grating, so
they can see the red, cyan, and purple. Tell students that the energy levels of hydrogen are
En = (−13.6 eV)/n2. Have students estimate the wavelengths of the three colors (based on
research) and determine which energy level transitions they are seeing (red 3 to 2, cyan 4 to 2, purple 5 to 2).

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
1.D.3
Properties of space and time cannot always be treated as absolute.
a.	 Relativistic mass–energy equivalence is a reconceptualization of matter and energy as two manifestations of the same underlying entity, fully interconvertible, thereby rendering invalid the classically separate laws of conservation of mass and conservation of energy. Students will not be expected to know apparent mass or rest mass.
b.	 Measurements of length and time depend on speed (qualitative treatment only).
Relevant Equation:

E mc
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
1.D.3.1
Articulate the reasons that classical mechanics must be replaced by special relativity to describe the experimental results and theoretical predictions that show that the properties of space and time are not absolute.
[Students will be expected to recognize situations in which nonrelativistic classical physics breaks down and to explain how relativity addresses that breakdown, but students will not be expected to know in which of two reference frames a given series of events corresponds to a greater or lesser time interval, or a greater or lesser spatial distance; they will just need to know that observers in the two reference frames can “disagree” about some time and distance intervals.]

Only waves exhibit interference and diffraction.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
6.C.1
When two waves cross, they travel through each other; they do not bounce off each other. Where the waves overlap, the resulting displacement can be determined by adding the displacements of the two waves. This is called superposition. Examples include interference resulting from diffraction through slits as well as thin-film interference.

7.C.4
Photon emission and absorption processes are described by probability.
a.	 An atom in a given energy state may absorb a photon of the right energy and move to a higher energy state (stimulated absorption).
b.	 An atom in an excited energy state may jump spontaneously to a lower energy state with the emission of a photon (spontaneous emission).
c.	 Spontaneous transitions to higher energy states have a very low probability but can be stimulated to occur. Spontaneous transitions to lower energy states are highly probable.
d.	 When a photon of the right energy interacts with an atom in an excited energy state, it may stimulate the atom to make a transition to a lower energy state with the emission of a photon (stimulated emission). In this case, both photons have the same energy and are in phase and moving in the same direction.

Lab Experiments
Although laboratory work has often been separated
from classroom work, research shows that experience
and experimentation are often more instructionally
effective. Familiarity with concrete evidence leads to a
deeper understanding and gives students a sense of ownership of the knowledge they have constructed.
AP Physics courses require students to engage with
data in a variety of ways. The analysis, interpretation,
and application of quantitative information are vital
skills for students. Scientific inquiry experiences in AP
Physics 2 should be designed and implemented with
increasing student involvement to help enhance inquiry
learning and develop critical thinking and problem solving skills. Typically, the level of investigations in an
AP Physics 2 classroom should focus primarily on the
continuum between guided and open inquiry. However,
depending on students’ familiarity with the topic, a given
laboratory experience might incorporate a sequence
involving all four levels of inquiry (confirmation,
structured inquiry, guided inquiry, and open inquiry).
Lab Manuals and Lab Notebooks
College Board publishes AP Physics 1 and 2 Inquiry-
Based Lab Investigations: A Teacher’s Manual to
support the guided inquiry lab requirement for the course. It includes labs that teachers can choose
from to satisfy the guided inquiry lab component for the course. Many publishers and science classroom
material distributors offer affordable lab manuals
with outlined experiments and activities as well as lab
notebooks for recording lab data and observations.
Students can use any type of notebook to fulfill the
lab notebook requirement, even an online document.
Consider the needs of the classroom when deciding what type of lab notebook to use.
Lab Materials
A wide range of equipment may be used in the physics laboratory, from generic lab items such
as meter sticks, rubber balls, springs, string, metal spheres, calibrated mass sets, beakers, glass and
cardboard tubes, electronic balances, stopwatches, clamps, and ring stands to items more specific to
physics, such as tracks, carts, light bulbs, resistors, magnets, and batteries. Successful guided inquiry
student work can be accomplished both with simple, inexpensive materials and with more sophisticated
physics equipment, such air tracks, force sensors,
and oscilloscopes. Remember that the AP lab should provide an experience for students equivalent to
that of a college laboratory, so teachers should make
every effort to provide a range of experiences–—from experiments students contrive from plumbing pipe,
string, and duct tape to experiments in which students
gather and analyze data using calculators or computer interfaced equipment.
There are avenues that teachers can explore as a
means of getting access to more expensive equipment, such as computers and probes. Probes can often
be rented for short periods of time from instrument
suppliers. Alternatively, local colleges or universities
may allow high school students to complete a lab as a
field trip on their campus, or they may allow teachers to
borrow their equipment. They may even donate their old
equipment. Some schools have partnerships with local
businesses that can help with laboratory equipment
and materials. Teachers can also utilize online donation
sites, such as Donors Choose and Adopt-A-Classroom.

Lab Time
For this AP Physics 2 to be comparable to a college physics course, it is critical that teachers make
laboratory work an important part their curriculum.
An analysis of data from AP Physics 2 examinees regarding the length of time they spent per week in the laboratory shows that increased laboratory
time correlates with higher AP scores. Flexible or modular scheduling must be implemented to meet
the time requirements identified in the course outline.
At minimum, one double period a week is needed.
Furthermore, it is important that the AP Physics 2
laboratory program be adapted to local conditions and
funding, as it aims to offer the students a well-rounded experience with experimental physics. Adequate
laboratory facilities should be provided so that each student has a work space where equipment and
materials can be left overnight if necessary. Sufficient
laboratory equipment for the anticipated enrollment and appropriate instruments should be provided.
Students in AP Physics 2 should have access to
computers with software appropriate for processing laboratory data and writing reports.

How to Set Up a Lab Program
Physics is not just a subject. Rather, it is a way of
approaching scientific discovery that requires personal observation and physical experimentation. Being successful in this endeavor requires students to synthesize and use a broad spectrum of knowledge
and skills, including mathematical, computational,
experimental, and practical skills, and to develop
habits of mind that might be characterized as thinking
like a physicist. Student-directed, inquiry-based lab experience supports the AP Physics 2 course and
AP Course Audit curricular requirements. It provides opportunities for students to design experiments,
collect data, apply mathematical routines and methods, and refine testable explanations and predictions.
Teachers are expected to devote a minimum of 25% of
instructional time to lab investigations to support the learning objectives in the course framework.
The AP Physics 2 Exam directly assesses the learning objectives of the course framework, which means
the inclusion of appropriate experiments aligned with
those learning objectives is important for student success. Teachers should select experiments that provide students with the broadest laboratory experience possible.
We encourage teachers to be creative in designing
their lab program while ensuring students explore and develop understandings of these core techniques.
After completion, students should be able to describe
how to construct knowledge, model (create an abstract
representation of a real system), design experiments, analyze visual data, and communicate physics.
Students should also develop an understanding of
how changes in the design of the experiments would
impact the outcome of their results. Many questions
on the AP Exam are written in an experimental context,
so these skills will prove invaluable for both concept comprehension and exam performance.
Getting Students Started
There are no prescriptive “steps” to the iterative process of inquiry-based investigations. However,
there are some common characteristics of inquiry that
will support students in designing their investigations.
Often, this simply begins with using the learning objectives to craft a question for students to
investigate. Teachers may choose to give students a list
of materials they are allowed to use in their design, or
require that students request the equipment they feel
they need to investigate the question. To use learning objectives when crafting questions, consider the
following points:
§§ Select learning objectives from the course framework that relate to the subject under study and  may set forth specific tasks, in the form of “Design an experiment to … .”
§§ Rephrase or refine the learning objectives that
align to the unit of study to create an inquiry-based investigation for students.
Students should be given latitude to make design modifications or ask for additional equipment
appropriate for their design. It is also helpful for
individual groups to report out to the class on their
basic design to elicit feedback on feasibility. Guided
student groups can proceed through the experiment,
with the teacher allowing them the freedom to make mistakes—as long as those mistakes don’t endanger
students or equipment or lead the groups too far off task. Students should have many opportunities for
post-lab reporting so that groups can understand the
successes and challenges of individual lab designs.

Communication, Group
Collaboration, and the
Laboratory Record
Laboratory work is an excellent means through which students can develop and practice communication skills. Success in subsequent work in physics
depends heavily on an ability to communicate about
observations, ideas, and conclusions. Students must
learn to recognize that an understanding of physics is
relatively useless unless they can communicate their
knowledge effectively to others. By working together
in a truly collaborative manner to plan and carry out
experiments, students learn oral communication skills and teamwork. Students must be encouraged to take
full individual responsibility for the success of the
collaboration and not be a sleeping partner ready to blame the rest of the team for failure.
After students are given a question for investigation,
they may present their findings either in a written or an
oral report to the teacher and the class for feedback
and critique on their final design and results. Students
should be encouraged to critique and challenge one another’s claims based on the evidence collected during the investigation.
Laboratory Safety
Giving students the responsibility for design of their own laboratory experience involves special responsibilities for teachers. To ensure a safe
working environment, teachers should first provide
the limitations and safety precautions necessary for potential procedures and equipment students may
use during their investigation. Teachers  should also
provide specific guidelines prior to students’ discussion on investigation designs for each experiment, so
that those precautions can be incorporated into the
final student-selected lab design and included in the
background or design plan in a laboratory record. It may
also be helpful to print the precautions that apply to
that specific lab as Safety Notes to place on the desk or
wall near student workstations. Additionally, a general
set of safety guidelines should be set forth for students
at the beginning of the course. The following is a list of possible general guidelines teachers may post:
§§ Before each lab, make sure you know and record the
potential hazards involved in the investigation, as
well as the precautions you will take to stay safe.
§§ Before using equipment, make sure you know the proper use to acquire good data and avoid damage to equipment.
§§ Know where safety equipment is located in the lab,
such as the fire extinguisher, safety goggles, and the first aid kit.
§§ Follow the teacher’s special safety guidelines as set forth prior to each experiment. (Students should
record these as part of their design plan for a lab.) §§ When in doubt about the safety or advisability of a procedure, check with the teacher before proceeding.
Teachers should interact constantly with students as
they work to observe safety practices and anticipate
and discuss with them any problems that may arise.
Walking among student groups, asking questions, and
showing interest in students’ work allows teachers to
take the pulse of what students are doing and maintain a watchful eye for potential safety issues.

Selecting and Using
Course Materials
Teachers will benefit from a wide array of materials
to help students become proficient with the science practices necessary to develop a conceptual understanding of the relationships, laws, and phenomena studied in AP Physics 2. In addition
to using a college-level textbook that will provide
required course content, students should have regular
opportunities to create and use data, representations,
and models. Rich, experimental investigation is the cornerstone of AP Physics 2, and diverse source
material allows teachers more flexibility in designing
the types of learning activities that will help develop the habits of thinking like a physicist.
Textbooks
While nearly all college-level physics textbooks address
the seven units of AP Physics 2, it’s important for
teachers to identify other types of secondary sources to supplement the chosen textbook accordingly,
ensuring that each of the seven topic areas, as well as
the science practices, receives adequate attention.
AP Central provides an example textbook list to help
determine whether a text is considered appropriate in meeting the AP Physics 2 Course Audit resource
requirement. Teachers can also select textbooks locally.

Guided Inquiry in AP Physics 2
The more active students are in their science
education, the more scientifically literate they will
become. Inquiry into authentic questions generated
from student experiences should be one of the central strategies when teaching AP Physics 2. By posing
questions, planning investigations, and reviewing what
is already known in light of experimental evidence,
students mirror how scientists analyze the natural
world. Inquiry requires identifying assumptions, using
critical and logical thinking, and considering alternative
explanations. Having students probe for answers to
scientific questions will lead to a deeper understanding of scientific concepts.

Different types of lessons, and therefore different
types of inquiry, are used throughout AP Physics 2.
There is a continuum from more student-centered types of inquiry to more teacher-centered types.
Understanding the different types of inquiry can help
teachers scaffold the types of labs and activities to better meet the needs of their students.
Below are four suggestions to make labs and activities more student-centered and inquiry-based:
§§ Start small: Take out the “data” or “results” section
from traditional labs. If the procedure is thorough and simple enough, students can read and design the data and/or results sections on their own.
§§ Tackle the procedure: Eventually, teachers will want
students to design their own experiments, but they may need some practice first. Remove the step numbers and shuffle the steps. Have students
work in pairs to put the steps into the correct order.
Next, try having them write a procedure as a pre-lab homework assignment, and then work together as
a class to develop it further, making sure that the question, variables, and safety are addressed.
§§ Try a goal-oriented task: Completely remove the procedure, and prompt students with a question that asks them to achieve something they want
to do. At this point, it’s best to choose a lab that students already understand conceptually and that uses simple, familiar equipment.
§§ Let them do the thinking: Students choose what
they will investigate. Facilitate (rather than walk them
through) their thought process without telling them
what to do. A pre-lab brainstorming session in small groups is helpful when having students develop a
question to investigate. It is important to provide students with some guidelines at this step. For example, students need to think about a question, a hypothesis, and materials before beginning an open-ended lab. Seeing and approving this in the lab groups helps boost students’ confidence.

Instructional Strategies
The AP Physics 2 course framework outlines the concepts and science practices
students must master in order to be successful on the AP Exam. To address those
concepts and science practices effectively, it helps to incorporate a variety of
instructional approaches into daily lessons and activities. Teachers can help their
students develop the science practices by engaging them in learning activities
that allow them to apply their understanding of course concepts. Teachers may
consider the following strategies as they plan instruction. Please note they are listed
alphabetically and not by order of importance or instruction.
Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Activity
Ask the Expert
Students are assigned as “experts” on problems they have mastered. Groups rotate through the expert stations to learn about problems they have not yet mastered.
Students share their knowledge and learn from one another.
In Unit 7, assign students as “experts” on atomic, quantum, or nuclear questions. Have them rotate through stations in groups, working with the station expert to justify a set of claims with corresponding physical laws as evidence.
Bar Chart
Bar chart tasks have histograms for one or more quantities. Frequently, histograms are given before and after some physical process with one bar left off. Students are asked to complete the bar chart by supplying the value for the missing quantity. This is a new type of representation, requiring students to translate between whatever other representation they are using and this one. Bar chart tasks are usually quite productive in helping students make meaning.
Bar chart tasks help students make meaning by asking them to translate between before and after some physical process.
This strategy can be used with conservation laws.
Students can define the system and then create bar charts for before and after some event. For example, have students create an energy bar chart for a ball rolling down an incline. Have them identify the system and then create one set of charts for the top of the incline and a separate set of charts for the bottom of the incline.

Changing
Representations
These tasks require students to translate from one representation (e.g., an electric field diagram) to another (e.g., an equipotential curves or surfaces diagram). Students often learn how to cope with one representation without really learning the role and value of representations and their relationship to problem solving. Getting them to go back and forth between/among different representations for a concept forces them to develop a more robust understanding of each representation.
Among the representations that will be employed at times are mathematical relationships, so this task can serve as a bridge between conceptual understanding and traditional problem solving.
Students create pictures, tables, graphs, lists, equations, models, and/or verbal expressions to interpret text or data. This helps organize information using multiple ways to present data and answer a question or show a problem’s solution.
As students learn about energy conservation in circuits, ask them to move between different representations of circuits.
For example, if given a sketch of a simple circuit, have students create a circuit diagram, a set of equations using Kirchhoff’s rules, and a graph of potential around the circuit.
Students should be able to move freely between these representations as well as use them for evidence in support of claims.
Concept-Oriented
Demonstration
These tasks involve an actual demonstration but with the students doing as much of the description, prediction, and explanation as possible. Although the demonstration should produce results students don’t expect, students should nonetheless feel comfortable making predictions about what will happen.
Involving an actual demonstration, students are asked to predict and explain.
Although most students will already know the outcome, the “soda can crushing” experiment can be demonstrated in Unit 2 to challenge students to explain how and/or why the phenomena occurred in terms of physical laws and theories.
Conflicting
Contentions
Conflicting contentions tasks present students with two or three statements that disagree in some way, and students decide which contention they agree with and explain why.
These tasks are very useful for contrasting statements of students’ alternate conceptions with physically accepted statements. This process is facilitated in these tasks because they can be phrased as “Which statement do you agree with and why?” rather than asking which statement is correct or true. These tasks complement the “What if Anything Is
Wrong?” tasks.
These tasks help contrast statements of students’ alternate conceptions with physically accepted statements.
This strategy is useful for helping students begin to understand how to write a full argument. By providing the arguments and having students identify strong and weak claims, evidence, and reasoning, teachers can help scaffold the instruction of good argumentation for their students.

Construct an
Argument
Students use mathematical reasoning to present assumptions about mathematical situations, support conjectures with mathematically relevant and accurate data, and provide a logical progression of ideas leading to a conclusion that makes sense.
Helps in developing the process of evaluation of mathematical information, developing reasoning skills, and enhancing communication skills in supporting conjectures and conclusions.
This strategy can be used with word problems that do not lend themselves to immediate application of a formula or mathematical process. The teacher can provide distance and velocity graphs that represent a motorist’s behavior through several towns on a map and ask students to construct a mathematical argument either in defense of or against a police officer’s charge of speeding, given a known speed limit.
Create a Plan
Students analyze the tasks in a problem and create a process for completing the tasks by finding the information needed, interpreting data, choosing how to solve a problem, communicating the results, and verifying accuracy.
Assists in breaking tasks into smaller parts and identifying the steps needed to complete the entire task.
When scaffolding for how to design an experiment, a good first step is assigning small groups to analyze the tasks necessary to design the experiment.
Have students identify the steps needed to answer the question by collecting and analyzing data. Included in this discussion is a plan for what to do with the collected data.
Debriefing
Students discuss the understanding of a concept to lead to a consensus on its meaning.
Helps clarify misconceptions and deepen understanding of context.
In order to discern the difference between average velocity and instantaneous velocity, have students roll a ball down a simple ramp and measure the distance the ball travels over time every second for five seconds.
While plotting position versus time and sketching a curve of best fit, students can discuss how they might determine the average velocity of the ball over the five seconds and then the instantaneous velocity of the ball at several points. A discussion in which students address the distinction between the ball’s velocity between two points and its velocity at a single point helps in clarifying the concept and mathematical process.

Desktop
Experiment
Tasks (DETs)
These tasks involve students performing a demonstration at their desks (either in class or at home) using a predict-and-explain format.
After doing the experiment, students “reformulate,” or reconsider, their previous explanations in light of what happened. DETs are narrow in scope, usually qualitative in nature, and typically use simple equipment.
Students are presented with a small desktop experiment and asked to use the apparatus provided to answer a given question.
Direct Measurement Videos make excellent “desktop” experiments. They can include small experiments with magnets, syringes (to experiment with force and pressure), lenses/mirrors, diffraction gratings, fur, balloons, etc.
Discussion
Groups
Students work within groups to discuss content, create problem solutions, and explain and justify a solution.
Aids in understanding through the sharing of ideas, interpretation of concepts, and analysis of problem scenarios.
Once students learn all methods of problem solving and can choose which is the most appropriate given a particular situation, have them discuss in small groups (no writing) why a specific method should be used over another.
Friends
Without Pens
Students are given a free-response problem, quiz, or challenging problem.
“Friends Without Pens” takes place
in two rounds: The first round is the timed “Friends Without Pens” round, in which students are grouped together and can discuss—but not write about—the question. At the end of the time, students return to their desks for the “Pens Without
Friends” round, where they tackle the assignment in the traditional, independent sense.
This can be a scaffolding tool if students are being introduced to a new type of assignment or a particularly difficult or challenging
AP-level question.
Have students identify, with their peers, adequate claims, evidence, and reasoning. After discussing their various claims, have students return to their desks and develop a complete argument.
Four-Square
Problem Solving
Students are given some sort of situation, perhaps one that came from a traditional plug-and-chug problem.
They then divide a sheet of paper into four quadrants. In each quadrant, the student(s) are to put some representation of what is going on in the problem. Possible representations include motion maps or graphs, free-body diagrams, energy bar graphs, momentum bar graphs, mathematical models (equations with symbols), well-labeled diagrams, or written responses (two to three strong, clear sentences).
Re-expressing or re-representing data is a key skill necessary for student success in AP Physics 2.
This task scaffolds the needed practice for students to get into the habit of creating and using representations to make claims and answer questions.
In Unit 4, students can regularly and repeatedly do four-square problem solving tasks about circuits. The key representations can include a circuit diagram, a circuit sketch, an energy bar chart, or a graph of potential around the circuit.

Graph and Switch
Students generate a graph (or sketch of a graph) to model a certain function and then switch calculators (or papers) to review each other’s solutions.
Allows students to practice creating different representations of functions as well as giving and receiving feedback on each other’s work.
As students learn about
PV graphs, they can graph pressure versus volume for different processes (isobaric, isochoric, adiabatic, and isothermal).
Have students individually graph and explain how their graphs support claims.
After, have them share their steps with a partner and exchange feedback on their graphs, claims, evidence, and reasoning.
Graphic
Organizer
Students use visual representation for the organization of information.
Builds comprehension and facilitates discussion by representing information in visual form.
To determine the work done on or by a gas and the change in internal energy (and the heat) from a PV graph, have students construct a sign table to help them keep track of their logic as they think through the different processes represented.
Have them mark where the heat, work, and internal energy increases, decreases, or remains the same. This process also works well in circuits when switches are opened/closed or when bulbs are removed/added.
Identify Subtasks
Students break a problem into smaller pieces with outcomes leading to a solution.
Helps organize the pieces of a complex problem and reach a complete solution.
Another scaffolding
technique: When first exposing students to AP-level questions that involve several steps of reasoning and logic, additional questions can be added to help guide students to the final claim, evidence, and reasoning. For example, ask students to sketch a free-body diagram, discuss the system, and/or draw energy bar charts. After completing the first few units, students should be able to identify (first in groups and then individually) what the subtasks would be (free-body diagram, etc.) to start thinking about the claim, evidence, and reasoning.

Marking the Text
Students highlight, underline, and/or annotate text to focus on key information to help understand the text or solve the problem.
Helps the student identify important information in the text and make notes in the text about the interpretation of tasks required and concepts to apply to reach a solution.
This strategy can be used with AP-level problems as well as problems from the textbook and sample laboratory procedures.
Have students read through the question, experimental design, or another student’s experimental design;
underline the pronouns, equipment, key information (i.e., the car begins at rest), etc., to identify important information and to be able to ask clarifying questions.
Meaningful,
Meaningless
Calculations
Students are presented with an unreduced expression for a calculation for a physical quantity describing a physical situation. They must decide whether the calculation is meaningful (i.e., it gives a value that tells us something legitimate about the physical situation) or is meaningless (i.e., the expression is a totally inappropriate use of a relation). These calculations should not be trivially meaningless, such as substituting a wrong numerical value into the expression. These items are best when the quantity calculated fits with students’ alternative conceptions.
Students are presented with an unreduced calculation for a physical calculation that involves a mathematical relationship, and students are asked if the calculation makes any sense.
These calculations can take many forms, but the most useful are those where the “meaningless” calculations illustrate common student misconceptions. For example, when calculating current through individual resistors, students might see sample calculations that use the voltage of the battery instead of the voltage across the individual resistor. Have students identify the calculation(s) that have physical meaning.
Ask students about a situation in which there is a uniform magnetic field of specified magnitude, directed toward the left, with an electron traveling parallel to the field at a speed of 300 m/s. Have students find the magnetic force acting on the electron as the product of the speed, the charge, and the magnitude of the field. Ask students if this a meaningful (or meaningless) calculation for this situation.

Model Questions
Students answer items from released
AP Physics Exams.
Provides rigorous practice and assesses students’ ability to apply multiple physical practices on content, either a multiple-choice or a free-response question.
Model questions can be
AP-released or AP-level questions. They can be given as is, or scaffolded for students earlier in the year to provide them with support.
Note Taking
Students create a record of information while reading a text or listening to a speaker.
Helps in organizing ideas and processing information.
Have students write down verbal descriptions of the steps needed to solve a problem so that a record of the processes can be referred to at a later point in time.
Predict and Explain
These tasks describe a physical situation that is set up at a point where some event is about to occur.
Students predict and explain what they think will happen. These tasks must have situations with which the students are familiar or have sufficient background information in to enable the students to understand the situation. This is important because otherwise students usually do not feel comfortable enough to attempt to answer.
Stimulates thinking by asking students to make, check, and correct predictions based on evidence from the outcome.
When a circuit is set up with a capacitor, bulb, and switch,
ask students: “What will happen to the brightness of the bulb when the switch is closed or opened? What happens immediately versus what happens after a long time? What would happen if the capacitor was replaced with a second bulb?”
Qualitative
Reasoning
These tasks can take a variety of forms, with their common denominator being qualitative analysis. Frequently, students are presented with an initial and final situation and asked how some quantity or aspect will change.
Qualitative comparisons (e.g., the quantity increases, decreases, or stays the same) are often the appropriate answer. Qualitative reasoning tasks can frequently contain elements found in some of the other task formats (e.g., different qualitative representations and a prediction or explanation).
Students are presented with a physical situation and asked to apply a principle to qualitatively reason out what will happen.
These questions are commonly found in other multiple-choice question subtypes.
Ask students what would happen to the image created by a convex lens if the object were moved farther from or closer to the lens or focal point.
Additional questions could include, “What happens if a second lens is added?” or “What would happen to the image if the whole experiment were put under water?” continued on next page

Quickwrite
Students write for a short, specific amount of time about a designated topic.
Helps generate ideas in a short amount of time.
To help synthesize concepts after having learned how to analyze single- and double-slit experiments, have students list as many ways as possible to change the interference pattern on the screen and explain how each change affects the pattern.
Ranking
A ranking task is an exercise that presents students with a set of variations—sometimes three or four but usually six to eight—on a basic physical situation. The variations differ in value (numeric or symbolic) for the variables involved but also frequently include variables that are not important to the task. The students’ task is to rank the variations on the basis of a specified physical quantity. Students must also explain the reasoning for their ranking scheme and rate their confidence in their ranking.
These tasks require students to engage in a comparison reasoning process that they seldom have opportunities to do in traditional problem solving.
Given six different arrows launched from the ground with different speeds at different angles, have students rank the arrows on the basis of the highest acceleration at the top, the longest time in the air, and the largest velocity at the top.
Sharing and Responding
Students communicate with another person or a small group of peers who respond to a proposed problem solution.
Gives students the opportunity to discuss their work with peers, make suggestions to improve the work of others, and/or receive appropriate and relevant feedback on their own work.
Group students to review individual work (graphs, derivations, problem solutions, experimental designs, etc.). Have the groups make any necessary corrections and build a single complete solution together.
Simplify the
Problem
Students use “friendlier” numbers or functions to help solve a problem.
Provides insight into the problem or the strategies needed to solve the problem.
Have students use resistors with resistances that add easily in parallel. Two resistors with resistances of 30 ohms and 60 ohms in parallel add nicely to 20 ohm total resistance for the combination.

Troubleshooting
Troubleshooting tasks are variations on “What if Anything Is Wrong?” tasks. Students are explicitly told that there is an error in the given situation.
Their job is to determine what the error is and explain how to correct it. These tasks can often produce interesting insights into students’ thinking, because they will, at times, identify some correct aspect of the situation as erroneous. Once again, this helps develop additional items.
Allows students to troubleshoot errors and misconceptions by focusing on problems that may arise when they do the same procedures themselves.
Give students a derivation or problem solution and ask them to find the incorrect step(s). Have them identify and explain the mistake or misunderstanding that led to the error. This can also be done with bar charts, diagrams, and other representations.
“What if
Anything Is
Wrong?”
Requires students to analyze a statement or diagrammed situation to determine if it is correct or not.
If everything is correct, the student is asked to explain the statement/ situation and why it works as described. If something is incorrect, the student has to identify the error and explain how to correct it. These are open-ended exercises, so they provide insights into students’ ideas, since they will often have interesting reasons for accepting incorrect situations and for rejecting legitimate situations. Often, students’ responses provide ideas for other items.
Allows students to troubleshoot errors and focus on problems that may arise when they do the same procedures themselves.
Give students a ray diagram that may or may not have incorrect rays drawn. Or, give them a sketch of a circuit and a corresponding circuit diagram and ask them to identify if the diagram matches the sketch. This technique can also be used in derivations and problem solving where students are given the “complete” solution and are asked to verify that it was done correctly.
Write and Switch
Like graph and switch, but with writing. Make observations or collect data or make a claim, and then switch papers.
Allows students to practice writing and both give and receive feedback on each other’s work.
As students learn about creating an argument, have them draft an initial argument themselves; share their claim, evidence, and reasoning with a partner;
and receive feedback on their argument.
Working
Backward
This task reverses the order of the problem steps. For example, the given information could be an equation with specific values for all, or all but one, of the variables. The students must then construct a physical situation for which the given equation would apply. Such working backward tasks require students to take numerical values, including units, and translate them into physical variables.
Working backward problems also require students to reason about these situations in an unusual way, and they often allow for more than one solution.
Provides another way to check possible answers for accuracy.
Give students an equation, such as ( ) ( ) 2 2 16 2 5 m m s s m t t − = − , and ask them to create another representation from this equation. For example, position versus time graphs, velocity versus time graphs, motion maps, etc., are all written scenarios that this equation represents.

Developing the
Science Practices
Throughout the course, students will develop and apply science practices that
are fundamental to the discipline of physics. Since these practices represent the
complex skills that adept physicists demonstrate, students will benefit from multiple
opportunities to develop them in a scaffolded manner. Through the use of guided
questioning, discussion techniques, and other instructional strategies, Teachers
can help their students apply these science practices in new contexts, providing an
important foundation for their college and career readiness.
Science Practice 1: Modeling
The student can use representations and models to communicate scientific phenomena and solve scientific problems.
The real world is extremely complex. When physicists
describe and explain phenomena, they try to simplify real objects, systems, and processes to make the
analysis manageable. These simplifications, or models, are used to predict how new phenomena will occur.
A simple model may treat a system as an object,
neglecting the system’s internal structure and behavior, while more complex models illustrate a system of objects, such as an ideal gas.
To create an accurate model, students must identify
a set of the most important characteristics of the phenomenon or system that may simplify analysis.
Inherent in the construction of models that physicists
invent is the use of representations, such as force
diagrams, graphs, energy bar charts, ray diagrams, and
circuit diagrams. Representations help in analyzing phenomena, making predictions, and communicating
ideas. AP Physics 2 requires students to use and/or
analyze and/or re-express models and representations of natural or man-made systems.
The table on the following page provides examples of
questions and instructional strategies for implementing modeling resources into the course.

Science Practice 2: Mathematical Routines
The student can use mathematics appropriately.
Physicists commonly use mathematical
representations to describe and explain phenomena,
as well as to solve problems. When students work with these representations, they should understand the
connections between the mathematical description, the
physical phenomena, and the concepts represented in
the mathematical descriptions. When using equations
or mathematical representations, students need to be
able to justify why using a particular equation to analyze
a particular situation is useful and to be aware of the conditions under which the equations/mathematical representations can be used.
The following table provides examples of questions and
instructional strategies for implementing mathematical resources into the course:

Instructional
Strategies 2.1 The student can justify the selection of a mathematical routine to solve problems.
§§ What quantities are given?
§§ What quantity is needed to answer the question?
§§ What relationship(s) link the needed quantities with the given quantities?
Have students work backward from a given mathematical routine to a physical situation.
For instance, give them an equation such as ( ) ( ) 2 2 16 2 5 m m s s m t t − = −

and ask them to create another representation—such as a written scenario about this equation, position versus time graphs, velocity versus time graphs, motion maps, etc.—from this equation.
§§ Working
Backward §§ Simplify the
Problem §§ Ask the Expert 2.2 The student can apply mathematical routines to quantities that describe natural phenomena.
§§ What laws, definitions, or mathematical relationships exist that relate the given problem?
§§ What are the rules, assumptions, or limitations surrounding the use of the chosen law, definition, or relationship?
§§ Did the calculation begin with an equation or a fundamental physics relationship, law, or definition?
§§ Are the steps clearly written out and annotated?
§§ Are any steps skipped?
§§ Is the unknown quantity clearly labeled as the final answer, complete with units?
Have students perform a task in which the calculations are already done—a task that will require them to focus on making important distinctions that physicists consider critical.
For example, have students determine whether a specified calculation is meaningful or meaningless. This is entirely different from plugging numerical values into an equation and turning the crank.
Meaningful/meaningless calculation tasks are another tool to get students to process information about a concept or principle in a different way.

Science Practice 3: Scientific Questioning
The student can engage in scientific questioning to
extend thinking or to guide investigations within the context of the AP course.
Research scientists pose and answer meaningful
questions. Students may easily miss this point since,
depending on how a science class is taught, it may seem that science is about compiling and passing
down a large body of known facts (e.g., the acceleration
of a free-falling object is 9.8 m/s2). Helping students
learn how to pose, refine, and evaluate scientific
questions is an important but difficult instructional
and cognitive goal. Students need to be guided away
from asking “fuzzy” questions about queries that can be
measured and tested. A first step in refining questions
might be to guide students to consider all the ways one
might measure relevant physical quantities, leading
to further discussions about how one would evaluate
questions by designing and carrying out experiments and then evaluating data and findings.
The following table provides examples of questions
and instructional strategies for implementing scientific questioning into the course:
Science Practice
Key Questions
Instructional Notes or Sample Activities
Instructional
Strategies 3.1 The student can pose scientific questions.
§§ What does it mean for a question to be “scientific”?
§§ How can questions be modified to make them testable?
Have students practice posing scientific questions by giving them opportunities to discuss what is scientifically measurable and determinable with certain laboratory equipment.
§§ Desktop
Experiment Tasks §§ Write and Switch 3.2 The student can refine scientific questions.
§§ How can scientific questions be modified to make them testable?
§§ How can a scientific question be refined concerning a proposed incorrect relationship between variables?
Have students practice engaging in scientific questioning by, for example asking questions about the relationships between pressure, temperature, and volume in an ideal gas. As a first step, students might consider the ways in which one can measure physical quantities relevant to the gas, leading to a discussion of pressure, temperature, volume, and number of gas particles (in moles). Follow-up discussions can lead to how one goes about evaluating questions such as, “Upon what does the pressure in an ideal gas depend?” by designing and carrying out experiments and then evaluating data and findings.
§§ Desktop
Experiment Tasks §§ Write and Switch §§ Predict and Explain 3.3 The student can evaluate scientific questions.
This science practice is not directly tested on the AP
Physics 2 Exam. However, through laboratory investigation, students need to be able to determine what makes a good scientific question. This is especially important if students are going to continue in their studies of science.

Science Practice 4: Experimental Methods
The student can plan and implement data collection
strategies in relation to a particular scientific question.
Scientific questions can range in scope, as well as in
specificity, from determining influencing factors and/ or causes to determining mechanism. The question
posed determines the type of data required, as well as
the plan for collecting data. Although class discussion can reveal issues of measurement uncertainty and assumptions in the data collection, designing and
improving experimental designs and/or data collection
strategies is a learned skill. Students must ultimately
understand that the results of collecting and using
data to determine a numerical answer to a question
are best thought of as an interval, not a single number.
This interval, the experimental uncertainty, is due to
a combination of uncertainty in the instruments used
and the process of taking the measurement. Detailed
error analysis is not necessary to convey this pivotal
idea; however, it is important that students make some
reasoned estimate of the interval within which they
know the value of a measured data point and express their results in a way that makes this clear.

instructional strategies for implementing data collection resources into the course:

Science Practice 5: Data Analysis
The student can perform data analysis and evaluation of evidence.
The analysis, interpretation, and application of
quantitative information are vital skills for students in
AP Physics 2. Analysis skills can be taught using any
type of data, so it’s critical that students are fluent in
pattern recognition and comfortable using models and representations.
Students often think that to make a graph, they need
to connect data points or that the best-fit function
is always linear. Thus, it is important that they can
construct a best-fit curve even for data that does not
fit a linear relationship. Students should be able to
represent data points as intervals with sizes dependent
on the experimental uncertainty. After students find a
pattern in the data, they need to ask why this pattern
is present and try to explain it using the knowledge
that they have. When dealing with a new phenomenon,
they should be able to devise a testable explanation
of the pattern, if possible. It is important that students understand that instruments do not produce exact measurements and must learn what steps they can
take to decrease uncertainty. Students should be able
to design a second experiment to determine the same
quantity and then check for consistency across the two
measurements, comparing the results by writing them
both as intervals and not as single, absolute numbers.
Finally, students should be able to revise their reasoning
based on the new data, data for some that may appear anomalous.

instructional strategies for implementing data analysis resources into the course:

Science Practice 6: Argumentation
The student can work with scientific explanations and theories.
A scientific explanation, accounting for an observed
phenomenon, needs to be experimentally testable. One
should be able to use it to make predictions about new phenomena. A theory—such as the kinetic molecular theory or atomic theory—uses a unified approach to account for a large set of phenomena and gives
accounts that are consistent with multiple experimental
outcomes within the range of applicability of the theory.
Understanding the difference between explanations and theories is essential.
Students should be prepared to offer evidence,
construct reasoned arguments based on that evidence,
and make a claim or provide an explanation to support
predictions. A prediction states that the expected
outcome of a particular experimental design is based on an explanation or a claim under scrutiny.
Physicists examine data and evidence to develop
claims about physical phenomena. As they articulate their claims, physicists use reasoning processes
that rely on their awareness of different types of
relationships, connections, and patterns within the data
and evidence. They then formulate a claim and develop
an argument that explains how the claim is supported
by the available evidence. AP Physics 2 teachers should help students learn how to create persuasive and
meaningful arguments by improving their proficiency with each of these practices.
The following table provides examples of strategies for
implementing argumentation resources into the course:

Strategies 6.1. The student can justify claims with evidence.
§§ What is evidence and how does it differ from reasoning?
Have students identify and explain the evidence that supports their claim, with an emphasis on how the evidence supports the claim.
Give students a question such as, “Which of the following is most responsible for … ?”
Students should analyze possibilities and the evidence for and against each position. Have students choose a position and write a defensible claim or thesis that reflects their reasoning and evidence.
§§ Conflicting
Contentions 6.2. The student can construct explanations of phenomena based on evidence produced through scientific practices.
§§ What possible claims could you make based on the question and the evidence?
§§ What is your purpose (to define, show causality, compare, or explain a process)?
§§ What evidence supports your claim?
§§ How does the evidence support your explanation?
Have students construct an explanation of physical phenomena based on evidence. A scientific explanation includes a claim, evidence, and reasoning. For example, have them construct an explanation of the inverse square dependence of the electric field surrounding a spherically symmetric, electrically charged object.

§§ What evidence is there that refutes the old scientific explanation or theory?
§§ What evidence is there that supports the new scientific explanation or theory?
§§ Are there still phenomena that cannot be explained by scientific explanation or theory?
Have students list and discuss reasons that a scientific explanation and/or theory was refined or replaced.
For example, have them explain why classical mechanics cannot describe all properties of objects by listing the reasons that classical mechanics must be refined and an alternative explanation developed when classical particles display wave properties.
§§ Discussion

§§ What reasoning (physical laws or theories) supports your claim?
§§ How does the reasoning support your claim?
§§ How does the evidence support your claim?
Use transitions such as because or therefore.
Have students make claims about a physical situation that is set up at a point where some event is about to occur. Next, have students predict what will happen in the situation and explain why they think that will occur.
For example, have students make claims and predictions about the net disturbance that occurs when two waves overlap (superposition).

Science Practice 7: Making Connections
The student is able to connect and relate knowledge
across various scales, concepts, and representations in and across domains.
Throughout the course, students will have opportunities
to transfer their learning across disciplinary boundaries
to link, synthesize, and apply the ideas they learn across the sciences and mathematics. Teachers are
encouraged to provide multiple contexts in which major
ideas facilitate transfer, allowing students to bundle
knowledge together with the multiple contexts to which
it applies. Students should also be able to recognize seemingly appropriate contexts to which major concepts and ideas do not apply.
The following table provides examples of questions
and instructional strategies for making connections throughout the course:

Strategies 7.1 The student can connect phenomena and models across spatial and temporal scales.
§§ What models and/or representations can help connect these phenomena with other phenomena?
§§ What important features of the models and/or representations connect the phenomena across spatial and temporal scales?
Have students practice connecting phenomena across spatial and temporal scales.
Problem solving in isolation of one unit will not prepare students for the AP Physics 2 Exam.
For example, have students connect representations between topics and big ideas.
Students should be able to make predictions about the scale of the physical situation to determine when a wave or particle model is more appropriate.

§§ How can the ideas used to explain this phenomenon be generalized to extrapolate across enduring understandings?
§§ How can the ideas used to explain this phenomenon be generalized to extrapolate across big ideas?
Have students practice connecting phenomena across domains and making generalizations across enduring understandings and big ideas.
For example, have students predict and explain, using representations and models, how waves can transfer energy around corners and behind obstacles by using diffraction as a property of waves, including with sound and light.

AP PHYSICS 2
Scoring Guidelines 1.
Students use a sample of gas to investigate the behavior of the pressure P of the gas at constant temperature T as the
volume V changes. The gas is in a cylinder with a movable piston and volume markings. Pressure and temperature probes
can be inserted into the cylinder. A hot water bath and a cold water bath are also available.
(A)	Describe a procedure that would allow the students to obtain data for the pressure P of the gas at constant temperature T as volume changes.
(B)	 One student suggests that the temperature probe is not needed. Is the student correct? Briefly explain your answer.
(C)	 Describe a method of analyzing the pressure and volume data that could be used to determine whether the gas is
ideal. Explicitly indicate the results of the analysis that would indicate an ideal gas.
The students are now given a sample of ideal gas in a similar container with a piston. They investigate the behavior
of the temperature T of the gas at known constant pressure P as the volume V changes. Their graph of the data, including a best-fit line, is shown below.

positive potential, and negative charges produce negative potential. The charges are equal, so all
charges produce the same magnitude of potential at the center. V3 is caused by a net of 3 positive
charges, V2 by 2 positives, V1 by 2 negatives, and V4 by 3 negatives.
