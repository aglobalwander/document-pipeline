Introduction
The Diploma Programme
The Diploma Programme is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19
age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and
inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to
develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The Diploma Programme model
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core (see figure 1). It encourages the
concurrent study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study two modern languages (or a modern
language and a classical language), a humanities or social science subject, an experimental science,
mathematics and one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma
Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance.
In each of the academic areas students have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can
choose subjects that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.

Language B guide 3
Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they
can, instead of an arts subject, choose two subjects from another area. Normally, three subjects (and
not more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB
recommends 240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than at SL.
At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of
the course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some element of coursework assessed by teachers.
The core of the Diploma Programme model
All Diploma Programme students participate in the three course elements that make up the core of the model.
Theory of knowledge (TOK) is a course that is fundamentally about critical thinking and inquiry into the
process of knowing rather than about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines the
nature of knowledge and how we know what we claim to know. It does this by encouraging students to
analyse knowledge claims and explore questions about the construction of knowledge. The task of TOK is to
emphasize connections between areas of shared knowledge and link them to personal knowledge in such a
way that an individual becomes more aware of his or her own perspectives and how they might differ from others.
Creativity, activity, service (CAS) is at the heart of the Diploma Programme. The emphasis in CAS is on
helping students to develop their own identities, in accordance with the ethical principles embodied in
the IB mission statement and the IB learner profile. It involves students in a range of activities alongside
their academic studies throughout the Diploma Programme. The three strands of CAS are creativity (arts,
and other experiences that involve creative thinking), activity (physical exertion contributing to a healthy
lifestyle) and service (an unpaid and voluntary exchange that has a learning benefit for the student).
Possibly, more than any other component in the Diploma Programme, CAS contributes to the IB’s mission to
create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect.
The extended essay, including the world studies extended essay, offers the opportunity for IB students to
investigate a topic of special interest, in the form of a 4,000-word piece of independent research. The area of
research undertaken is chosen from one of the students’ six Diploma Programme subjects, or in the case of
the inter-disciplinary world studies essay, two subjects, and acquaints them with the independent research
and writing skills expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally presented, structured
writing, in which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent manner, appropriate to
the subject or subjects chosen. It is intended to promote high-level research and writing skills, intellectual
discovery and creativity. An authentic learning experience, it provides students with an opportunity to
engage in personal research on a topic of choice, under the guidance of a supervisor.

Approaches to teaching and approaches to learning
Approaches to teaching and learning across the Diploma Programme refers to deliberate strategies,
skills and attitudes which permeate the teaching and learning environment. These approaches and
tools, intrinsically linked with the learner profile attributes, enhance student learning and assist student
preparation for the Diploma Programme assessment and beyond. The aims of approaches to teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme are to:
•
empower teachers as teachers of learners as well as teachers of content •
empower teachers to create clearer strategies for facilitating learning experiences in which students
are more meaningfully engaged in structured inquiry and greater critical and creative thinking •
promote both the aims of individual subjects (making them more than course aspirations) and linking
previously isolated knowledge (concurrency of learning) •
encourage students to develop an explicit variety of skills that will equip them to continue to be
actively engaged in learning after they leave school, and to help them not only obtain university
admission through better grades but also prepare for success during tertiary education and beyond •
enhance further the coherence and relevance of the students’ Diploma Programme experience •
allow schools to identify the distinctive nature of an IB Diploma Programme education, with its blend of idealism and practicality.
The five approaches to learning (developing thinking skills, social skills, communication skills, self management skills and research skills), along with the six approaches to teaching (teaching that is inquiry based, conceptually focused, contextualized, collaborative, differentiated and informed by assessment),
encompass the key values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy.
The IB mission statement and the IB learner profile
The Diploma Programme aims to develop in students the knowledge, skills and attitudes they will need
to fulfill the aims of the IB, as expressed in the organization’s mission statement and the learner profile.
Teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme represent the reality in daily practice of the organization’s educational philosophy.
Academic honesty
Academic honesty in the Diploma Programme is a set of values and behaviours informed by the attributes
of the learner profile. In teaching, learning and assessment, academic honesty serves to promote personal
integrity, engender respect for the integrity of others and their work, and ensure that all students have an
equal opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquire during their studies.
All coursework—including work submitted for assessment—is to be authentic, based on the student’s
individual and original ideas, with the ideas and work of others fully acknowledged. Assessment tasks that
require teachers to provide guidance to students, or that require students to work collaboratively, must be
completed in full compliance with the detailed guidelines provided by the IB for the relevant subjects.
For further information on academic honesty in the IB and the Diploma Programme, please consult the IB
publications Academic honesty in the IB educational context, Academic honesty in the Diploma Programme and
Diploma Programme: From principles into practice.
Specific information regarding academic honesty as it pertains to external and internal assessment
components of this Diploma Programme subject can be found in this guide.

Acknowledging the ideas or work of another person
Coordinators and teachers are reminded that candidates must acknowledge all sources used in work
submitted for assessment. The following is intended as a clarification of this requirement.
Diploma Programme candidates submit work for assessment in a variety of media that may include audio visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print or electronic sources. If a candidate uses
the work or ideas of another person, the candidate must acknowledge the source using a standard style of
referencing in a consistent manner. A candidate’s failure to acknowledge a source will be investigated by the
IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.
The IB does not prescribe which style(s) of referencing or in-text citation should be used by candidates; this
is left to the discretion of appropriate faculty/staff in the candidate’s school. The wide range of subjects,
three response languages and the diversity of referencing styles make it impractical and restrictive to insist
on particular styles. In practice, certain styles may prove most commonly used, but schools are free to
choose a style that is appropriate for the subject concerned and the language in which candidates’ work is
written. Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a given subject, it is expected that the
minimum information given includes: name of author, date of publication, title of source, and page numbers as applicable.
Candidates are expected to use a standard style and use it consistently so that credit is given to all sources
used, including sources that have been paraphrased or summarized. When writing text candidates must
clearly distinguish between their words and those of others by the use of quotation marks (or other method,
such as indentation) followed by an appropriate citation that denotes an entry in the bibliography. If an
electronic source is cited, the date of access must be indicated. Candidates are not expected to show faultless
expertise in referencing, but are expected to demonstrate that all sources have been acknowledged.
Candidates must be advised that audio-visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print
or in electronic sources that is not their own must also attribute the source. Again, an appropriate style of referencing/citation must be used.
Learning diversity and learning support requirements
Schools must ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided to
candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents:
•
Candidates with assessment access requirements •
Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes.

Introduction
Nature of the subject
Language acquisition
Language acquisition consists of two modern language courses—language ab initio and language B—that
are offered in a number of languages, and a classical languages course that is offered in Latin and Classical
Greek. Owing to the nature of language study in the latter, there are specific aims for classical literature that
can be found in the Classical languages guide. Language ab initio and language B are language acquisition
courses designed to provide students with the necessary skills and intercultural understanding to enable
them to communicate successfully in an environment where the language studied is spoken. This process
allows the learner to go beyond the confines of the classroom, expanding their awareness of the world and fostering respect for cultural diversity.
The two modern language courses—language ab initio and language B—develop students’ linguistic
abilities through the development of receptive, productive and interactive skills (as defined in the “Syllabus
content” section). The classical languages course focuses on the study of the language, literature and culture of the classical world.
Language B SL and language B HL
Language B is a language acquisition course designed for students with some previous experience of the
target language. In the language B course, students further develop their ability to communicate in the
target language through the study of language, themes and texts. In doing so, they also develop conceptual
understandings of how language works, as appropriate to the level of the course.
Most language B subjects are available at both SL and HL. A list of languages offered at language B SL and
HL is released each year in the Diploma Programme Assessment procedures.
Distinction between SL and HL
At both levels of language B (SL and HL), students learn to communicate in the target language in familiar
and unfamiliar contexts. They describe situations, narrate events, make comparisons, explain problems, and
state and support their personal opinions on a variety of topics relating to course content. The study of two
literary works originally written in the target language is required only at language B HL. The distinction
between language B SL and HL can also be seen in the level of competency the student is expected to
develop in the receptive, productive and interactive skills described below.
Language B SL
Receptive skills: Students understand a range of written and spoken authentic personal, professional and
mass media texts on topics of interest. They understand descriptions of events, feelings and wishes; they
understand comparisons and recognize a straightforward, linear argument. They use context to deduce the
meaning of sentences and unknown words and phrases.

=== Page 17 ===
Nature of the subject
Language B guide 7
Productive skills: Students write texts for a variety of purposes and make oral presentations on topics of
interest. They write descriptive texts and personal correspondence; they make comparisons, narrate stories,
provide detailed accounts, and express their thoughts and opinions on abstract or cultural topics.
Interactive skills: Students initiate and maintain the flow of conversations and discussions. They express
and respond to opinions and feelings on a variety of topics. They use and understand clear speech on a
variety of topics relating to course content and the culture(s) of the target language. Students use a variety
of strategies to negotiate meaning and foster communication.
Language B HL
At HL, students are expected to extend the range and complexity of the language they use and understand
in order to communicate. They continue to develop their knowledge of vocabulary and grammar, as well
as their conceptual understanding of how language works, in order to construct, analyse and evaluate
arguments on a variety of topics relating to course content and the target language culture(s).
Receptive skills: Students understand and evaluate a wide variety of written and spoken authentic
personal, professional and mass media texts; they understand fundamental elements of literary texts such
as theme, plot and character. They analyse arguments, distinguishing main points from relevant supporting
details and explanations. They use a variety of strategies to deduce meaning.
Productive skills: Students present and develop their ideas and opinions on a variety of topics, both
orally and in writing. They construct and support arguments with explanations and examples. They speak
and write at length, and with purpose, in order to meet a wide range of communicative needs: describing,
narrating, comparing, explaining, persuading, justifying, evaluating.
Interactive skills: Students initiate, maintain and close oral exchanges, displaying some ability to make
adjustments in style or emphasis. They use a variety of strategies to maintain the flow of conversations
and discussions on a variety of topics relating to course content and the culture(s) of the target language.
Students are adept in negotiating meaning and fostering communication.
Language B and the core
Teachers of language acquisition courses need to plan carefully to provide opportunities for students to
draw on their experiences in the core. Examples of how this might happen include:
•
transferring the critical-thinking process explored in TOK to the development of well-supported
arguments in written text types, such as a speech or report •
using personal knowledge gained from a CAS experience as a cultural comparison in an individual or
group oral activity, or as an example in a written response •
developing ideas for CAS activities as a result of themes and topics explored in a language acquisition class •
developing a research question for an EE that allows the deeper exploration of a language topic of special interest to the student •
using the opportunity to write an EE in the student’s language of study as a means of personal challenge and skills development.
The following section outlines the nature of the contributions that each element of the core can make to language acquisition lessons.

=== Page 18 ===
Nature of the subject
Language B guide 8
Language B and theory of knowledge
Theory of knowledge (TOK) is one of the three core elements of the Diploma Programme (DP). It plays a
special role in the programme by providing an opportunity for students to reflect on the fundamental
question of how they know what they know. It aims to help students become more aware of their own
perspective, as well as developing an awareness of multiple perspectives. More information on TOK can be found in the Theory of knowledge guide.
Language is itself one of the specific ways of knowing that is identified in the TOK course. In addition to
this explicit exploration of language, the skills and wider conceptual understandings that students develop
in TOK can make an extremely positive contribution to their study of language acquisition. TOK develops
higher-order thinking skills, such as analysis and evaluation, and also helps students to make connections
and comparisons across their subject areas and the DP core. In this way, language acquisition both supports and is supported by TOK.
As well as using the skills developed in TOK in acquiring an additional language, students will also benefit
from guiding questions that can connect TOK to the five themes of the language B curriculum. The following
discussion questions are examples and are not meant to be either prescriptive or exhaustive.
•
Is it possible to think without language?
•
What would be lost if the whole world shared one common language?
•
If people speak more than one language, is what they know different in each language?
•
Do you think maths, logic or music should be classified as languages?
•
In what ways can language be used to influence, persuade or manipulate people?
•
Does language describe our experience of the world, or does it actively shape our experience of the world?
•
How are metaphors used in the construction of knowledge?
•
To what extent is our perspective determined by our membership of a particular culture?
•
To what extent are we aware of the impact of culture on what we believe or know?
•
Is there anything that is true for all cultures?
Language B and creativity, activity, service
Creativity, activity, service (CAS) experiences can be associated with each of the subject groups of the DP.
CAS and language acquisition can complement each other in a variety of ways. Students can enhance
intercultural understanding through the active and purposeful use of their acquired language within
the specific real-life contexts provided by their CAS experiences. Students may also draw on their CAS
experiences to enrich their involvement in language acquisition both within and outside the classroom.
An important characteristic of the language acquisition courses is the conceptual understandings that
students develop. Through the five prescribed themes around which the language acquisition courses are
centred, students might be able to investigate, plan, act and reflect on CAS experiences and projects in a
more informed and meaningful way. Similarly, CAS experiences can ignite students’ passion for addressing
particular personal, local, national and global issues.
Language acquisition teachers can assist students in making links between their subjects and their CAS
experiences, where appropriate. This will provide students with relevance in both their subject learning and
their CAS learning through purposeful discussion and real experiences.
The challenge and enjoyment of CAS can often have a profound effect on language acquisition students,
who might choose, for example, to engage with CAS in the following ways.

=== Page 19 ===
Nature of the subject
Language B guide 9 •
As a CAS experience, a student can extend engagement with the language acquisition theme of “sharing
the planet” (for example, environment) by conducting a separate activity in learning the names of organic
and human-made materials in the target language. The student could then walk around the school to
collect human-made waste (for example, plastic) that is discarded during one day, and then display it.
•
In a series of CAS experiences relating to the language acquisition theme of “social organization” (for
example, social relationships, community, social engagement), a student interacts with elderly target
language speakers, over a number of visits, to collect sayings, idioms or adages used by the older
generations. These could then be shared in an article on the school or programme blog.
•
Students can develop a CAS project linked to the language acquisition theme of “experiences”
(for example, migration) in which they engage with members of a local refugee population. The
students could collaborate in an investigation of how migrants balance negotiating a new culture with
maintaining their cultural heritage. An outcome of this interaction could be the creation of a mural representing the cultural balance.
It is important to note that a CAS experience can be a single event or may be an extended series of events.
However, CAS experiences must be distinct from, and may not be included or used in, the student’s diploma course requirements.
Additional suggestions on the links between DP subjects and CAS can be found in the Creativity, activity, service teacher support material.
Language B and the extended essay
Writing an extended essay (EE) in a language of acquisition provides students with an excellent opportunity
to explore one aspect of their chosen language in greater depth and to increase their intercultural
understanding and international-mindedness. In line with the IB’s focus on approaches to teaching and
learning (ATL), the EE in a language of acquisition provides opportunities for students to develop their
thinking, research and self-management skills while, at the same time, focusing on an aspect of language
that is of particular personal interest and challenge.
Students must select one of the three distinct categories outlined below in order to develop a manageable
research question for their EE. A simplified summary, with examples, is provided in the table below. For full
details of requirements, teachers and students must refer to the Extended essay guide (first assessment 2018).
•
Category 1 (“language”) offers the opportunity to engage with a particular linguistic aspect in greater detail.
•
Category 2 (“culture and society”) allows the student to focus on one aspect of the target culture,
linked to either a linguistic detail or a cultural artifact, and complements perfectly the learner profile
for language acquisition, promoting reflection on the culture of the target language and the learner’s role in the linguistic community.
•
Category 3 (“literature”) provides an opportunity for students to explore one or more works of literature
in order to widen their understanding of the target language and culture from a literary angle.

Language acquisition and international-mindedness
International-mindedness is central to the IB philosophy and instrumental in aspiring to a more peaceful
world. Language acquisition courses do not have as their only goal the development of language skills, but
also fostering intercultural understanding and global engagement. The nature of the language acquisition
process supports international-mindedness and is, in turn, supported by it. The flexibility of IB course design
allows language acquisition teachers to incorporate ideas and resources that encourage students to view
aspects of the language and culture from different (and sometimes differing) perspectives, to make non judgmental comparisons of language and culture, and to view language and culture in a global context.
International-mindedness also provides opportunities for students to progress in the development
of IB learner profile traits. Through exposure to, examination of, and reflection on, texts from cultures
other than their own, students nurture their curiosity (inquirers), engage with issues and ideas of global
significance (knowledgeable), use critical-thinking skills (thinkers) and listen carefully to the perspectives
of other individuals and groups (communicators). They learn to show respect for the dignity and rights of
people everywhere (principled), critically appreciate the values and traditions of others (open-minded), show
empathy, compassion and respect (caring), recognize their interdependence with other people and the world
in which they live (balanced), consider the world thoughtfully (reflective) and explore new ideas (risk-takers).
Engaging with sensitive topics
All language acquisition courses will provide the opportunity to engage with a broad range of texts, stimuli
and scenarios that address topics of personal, local or national and global significance. Such work may well
raise issues that challenge learners intellectually, personally and culturally. Engagement with these topics,
whether intentional or incidental, can be opportunities for development of IB learner profile traits. Teachers
should help learners to approach such materials in a sensitive, responsible and reflective manner, bearing
in mind the IB’s mission and its commitment to international-mindedness and intercultural respect within
the context of the course. Consideration should also be given to the personal and social values of others.
As part of the collective consideration of the school, language acquisition students must be supported
in maintaining an ethical perspective during their course. Schools must make every reasonable effort to
encourage students to respond appropriately (without seeking to offend), to promote respect for their
peers and to consider the environment in all their actions.

=== Page 21 ===
Nature of the subject
Language B guide 11
In selecting texts and preparing materials and tasks for language acquisition courses, teachers are reminded
to consider the cultural environment and the make-up of the student body, in order to act as role models in
demonstrating an awareness of, and sensitivity to, deeply held personal and community values.
Prior learning
Students enter language acquisition courses with varying degrees of exposure to the target language(s).
It is, therefore, important that students are placed into a course that is most suited to their language
development needs and that will provide them with an appropriate academic challenge. For those students
entering DP language acquisition from the Middle Years Programme (MYP), table 1 in the “Language
acquisition across the IB continuum” section of the MYP Language acquisition guide provides indications that can be useful for appropriate placement.
Further placement guidance can be drawn from the study Benchmarking Selected IB Diploma Programme
Language Courses to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. This study suggests that
students already at CEFR A2 or B1 in the target language can comfortably take language B SL. Students
already at CEFR B1 or B2 can comfortably take language B HL.
Links to the Middle Years Programme
The MYP is designed for students aged 11 to 16 and, as an integral part of the IB continuum, can directly
lead into the DP. MYP language acquisition provides students with opportunities that prepare them for a DP
language acquisition course through the following shared aims.
•
Developing communication skills in an additional language •
Developing insights into the features, processes and craft of language, and the concept of culture,
encouraging students to see that there are diverse ways of living, behaving and viewing the world •
Developing intercultural understanding and global engagement, leading to international-mindedness •
Providing opportunities for learning through inquiry and the development of critical- and creative thinking skills •
Fostering curiosity and a desire for lifelong learning •
Understanding and respecting other languages and cultures
As with the DP, the MYP holistically addresses students’ intellectual, social, emotional and physical well being, and provides students with opportunities to develop the knowledge, attitudes and skills they need in
order to manage complex ideas and issues, and take responsible action for the future. The MYP requires the
study of at least two languages to support students in understanding their own cultures and those of others.
Additionally, the MYP helps to prepare students for further education, the workplace and lifelong learning.
These courses also provide the opportunity to develop language skills and learn about language through
the conceptual understandings of communication, connections, creativity and culture. The range of
conceptual understandings, and factual and procedural knowledge that language acquisition students
encounter throughout the MYP, can be directly transferred and developed in DP language acquisition
courses, as can related concepts such as audience, purpose, meaning and context.
Learning takes place within contexts relevant to the student, whether personal, local, national, international
or globally significant. This approach—using a range of learning contexts in the MYP—is directly extended
through the five prescribed themes of DP language acquisition courses: identities; experiences; human
ingenuity; social organization; sharing the planet.

Links to the IB Career-related Programme
The IB Career-related Programme (CP) is a framework of international education that incorporates the vision
and educational principles of the IB into a unique programme specifically developed for students who wish
to engage in career-related learning. The CP’s flexible educational framework allows schools to meet the
needs, backgrounds and contexts of students, and is especially relevant for language acquisition.
The core of the CP enables students to enhance their personal and interpersonal development, with an
emphasis on experiential learning. One of the components of the CP core is language development, which
ensures that all CP students have access, and are exposed, to an additional language that will enable them
to use the language they have studied, encourage intercultural awareness and gain personal fulfilment.
Students are encouraged to begin or extend the study of an additional language that suits their needs,
background and context. A minimum of 50 hours is expected to be devoted to language development. CP
students must complete a language development portfolio to the satisfaction of the school.
One of the ways in which students can undertake language development in the CP is with an extension to
their DP language acquisition course. This could be done through a school-designed language development
course, through an external provider of language development or through monitored self-directed study.
It is essential that the content of the provision of language development is an extension to the DP language
acquisition coursework, if both are based on the same target language. The content and outcomes of the
extension course may be tailored to the career-related studies of the students, if so desired.
The CP documents Language development guide, General regulations: Career-related Programme, and
Language development teacher support material provide further guidance regarding language acquisition
and language development. More information about the CP can be found on the CP website, which can be accessed through the programme resource centre.

Assessment objectives
The following assessment objectives are common to both language B and language ab initio. The level
of difficulty of the assessments, and the expectations of student performance on the tasks, are what
distinguishes the three modern language acquisition courses.
1.
Communicate clearly and effectively in a range of contexts and for a variety of purposes.
2.
Understand and use language appropriate to a range of interpersonal and/or intercultural contexts and audiences.
3.
Understand and use language to express and respond to a range of ideas with fluency and accuracy.
4.
Identify, organize and present ideas on a range of topics.
5.
Understand, analyse and reflect upon a range of written, audio, visual and audio-visual texts.

Figure 2
In the language B course, students develop the ability to communicate in the target language through the
study of language, themes and texts. In doing so, they also develop conceptual understandings of how
language works. Communication is evidenced through receptive, productive and interactive skills across a
range of contexts and purposes that are appropriate to the level of the course.
The study of language requires careful attention to forms, structures, functions and conceptual
understandings of language. Knowledge of vocabulary and grammar—the what of language—is reinforced
and extended by understanding the why and how of language: audience, context, purpose, meaning.
Students expand the range of their communication skills by understanding and producing a wide variety of
oral and written texts for audiences, contexts and purposes associated with academic and personal interests.
For the development of receptive skills, language B students must study authentic texts that explore the
culture(s) of the target language. In addition, the study of two literary works is required at HL.
A key aim of the language B course is to develop international-mindedness through the study of language,
culture, and ideas and issues of global significance. Explicit links to TOK strengthen the ability to communicate
in the target language by increasing students’ self-awareness as inquirers in their own language learning
process. As appropriate to the level of the course, communication skills are reinforced through the other
categories of approaches to learning skills: thinking, research, social and self-management skills.
The recommended teaching time is 240 hours to complete HL courses and 150 hours to complete SL courses,
as stated in the document General regulations: Diploma Programme (2016: 6, article 8.2).

Themes
Prescribed themes
Five prescribed themes are common to the syllabuses of language B and language ab initio; the themes
provide relevant contexts for study at all levels of language acquisition in the DP, and opportunities for
students to communicate about matters of personal, local or national, and global interest.
The five prescribed themes are:
• identities • experiences • human ingenuity • social organization • sharing the planet.
The themes allow students to compare the target language and culture(s) to other languages and cultures
with which they are familiar. The themes also provide opportunities for students to make connections to
other disciplinary areas in the DP. Students and teachers of language B with experience of the Primary Years
Programme (PYP) or the MYP will recognize that the themes are inspired by the transdisciplinary themes
of the PYP and the global contexts of the MYP. In this way, the DP language B course can enhance the
continuity of the educational experience of long-standing IB students, while also being suitable for students who are new to the IB.
Recommended topics
The five prescribed themes must all be addressed equally in the language B course; beyond that, teachers
are free to work with the themes in a way that best helps them to organize a course plan and build upon
students’ interests in the target language and its cultures, and that best helps students to meet the
expectations of the syllabus with regard to language and texts.
The following lists of recommended topics for each theme are appropriate for students to achieve the
aims and objectives of the course. The recommended topics are to be considered indicative content, not
prescribed content, for the language B course. The themes are prescribed, but the recommended topics
and possible questions for each theme are not prescribed.

Language B guide 21
For the purposes of teaching and learning in a language acquisition course, the language B and language
ab initio syllabuses organize written, visual, audio and audio-visual texts into three broad categories:
personal, professional and mass media texts. The guiding principle for using texts in the DP language
acquisition courses is to develop students’ receptive, productive and interactive skills in the target language
by focusing their attention on the ways in which good communicators consider the audience, context and
purpose of what they want to say or write in the process of choosing and developing an appropriate text type to convey a message.
Teachers should provide frequent opportunities for students to understand and use a variety of text types
in relation to the prescribed themes and related course content. The categories are described below, and
the table that follows provides examples of text types for each category. The examples shown are neither prescriptive nor exhaustive.
Personal texts
Personal texts are shared by the person creating the message and an audience who may be family members,
friends or groups with a common interest; a personal text may also be directed to oneself. Personal texts
tend to be characterized by attention to the everyday interests or the affective needs of individuals rather
than the analysis of information. Personal texts have a variety of functions including, but not limited to,
describing, narrating, entertaining, recommending and persuading. The level of formality in the register of
these texts will vary according to the linguistic and sociocultural norms of the target language.
Professional texts
Professional texts are created for an intended audience in contexts where no personal relationship is
assumed between the producer of the text and the recipient(s); however, the producer of the text can
assume that the recipient(s) will have an interest in receiving and understanding the message. Professional
texts tend to be characterized by attention to the cognitive needs of individuals, the transfer of knowledge
and the logical presentation of information; these texts employ clear, factual language and a formal register.
Professional texts have a variety of functions including, but not limited to, informing, instructing, explaining,
analysing, convincing, interpreting and evaluating.
Mass media texts
Mass media texts are created for distribution to a large audience that is targeted because of an interest that,
at least initially, lies primarily with the producer of the text, since the person or entity responsible for a mass
media text has no way of knowing exactly who will take the time and interest to understand the message
or who will ignore it. Mass media texts tend to be characterized by the need of the producer of the text to
project authority, desirability or exclusivity, and the conscious choice of a particular medium or technology
that is appropriate to reach the targeted audience. The level of formality in the register of these texts will
vary according to the linguistic and sociocultural norms of the target language.

* Teachers are reminded that the study of at least two literary texts (originally written in the target language)
is compulsory for language B at HL, and that one of the literary texts studied during the course must serve
as the stimulus for the individual oral assessment at HL.
Literature
Reading literature in the target language can be an enjoyable journey into cultures where the target
language is spoken. Literature can exemplify one or more of the prescribed themes of the language B
course, and can help students to broaden their vocabulary and use language to express opinions and
explore ideas. Reading literature helps students to develop fluent reading skills as they progress from
comprehension to interpretation and inference. Literature is also an especially appropriate vehicle for
promoting the development of international-mindedness, which is a key aim of the DP language acquisition courses.
The use of literary works to develop students’ receptive and productive skills is encouraged at all levels of
language acquisition in the DP; however, in terms of formal requirements of the syllabus and assessment
outline, the study of two literary works originally written in the target language is a requirement at
HL in language B. HL students are expected to understand fundamental elements of the literary works
studied, such as themes, plot and characters. It must be emphasized that literary criticism is not an objective

=== Page 33 ===
Syllabus content
Language B guide 23
of the language B course; literary criticism lies within the remit of the DP studies in language and literature
courses. In language acquisition courses, specifically language B HL, literature is intended as a stimulus for
ideas to be explored, principally through oral assessment.
The term “literary works” refers to works of prose fiction, prose non-fiction, poetry and drama. When
choosing literary works, teachers should consider carefully how to use literature in relation to one or more
of the prescribed themes, and they should also bear in mind the interests and general language proficiency
of their students. The term “literary text” refers to an extract from a complete literary work, for example, a
scene from a play, several paragraphs from a novel or a single poem from a larger collection.
As with any resources used in the classroom, literary works should be chosen in order to allow students to
achieve the aims and objectives of the course, be culturally relevant to the target language and linguistically
accessible for language acquisition students. Literary works that feature a high degree of linguistic
complexity, arcane language or an enigmatic subject matter are not appropriate in the DP language
acquisition classroom context. Works in translation or “easy reader” versions of literary texts are not helpful
for students to achieve the aims and objectives of the course and must be avoided.
Conceptual understanding
Concerning the importance of “significant content” that allows students to develop both disciplinary and
interdisciplinary understandings, the document What is an IB education? states that “Each of the four IB
programmes provides a detailed and developmentally appropriate curriculum or curriculum framework
that is broad, balanced, conceptual and connected.” The explicit integration of conceptual understanding
into the curriculum focuses on “powerful organizing ideas that are relevant across subject areas” (2013, updated June 2015, May 2017: 5).
All DP language programme subject groups promote a vision of learning in which the development of
language skills and conceptual understandings of language are complementary to each other, so that the total
learning experience of the student is as robust as possible. Thus, DP students become more accomplished
communicators in the languages they study when their abilities to read, write and speak about course content
are reinforced and extended by an understanding of why and how people use language to communicate.
In particular, the approach to developing conceptual understandings of language in the DP languages
programme is designed using the following guiding principles.
•
DP students with experience of the PYP or the MYP are provided with frequent opportunities to
develop further their conceptual understandings of language (PYP) or their understanding of the key
and related concepts in the MYP language and literature and language acquisition courses.
•
DP students are encouraged to apply what they already know about other languages and cultures—
through formal study or personal experience—in order to enhance their overall learning process.
•
DP students are encouraged to consider broad questions about language and culture, as appropriate
to their course of study, in order to develop international-mindedness and increase their self awareness as inquirers in their own learning process.
Conceptual understanding in language acquisition courses
For language acquisition courses, it is important to note that the approach presented here for developing
conceptual understanding recognizes that DP students are not beginning students, even when they are
beginning learners of a language or do not demonstrate a high level of language proficiency. At all levels of
language acquisition, therefore, DP students are encouraged to make use of the thinking, communication
and research skills they have developed over years of experience in school, and to transfer those skills to
the target language at the pace—and within the contexts and for the purposes—that their language skills development will allow.

=== Page 34 ===
Syllabus content
Language B guide 24
Certain conceptual understandings of language are fundamental to successful communication and should
be developed in all DP language acquisition courses. Following the description of each are some stimulus
questions that may encourage exploration of these conceptual understandings while calling attention to
language skills. Teachers should feel free to use or adapt these questions—or create their own questions—
for use in class so that they are comprehensible to students and relevant to course content. It is important
to note that these are not questions for examination papers; rather, they are included in the syllabus as
a tool for teachers to use in order to encourage students to think about language and culture as part of their
language study in the DP and, in doing so, to become more effective and knowledgeable communicators.
•
Audience: Students understand that language should be appropriate for the person(s) with whom one is communicating.
Stimulus questions –
How can the perceived needs and interests, or previous knowledge, of the recipients of a text influence its production?
–
How would the language used in a given text need to change if the same basic message needed to be communicated to a different audience?
•
Context: Students understand that language should be appropriate to the situation in which one is communicating.
Stimulus questions –
How does the situation or setting influence the production or reception of a text?
–
How is the relationship between the producer and the recipient(s) of a text (or the relationship of
interlocutors in a conversation) reflected in language use?
•
Purpose: Students understand that language should be appropriate to achieve a desired intention, goal or result when communicating.
Stimulus questions –
When I read or listen to a text, what helps me to understand the intention of the person who produced the text?
–
When I need to communicate for a specific reason, how do I plan my message and language use in order to achieve my goal?
•
Meaning: Students understand that language is used in a range of ways to communicate a message.
Stimulus questions –
How are literal and figurative (non-literal) language used by producers of texts to create desired effects?
–
What does the producer of a text do to make the message clear (or, on the contrary, to make it
ambiguous) when there is no opportunity for the recipient(s) to reply to the text?
•
Variation: Students understand that differences exist within a given language, and that speakers of a
given language are generally able to understand each other.
Stimulus questions –
How or why does a language change over time, across geographical boundaries or from one social or cultural group to another?
–
What does it mean to say that aspects of a text are “lost in translation” from one language to another?

Principles of course design
The IB recognizes that, owing to differences in language teaching traditions, it might be easier for the
teachers of particular languages to find textbooks to suit their specific language. However, should
appropriate textbooks not be available, the syllabus has been designed to allow teachers the freedom to
construct their own course of study and schemes of work based on a range of texts linked to one or more
of the prescribed themes in the syllabus. Teachers must use authentic materials as much as possible in the
classroom, as this is necessary in order for students to meet the expectations of the course. This includes
exposing students to the full range of varieties of the target language, both in written and spoken form,
so that students become familiar with different accents as well as significant differences in vocabulary
and structures. Such language experiences will encourage students to become open-minded, reflective
communicators with a heightened sense of international-mindedness.
In designing a language B course of study, teachers should pay particular attention to three important
principles: variety, integration and transparency.
Variety
Teachers should ensure that their students:
•
develop their receptive, productive and interactive skills in the target language through a wide range of individual, pair and group activities in class •
practise the target language through a wide range of individual, pair and group tasks •
are introduced to the full range of text types appropriate to the level of the course •
are exposed to a range of regional and national accents.
Integration
In order to integrate all the relevant aspects of the course and to encourage autonomy, it is necessary for
teachers to help their students develop strategies for dealing with unfamiliar situations and unfamiliar
language. To achieve this, teachers should provide:
•
an environment that promotes the use of the target language in the classroom and prepares the
students to communicate in a variety of contexts and for a variety of purposes that are appropriate to the level of the course •
authentic and modified authentic materials for study that have originally been produced for everyday users of the target language.
Teachers should also ensure that their course provides opportunities for students to:
•
move easily from one language skill to another (for example, a discussion after reading a text) •
interact in the target language through active participation in oral exchanges, by both listening and
speaking, or responding to a text, either in writing or orally •
consider and explore links with other disciplinary areas in the DP and with the TOK course •
reinforce their communication skills by using the other categories of approaches to learning skills:
thinking, research, social and self-management skills •
be involved in the selection of materials to be studied.

=== Page 36 ===
Syllabus content
Language B guide 26
Teachers are reminded that no single part of the syllabus—language, themes, texts, conceptual
understandings—is an end in itself, but that all parts should complement each other and must be integrated
in the course design. The ability of students to communicate in the target language should be developed
through the study of materials that reflect the culture(s) concerned. This consideration also applies to the selection of literary works for language B HL.
Transparency
Teachers must ensure that their students are given clear information about the aims and objectives, the
syllabus requirements and the assessment criteria for the course. Students should be made aware of what
is expected of them regarding classwork and homework, as well as receiving regular feedback on their progress throughout the course.

Language B guide 27
Assessment
Assessment in the Diploma Programme
General
Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most important aims of assessment in the DP
are that it should support curricular goals and encourage appropriate student learning. Both external and
internal assessments are used in the DP. IB examiners mark work produced for external assessment, while
work produced for internal assessment is marked by teachers and externally moderated by the IB.
There are two types of assessment identified by the IB.
•
An integral component of ATL, formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is
concerned with providing accurate and helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of
learning taking place and the nature of students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop
students’ understanding and capabilities. Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching
quality, as it can provide information to monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives.
•
Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring student achievement.
The DP primarily focuses on summative assessment designed to record student achievement at, or towards,
the end of the course of study. However, many of the assessment instruments can, and should, also be
used formatively during the course of teaching and learning. A comprehensive assessment plan is viewed
as being integral with teaching, learning and course organization. For further information, see the IB
Programme standards and practices document.
The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not norm-referenced. This approach to
assessment judges students’ work by their performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, and
not in relation to the work of other students. For further information on assessment within the DP, please
refer to the publication Diploma Programme assessment: Principles and practice.
To support teachers in the planning, delivery and assessment of the DP courses, a variety of resources can
be found on the programme resource centre. Additional publications, such as specimen papers and the
corresponding markschemes, teacher support materials, subject reports and grade descriptors, can also be
found on the programme resource centre. Past examination papers and the corresponding markschemes
are made available for purchase through the IB store.
Methods of assessment
The IB uses the following methods to assess work produced by students.
Assessment criteria
Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended. Each criterion concentrates on
a particular skill that students are expected to demonstrate. An assessment objective describes what
students should be able to do, and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do it. Using
assessment criteria allows discrimination between different answers and encourages a variety of responses.

=== Page 38 ===
Assessment in the Diploma Programme
Language B guide 28
Each criterion comprises a set of hierarchically ordered level descriptors. Each level descriptor is worth one
or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The maximum marks for each
criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are added
together to give the total mark for the piece of work.
Markbands
Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance against which responses are judged.
They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds
to a range of marks to differentiate student performance. A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which
particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.
Analytic markschemes
Analytic markschemes are prepared for those examination questions that expect a particular kind of
response and/or a given final answer from students. They give detailed instructions to examiners on how to
break down the total mark for each question for different parts of the response.
Marking notes
For some assessment components marked using assessment criteria, marking notes are provided. Marking
notes give guidance on how to apply assessment criteria to the particular requirements of a question.
Inclusive assessment arrangements
Inclusive assessment arrangements are available for candidates with assessment access requirements.
These arrangements enable candidates with diverse needs to access the examinations and demonstrate
their knowledge and understanding of the constructs being assessed.
The IB document Candidates with assessment access requirements provides details on all the inclusive
assessment arrangements available to candidates with learning support requirements. The IB document
Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes outlines the position of the IB with regard to candidates
with diverse learning needs in the IB programmes. For candidates affected by adverse circumstances, the
IB documents General regulations: Diploma Programme and Diploma Programme Assessment procedures provide details on access considerations.
Responsibilities of the school
Schools must ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided to
candidates with learning support requirements, in line with the IB documents Candidates with assessment
access requirements and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes.
The documents Meeting student learning diversity in the classroom and The IB guide to inclusive education: a
resource for whole school development are available to support schools in the ongoing process of increasing
access and engagement by removing barriers to learning.

Paper 1: Productive skills—writing
Duration: 1 hour 15 minutes
Weighting: 25%
Paper 1 is based on the five themes: identities, experiences, human ingenuity, social organization, sharing the planet.
This examination is externally set and externally assessed. It consists of a choice from three tasks with a
variety of audiences, contexts and purposes. Each task is based on a different theme from the syllabus.
Students write a response of 250–400 words to one of the tasks, choosing a text type from among those listed in the examination instructions.
The aim of this component is to assess the ability to communicate in writing for a variety of purposes. In
order to fulfill the requirements of this assessment component, students need to show, through their use of
text type, register and style, that they understand the concepts of audience, context, purpose, meaning and
variation, and can apply them to their written language.
Paper 1 assesses the degree to which students are able to:
•
communicate clearly and effectively in a range of contexts and for a variety of purposes •
understand and use language appropriate to a range of interpersonal and/or intercultural contexts and audiences

=== Page 42 ===
External assessment
Language B guide 32 •
understand and use language to express and respond to a range of ideas with fluency and accuracy •
identify, organize and present ideas on a range of topics.
Students’ factual knowledge of topics within the themes will not be tested; however, it can be used to
support any ideas that the student wishes to communicate.
Paper 2: Receptive skills—listening and reading
Duration: 1 hour 45 minutes
Weighting: 50% (25% listening comprehension, 25% reading comprehension)
Paper 2 is based on the five themes: identities, experiences, human ingenuity, social organization, sharing the planet.
This examination is externally set and externally assessed. It is divided into two separate sections: listening
(three audio passages) and reading (three written passages) covering different topics drawn from the five
themes. The students’ understanding of the six passages is assessed in this examination; it does not test
the students’ knowledge of any factual content of a specific topic. All audio and written passages are in the
target language and all answers must be provided in the target language.
Note: International-mindedness is central to the IB philosophy. It is expected that students will
have been exposed to a variety of texts, both oral and written, that demonstrate linguistic variation
and regional accents. Linguistic variation and regional accents appearing in texts used for external
assessment are intended to reflect this expectation while also being comprehensible to the students.

External assessment details—HL
Paper 1: Productive skills—writing
Duration: 1 hour 30 minutes
Weighting: 25%
Paper 1 is based on the five course themes: identities, experiences, human ingenuity, social organization, sharing the planet.
This examination is externally set and externally assessed. It consists of a choice from three tasks with a
variety of audiences, contexts and purposes. Each task is based on a different theme from the syllabus.
Students write a response of 450–600 words to one of the tasks, choosing a text type from among those listed in the examination instructions.
Although the general format of paper 1 at HL resembles that of paper 1 at SL, it must be stressed that the
nature of the tasks set will require more complex language and structures, as well as demanding higher-order
thinking skills such as analysis, evaluation, synthesis and interpretation. The higher word range has been
provided in order to accommodate the more complex responses required at this level.
The aim of this component is to assess the ability to communicate in writing for a variety of purposes. In
order to fulfill the requirements of this assessment component, students need to show, through their choice
of text type, register and style, that they understand the concepts of audience, context, purpose, meaning
and variation, and can apply them to their written language.
Paper 1 assesses the degree to which students can:
•
communicate clearly and effectively in a range of contexts and for a variety of purposes •
understand and use language appropriate to a range of interpersonal and/or intercultural contexts and audiences •
understand and use language to express and respond to a range of ideas with fluency and accuracy •
identify, organize and present ideas on a range of topics.
Students’ factual knowledge of topics within the themes will not be tested; however, it can be used to
support any ideas that the student wishes to communicate.
Paper 2: Receptive skills—listening and reading
Duration: 2 hours
Weighting: 50% (25% listening comprehension, 25% reading comprehension)
Paper 2 is based on the five themes: identities, experiences, human ingenuity, social organization, sharing the planet.
This examination is externally set and externally assessed. It is divided into two separate sections: listening
(three audio passages) and reading (three written passages) covering different topics drawn from the five
themes. The students’ understanding of the six passages is assessed in this examination: it does not test
the students’ knowledge of any factual content of a specific topic. All audio and written passages are in the
target language and all answers must be provided in the target language.
Note: International-mindedness is central to the IB philosophy. It is expected that students will
have been exposed to a variety of texts, both oral and written, that demonstrate linguistic variation
and regional accents. Linguistic variation and regional accents appearing in texts used for external
assessment are intended to reflect this expectation while also being comprehensible to the students.

Assessment
Internal assessment
Purpose of internal assessment
Internal assessment is an integral part of the course and is compulsory for both SL and HL students. It
enables students to demonstrate the application of their skills and knowledge in a different setting. In
language B, the internal assessment takes the form of the individual oral assessment. The development
of skills for the individual oral assessment should be woven into normal classroom teaching, although the
evidence submitted for moderation must come from an individual oral assessment, which is a separate activity conducted towards the end of the course.
The internal assessment requirements at SL and at HL are different.
Internal assessment is compulsory for both SL and HL students. SL students are required to make
an individual presentation with clear links to the target culture(s) in response to a visual stimulus,
whereas HL students will respond to a literary extract. At both levels, students will then go on to
engage in a one-to-one discussion with the teacher, firstly on the topic of the stimulus and then in
general conversation across the range of themes listed in the syllabus.
Guidance and authenticity
When carrying out the individual oral assessment, students may not bring into the preparation room any
additional resources such as computers, mobile phones, class notes, dictionaries (either online or paper),
copies of texts, and so on. Schools must provide students with a piece of paper on which to make brief
working notes (a maximum of 10 bullet points) during the preparation time. These notes are the only
resource that may be brought into the interview room and are to be used for reference only. They are not to
be read aloud and must be retained by the teacher at the end of the interview.
It is the responsibility of the teacher to ensure that students are familiar with:
•
the linguistic requirements of the individual oral assessment • the procedures for the conduct of the examination • the assessment criteria.
It is essential that SL students do not have prior knowledge of the visual stimulus to be presented, nor
can they know in advance from which themes their choices will be drawn. HL students must not know in
advance which literary extracts will be selected by the teacher for use in the individual oral assessment. For
both SL and HL students, the presentation in part 1 must be wholly the work of the student and it may not
be written out in full and read aloud. Authenticity may be checked by scrutiny of the notes (if any) used by
the student, as well as through the follow-up questions in part 2 of the individual oral assessment.

=== Page 51 ===
Internal assessment
Language B guide 41
Group work
Group work cannot be used as the final summative assessment submitted to the IB as the internal assessment
individual oral. However, group work, as one aspect of a wide range of approaches to teaching and learning,
may well be incorporated as one type of formative assessment used throughout the course.
Time allocation
Internal assessment contributes 25% to the final assessment in both the SL and the HL courses. This
weighting should be reflected in the time that is allocated to helping students develop the knowledge, skills
and understanding required to carry out speaking tasks. The development of oral communication skills
must be evenly interspersed throughout the course and should include:
•
time for students to develop their oral communication skills •
time for one-to-one interaction between the teacher and each student so that the student becomes
comfortable communicating in the target language with the teacher •
time for students to review and monitor their own progress, and for teachers to offer feedback •
time for the teacher to explain to students the requirements of the internal assessment.
Requirements and recommendations
The internal assessment is to be conducted entirely in the target language. The final internal assessment,
for which marks will be submitted, must not be rehearsed as this would not reflect the student’s true
ability to interact in the target language; however, the procedures and characteristics of the individual oral
assessment can, and should, be practised during lessons, as should the development of verbal interaction between student and teacher.
Each student’s individual oral assessment must be audio recorded and the files must be of high quality. Each
recording is to be retained according to the procedures set out in Diploma Programme Assessment procedures.
Samples of the internal assessment selected for moderation must be submitted in the form of an audio file.
Using assessment criteria for internal assessment
For internal assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion has
level descriptors describing specific achievement levels, together with an appropriate range of marks. The
level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure to reach certain
minimum requirements may be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL against the criteria using the level descriptors.
•
The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL, although the level descriptors for each
criterion in each course are designed to reflect the degree of difficulty and complexity expected for
that level. Therefore, close attention should be paid to the wording of each level.
•
The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that describes the student’s performance most
accurately, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be made
when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion across several different levels. The mark
awarded should be the one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion.
It is not necessary for every single aspect of a level to be met for a corresponding mark to be awarded.

=== Page 52 ===
Internal assessment
Language B guide 42 •
When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors for each criterion until
they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the standard of the work being assessed. If
a piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the
one that more appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.
•
Where there are two or more marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper marks
if the student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent and the work is close to
matching the descriptors in the level above. Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s
work demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent and the work is closer to matching the descriptor in the level below.
•
Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.
•
Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but rather should concentrate on
identifying the descriptor that best matches the student’s work for each assessment criterion.
•
The highest level descriptors do not imply a faultless performance; they should be achievable by a
language acquisition student. Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes of the mark range if
they are appropriate descriptions of the work being assessed.
•
A student who is awarded a mark in a high level in relation to one criterion will not necessarily reach
high levels in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a student who is awarded a mark in a low level for
one criterion will also not necessarily be placed in low levels for the other criteria. Teachers should not
assume that the overall assessment of the students will produce any particular distribution of marks.
•
Teachers are expected to make the assessment criteria available to students and ensure that they understand them.
Internal assessment details—SL
Interactive skills: Individual oral assessment
Duration: 12–15 minutes (plus 15 minutes for preparation)
Weighting: 25%
The individual oral assessment is based on the course themes: identities, experiences, human ingenuity, social organization, sharing the planet.
The aim of this assessment is to measure the student’s ability to understand and produce communication in
the target language, and to use it for successful interaction.
The individual oral assesses the degree to which the student is able to:
•
communicate clearly and effectively in a range of contexts and for a variety of purposes •
understand and use language appropriate to a range of interpersonal and/or intercultural contexts and audiences •
understand and use language to express and respond to a range of ideas with fluency and accuracy •
identify, organize and present ideas on a range of topics •
understand, analyse and reflect within the context of presentation and conversation.
The language B SL individual oral assessment is divided into three parts, preceded by a timed period of supervised preparation.

=== Page 53 ===
Internal assessment
Language B guide 43
Supervised preparation time
The student is shown two visual stimuli, each relating to a different theme from the course.
Each visual stimulus must be labelled in the target language with the theme to which it relates.
The student chooses one of the visual stimuli and prepares a presentation directly related to the stimulus. During this time, the student is allowed to make brief working notes.
15 minutes
Part 1: Presentation
The student describes the visual stimulus and relates it to the relevant theme and the target culture(s).
3–4 minutes
Part 2: Follow-up discussion
The teacher engages the student on the theme presented in part 1, expanding on what the student has provided in the presentation.
4–5 minutes
Part 3: General discussion
The teacher and student have a general discussion on at least one additional theme taken from the five themes around which the course is based.
5–6 minutes
Preparation
The teacher selects a range of visual stimuli linked to the five themes studied during the course and labels
each one in the target language according to theme. For the purposes of the SL individual oral assessment,
a “visual stimulus” may be a photo, a poster, an illustration or an advertisement. Any language that naturally
appears on the image should be minimal and must be in the target language. It must not provide vocabulary
and structures that would give a student an unfair advantage.
An effective visual stimulus is one that:
•
is clearly relevant to one of the five themes in the course • is culturally relevant to the target language •
offers opportunities for students to demonstrate their international-mindedness •
offers sufficient visual text for students to describe a scene or situation •
allows the student to offer a personal interpretation •
enables the teacher to lead the student in a wider conversation •
is relevant and of interest to the student’s age group.
The students must not see these stimuli prior to the examination.
The same five stimuli can be used for up to ten students sitting the examination. If there are more than ten
students sitting the examination, two visual stimuli from each theme must be prepared.
The following table provides an example of how the teacher may choose to distribute the visual stimuli to
ensure that each student receives two stimuli, each relating to a different theme. Teachers may wish to have
two copies of each stimulus available in the event that examination site arrangements require a student to
be in the “supervised preparation” phase at the same time as a different student is sitting parts 1–3 of the examination.

=== Page 54 ===

Language B guide 44
Up to 10 students 5 stimuli total (1 from each theme)
Up to 20 students 10 stimuli total (2 from each theme)
Up to 30 students 10 stimuli total (2 from each theme)
Up to 40 students 10 stimuli total (2 from each theme)

The letters above indicate the theme of the visual stimuli. For example, A1 would represent the first visual
stimulus relating to one of the themes (for example, “sharing the planet”) and A2 would represent the
second visual stimulus relating to that same theme (“sharing the planet”). Following this pattern, B1 would
represent the first visual stimulus relating to a different theme (for example, “experiences”) and B2 would
represent the second visual stimulus from that same theme (“experiences”).
Please note that each student sitting the examination will be shown only two stimuli from which to select. In the
event that more than 40 students are sitting the examination, the teacher will be allowed to re-sort these same ten
visual stimuli into new pairings, but must ensure that the stimuli used in each pair do not relate to the same theme.
Conduct of the individual oral assessment
The timing of the 15-minute preparation period begins when the student is presented with clean copies of
each of the two stimuli (from two different themes) from which to choose the one stimulus they would like
to use for the individual oral assessment. After choosing the stimulus, the student has the remainder of the
15 minutes to prepare the presentation. During this preparation time, the student may write brief working
notes (a maximum of 10 bullet points). These notes may be used for reference only and must not be read aloud as a prepared speech.
During the preparation time, the student must be supervised. The student may not have access to course
materials, class notes, dictionaries (in any form), computers, mobile phones or other IT equipment. The
student must be given a blank sheet of paper on which to make up to 10 notes in bullet-point form. The
visual stimulus and any notes that have been made in the 15 minutes of preparation time for the individual
oral assessment are to be collected and retained by the teacher.
Presentation
As schools are required to keep coursework submissions anonymous, students are asked to avoid using their
names or any other identifying information in their presentations. During the presentation, the student should:
•
provide a brief description of the visual stimulus •
relate the visual stimulus to the relevant theme from the course • make clear links to the target culture(s) •
express his or her opinions on the ideas implied in the visual stimulus.
The presentation must be spontaneous and relate specifically to the content of the visual stimulus provided;
pre-learned presentations on generic aspects of a course theme that do not directly focus on the ideas in
the visual stimulus provided will not score high marks. Students who do not make clear links to the target
culture(s) will not score full marks for Criterion B1.
In order to reassure students and help them focus on the requirements of the individual oral assessment, the
teacher should signal the changes between the respective parts through the use of an appropriate phrase.

=== Page 55 ===
Internal assessment
Language B guide 45
The presentation should last 3–4 minutes, during which time the teacher should avoid interrupting
the student, unless it is clear that guidance is needed. At four minutes, if the student has not drawn the
presentation to a close, the teacher is expected to interrupt the presentation and make the transition to the
second part of the individual oral assessment, using a phrase such as: “I’m sorry to interrupt, but we need to
move on now”. This exact phrase does not need to be used, but it is good practice for teachers to prepare
their students before the day of the examination so that a necessary interruption in order to adhere to timings does not unduly disturb the student.
Follow-up discussion based on the visual stimulus
Following the student’s presentation, the teacher initiates a discussion by asking questions about the theme
represented by the visual stimulus. These questions should:
•
seek clarification or extension of observations made by the student in the presentation •
invite the student to interpret and evaluate ideas presented by the visual stimulus and the teacher •
encourage connections and comparisons with the student’s other cultural experiences •
provide the student with opportunities to demonstrate his or her understanding and appreciation of the target language culture(s) •
encourage the student to engage in authentic conversation to the best of his or her ability.
This section of the individual oral assessment should last 4–5 minutes and should offer the student the
opportunity to demonstrate the ability to engage in authentic discussion on a topic. The teacher should
ask open-ended questions in order to offer the student the opportunity for authentic engagement, thus
facilitating an assessment of the student’s interactive skills.
General discussion
The teacher should signal that they are moving to the final section of the individual oral assessment in order
to prepare the student for the change of theme. The teacher may use a phrase such as “Let’s move on to the
final section of the exam. First of all, I’d like to talk with you about [theme]”. This section lasts 5–6 minutes
and should:
• introduce at least one additional theme •
seek clarification or extension of observations made by the student in relation to the additional theme(s) broached •
invite the student to interpret and evaluate ideas that arise in the general discussion •
encourage connections and comparisons with the student’s other cultural experiences •
provide the student with opportunities to demonstrate their understanding and appreciation of the target language culture(s) •
encourage the student to engage in authentic conversation to the best of his or her ability •
allow an assessment of the student’s interactive skills.
Administration of the individual oral assessment •
The individual oral assessment for language B SL should last a minimum of 12 minutes and a maximum
of 15 minutes. Examiners will be instructed to stop listening after 15 minutes. The individual oral
assessment must be scheduled during the final year of the course.
•
Students must be given adequate notice of when the individual oral assessment is to take place. It
may take place in or out of the classroom, but care should be taken to ensure that students are not
disturbed by external distractions such as school bells and announcements, people entering the
room, or any audible or visual distractions from outside the room.

=== Page 56 ===
Internal assessment
Language B guide 46 •
Students must not take mobile phones and other IT equipment into the examination room.
•
Audio recordings of the individual oral assessment will be required for external moderation. However,
the samples selected for moderation will not be identified until the teacher’s marks are entered into
IBIS; therefore, it is vital that all students are recorded and that the recordings are of a high quality.
•
Under no circumstances should a recording be stopped or modified in any way.
•
Timings for the individual oral assessment are approximate, but should be adhered to as much as
possible without disturbing the student. It is imperative that all three sections are adequately addressed.
•
The teacher is encouraged to interact with the student to facilitate an authentic discussion, but must avoid dominating the exchange.
The teacher’s role in conducting and assessing the individual oral assessment
It is the teacher’s responsibility to:
•
be aware that the purpose of the individual oral assessment is to assess the student’s ability to
produce, understand and interact using spoken language •
ensure that the correct number and range of visual stimuli are prepared for the individual oral
assessment and that an accurate record is kept of the allocation •
have a very clear understanding of the format of the individual oral assessment as well as the assessment criteria •
ensure that the questions asked are adapted to the student’s ability and are designed to give the
student every opportunity to show the full extent of the student’s language skills •
rephrase a question or statement, if a student is having difficulty understanding, in order to support
the student and maintain the flow of the conversation •
avoid correcting the student or dominating the conversation •
ensure that students are allowed sufficient time to respond to questions.

Internal assessment details—HL
Interactive skills: Individual oral assessment
Duration: 12–15 minutes (plus 20 minutes for preparation)
Weighting: 25%
The individual oral assessment is based on an extract of up to approximately 300 words taken from one of
the literary works studied in class as part of the language B HL course.
The aim of this assessment is to measure the student’s ability to understand and produce communication in
the target language, and to use it for successful interaction.
The individual oral assesses the degree to which the student is able to:
•
communicate clearly and effectively in a range of contexts and for a variety of purposes •
understand and use language appropriate to a range of interpersonal and intercultural contexts •
understand and use language to express and respond to a range of ideas with fluency and accuracy •
identify, organize and present ideas on a range of topics •
understand, analyse and reflect within the context of presentation and conversation.
The language B HL individual oral assessment is divided into three parts, preceded by a timed period of supervised preparation.
Supervised preparation time
The student is shown two extracts of up to approximately 300 words each: one from each of the two literary works studied during the course.
The student chooses one of the extracts and prepares a presentation focused on the content of the extract. During this time, the student is allowed to make brief working notes.
20 minutes
Part 1: Presentation
The student presents the extract. The student may place the extract in relation to the literary work, but must spend the majority of the presentation discussing the events, ideas and messages in the extract itself.
3–4 minutes
Part 2: Follow-up discussion
The teacher engages with the student on the content of the extract that the student has presented, expanding on observations that the student has provided in the presentation.
4–5 minutes
Part 3: General discussion
The teacher and student have a general discussion using one or more of the five themes of the syllabus as a starting point.
5–6 minutes

=== Page 61 ===
Internal assessment
Language B guide 51
Preparation
The teacher selects a range of extracts of up to approximately 300 words each, taken from both of the
literary works studied in class. The extracts need to be copied onto plain paper and labelled to indicate
which literary work is the source for each (title and author). Students must not simply be shown the relevant
page(s) in a copy of the literary work as the student may wish to mark up the extract in order to be better
able to discuss the content. In order to support the student, the extract needs to allow the student to use
a wide range of grammatical structures and provide opportunities to stimulate discussion following the presentation.
An effective literary extract is one that:
•
is easy to identify from one of the literary works studied in class •
offers opportunities for the student to demonstrate intercultural understanding •
allows the student to engage with the scene or situation in the extract •
allows the student to offer a personal interpretation of the extract •
enables the student to actively engage with the teacher in a conversation about the extract •
enables the teacher to ask questions that are unique to each student.
The number of different extracts to be selected for the individual oral assessment will depend on the
number of students in the class, but this need not exceed six extracts in total (three from each literary work).
The table below is an example of how the teacher may choose to distribute the literary extracts to ensure
that each student receives two extracts, one from each of the two literary works studied during the course.
Up to 4 students 4 extracts total (2 from each work) 5 or more students 6 extracts total (3 from each work)

A2 + B1 3
A1 + B3 4
A2 + B2 4
A2 + B1 5
A2 + B2 6

The letters A and B above indicate from which literary work the extract was chosen. For example, A1 would
represent the first extract from the first literary work and B1 would represent the first extract from the
second literary work. Following this pattern, A2 would represent the second extract from the first literary
work, and B2 would represent the second extract from the second literary work.
Please note that each student sitting the examination will be shown only two extracts from which to select.

=== Page 62 ===
Internal assessment
Language B guide 52
Conduct of the individual oral assessment
The student must not know in advance which extracts will be used in the individual oral assessment. The
timing of the 20-minute preparation period begins when the student is presented with clean copies of the
two extracts (one from each of the two literary works studied) from which to choose one. After choosing
the extract, the student has the remainder of the 20 minutes in which to prepare a presentation on the
extract, focusing principally on the events, characters, ideas and messages within the allocated extract.
During the preparation time, the student must be supervised. The student may not have access to course
materials, class notes, copies of the literary works studied, dictionaries (in any form), mobile phones,
computers or any other IT equipment. The student must be given a blank sheet of paper on which to make
up to 10 notes in bullet-point form. These notes may be used for reference only and must not be read aloud
as a prepared speech as part of the exam. Any notes that have been made in the 20 minutes of preparation
for the individual oral assessment, as well as the copy of the extract, are to be collected in by the teacher at the end of each student’s interview.
Presentation
As schools are required to keep coursework submissions anonymous, students are asked to avoid using their
names or any other identifying information in their presentations. During the presentation, the student
should:
• summarise the extract •
briefly relate the extract to the literary work as a whole •
express his or her opinions on the characters, events, ideas and themes presented in the extract.
The presentation must relate specifically to the content of the extract provided. Pre-rehearsed presentations
on generic aspects of a literary work or presentations in the style of a “book review” that do not directly
focus on the content of the extract provided are not the objective of this exercise.
The presentation should last 3–4 minutes, during which time the teacher should avoid interrupting
the student, unless it is clear that guidance is needed. At four minutes, if the student has not drawn the
presentation to a close, the teacher is expected to interrupt the presentation and make the transition to the
second part of the individual oral assessment, using a phrase such as: “I’m sorry to interrupt, but we need to
move on now.” This exact phrase does not need to be used, but it is good practice for teachers to prepare
their students before the day of the examination so that a necessary interruption in order to adhere to timings does not unduly disturb the student.
Follow-up discussion based on the literary extract
Following the student’s presentation, the teacher initiates a discussion by asking questions about various
aspects of the literary extract. These questions should:
•
seek clarification or extension of observations made by the student in the presentation •
invite the student to interpret and evaluate ideas presented by the extract or the teacher •
encourage connections and comparisons with the student’s other cultural experiences, as appropriate •
provide the student with opportunities to demonstrate understanding and appreciation of the target language culture(s) •
encourage the student to engage in authentic conversation to the best of his or her ability.
This section of the individual oral assessment should last 4–5 minutes and should offer the student the
opportunity to demonstrate the ability to engage in authentic discussion on a topic. The teacher should
ask open-ended questions in order to offer the student the opportunity for authentic engagement, thus
facilitating an assessment of the student’s interactive skills.

=== Page 63 ===
Internal assessment
Language B guide 53
General discussion
The teacher should signal that they are moving to the final section of the individual oral assessment in order
to prepare the student for the change to a general discussion. This section lasts 5–6 minutes and should:
•
use one or more of the course themes as a starting point •
seek clarification or extension of observations made by the student in relation to the additional theme(s) broached •
invite the student to interpret and evaluate ideas that arise in the general discussion •
encourage connections and comparisons with the student’s other cultural experiences •
provide the student with opportunities to demonstrate their understanding and appreciation of the target language culture(s) •
encourage the student to engage in authentic conversation to the best of his or her ability •
allow an assessment of the student’s interactive skills.
Administration of the individual oral assessment •
The individual oral assessment for language B HL should last a minimum of 12 minutes and a maximum
of 15 minutes. Examiners will be instructed to stop listening after 15 minutes. The individual oral
assessment must be scheduled during the final year of the course.
•
Students must be given adequate notice of when the individual oral assessment is to take place. It
may take place in or out of the classroom, but care should be taken to ensure that students are not
disturbed by external distractions such as school bells and announcements, people entering the
room, or any audible or visual distractions from outside the room.
•
Students must not take mobile phones and other IT equipment into the examination room.
•
Audio recordings of the individual oral assessment will be required for external moderation. However,
the samples selected for moderation will not be identified until the teacher’s marks are entered into
IBIS; therefore, it is vital that all students are recorded and that the recordings are of a high quality.
•
Under no circumstances should a recording be stopped or modified in any way.
•
Timings for the individual oral assessment are approximate, but should be adhered to as much as
possible without disturbing the student. It is imperative that all three sections are adequately addressed.
•
The teacher is encouraged to interact with the student to facilitate an authentic discussion, but must avoid dominating the exchange.
The teacher’s role in conducting and assessing the individual oral assessment
It is the teacher’s responsibility to:
•
be aware that the purpose of the individual oral assessment is to assess the student’s ability to understand and speak the language •
ensure that the correct number and range of literary extracts are prepared for the individual oral
assessment and that an accurate record is kept of the allocation •
have a very clear understanding of the format of the individual oral assessment as well as the assessment criteria •
ensure that the questions asked are adapted to the student’s ability and are designed to give the
student every opportunity to show the full extent of the student’s language skills •
rephrase a question or statement, if a student is having difficulty understanding, in order to support
the student and maintain the flow of the conversation •
avoid correcting the student or dominating the conversation •
ensure that students are allowed sufficient time to respond to questions.

Approaches to teaching and learning
Approaches to the teaching and learning of language B
Through approaches to learning in language acquisition courses, students develop skills that have relevance
across all areas that help them “learn how to learn”. Approaches to learning can be taught, improved with
practice and developed incrementally, through implementing a number of approaches to teaching.
Approaches to learning provide a common framework for students to reflect on, and articulate, how they
are learning. They prepare students for success in their studies and life beyond school. To this end, language
learning should be supported in ways that are consistent with the IB learner profile and the pedagogical
principles that underpin the IB programmes: the promotion of critical- and creative-thinking skills, learning
how to learn, and promoting international-mindedness.
When designing their courses, teachers need to embrace the approaches to teaching in order for them to
help students identify and develop learning skills in their language acquisition course.
Approaches to teaching
Teaching based on inquiry
One of the pedagogical principles that underpin all IB programmes is that of teaching based on inquiry.
Being inquirers is one of the attributes of the IB learner profile, where the process is seen as involving the
development of students’ natural curiosity, together with the skills needed to enable them to become
autonomous lifelong language learners. In language acquisition classes, students should be encouraged to
find out meaning and message for themselves, as far as is possible within the parameters of their language learning experiences.
One form of inquiry-based approach is that of experiential learning. “Experiential education refers to
learning activities that engage the learner directly in the phenomena being studied” (Cantor 1997). It is a
type of inquiry that can occur within a normal classroom environment through the use of a wide range of
linguistic sources, cultural artifacts and visitors, as well as outside the classroom through visits, virtual or actual exchange programmes.
Another form of inquiry-based learning is problem-based learning (PBL). In PBL, students analyse and
propose solutions to a real-world problem that is usually presented to them in an unstructured, and often
open-ended, manner. This kind of task lends itself to small-group collaboration in order to address the
themes in the language programme (such as “sharing the planet”) and also provides ample opportunities
for bringing a conceptual focus to students’ learning experiences.
Teaching focused on conceptual understanding
Concepts are broad, powerful organizing ideas that have relevance both within and across subject areas.
A set of five conceptual themes (identities, experiences, human ingenuity, social organization and sharing
the planet) have been used to shape the language acquisition syllabuses in order to help students build
the capacity to engage with complex ideas. Discussion of the “big ideas” behind these five concepts can
help students get to the heart of why they are exploring a particular language unit or option. There is also a
strong link between teaching through concepts and moving students to higher-order thinking; for example,
it allows students to move from concrete to abstract thinking, and facilitates transfer of learning to new
contexts, thereby supporting concurrency of learning.

=== Page 68 ===
Approaches to the teaching and learning of language B
Language B guide 58
Teaching developed in local and global contexts
Contextualized learning places an emphasis on students processing new information by connecting it
to their own first language and culture experience, and to the world around them. In addition to helping
students see connections between languages and cultures, and helping to ground abstract concepts in real life situations, there is also an important link between the contextualization of learning in global contexts
and the development of international-mindedness. International-mindedness should have a significant
focus in language acquisition classes by allowing students opportunities to explore course concepts, such
as sharing the planet, experiences and human ingenuity, as well as providing students with opportunities to
consider the nature of target-language countries and regions.
Teaching focused on effective teamwork and collaboration
This principle applies to promoting teamwork and collaboration among students, but it also refers to the
collaborative relationship between the teacher and students. Collaborative learning activities include
activities such as group projects, debates, role plays and other activities with shared goals. Therefore,
there are extremely close links between social skills, such as negotiation and collaborative learning. A key
aspect of fostering a collaborative relationship between teachers and students is the promotion of effective
dialogue and feedback on what students have and have not understood during their lessons.
Teaching differentiated to meet the needs of all learners
Differentiation is about accommodating the different ways in which students learn, and about teachers
designing learning experiences that allow students with a range of needs to meet their learning objectives.
These include affirming identities, valuing prior knowledge, scaffolding learning and extending learning.
Given the varied language experiences, first language knowledge and backgrounds of students when they
start a language acquisition programme, it is vital for teachers to identify the different learning needs of
individual students within a cohort and provide differentiated learning experiences for all students.
Teaching informed by assessment (formative and summative)
Assessment plays a crucial role in supporting learning, as well as in measuring learning. Formative
assessment encompasses “all those activities undertaken by teachers, and/or by their students, which
provide information to be used as feedback to modify the teaching and learning activities in which they
are engaged” (Black and Wiliam 1998: 7). Formative assessment is, therefore, a tool or process that teachers
can use to improve student learning; it is about assessment for learning, rather than simply assessment
of learning. In the language acquisition classroom, there should be opportunities for both teacher-led
formative and summative assessment as well as peer assessment and opportunities for students to reflect
on their own learning and performance on assessment instruments in order to develop their language skills.
Approaches to learning
Thinking skills
Through language acquisition, students develop a body of thinking skills that may include, but are not
limited to, metacognition, reflection, critical thinking, creative thinking and transfer. The development of
higher-order thinking skills, rather than the simple memorization of content, is integral to the language
learning process. This may be achieved through approaches to teaching, such as the use of collaborative,
enquiry-based tasks to provide students with the opportunity to explore language and structures relating
to a given theme. Learners are better equipped for their future roles as global citizens when given the
opportunity to analyse, synthesize and evaluate language topics from their own and different perspectives.

=== Page 69 ===
Approaches to the teaching and learning of language B
Language B guide 59
Research skills
In language acquisition, research allows students to use authentic sources to explore questions from different
cultural perspectives and to expand their linguistic and intercultural knowledge in any direction that presents a
particular interest for them. Research skills may include critical thinking, problem solving, analysis and sharing
of ideas (which could involve selecting a topic of interest in order to explore one of the language acquisition
course’s five themes or concepts), finding, validating and evaluating sources, as well as paraphrasing and citing
in an academically honest way. Students also need to present their work, and reflect on their experience, in a
way that demonstrates a positive attitude to learning. One of the many ways in which students can develop
their research skills is through the completion of an extended essay in the target language.
Communication skills
Communication is at the heart of language acquisition. Effective communicative interactions using the
spoken and written forms of a language entail: interpretation and negotiation of meaning; coherent
exchange of ideas; and the ability to inform, describe, narrate, explain, persuade and argue to a variety of
audiences and in different contexts. Not only does effective communication allow students to develop their
linguistic skills and self-confidence, it also promotes intercultural understanding through the examination
of the interrelationship between language and culture, and promotes international-mindedness through an
increased awareness of the use of the target language in a variety of countries and regions.
Social skills
To function effectively in the language acquisition classroom, students need to be adept at both peer-related
and adult-related social communication and behaviour. These skills are closely related to communication skills
and also to attributes of the IB learner profile, such as being open-minded, for example, through students
showing appreciation for the culture(s) of the target language. A particularly important skill within the category
of social skills is collaboration, which can be a catalyst to higher-order thinking and should, therefore, be at the
forefront of teachers’ minds when they are planning units of work for language acquisition classes.
Self-management skills
Students should set their own goals and reflect on their progress as they grow and improve their linguistic
and cultural competence. They should demonstrate initiative, perseverance and a strong willingness to
learn independently. An example could be students going beyond classroom requirements and using the
language in real-life situations, or seeking out native speakers in the local community with whom to practise their language skills.
Approaches to teaching
are:
Example based on inquiry
Students are given a set of resources (online, on paper, artifacts, and so
on) along with a challenge to complete. They will need to look for possible
solutions to the challenge by exploring the resources provided.
focused on conceptual understanding
Class discussion of the ways in which “purpose” shapes our communication in
the target language (selection of appropriate vocabulary and structures, use
of idiom, use of rhetorical devices, and so on). This could be done by taking
an authentic piece of writing in the target language and analysing it in order
to identify the purpose for which it was written. How do we know this? What
devices help us to understand the purpose? How clear is the purpose?
A follow-on task could be the creation of work samples, in which students
write for a specific purpose. Peer review of students’ work can produce good
discussion to evaluate the success of the writing for a specific purpose.

=== Page 70 ===
Approaches to the teaching and learning of language B
Language B guide 60
Approaches to teaching
are:
Example developed in local and global contexts
The class takes a topic from one of the themes and considers the
application of one of the conceptual understandings in different regions
and countries where the target language is spoken. For example, under
“identities”, the Spanish class could explore the different approaches to
naming, addressing and treating various family members in both Castilian
and other variations of Spanish, and selecting ways in which the students
can refer to their own family members (for example, in a non-Spanish speaking environment).
focused on effective teamwork and collaboration
Class debate on the pros and cons of recycling. Teams need to develop
arguments, share them across the team, collaborate with the teacher to
develop fluency in order to communicate well during the debate and
interact with their own team and the opposition during the debate itself.
differentiated to meet the needs of all learners
An inquiry task in which different students are provided with resources
commensurate with their language skills, but that will ultimately still allow
each individual student to contribute some ideas to the finished task.
informed by assessment (formative and summative)
An interactive oral activity in which students assess themselves and their
partners (peers) on the degree to which the use of the target language and
active participation contributed to the successful fulfilment of the activity
(detracted, contributed, enhanced). For formative assessment purposes, the
students also provide a reflection and strategy for improvement based on both the peer and self-assessment.
Approaches to learning
Example
Thinking skills
Having completed a piece of written work, students are given some
guiding questions and time for reflection on what they have written in the
target language. Students can be asked to identify what they feel they have
done well, whether there are any examples of language that they feel show
they have moved beyond their previous achievements, and plan how they
can expand on this success. In addition, students can take time to reflect on
the mistakes they have made, and can seek to understand why a structure
was wrong in order to reach a point where they use such structures correctly in the future.
Research skills
Themes such as “human ingenuity” particularly lend themselves to research
skills. For example, it is valuable for students to be able to give examples
when speaking about the ways in which technology has changed our lives.
By doing an internet search using a target language search engine, more
authentic language can be obtained. A common form of research, and one
that students should be encouraged to use daily, is to look up their own
vocabulary, verify language structures, and so on.

=== Page 71 ===
Approaches to the teaching and learning of language B
Language B guide 61
Approaches to learning
Example
Communication skills
Skills development for the individual oral assessment is substantially
focused on communication skills. Teachers need to allocate time in the class
schedule to helping students build confidence in one-to-one conversation.
This can be accomplished through establishing verbal protocols,
using linguistic strategies for the maintenance of communication and
encouraging the students’ active participation as interlocutors.
Social skills
A CAS activity that links to the language and culture a student is learning is
a good way to develop social skills; in particular, it may provide the student
with the opportunity to experience the way in which language, culture and
nationality can create subtle differences in social skills. Attitudes, outlooks,
prejudices and stereotyping are all topics that can be explored with
language acquisition students in the process of developing more mature social skills.
Self-management skills
The class might develop a timeline or planning strategy for the completion
of written tasks, establish routines for submitting completed work, and
establish protocols for peer review of classwork and formative assessment
tasks. Another very significant self-management skill focuses on the ability
to self-check work, manage errors and develop strategies for improvement.
While most students will already have some aspects of these skills, all
students can benefit from more structured consideration of appropriate
strategies for improving their ability to meet deadlines and manage their own learning.

Authentic text
An authentic text may be an audio, visual, audio-visual or written text. It has three definitions.
1.
It may come from an original target language source, such as a public
transport announcement or a television interview, and may be used
in its unaltered state provided the speed, language and ambient
noise do not prevent a language acquisition student from accessing the material.
2.
It may be an original text that has been modified (footnoted, some
changes to vocabulary, slowed down, and so on) to assist students with access to the content.
3.
Alternatively, an authentic item may be one that has been created in
the target language but is based on an authentic scenario, particularly
for beginning language learners and specifically for the purposes of language acquisition instruction and assessment.
Fluency
In language acquisition syllabuses and assessment outlines, the term
“fluency” does not mean “to speak like a native speaker”, nor should it be
taken as a measure of the accuracy of a student’s language. Schmidt (1992)
found that L2 (target language) fluency was “primarily a temporal
phenomenon” (that is, not a vague notion of proficiency, but the way
speech is processed and articulated in real time). In the context of the
language B course, “fluency” refers to how well a student can join up
language and structures in order to convey their ideas within the parameters
of the language learned. Pauses, rephrasing and repetition can all contribute to fluency rather than detracting from it.
Literary text
An extract from a complete literary work, for example, a scene from a play,
several paragraphs from a novel or a single poem from a larger collection.
Literary work
Complete works of prose fiction, prose non-fiction, poetry and drama,
originally written in the target language. Simplified or abridged versions of
literary works are not considered to fulfill the requirement of the definition “literary work” for the purpose of this guide.
Visual stimulus
For the purpose of the language B SL individual oral assessment, a “visual
stimulus” may be a photo, a poster, an illustration or an advertisement.

Visual text
Visual texts are texts that are created using images such as posters, book
covers, illustrations and photos. At their simplest, a visual text is a single
image that conveys ideas and information. It may also contain added language to enrich the message.
For the purpose of the language B SL individual oral assessment, a visual
stimulus containing plenty of visual text is an image that has ample detail
and action, and is a rich source of material for the student to talk about.
