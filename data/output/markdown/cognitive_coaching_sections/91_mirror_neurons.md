## Mirror Neurons

In 1992, the Italian neuroscientist Giacomo Rizzolatti found neurons in monkeys that fire both when the monkey carries out certain specific hand motions and when it views those specific motions being carried out by someone else. We, too, are built to respond to what others do. 'The human brain harbors multiple mirror neuron systems, not just for mimicking actions but also for reading intentions . . . and for reading emotions' (Goleman 2006, 42). Social skills and rapport depend on mirror neurons. Goleman observes that mirror neurons make emotions contagious, letting the feelings we witness flow through us. Amazingly, these same neurons respond to the mere hint of an intention to move one's body. The intentions of the mediator's actions can be conveyed and processed, and the mechanism is the selective activation of the mirror neuron system. What is mirrored is not only the meaning of the actions observed but also the understanding of mediator's intentions (Feuerstein, Feuerstein, and

Falik 2010, 137-38).

Frame-by-frame analysis of pairs talking show head and hand movements punctuate their conversational rhythm that coincide with stress points and hesitations in speech (Provine 2000). Microanalysis reveals that mother and baby precisely time the start and end of pauses in baby talk, creating a coupling of rhythm (Glaser 2014, 36). With words as mere sound effects, mothers and babies communicate nonverbally, a smile appearing on mother's face to be reproduced by baby within three seconds.

Humans gesture when they talk. The observant coach will notice that colleagues place people, events, time periods, and concepts in space. 'On the one hand . . . and then on the other hand' is a verbal equivalent of this physical talk. Understanding is communicated and rapport is enhanced when the coach points to the space assigned to a concept when verbally responding. A verbal paraphrase is a reflection of what the colleague is thinking and feeling. Repeating a colleague's gesture adds a visual component to the reflection.

Even laughter, as a paralanguage, is valuable in coaching. Researchers at Stanford University and the Loma Linda Medical School found an increase in white blood cell activity while subjects listened to a comedian.

This change in blood chemistry may boost the production of the neurotransmitters required for alertness and memory.

During the early 1970s, Richard Bandler and John Grinder conducted a series of investigations to learn why some therapists were almost magically effective, in contrast to others who simply did a good job. They initially studied Fritz Perls, the founder of Gestalt therapy; Virginia Satir, noted for her results in family therapy; and Milton Erickson, generally acknowledged to be the world's leading practitioner of medical hypnosis (Bandler and Grinder 1975).

The researchers discovered that Perls, Satir, and Erickson constantly mirrored their clients. For example, if the client had his legs crossed, the therapist crossed his legs. If the client leaned forward on her elbows, so did the therapist. When the client spoke rapidly, the therapist did too.

Whether they were conscious of it or not, Perls, Satir, and Erickson were modeling the theory of entrainment, which was formulated in 1665 after a Dutch scientist noted that two pendulum clocks mounted side by side on a wall would swing together in a precise rhythm. It was discovered that the clocks were synchronized by a slight impulse through the wall. Figure 3.1 shows manifestations of rapport.

When two people 'oscillate' at nearly the same rates, we observe entrainment. Human beings seek this kind of synchronization.

Neuroscientists have discovered neural systems (oscillators) that operate as clocks, resetting over and over their rate of firing to coordinate with the periodicity of an incoming signal (Rizzolatti, Fogassi, and Gallese 2006).

At the Boston University School of Medicine, William Condon studied films of many sets of two people talking. Not only were the bodies of the speakers matched but also another 'very startling phenomenon' was observed: entrainment existed between the speaker's words and the listener's movements. As one person would talk, the second person would make tiny corresponding movements. As Condon (1975) expressed it:

Listeners were observed to move in precise shared synchrony with the speaker's speech. This appears to be a form of entrainment since there is no discernible lag even at 1/48 second. It also appears to be a universal characteristic of human communication, and perhaps characterizes much of animal behavior in general. Thus, communication is like a dance, with everyone engaged in intricate and shared movements across many subtle dimensions, yet all strangely oblivious that they are doing so.
