SHAPE America   National Physical Education Standards: Public Review & Comment #2 4

Introduction
This second round of Public Review and Comment includes proposed Student Attributes and
Draft Standards, which were developed by the SHAPE America National Physical Education
Standards Task Force based on feedback received during the first round of Public Review and Comment.
The Student Attributes and Draft Standards focus on the well-being of the whole person and
their physical literacy journey. The standards consider the psychomotor, cognitive, affective, and
social learning domains essential to facilitating the physical literacy journey of preK-12 learners.
The physical literacy journey involves the ongoing acquisition and application of the knowledge,
skills, and dispositions necessary for engagement in a lifetime of healthful and meaningful
physical activity. The proposed Draft Standards are responsive to the developmental stages of
preK-12 learners and are designed to help everyone strive to reach their full potential.
Physical literacy is based on the premise that everyone can acquire and apply knowledge and
skills to move more confidently in physical activities that are motivating and enjoyable to the
individual. The physical literacy journey is inclusive; it is for all individuals regardless of their ability, age, class, gender, or race.
The development of physical literacy for preK-12 learners is dependent upon quality instruction
and opportunities to become more skilled, knowledgeable, and confident movers. The proposed
Draft Standards have been designed so teachers can easily build relevant and developmentally
appropriate learning experiences that engage all preK-12 learners in their own meaningful physical literacy journey.
