## 3. What Factors Maximize Learning? (Knowledge of Students and How They Learn)

Since the onset of neuroscientific research and its implications for learning and teaching, there has been increasing support for constructivism as an underlying principle (Tokuhama-Espinosa 2014; Caine and Caine 1991; Jensen 1998; Wolfe and Brandt 1998; Sigel 1984; Kuhn 1962; Dewey 1938; Brooks and Brooks 2001; Treadwell 2014).

Although constructivism is described here as it relates to classroom teachers, these principles of constructivism may also serve as a basis for understanding why Cognitive Coaches do what they do. They provide the theoretical underpinnings of the model of Cognitive Coaching, and they can be employed as a template to determine the degree to which schools embrace a constructivist philosophy.

Meaning making is not a spectator sport. Knowledge is a constructive process rather than a finding; it is not the content that gets stored in memory but the activity of constructing it that gets stored. Humans don't get ideas; they make ideas.

Constructivism is a theory of learning that is based in a belief that human beings have an innate quest to make meaning from their experiences. When humans are perplexed by anomalies, discrepancies, or new information, they have a natural inclination to make sense of it. This process of making sense is enhanced in instructional environments when certain behaviors are practiced:

- Seeking and valuing others' points of view
- Challenging other's suppositions
- Posing problems of emerging relevance
- Focusing on 'big' ideas and long-range outcomes
- Creating conditions for self-assessment
- Providing opportunities for reflection on experience
- Focusing on the mental processes of problem solving and decision making

The following principles of constructivism guide teachers as mediators of a learning-centered environment:
