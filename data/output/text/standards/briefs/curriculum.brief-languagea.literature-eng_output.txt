I. Course description and aims
The language A: literature aims at exploring the various manifesta­
tions of literature as a particularly powerful mode of writing across
cultures and throughout history. The course aims at developing
an understanding of factors that contribute to the production
and reception of literature—the creativity of writers and readers,
the nature of their interaction with their respective contexts and
with literary tradition, the ways in which language can give rise to
meaning and/or effect, and the performative and transformative
potential of literary creation and response. Through close analysis
of a range of literary texts in a number of literary forms and from
different times and places, students will consider their own inter­
pretations as well as the critical perspectives of others, to explore
how such positions are shaped by cultural belief systems and to negotiate meanings for texts.
The aims of studies in language and literature courses are to enable
students to:
z
z engage with a range of texts, in a variety of media and forms, from different periods, styles and cultures z
z develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, writing, viewing, presenting and performing z
z develop skills in interpretation, analysis and evaluation z
z develop sensitivity to the formal and aesthetic qualities of texts and
an appreciation of how they contribute to diverse responses and open up multiple meanings z
z develop an understanding of relationships between texts and a
variety of perspectives, cultural contexts, and local and global issues,
and an appreciation of how they contribute to diverse responses and open up multiple meanings z
z develop an understanding of the relationships between studies in language and literature and other disciplines z
z communicate and collaborate in a confident and creative way z
z foster a lifelong interest in and enjoyment of language and literature.

The Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19 age
range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and inquiring,
but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to develop
intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core. Students study two
modern languages (or a modern language and a classical language), a humanities or social
science subject, an experimental science, mathematics and one of the creative arts.
Instead of an arts subject, students can choose two subjects from another area. It is this
comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma Programme a demanding
course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance. In
each of the academic areas students have flexibility in making their choices, which
means they can choose subjects that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.
Normally, three subjects (and not more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and
the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends 240 teaching hours
for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than at SL.
In addition, three core elements—the extended essay, theory of knowledge and creativity,
activity, service—are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.
This IB DP subject brief has three key components:
