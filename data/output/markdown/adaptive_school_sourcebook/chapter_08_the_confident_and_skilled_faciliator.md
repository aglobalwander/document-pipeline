## Chapter 8

## The Confident and Skilled Faciliator

F resources. Perhaps  no  role  is  as  significant  to  developing  social  capital acilitation  is  the  group's  instrument  for  making  the  most  of  its  time  and and  producing  self-directed  groups  that  effectively  plan,  problem  solve, and  make  decisions  as  the  facilitator.  This  chapter  offers  definitions  of  facilitation work, addresses the requirements for facilitators, the tasks during the various stages of facilitation, ways to develop confidence and competence, and ways facilitators intervene when things go wrong in meetings. A special section is included on facilitation practices in groups of three or four members.

and  often  allows  people  to  hear  one  another, even if their mind was somewhere else during the original statement. Paraphrasing is but one of several language tools the facilitator uses.

Because  meetings  are  inherently  messy, facilitation  is  essential.  A  person  serving  as facilitator makes  complicated  conversations manageable,  manages  energy  and  focus,  provides  structure  and  protocols,  accommodates differences  in  cognitive  style,  equalizes  the influence of new and veteran teachers, and accommodates the vocal and the shy.

Facilitators make  a  group's  work  easier,  clarify  outcomes  and  manage  processes, make  sure  all  views  are  considered,  ask  the right  questions,  create  safe  environments, and strengthen  the  fabric  of  community.  Effective listening  is  embedded  in  all  of  this  (Davis, 2013). Listening, manifested by attentive paraphrasing, lets the speaker know he or she has been heard, connects one person's contribution to  another's,  summarizes  group  conversation,

A great facilitator is like an accomplished dancer.  One  notices  the  dance,  but  not  the dancer.  She  directs  process,  yet  is  supremely flexible. She follows principles, not rules. She improvises.  She  is  comfortable  with  who  she is and sets aside judgments about others. And, changing  genders  for  balance,  he  is  clear  in the  moment  about  his  intentions.  He  thinks beyond activities to outcomes. He is reflective and  learns  from  experience.  He  can  direct  or request, be firm or soft, serious or light, focus on  task  or  on  relationships.  Male  or  female, the skilled facilitator has abundant knowledge about processes and groups and is effortlessly competent with many facilitation moves.

Above  all,  the  facilitator  is  an  observer who  helps  groups  mediate  tensions.  Every system is  influenced  by  demands  that  present mixed messages. The  principal  who  responds to  the  demands  of  the  central  office  without considering  impacts  on  staff  can  unwittingly contribue  to  teacher  reluctance,  resistance,  or rebellion.  Teachers,  driven  by  concern  for student learning needs, sometimes collectively

work in opposition to excesses of standardized testing.  Parents  and  teachers  look  at  a  system through  different  eyes.  Each  day,  there  are different  interpretations  of  the  same  data,  and stakeholders  respond  from  different  perspectives. A facilitator serves the system by bringing the different perspectives to consciousness.

## Facilitation Compared to Other Leadership Roles

As  mentioned  in  chapter  3,  facilitation  is similar to but different from three other leadership roles: presenting, consulting, and coaching. Groups  need  clear  role  definitions  because  the name of a role influences people's expectations. The most common error we've noticed is for the presenter  and  facilitator  titles  to  be  used  interchangeably. This has become so pervasive thatthe spell-check on one of our laptops automatically changes the word facilitator to presenter. Just as a Ford is not a Honda, a facilitator is not a presenter, and a presenter is not facilitator. In one case both are vehicles, in the latter, both are leadership functions with important differences.

In a professional community dedicated to adaptive change leadership is shared. All participants  develop  the  knowledge  and  skills  to manage themselves and lead others. Leadership is  a  function  shared  in  teams,  in  professional development,  in  research,  and  in  projects. Recognizing  what  we  have  called  the  four hats of leadership (see chapter 3) and knowing when and how to change them becomes shared knowledge within the organization. When values,  roles,  and  work  relationships  are  clear, decisions about appropriate behavior are easy. Because the terms presenter and facilitator are sometimes used interchangeably we repeat key distinctions made in chapter 3.

## Facilitators Make Work Easy

Facilitate comes from the Latin stem facilis 'easy'  and  from  the  French faciliter 'to render  easy.'  Groups  convene  to  solve  problems,  make  decisions,  develop  plans,  or  clar- ify  information.  Facilitators  direct  processes, choreograph  energy,  and  maintain  a  focus  on one  content  and  one  process  at  a  time.  The facilitator  may not be the person in charge of the group. More ideas are generated and better decisions made when a facilitator serves groups than when no facilitator works with a group

Because presenters use many instructional methods, including facilitating learning in processes that actively engage adult learners, the roles are easily confused. While facilitators are neutral  to  content,  presenters  are  responsible for the content. When facilitators have essential  information  about  a  topic,  it  is  difficult to  stay  within  the  neutrality  boundary  (Bens, 2012).  We  periodically  witness  meetings  in which colleagues ask the group member who is facilitating to add to the conversation. Wanting  to  know  the  facilitator's  ideas  is  understandable, but it is a disservice to the group to lose a content-neutral facilitator. The strategy Signal  Role  Change permits  the  facilitator  to step out of the role to comment and yet protect the  integrity  of  the  role.  See  appendix A  for thirty-seven moves facilitators use to manage energy, focus, and information.

## Signal Role Change

- · When  facilitating  a  meeting  and wanting  to  contribute  content,  ask, 'May I add something?' The group usually will concur.
- · Move off to the side of the group or be seated. From this space, make a contribution in a credible voice.
- · Without speaking, return to the facilitation space. In an approachable voice say,  'OK.  Let's  move  on,'  or  'How does that add to your thinking?'

## Facilitator Qualities

Facilitating  a  meeting  is  improvisational work,  requiring  a  foundation  of  knowledge and skills, a clear sense of purpose, a juggler's

gift  of  attending  to  everything  at  once,  and knowing  what  to  do  when  you  don't  know what to do. You don't have to be flashy to be a good facilitator, but you do need to be developing  consciousness,  clarity,  competence, credibility, and confidence.

## Consciousness

Facilitators  are  simultaneously  aware  of multiple  events  in  the  external  environment and in their internal world. They work to hone their sensory acuity. Of the eleven million bits of data bombarding a person every second, ten million  come  through  the  eyes.  Facilitators pick up cues that group members are engaged, socializing, fatigued, impatient, apathetic, curious, excited, or just going through the motions. With  auditory  senses,  facilitators  detect  nuances in voice tone even when they are turned away  from  the  group.  They  pay  attention  to breathing,  room  temperature,  and  sight  lines. They shuttle from looking outward to looking inward.  Facilitators  maintain  their  own  resourcefulness, take stock of their energy, notice when  they  might  be  making  poor  judgments, remind themselves of context, and assess their relationship  with  the  group.  The  facilitator's internal focus complements, not dominates, the external awareness.

Facilitators stay aware  of  multiple  outcomes and contexts. Most meetings are nested inside other circumstances or initiatives. Perhaps most  important,  facilitators  are  aware  of  their point of view at any given time, and they press themselves to understand interactions from various perspectives. Facilitators know that success often  depends  on  their  ability  to  see  things  in new  ways,  gain  new  understandings,  and  produce new patterns of group interactions.

## Clarity

Facilitators  are  clear  about  their  role,  its boundaries,  and  its  responsibilities,  and  they communicate  this  unambiguously  to  groups. They  know  to  whom  they  are  ultimately  re- sponsible. (See appendix F for the distinctions among  a  contact,  intermediate,  or  primary client.)  Facilitators  know  the  importance  of language and strive for precision. The following are examples of clear facilitator language:

- · To get attention. 'Look this direction.'
- · To  clarify  purpose. 'Today's  task  is  to \_\_\_\_  [approve,  generate,  select,  identify, explore, resolve].'
- · To  give  directions .  'Identify  some  ideas you would like to explore as a team. Prepare  to  share  your  two  most  important ideas.'
- · To  encourage  participation. 'Here  are some suggestions for how to get the most value out of today's meeting. Be responsible  for  your  comfort  and  learning.  Don't wait  for  a  break  to  make  yourself  comfortable. Be responsible for your learning. If  you  can't  hear  someone,  say  'Louder, please!'  If  someone  is  speaking  too  abstractly and you need a concrete example, please ask for it.'
- · To  enlarge  perspective. 'Who  is  not  in this  room and can't speak for themselves on  the  topic?  What  do  you  imagine  their concerns might be?'
- · To  invite  group  awareness. 'How  is  the group doing on its agreement about listening to one another? Tell your partner.'
- · To  foster  understanding. 'Who  can  offer an organizing paraphrase?'
- · To encourage agreements. 'Are you ready for a decision?'

Language  obscures  or  clarifies.  Precise language  is  a  gift  to  the  facilitator  and  the group. It saves time and frustration, eliminates ambiguity, conveys respect for the group, and fosters facilitator credibility. Facilitators strive to  be  organized,  brief,  and  specific.  They  use words and phrases that have one meaning. Use nouns more than pronouns. Tell the group what it is to do, why or how that relates to the bigger context of its work, and the specific intention

to  be  achieved  at  each  stage.  Use  advanced organizers like 'There are three steps. Number one is. . . .

## Competence

Competence  develops  with  continuous learning, experience, and reflection on experience.  Facilitators'  competencies  are  grounded in  a  basic  knowledge  of  effective  meetings. This  includes  the  distinction  between  discussion  and  dialogue  (chapter  5),  a  set  of  facilitation  strategies  (see  appendix  A),  and  three structures  for  successful  meeting  (see  chapter 6). Additional competencies include designing an  agenda  (chapter  7),  reading  a  group,  paraphrasing,  asking  invitational  questions,  being comfortable with silence,  and  using  a  host  of nonverbal  strategies  and  moves.  Competence also means realizing that a plan is only a map of the territory and having the wisdom to know when  the  plan  is  not  working.  You  may  also want  to  see  a  book  on  resolving  problems  in meetings and workshops to self-assess yourself on a facilitator proficiency scale (Garmston and Zimmerman, 2013).

## Credibility

Credibility is a byproduct of clarity, competence,  and  confidence.  Credibility  does  not live inside the facilitator; rather, it is a perception the group forms about the person. When a group  believes  that  a  facilitator  is  competent, confident,  neutral,  trustworthy,  and  fair,  the group can say that this person is credible.

Credibility,  like  trust,  can  temporarily  be lost.  Being  less  than  honest,  not  owning  mistakes,  or  speaking  disrespectfully  about  those who are not in the room will drive a wedge of discomfort  between  you  and  the  group.  One essential facilitator capacity is learning how to recover from mistakes. As a friend of ours says, if you step in it, know how to step out of it.

The strongest element of a recovery move is  to  step  away  from  the  place  you  made  the error. ('Did I say that?'-Pointing to the space you just left), or direct some humor at yourself ('I always wanted to be skillful, now I realize I  should  have  specified  at  what').  To  regain credibility for errors of greater magnitude use four  steps. (1)  Acknowledge  whatever  you did  that  evoked  discomfort  ('I  brought  you incorrect information that resulted in confusion and  upset');  take  responsibility  ('I'm  sorry,  I was supposed to bring that to you today, and I forgot'); (3) Apologize ('That was insensitive, please  accept  my  apology');  and  (4)  self-disclose ('I will make it my intention to not make that error again').

## The Facilitator as Manager

Facilitators  manage  four  vital  currents  to maximize the value of meeting time: attention, energy, information, and logistics. Facilitators monitor and stimulate energy when necessary. Information  flow  must  be  clear,  multidirectional,  relevant,  and  comprehensible,  and  logistics  for  room  arrangements, schedules, and announcements must be clear.

Figure 8.1 . The Facilitator as Manager

<!-- image -->

Attention is first. In chapter 6 we presented five  principles  for  developing  meeting  standards. The first two were to stay on one topic at  a  time  and  use  only  one  process  at  a  time. Facilitators  use  language,  space,  flip  charts, and their bodies to manage these two standards. Whether standing or seated with a small group these four tools are vital.

Energy,  the  second  current,  is  an  essential resource  of  groups  if  they  are  to  accomplish work.  Productive  energy  is  a  side  effect  of positive human relationships. A facilitator's pri-

mary  task  is  to  amplify  and  direct  emotional, cognitive,  and  physical  energy  to  group  goals. Researchers  have  found  that  some  groups  are 'smarter' than others-that is they collectiveley have  higher  performance  or  greater  success  in solving problems than comparison groups (Fredrickson and Losada, 2005; Losada and Heaphy, 2004;  Woolley  et  al.,  2010).  The  researchers found substantial evidence for collective intelligence as real and measurable. Factors like turn taking, balancing inquiry with advocacy, higher positivity ratios, and  social  sensitivity were attributes of  the  more  accomplished  groups. Studies also find that collective efficacy, one of the  five  energy  sources,  is  consistently  related to high performance across subject areas, across locations and using multiple instruments (Eells, 2011; Goddard, Hoy, and Woolfolk-Hoy, 2004).

Information  is  the  third  essential  current. Groups  consume  and  construct  information  in order to plan, decide, solve problems, and take action. Information comes in a variety of packages:  abstractions, examples,  generalizations, details,  thoughts,  feelings,  research,  numbers, history, and dreams. There is typically too much data and too little time. Facilitators assist groups to select some data to study and others to ignore. They guide groups to know when to look for details and when to examine themes and patterns.

The  fourth  and  final  current  is  logistics. 'This  is  the  'ground'  of  group  process-the most constrained and, when mastered, the most enabling flow because it frees up attention and energy for other things' (Sibbit, 2002, p. 55). This  current  carries  the  management  of  the meeting-room environment, equipment, materials, time allotments, schedules, and reporting procedures (chapter 6).

Give  instructions  for  room  arrangement and materials (see chapter 6 for ideas on organizing the room for different purposes). Arrive at least thirty minutes early to make whatever adjustments are necessary. Get any clutter out of the room. Often there are too many tables or chairs to work effectively.

Visuals  are  indispensable  for  focusing attention.  Most  of  our  sensory  information comes  through  the  eyes.  One  major  value of  charts  over  images  on  a  screen  is  their potential  for  permanence.  People  know  that a  screen  image  will  disappear  and  therefore experience a muscular tension they don't have when  looking  at  a  chart.  On  a  chart,  information stays visible throughout the meeting, allowing the participants to know where they are on the agenda and the facilitator to refocus them on goals or norms. Charts are especially valuable if information is being presented that makes members uncomfortable. A facilitator can  use  the  strategy  Third  Point  to  direct attention to the data and away from him- or herself,  providing  a  separation  between  the message and the messenger. Place the charted agenda  where  it  can  be  easily  referred  to throughout the meeting.

Color-code charted agendas or other data that has been prepared in advance. Use red for headlines; brown, blue, and green for text; and yellow  and  black  for  organizing  or  graphics. Always  print  in  block  letters,  never  in  cursive-and,  despite  what  some  books  advise, never use all caps. Any teacher will tell you that printed upper- and lowercase block letters are the most readable.

<!-- image -->

Color-coding  is  not  advisable  when  you are recording during a meeting, because it can slow  the  flow  of  talk.  Graphics  aid  memory and communicate complex concepts metaphorically. ChartArt (Buckley, 2002) is a series of images  that  can  be  traced  onto  a  chart;  they are considered useful by both experienced and novice  facilitators.  Buckley  (2002)  describes how to work with charts and graphics.

## Facilitation Functions

The  facilitator's  work  begins  before  the meeting  does  and  continues  after  the  meeting. During  a  meeting,  there  are  many  facilitator functions with unique purposes and tools. Meeting work is cyclical. The same functions-generating, organizing, and analyzing-can repeat, and complex strategies often have embedded in them  several  smaller  ones.  Focusing  attention will  be  repeated  many  times  throughout a session, along with framing the work and activating relevant knowledge.

Here we describe tips, strategies, and overarching goals for each function.

## Preparing

Is  this  part  of  an  initiative  in  which  the group has already worked? Will there be meetings  to  follow?  Are  other  groups  involved? Learn the leader's perception of meeting goals. You might have to be a coach or consultant before you can be a facilitator, in some situations. Often the meeting outcomes have not been considered at the level of detail necessary to design an  effective  session.  Explore  specifics.  Find out if anything is happening in the group, or to the  group,  that  could  bring  counterproductive energy into the room. Occasionally you might arrange to meet with a small planning committee or conduct a phone conference to get multiple  perspectives.  This  is  essential  when  you have been asked to facilitate conflict-related or problem-solving  meetings.  See  appendixes  F, G, and H for tips on contracting for facilitation services.  Ask  to  see  the  meeting  announce-

ment; you want to know what information the participants have about the meeting.

## Opening

An opening might take as little as ten minutes or as long as thirty minutes, depending on your  desired  outcome,  available  time,  group size, level of group maturity, and experience in working together. The first three to five minutes are  critical  in  developing  expectations,  receptivity,  and  relationship  with  a  group.  During the  opening  the  facilitator  must  get  people's attention, focus their energy, acknowledge any resistance that might be present, be especially careful  about  pronoun  use  (your  meeting,  not mine), provide for a public display of information and group memory, and clarify roles-the facilitator's,  the  participants,'  and  the  record-

er's.  Members  want  to  know  the  topic,  its relevance to them, if it will be worth their time (Is  it  well  organized?),  and  the  credibility  of the person facilitating. All these questions must be addressed in the first few minutes. In video 8.1  we  see  the  facilitator  open  a  meeting  and address these points.

Video 8.1.

## Focusing

Everyone knows the importance of attention, yet it is not unusual for a facilitator who is stressed or pressed for time to begin talking before attention is fully gained. This will backfire and become a cumulative problem, indicating to the group that full attention is not expected.

Grinder (2007) describes twenty-one nonverbal  tools  that  people  unconsciously  use  to enhance  their  speech.  Many  of  these  appear in  appendix  A.  Since  humans  are  influenced more  by  nonverbal  communication  than  by the spoken word, it is necessary for facilitators to  develop  a  nonverbal  vocabulary.  We  have incorporated many nonverbal tools of communication in training facilitators and have had remarkable success in helping them amplify their effectiveness. See appendix A for descriptions of over thirty facilitator moves.

## Clarifying Role

Take  time  to  specify  that  your  role  is  to guide the process and stay neutral to the content.  Encourage  group  members  to  tell  you  if they  think  that  you  are  stepping  out  of  role. Have them direct you about the type of facilitation they desire: tightly directed by you or with greater allowance made for the group to guide the process. Facilitation is essential to maintain focus, efficiency, and energy as well as to conserve time and achieve results.

Ultimately groups allow themselves to be facilitated. If it has not given its tacit permission,  a  group  will  resist  or  subvert  the  facilitator's  efforts  to  serve  them.  A  group  grants psychological  permission  to  the  facilitator  to manage the meeting process and to place issues before  the  group  to  consider.  Permission  is based on a number of intangibles. Among these are a perception of confidence, trust, and a belief  that  the  facilitator  can  remain  neutral  and nonjudgmental. Confidence and credibility are perceived by congruent language-that is, the body says what the words describe. Confident facilitators breathe from the abdomen. Facilitators whose breathing is high and shallow signal their own discomfort, which affects the group's sense of ease. Wellman and Lipton (2004) describe a permission-getting process that signals responsiveness  and  permits  the  group  to  provide direction to the facilitation services:

One  approach  to  empowering  a  working group, whether it is at a novice level of performance as a group or at a more expert level, is  to  negotiate  your  stance  as  a  facilitator. Stances may vary from hard to soft facilitation. An effective way to offer these options is to describe a physical continuum organized by  metaphors,  then  ask  group  members  to point  to  the  spot  on  the  continuum  they  believe  will  be  most  effective  for  that  session. Some  metaphors  that  we  have  used  include facilitation stances that range from Rambo to Mr. Rogers; from Xena the Warrior Princess to  Mary  Poppins;  or  from  a  lion  to  a  lamb. Presenting choices helps the group to gain or regain the power to control its own direction and  purposes.  This  is  especially  true  if  individual  group  members  are  dominating  the group's time and energies. Such a group will tend to select harder forms of facilitation and facilitator permission to intervene with problematic situations. (p. 15)

## Framing the Work

As  a  noun, frame marks  the  boundaries within which an entire picture is displayed. As a  verb, frame means to create a mental structure, or frame, through which people interpret or make sense of a situation. Facilitators frame tasks to set a tone for participation and productivity-to  describe  the  purposes  of  the  work, how it  relates  to  a  larger  context,  and  how  it benefits participant interests.

Groups  perform  at  their  best  when  they have  clearly  defined  outcomes.  You  might start  with  an  artfully  vague  statement  such as 'Today  you  will  explore  ways  to  save the after-school  program.'  Broad  outcomes maintain  momentum  because  people  relate  to the  intent  and  don't  get  bogged  down  by  the details.  Later,  after  framing  and  an  inclusion activity,  you  should  be  more  specific:  'The purpose  today  is  to  identify  what  resources we could make available for the program. You will  recommend  some  to  consider.  Next  you will assess the costs to other school programs and,  based  on  that,  make  a  go  or  no-go  recommendation  on  continuing  the  after-school activities.'  Working  outcomes  employ  a  verb that  specifies  what action is to be taken, such as decide , recommend , inform , assess , explore , advocate , inquire , or identify .

## Acknowledging Resistance

Some of the people, some of the time, will want  to  resist,  oppose,  refrain  from  participa- tion, or push back against proposals, programs, ideas, and even resist being in a meeting. Keep in  mind  that  their  resistance  is  just  a  way  of taking care of themselves and is not about you. The resistance often has nothing to do with the meeting.  One  of  the  authors  met  with  a  group of principals and sensed apathy and fatigue. He asked what was going on. He learned that this was the fourth day that week that the principals had been out of their buildings. In addition, they had  delivered  reductions-in-force  notices  the day before. Given these circumstances, the proposed agenda made little sense, and as the group modified its task, energy returned to the room.

To resist resistance is futile. To resist resistance is to have it persist. One cannot be reasoned out of resentment, hurt, anger, betrayal, blame, or discouragement, the typical sources of  resistance.  Only  if  you  acknowledge  the validity of the perceptions and feelings (which is  different  from agreeing with them) will the group have the choice to set them aside.

For extended resources see Garmston and Zimmerman's  (2013)  strategies  for  resolving twenty  types  of  problems  facilitators  face. Here we will identify three approaches to work with resistance. Each is a form of reframing. If resistance is present or anticipated, it must be addressed immediately at the start of a meeting. The three approaches are as follows:

- · Pace  and  lead.  The  facilitator  acknowledges  (by  pacing)  the  legitimacy  of  feelings a group is having, then (leading) suggests  the  temporary  suspension  of  those feelings  in  order  to  make  the  best  use  of this time. (Costa and Garmston, 2016)
- · Use strategies that acknowledge the resistance as natural and that generate humor, such as Banned Words (appendix A.).
- · Choreograph an opening. Imagine you are conducting  a  before-school  meeting  with teachers. They are attending because it is a workday at the beginning of the school year. Last year, scores went up across the district. They were promised a classroom day, but the district office decided to send

you to work with them instead. In choreographing an opening, the facilitator could describe the resistance in respectful terms and suggest that there are higher interests and benefits to come from the meeting. See Choreograph an Opening in appendix A.

Language  precision  is  important.  The  resistance must be stated in vague terms so that people can identify with it. The following language forms offer ways you can modulate the resistance description: all of you , some of you , or a few of you (Zoller and Landry, 2010).

## Developing Inclusion

The first four opening activities-focusing attention, clarifying  your  role,  framing  the work, and acknowledging resistance-can take very little time. These tasks do not have to be done as separate entities but can be blended.

Developing inclusion, the seventh activity, can  also  be  blended  with  focusing  attention, framing  the  work,  and  activating  relevant  information. Occasionally it can also be used in acknowledging resistance. People always come to meetings from somewhere else-geographically, emotionally, and cognitively. While bodies may be in the room, often heads are not, but are attending instead to the last class, concern with  a  student,  or  social  needs.  Therefore,  it is  essential  that  you  provide  experiences  that help  them  to  make  a  transition  into  the  new space  and  group.  Plan  for  either  full  group or subgroup  inclusion  activities.  Full-group activities set norms, focus attention inside the room, generate energy, and help people to answer the question of who they are in relation to the  group. They  begin  the  process  of  moving from a focus on self to the group. Groundings or synectics activities shown in appendix A are full-group  activities.  Groundings  are  particularly  useful  for  groups  experiencing  conflict, for  merging  members  of  different  groups,  or preparing groups for difficult conversations.

Synectic  activities  reveal  knowledge  and attitudes  about  a  topic  and  engage  the  metaphoric  brain.  As  an  example,  groups  might

## Virtual Inclusion Activities for Remote Teams

Virtual inclusion activities are as important  as  face-to-face  inclusions.  They get  voices  'in  the  room,'  serve  as  role calls, help  members  learn  about  one another, or challenge thinking about the topic  to  be  explored.  Keep  them  short. As in all  activities,  be  clear  about  your goals.  One  goal  set  might  be  to  get people's  voices  (or  faces)  in  the  room, represent a virtual role call, and get ownership  of  the  agenda. Another  might  be to  stimulate  creativity,  and  yet  another might be reveal to perceptions from different time zones.

- · Each  person,  in  turn,  says  their name, role, organization, and hopes for this meeting.
- · Each member posts a picture of their shoes  or  item  on  their  desk,  then explains  how  that  item  represents their interests.

respond  to  a  question  like  'assessing  student learning is like what household object because .  .  .'  if  that  is  the  focus  for  the  meeting.  We used that inclusion activity once, in an eastern state,  related  to  a  session  on  supervision. The majority  of  responses  had  to  do  with  toilets. The  group  clearly  communicated  its  attitude. Subgroup  activities  also  set  a  norm  of  active engagement and focus attention to the content of  the  meeting's  work.  Participants  take  turns speaking to a prompt. Prompts might be expectations  for  the  meeting,  or  naming  a  positive occurrence  of  the  week,  or  hopes  and  apprehensions for an upcoming event. See appendix A for other inclusion activities.

With all strategies, it is desirable to name the purposes of the activity. This is especially so at the beginning of a session, when, if you are not already known, you are still establishing your relationship with the group.

## Activating Knowledge

Just as teachers engage students by helping them  to  elicit  prior  knowledge,  the  facilitator does  this  to  generate  energy  and  activate  information that  is  relevant  to  the  group's  task. Doing it at the beginning of a meeting and each time  new  topics  are  introduced  has  multiple benefits.  First,  particularly  at  the  beginning of  a  meeting,  a  norm  for  engagement  is  reinforced. It energizes the group members as they work  and  frees  the  facilitator  to  observe  the group.  Second,  the  relevant  knowledge  that is  activated is instrumental in accelerating the pace of the meeting, for it brings information into play that is necessary to work on a topic. Sometimes this information is as simple as remembering what happened at the last meeting. Many meetings take unnecessary time getting started  because  group  members  do  not  recall what happened in earlier sessions.

Third,  eliciting  prior  knowledge  levels the perceived playing field within the group. This is especially true with mixed-role groups when the activity is preceded by a quick writing  activity  so  that  each  group  member  has something  to  contribute.  Finally,  any  initial task has to be structured so that group members feel psychologically safe, confident that they  will  not  be  demeaned,  attacked,  or  ridiculed. The 'Sort Cards' strategy serves this purpose nicely. Members privately respond to a prompt on 3 × 5 cards, then they display and organize  the  cards  according  to  criteria  that they invent (appendix A).

Other strategies in appendix A that activate relevant  information  while  maintaining  psychological safety are 'Paired Verbal Fluency'; 'Know,  Think  You  Know,  Want  to  Know'; 'Four-Box  Synectics';  'Three  to  Get  Ready and  Card  Stack  and  Shuffle';  and  'Give  One to Get One.' Keep in mind that members must always feel safe but as the meeting progresses, not necessarily comfortable. Discomfort is often a doorway to learning.

## Giving Directions

Precise  directions  conserve  time  and  energy. Confusing directions make members feel dumb.  When  people  feel  dumb  they  lose  efficacy,  energy,  and  commitment  to  task.  The thinking-processes supporting direction-giving are  clear.  At  the  simplest  level,  they  include guidelines such as using declarative statements and a minimum number of words. As we will see  later,  personal  pronouns  can  be  problematic  with  this  function  and  others.  By  saying things  like  'Here's  what  I  want  you  to  do next' or 'Listen carefully to me as I describe this  process,'  a  facilitator  conveys  the  idea that the group is serving him or her rather than the group's goals. Instead, use phrases such as 'Your next steps are . . .' or 'This process has three stages . . .' or 'Turn to your neighbor and name your concerns about this topic.'

These forms maintain focus on the group and  on  the  task  rather  than  on  the  facilitator. Directions,  like  framing  statements,  can  be scripted. Charts and slides that hold directions visually aid retention. In the case of particularly difficult  tasks,  they  focus  participants'  attention on the process-task interaction-which is where it is supposed to be-rather than on the person guiding the work.

Adopt  the  syntactical  pattern  of  'What,' 'Why,'  'How'  when  giving  directions.  The 'What' is the name of the strategy, structure, or pattern you are proposing for engaging the group. The 'Why' is the intention or purpose of that choice. The 'How' includes the details and procedures involved in the process.

Video 8.3.

The 'Why' is the most essential element for enlisting group member respect for the process and commitment to following the assigned pattern with integrity. 'Why' statements offer principles  of  practice  such  as:  'This  strategy presents opportunities for hearing and considering multiple viewpoints without judgment or comment.' Or, 'This paired interaction allows partners to engage with the text and each other's perspectives in a time-efficient manner.'

Notice that this last 'Why' statement also embeds a subtle  pacing  for  those  participants who value time efficiency and may not always value their colleagues' contributions. For those participants  who  enjoy  collaborative  interactions,  the  embedded  message for them is that the strategy will be time bound so they should respect  the  protocol  and  time  frames  and not  get  lost  in  any  meandering  conversations during the process.

'Why'  statements  have  both  immediate and  longer-term  intentions.  The  immediate impact  is  framing  the  purpose  for  the  task at  hand.  The  longer-term  intention  is  where facilitation  overlaps  with  group  development goals.  For  groups  to  be  ready  to  engage  with increasing cognitive and relational challenges, the  skilled  facilitator  paces  both  the  strategy choice and 'Why's' to at first meet, and then stretch, the learning capacities of group members. For  novice  groups,  the  'Why's'  will be  mostly  about  the  intention  of  the  strategy to  help  those  groups  develop  basic  habits  of following directions and working successfully with colleagues.

Use a credible voice to give directionsone in which the tonal pattern is flat and tends to  curl  down  at  the  end  of  sentences.  This voice  pattern  universally  is  received  as  'this is important information, please attend.' Stand upright with head and body still in a posture of calm and centeredness with feet aligned under the  shoulders.  Drama  teachers  tell  us  this  is called  a  neutral  position.  If  there  are  subsets to  the  directions,  use  a  visual  paragraph  for maximum  congruence.  In  this  pattern  the  facilitator gives the first direction, pauses, breaks eye contact by dropping his or her head, moves to  a  new  spot,  looks  up,  and  gives  the  next direction.  This  pattern  can  be  used  for  up  to four steps in direction giving. Imagine the following statements (with expanded information for  each)  delivered  with  the  visual  paragraph after each of the first three directions. Table 8.1 shows what might be said while giving directions in a meeting and in a sixth-grade class.

A facilitator's language choices will greatly influence success in giving directions as well as in offering guidelines and leading the process.

An often-overlooked yet powerful attribute of  clear  directions  is  pronoun  use  (Wellman, 2006).  Pronouns  are  substitutes  for  names. They label the speaker's place in any relationship and convey expectations of that relationship, such as compliance, affection, and whose group  it  really  is.  When  a  facilitator  named Sarah  says,  'Please  give  me  your  attention,' she  might  as  well  have  been  saying,  'Please give  Sarah,  not  somebody  else  in  the  group, your attention.' One of the authors once heard

| Directions in a Meeting                                                                                                                         | Directions in a Sixth-Grade Class                                                                                                                                                         |

| • First, you will brainstorm. • Next, you will clarify. • Third, you will advocate. • And finally, you will rank what is most important to you. | • Open your books to page 32. • Put your finger on the right-hand column of problems. • Answer the odd-numbered problems. • Show your work for each problem on a separate piece of paper. |

a principal in a meeting refer to 'our work this year,' to which a teacher muttered, 'No, it's not 'our work'; she's going back to the office, and we're going to be doing it.' On another occasion  a  superintendent  new  to  the  job  thanked one of us for coming to the district to work with 'his people.'

Who you are by position and relation to the group should influence your choice of pronouns. If you are a group member who has stepped up to facilitate a session, the work very well might be  'ours.'  If  you  are  external  to  the  group  in any  way,  referring  to  the  work  as  'ours'  can generate  inferences  that  actually  interfere  with the group's work or its development.

It  is  usually  wise  to  carefully  plan  and script  your  comments.  For  an  upcoming  facilitation  session,  consider  whether  it  is  'our work today,' 'your work today,' or 'the work today.'  For  work  that  is  emotionally  charged in  any  way,  it  is  usually  safest  to  apply  the most  pronoun-neutral  forms  and  talk  about 'the work,' 'this task,' 'the data,' or 'the outcome.' Neutral forms, which use articles  and pronouns  such  as the and this ,  depersonalize the task and make it psychologically safer for group  members  to  engage  with  the  issue  and not the person before them.

The  neutral  pronoun  pattern  can  be  supported by the use of charts and visuals that hold important  technical,  and  perhaps  emotionally laden, information  off  to  the  side  (Grinder, 2007).  This  approach  removes  the  emotion  of the  message  from  the  facilitator,  guiding  the group's  emotional  energy  to  the  information rather than toward the facilitator. Be sure to keep your eyes on the chart as you use neutral pronouns. If you revert to making eye contact with group  members  while  framing  difficult  tasks, you run the risk of repersonalizing the task and drawing the emotional energy to the messenger rather than leaving it with the message.

## Suggesting Process

Fluent  facilitators  are  able  to  anticipate bottlenecks  and  common  points  of  confu- sion. At  these  points,  they  succinctly  propose targeted  procedural  tips  and  offer  additional technical  resources  to  move  the  group  ahead. Again,  these  are  situations  in  which  careful pronoun choice can be important to the group's productivity. Given the wisdom of prior experience and an implicit desire for credibility with the group, you might be tempted to say things like 'In my experience the best thing to do is. . . .' Such phrasing has the effect of personalizing the advice or suggestions that follow.

The  alternate  approach  is  to  drop  the personal pronoun and cultivate a repertoire of phrases  such  as  'Groups  typically  get  stuck here and need to . . .' and 'At points like this, productive  groups  tend  to  .  .  .'  These  more pronoun-neutral  forms  frame  the  notion  of expertise as a capacity of some ideal group, not as a 'gift' from the facilitator. In all facilitator functions,  the  intention  must  be  to  place  the spotlight on the group, its development, and its task accomplishment-not on the facilitator.

## Facilitating Work

Facilitators  facilitate-that  is,  they  make work easier. Your awareness of the group combines  with  your  repertoire  of  facilitation  skills and knowledge to serve you as you maintain a neutral stance and guide the group through strategies and transitions. Appendix A describes over thirty  facilitator  moves  (often  nonverbal)  and one hundred and thirty strategies or protocols.

Very small groups cannot afford the luxury of having one person stay in a neutral facilitation role, yet facilitation can still be present. We will discuss the concept of facilitating a small group shortly.

## Transitioning

A  transition  is  a  process  of  change  from one  state  to  another.  Managing  the  shifts  between  activities  or  topics  or  between  content and  breaks  is  part  of  the  art  of  facilitation. Without any warning, momentum can be broken. Group members can be so invested in the

current activity that they feel resentment if the activity is suddenly broken off (Sibbit, 2002). Near  the  end  of  a  process,  help  the  group  to anticipate a transition by announcing that you are  beginning  to  move  toward  closure  or  are turning  to  a  different  stage  in  the  process. To manage energy and attention, give people time warnings when they are engaged in self-managing  activities.  The  move  'Yellow  Light' (appendix  A)  serves  as  a  warning.  Another strategy  is  to  move  quietly  around  the  group and indicate the remaining time. Timers on the screen  will  also  let  people  track  the  time  for themselves.

'Closing the Window' is a nonverbal strategy that signals that a full-group conversation is about to end. This often brings out those who have something to say before the time is up. In video 8.4 we watch the facilitator use 'closing the  window,'  a  facilitator  move  learned  from virtuoso Suzanne Bailey.

Video 8.4.

Because the group has not internalized the agenda sequence as you have, reminders about where they are now in relationship to the full agenda  can  be  useful.  Saphier,  Haley-Speca, and  Gower  (2008)  offer  the  metaphor  of  station  naming-as  if  riders  are  being  reminded of  what  they  are  leaving  and  where  they  are going-to help members know how what they are doing relates to what is completed and the next topic or process. 'Now that you've identified concerns, the next step will be to explore related assumptions. That will be the first task after a short break.'

Some  form  of  transition  is  also  useful  to signal a shift in activity ('OK, that's it for brainstorming, the next stage is clarification'),  pace ('The  pace  is  going  to  slow  down  to  open  an opportunity for reflection'), and level ('Now the task moves from naming assumptions to exploring what inferences they might lead to').

Use  transitions  to  have  participants  organize and integrate the work just completed when the  ideas  have  to  be  carried  to  a  next  stage  of thinking or when the content should be remembered  for  a  future  meeting.  Some  strategies (appendix A) that accomplish this are 'Journal,' 'Most Important Point,' 'Partners Report,' and 'Matchbook Definitions.' Strategies that engage the  full  group  are  'Walk About'  and  'Stir  the Classroom.'  'Sound  and  Motion  Symphony' brings physical expression to the integration of information (see appendix A).

## Closing the Meeting

At the conclusion of the work, the group is ready to close the meeting.

High  on  the  list  of  frustrations  that  people  express  to  us  is  the  feeling  that  at  the  end of  a  meeting,  nothing  was  accomplished.  A proper  closing  will  eliminate  this  complaint. The following tasks should be accomplished at this  stage:  clarify  who  is  to  do  what  by  when, test  commitments,  clarify  communications  and finally  assess  the  meeting  and  arrange  for  the next.

## Clarify Who Does What by When

In  the  heat  of  conversations,  the  actionable part of decisions is often overlooked. Left overlooked,  they  are  the  cause  of  confusion, incomplete  follow-up,  and  poor  morale.  The facilitator  is  responsible  for  seeing  that  this question is asked: Who is to do what by when? If no one else asks, the facilitator must. Names of the responsible parties should be recorded on charts and made a part of the meeting minutes.

## Test Commitments

Everyone  is  busy.  In  the  enthusiasm  of the moment,  some  people  overcommit.  'I know  you  would  never  do  this,'  the  facilitator  might  say  with  a  smile,  'but  under  what conditions  might  you  be  tempted  to  violate

these agreements?' Although it could be fairly easy-perhaps to go along with the group-to agree  to  a  course  of  action  during  a  meeting, real pressures can evolve later when one must choose between conflicting commitments. The facilitator's question brings an awareness of the realities and tensions associated with commitments.  When  these  realities  and  tensions  are articulated, the group has an opportunity to explore strategies that can overcome any barriers to the agreements.

## Clarify Communications

'What we have here is a failure  to  communicate' is a line from the movie Cool Hand Luke . When  people  are  surveyed  about  the problems  in  their  organizations,  one  of  the top  items  mentioned  is  poor  communication. Because work life is so hectic and individuals have interests  and  responsibilities  in  so  many areas,  it  is  critical  to  have  a  communication plan before people leave the meeting.

For leaders, it is desirable to have a meeting summary in group members' hands within twenty-four hours. This signals that the group's work is important. Some facilitators and group leaders  reserve  fifteen  to  thirty  minutes  after the meeting to develop a summary draft from the notes on the charts.

Other forms of after-meeting communication  include  scheduling reports at other meetings,  e-mailing  summaries  to  the  entire  staff, posting  minutes  in  the  staff  room,  or  having each member speak to a few colleagues about what  transpired.  In  some  schools,  grade-level teams  or  departments  post  agendas  and  minutes on the Internet to keep everyone abreast of what is occurring.

## Assess the Meeting

Any group too busy to reflect on its work is too busy to improve. Taking a small amount of time at the end of each meeting to fill out a meeting survey is a responsible form of professional development. Group members take three to four minutes at the end of a meeting to anon- ymously  complete  appendix  I,  a  Likert  scale questionnaire about meeting effectiveness. The data  are  collated  by  the  facilitator  or  group leader and brought back to the group at the next meeting, with frequency distributions for each item.  Small  groups  look  at  the  data  and  then engage  in  a  full-group  discussion  around  the question 'Given what we said about ourselves last time, what do we want to work on today?' This is a remarkably effective way to elicit concerns and rapidly improve group functioning.

## Arrange for the Next Meeting

Many groups rotate the facilitation role so that all the members have a chance to develop strength and an understanding of meeting dynamics. This is the time to select a next facilitator  wanting  to  develop  skills,  and,  ideally, arrange for this person to work with the group leader to design the next agenda.

## Facilitating In Small Groups

Three  members  comprise  a  team.  If  one stands  to  facilitate,  one  stands  to  record,  the seated  member  can  make  all  the  decisions. Right? Obviously this does not work. The essential concept for small groups is that facilitation is needed, not a full-time facilitator. The following problems are common to small groups:

- · In small  meetings  everyone  is  usually seated. Who is  facilitating  often  gets  lost in this arrangement.
- · Two  of  the  meeting  standards,  one  topic at  a  time  and  one  process  at  a  time,  are frequently violated.
- · In  a  group  of  three,  achieving  sufficient consensus  (80  percent)  is  artificial  with two to one splits. (Try rating an item from one to  one  hundred  to  see  distinctions  in perception.)
- · It  is  difficult  to  manage  a  third  meeting standard, balanced participation, if one is a dominator and incessantly talks.
- · The urgent often displaces the important.

What follows next are ideas to manage the tensions above. Then we will introduce a special role we call the 'Citizen Facilitator.'

When all are seated in a group of three to eight people, it is a greater challenge to manage the group's energy and focus. One solution is for  the  designated facilitator to position a flip chart or chalkboard nearby. To regain attention stand,  pointing  to  the  visual  display  behind you,  and  say  something  like,  'Here  is  where we are now,' or 'Are we ready to move to this next item?' or (writing something on the visual display) 'This seems to be the sticking point. Talk with a neighbor for a moment and generate some ideas.' A teacher in Mumbai told us she  has  her  group  do  lots  of  partner  work  to keep energy high. After she stands to redirect group energy, she returns to her own partner to engage in the conversation.

To  clarify  a  topic  or  process  in  a  large group, 'TAG/TAU' (topic as given/topic as understood)  and  'PAG/PAU'  (process  as  given/ process as understood) are used. Voice and the visual  paragraph  are  employed.  Both  can  be used in small groups in this manner.

'Next  we  (now  the  inclusive  pronoun  is appropriate) need to ask ourselves the question, 'What might we be missing?' Take a moment, jot down names of groups that might be affected by this and prepare to share.' The facilitator makes a discernable shift-leaning to one side, forward into  the  group,  leans  back  in  the  chair ,  or  removes eyeglasses -and asks in an approachable voice-'So what's your understanding of what we do now?' The facilitator shown in video 8.5 uses space and voice variation in three stages to check the group's understanding.

Video 8.5.

Sufficient consensus  is  mathematically challenging  in  a  group  of  three  or  in  a  twoto-two  split.  Make  a  working  agreement  that disagreements  based  on  principles  will  be explored; disagreements based on preferences will  give  way  to  values-based  choices.  Use  a values  matrix  on  important  decisions.  Name values  important  to  protect  when  making  the decision. Rate each choice as high, medium, or low in meeting each value. Most often this will clarify the decision-making process.

High talkers often have limited consciousness  of  their  behavior  and  its  effect  on  others. Two ideas might help. Anonymously ask members  to  respond  to  questions  on  post-it  notes. Each  should  list  three  to  five  aspects  of  the group's work they value, and three to five practices that make the group less effective. Use the wall of silence strategy (appendix A) in which members place the post-it notes on a flip chart or wall,  and  silently  rearrange  them  placing  them into categories. Allow time for reflection. Now ask, 'What are you seeing? What surprises are there? What might we keep doing? What might we  change?'  Another  approach  is  to  use  the round-robin reflection strategies in which members silently respond to this prompt. 'What are some of the decisions you were making about when  and  how  to  participate  and  what  were some of the effects of those decisions on you and the group?' After a minute or so, have members take turns reporting, with no interruptions.

The  urgent  is  always  present.  Scheduling  a  special  event,  determining  a  response to  an  emotional  event,  or  responses  to  an unexpected  change  in  schedule,  are  some examples. Two approaches help groups keep their  major  energy  on  the  important  items. First  post  an  agenda.  List  estimated  times for  each  item  and  what  the  group  is  to  do. Name each item as a product: develop, assess, decide, understand. Name who is to lead the conversation on each. Place the urgent last on the agenda because if it is first it will consume available time. List hard to talk about topics

early,  so  members  have  a  chance  to  recover equanimity. See agenda samples in chapter 7.

## The Citizen Facilitator

How can small groups, such as those with only three or four members, retain facilitation functions even without a designated facilitator who stays outside the conversation?

One of the authors worked with an elementary school in which grade-level teams met one hour a week to focus on instructional improvement. In each team, one teacher was designated to  be  the  facilitator.  Each  team's  charge  was to set annual grade-level goals, develop units, plan  lessons,  and  assess  student  work  results. Yet  by  midyear,  the  teams  were  struggling. Many  teachers  were  frustrated.  Some  teams had  developed  three  goals  for  the  year;  some had none; some had just one. They were good people, smart teachers with time and resources, yet they were floundering.

The  school  in  this  example  began  its collaborative  work  without  clear  intentions. Of course, student improvement is a goal, but how does collaborative work help the group to achieve this? The school leadership established structures, roles, times for the group to collaborate, and a menu of tasks on which to work. Yet tools were not provided. Time without tools is counterproductive.

In  conversations  with  facilitators,  other administrators, and one of the authors, the principal began to articulate her intention in having groups work together to make systematic inquiries into the relationship between teaching and student  learning. Strategies  for  collaborative work were learned.

The notion of a citizen facilitator emerged, one who may be designated for any amount of time (i.e., from one meeting to one semester to the life of the group), and has three responsibilities:

- · To serve as a two-way conduit between the team and the principal, informing the team of  the  principal's  priorities  and  requests,
- and informing the principal of the group's ideas and recommendations.
- · To serve as professional developer to the group-providing  foundation  knowledge about  group  processes,  an  awareness  of the  distinction  between  dialogue  and  discussion,  and  the  tools  for  conversing, planning, and problem solving.
- · To be the person in the group who maintains a macro perspective, using 'helicopter' viewing to anticipate and assess when members are stuck or fatigued, and to be the  person  who  initiates  the  processes  to get energy and information flowing again.

Rather  than  having  a  neutral  facilitator, the  intention  in  citizen-facilitated  meetings is to  have  facilitated  conversations.  If  the designated  facilitator  will  be  an  active  voice within  the  room,  then  the  group  itself  must take on the knowledge and skills base of the facilitator. It is imperative that group members acquire this knowledge, for in a small group led  by  a  citizen  facilitator,  group  members will want to suggest approaches to the group's work, take on charting responsibilities, or remind the group to get on task.

The following is a list of duties performed by a citizen facilitator.

- · Develop the agenda either before the meeting or with the group.
- · Open the meeting.
- · Achieve role clarification so that members can  periodically  and  informally  rise  to facilitate or record 'I will sometimes want to  comment, so will ask someone else to facilitate. While I am facilitating, if someone goes on for too long, what would you like me to do?'
- · Describe the task as a product-what the group will see or hear when done.
- · Call on others to start the conversation.
- · Engage in conversation as appropriate.
- · Protect processes, especially one topic and one process at a time.

- · Initiate transitions.
- · Ask who will do what by when.
- · Call for meeting assessment.
- · Close meeting.

## Developing Confidence as a Facilitator

Extensive literature supports the idea that beliefs about oneself translate into actions and results.  Facilitator  self-confidence  is  a  dimension  of  efficacy  applied  to  the  specific  work of  conducting  meetings. As  previously  noted, efficacious  persons  believe  that  they  have knowledge  and  skills  that,  when  applied  to  a goal, will overcome obstacles.

Such self-confidence derives from reflection  on  experiences,  conversations  with  colleagues, and support from coaches or leaders. This chapter closes with the topic of ways to develop confidence. No one who is beginning to  facilitate  is  a  blank  slate.  Each  person begins  the  journey  to  increasingly  effective facilitation  with  unique strengths and unique things to learn.

Because  there  are  fewer  opportunities  to facilitate than to teach, teachers invent ways to increase  their  facilitation  skills.  Gather  information about conducting meetings. Isolate and over-practice essential skills like paraphrasing, pausing, probing, and inquiring. Use these anywhere and everywhere. The more you practice, the sooner these skills will move to a level of unconscious  competence,  so  that  you  don't need  to  think  about  them  anymore  when  you are facilitating.

Isolate and practice other skills as well. Listen to a group when your back is turned to them and  record  what  you  hear  on  a  chart.  Observe the group with diffused vision to get a sense of the  group  as  a  unit,  to  monitor  breathing,  and to assess energy levels. Select a small group of moves and strategies from appendix A and use them repeatedly until you are comfortable with them. If you are a teacher, most of the strategies can be used in the classroom. Use a 'Proficiency

Scale' to assess your current level of facilitation effectiveness  and  plan  steps  for  improvement (Garmston and Zimmerman, 2013).

Practice in classrooms, in shopping malls, in conversations,  in  any  settings  in  which you  are  interacting  with  other  people.  Of  all the verbal skills, we encourage overpracticing paraphrasing.  Use  it  when  you  need  it  least, then you will have this skill available when you need it most.

Enlarge  your  repertoire.  Pay  attention  to others' facilitation styles and language. Jot down phrases they use. Isolate certain language forms to  practice.  Jot  down  in  advance  any  phrases you would like to incorporate into your next facilitation. Practice facilitation phrases when you are  working  with  students.  Keep  in  mind  that knowing is different from understanding.

Seek vicarious experiences. It's been demonstrated that one way to personal efficacy is to watch someone who performs well (Goddard, Hoy, and Woolfolk-Hoy, 2004) Talk with

## Forget the Apple: Two Minutes a Day Brings Confidence Your Way

Confident postures (taking more space  and  open  stances)  increase  testosterone  and  decrease  cortisol  leading to feelings of confidence and high tolerance for risk in both men and women. A simple two-minute power-pose manipulation  was  enough  to  significantly  alter the  physiological,  mental,  and  feeling states of  participants  (Carney,  Cuddy, and Yap, 2010). Measurements included electrocardiogram, saliva, and interview data. The daily practice implications are great for mental health. Facilitators could assume a superman (or woman) pose for two minutes before a meeting or important event. Admission: it works. Hint: do this in private.

such  people;  explore  their  reasons  for  certain moves. Ask  them  to  offer  you  ideas,  suggestions, and support.

Hold  an  object  such  as  a  pencil  in  your hand. For some reason, that helps many people to stay grounded. Focus on the group, not yourself. Focusing on yourself is a sure ticket to discomfort. Know that mistakes are your teacher.

Finally, inquire into your own inferences about others. 'The challenging internal work of  facilitation,'  Roger  Schwarz  reminds  us, 'is to identify and explore the core values and assumptions that guide your actions, to rigorously reflect on how they increase or decrease your effectiveness, and to develop a new set of  values  and  assumptions  that  you  can  use to increase your effectiveness and that of the groups you work with' (2002, p. 66). Presuming  positive  intentions,  the  last  of  the  seven norms of collaboration, influences good work with  groups.  However,  using  the  language of  positive  presuppositions  ('Given  your  interest in resolving this . . .') is not enough if your nonverbal behaviors belie what you say. Presuming  positive  intentions  is  a  matter  of respect for others. Its Latin origin, respecere , means  to  look  again,  highlighting  the  active nature of respect. Developing as an effective facilitator requires reflection and inquiry into your  own  attitudes,  assumptions,  and  beliefs about  others  and  the  potential  of  group  wisdom in a facilitative environment (Ravlin and Prickett, 2014).

According to Ravlin and Prickett (2014) the  workings  of  positive  presuppositions  are grounded  in  expectancy  theory,  first  proposed  as  a  model  by  Victor  Vroom  (1964), and  brought  into  the  twenty-first  century  by Redmond (2010) and others. Positive presuppositions  convey expectancy , in the  theory's terms: the belief that one's effort can or will indeed  result  in  attaining  the  stated  outcome or  stance.  We  know  a  facilitator  who  sometimes  starts  with  a  new  group  by  saying. 'I'm pleased to be here as I only work with smart groups,' with a gesture drawing the full group into this definition. The group will live up to the expectancy of the facilitator just as teacher expectations influence teacher behaviors, which influence student achievement.

## Conclusion

Facilitators manage group energy, focus attention, and manage information. They give directions, clarify tasks, frame group perceptions, encourage participation, test assumptions, synthesize ideas, encourage participation, and support the group in its own development. At times they intervene to help groups work more effectively and develop collective potential.

Stakeholders  have  different  perspectives. A facilitator serves the system by bringing consciousness about the different perspectives. As we depart  from  unproductive  school  cultures, the  facilitation  role  takes  on  even  more  value than  it  did  in  the  past.  It  is  one  of  four  leadership  roles  played  by  all  players  in  adaptive schools, yet it is still the role least occupied by teachers  and  classified  staff.  Developing  as  a facilitator is challenging, because it entails high levels  of  several  skill  sets.  Improvement  resources include self study, modeling, attending workshops,  and  self  assessement  with  proficiency scales and facilitian rubrics are helpful.

Finally, great facilitators help their groups see themselves not as they are but as they might become. As  we  shall  see  in  the  next  chapter, both  design  and  facilitation  play  important roles in developing groups.

## PART IV

## RESOURCES FOR INQUIRY

B leaders help groups articulate the underlying mental models that might be y shining the light of consciousness on essential inner structures, skilled limiting perspectives and possibilities.

Adaptive  leaders  disturb  the  system  for positive change. They see the group's potential for  working  effectively  and  efficiently  on  the right work by providing support for steady performance  improvements.  These  leaders  move beyond  tinkering  with  surface  practices  by pushing their groups to work at deeper levels that engage the beliefs and values that motivate collective learning and growth.

the  surface  of  group  phenomena  to  seek  the underlying  drivers  of  these  observable  behaviors. This section continues by presenting an  intervention  model  for  directing  energy as a vital resource to increase the potency of groups as systems. Finally, we describe structures and tools for facilitating inquiry-driven data teams.

Part IV offers a description of six domains of  group  development  leaders  can  target  to assess  and  modify  their  practices.  These  include: 'Getting Work Done,' 'Doing the Right Work,'  'Working  Collaboratively,'  'Managing  Systems,'  'Developing  the  Group,'  and 'Adapting to Change.'

In addition we will explore group energy as a powerful resource for this type of work. Here  we  present  a  model  for  looking  below
