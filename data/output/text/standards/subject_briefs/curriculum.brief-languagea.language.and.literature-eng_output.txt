I. Course description and aims
The language A: language and literature course aims at studying
the complex and dynamic nature of language and exploring both
its practical and aesthetic dimensions. The course will explore the
crucial role language plays in communication, reflecting experience
and shaping the world, and the roles of individuals themselves
as producers of language. Throughout the course, students will
explore the various ways in which language choices, text types,
literary forms and contextual elements all effect meaning.
Through close analysis of various text types and literary forms,
students will consider their own interpretations, as well as the
critical perspectives of others, to explore how such positions are
shaped by cultural belief systems and to negotiate meanings for texts.
The aims of studies in language and literature courses are to enable
students to:
z
z engage with a range of texts, in a variety of media and forms, from different periods, styles and cultures z
z develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, writing, viewing, presenting and performing z
z develop skills in interpretation, analysis and evaluation z
z develop sensitivity to the formal and aesthetic qualities of texts and
an appreciation of how they contribute to diverse responses and open up multiple meanings z
z develop an understanding of relationships between texts and a
variety of perspectives, cultural contexts, and local and global issues,
and an appreciation of how they contribute to diverse responses and open up multiple meanings z
z develop an understanding of the relationships between studies in language and literature and other disciplines z
z communicate and collaborate in a confident and creative way z
z foster a lifelong interest in and enjoyment of language and literature.

The Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19 age
range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and inquiring,
but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to develop
intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core. Students study two
modern languages (or a modern language and a classical language), a humanities or social
science subject, an experimental science, mathematics and one of the creative arts.
Instead of an arts subject, students can choose two subjects from another area. It is this
comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma Programme a demanding
course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance. In
each of the academic areas students have flexibility in making their choices, which
means they can choose subjects that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.
Normally, three subjects (and not more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and
the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends 240 teaching hours
for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than at SL.
In addition, three core elements—the extended essay, theory of knowledge and creativity,
activity, service—are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.
This IB DP subject brief has three key components:

I. Course description and aims
The language A: literature aims at exploring the various manifesta tions of literature as a particularly powerful mode of writing across
cultures and throughout history. The course aims at developing
an understanding of factors that contribute to the production
and reception of literature—the creativity of writers and readers,
the nature of their interaction with their respective contexts and
with literary tradition, the ways in which language can give rise to
meaning and/or effect, and the performative and transformative
potential of literary creation and response. Through close analysis
of a range of literary texts in a number of literary forms and from
different times and places, students will consider their own inter pretations as well as the critical perspectives of others, to explore
how such positions are shaped by cultural belief systems and to negotiate meanings for texts.
The aims of studies in language and literature courses are to enable
students to:
z
z engage with a range of texts, in a variety of media and forms, from different periods, styles and cultures z
z develop skills in listening, speaking, reading, writing, viewing, presenting and performing z
z develop skills in interpretation, analysis and evaluation z
z develop sensitivity to the formal and aesthetic qualities of texts and
an appreciation of how they contribute to diverse responses and open up multiple meanings z
z develop an understanding of relationships between texts and a
variety of perspectives, cultural contexts, and local and global issues,
and an appreciation of how they contribute to diverse responses and open up multiple meanings z
z develop an understanding of the relationships between studies in language and literature and other disciplines z
z communicate and collaborate in a confident and creative way z
z foster a lifelong interest in and enjoyment of language and literature.

Language ab initio
First assessment 2020 © International Baccalaureate Organization 2018
International Baccalaureate® | Baccalauréat International® | Bachillerato Internacional®
I. Course description and aims
Language acquisition consists of two modern language courses—
language ab initio and language B—designed to provide students
with the necessary skills and intercultural understanding to enable
them to communicate successfully in an environment where the language studied is spoken.
Offered at SL only, language ab initio is a language acquisition course
designed for students with no previous experience in—or very little exposure to—the target language.
Language ab initio students develop their receptive, productive and
interactive skills while learning to communicate in the target language in familiar and unfamiliar contexts.
Students develop the ability to communicate through the study of
language, themes and texts. There are five prescribed themes: identities,
experiences, human ingenuity, social organization and sharing the planet.
While the themes are common to both language ab initio and language
B, the language ab initio syllabus additionally prescribes four topics for
each of the five themes, for a total of 20 topics that must be addressed over the two years of the course.
The following language acquisition aims are common to both language ab initio and language B.
•	 Develop international-mindedness through the study of
languages, cultures, and ideas and issues of global significance.
•	 Enable students to communicate in the language they have
studied in a range of contexts and for a variety of purposes.
•	 Encourage, through the study of texts and through social
interaction, an awareness and appreciation of a variety of perspectives of people from diverse cultures.
•	 Develop students’ understanding of the relationship between
the languages and cultures with which they are familiar.
•	 Develop students’ awareness of the importance of language in relation to other areas of knowledge.
•	 Provide students, through language learning and the process of
inquiry, with opportunities for intellectual engagement and the
development of critical- and creative-thinking skills.
•	 Provide students with a basis for further study, work and leisure through the use of an additional language.
•	 Foster curiosity, creativity and a lifelong enjoyment of language learning.
II. Curriculum model overview
The curriculum is organized around five prescribed themes and 20
prescribed topics with which the students engage though written, audio, visual and audio-visual texts.

I. Course description and aims
Language acquisition consists of two modern language courses—
language ab initio and language B—designed to provide students
with the necessary skills and intercultural understanding to enable
them to communicate successfully in an environment where the language studied is spoken.
Language B is a language acquisition course designed for students
with some previous experience of the target language. Students
further develop their ability to communicate through the study
of language, themes and texts. There are five prescribed themes:
identities, experiences, human ingenuity, social organization and sharing the planet.
Both language B SL and HL students learn to communicate in the target
language in familiar and unfamiliar contexts. The distinction between
language B SL and HL can be seen in the level of competency the
student is expected to develop in receptive, productive and interactive skills.
At HL the study of two literary works originally written in the target
language is required and students are expected to extend the range
and complexity of the language they use and understand in order
to communicate. Students continue to develop their knowledge of
vocabulary and grammar, as well as their conceptual understanding
of how language works, in order to construct, analyse and evaluate
arguments on a variety of topics relating to course content and the target language culture(s).
The following language acquisition aims are common to both language ab initio and language B.
•	 Develop international-mindedness through the study of
languages, cultures, and ideas and issues of global significance.
•	 Enable students to communicate in the language they have
studied in a range of contexts and for a variety of purposes.
•	 Encourage, through the study of texts and through social
interaction, an awareness and appreciation of a variety of perspectives of people from diverse cultures.
•	 Develop students’ understanding of the relationship between
the languages and cultures with which they are familiar.
•	 Develop students’ awareness of the importance of language in relation to other areas of knowledge.
•	 Provide students, through language learning and the process of
inquiry, with opportunities for intellectual engagement and the
development of critical- and creative-thinking skills.

or social science subject, an experimental science, mathematics and one of the creative
arts. Instead of an arts subject, students can choose two subjects from another area.
It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma Programme a
demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university
entrance. In each of the academic areas students have flexibility in making their
choices, which means they can choose subjects that particularly interest them and
that they may wish to study further at university.
Normally, three subjects (and not more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and
the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends 240 teaching hours for
HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than at SL.
In addition, three core elements—the extended essay, theory of knowledge and creativity, activity,
service—are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.
This IB DP subject brief has four key components:

I. Course description and aims
The business management course is designed to meet the current and future needs of students who
want to develop their knowledge of business content, concepts and tools to assist with business decision making. Future employees, business leaders, entrepreneurs or social entrepreneurs need to be confident,
creative and compassionate as change agents for business in an increasingly interconnected global
marketplace. The business management course is designed to encourage the development of these attributes.
Through the exploration of four interdisciplinary concepts: creativity, change, ethics and
sustainability, this course empowers students to explore these concepts from a business perspective.
Business management focuses on business functions, management processes and decision-making in contemporary contexts of strategic uncertainty.
Students examine how business decisions are influenced by factors that are internal and external to
an organization and how these decisions impact upon a range of internal and external stakeholders.
Emphasis is placed on strategic decision-making and the operational business functions of human
resource management, finance and accounts, marketing, and operations management.
Business management is a challenging and dynamic discipline that more than meets the needs of our
students growing and developing in a complex business environment. This course prepares students to be
global citizens ready to face up to the challenges and opportunities awaiting them in our ever-changing world.

I. Course description and aims
The DP philosophy course provides students with an opportunity to undertake systematic critical
inquiry into profound and challenging questions, such as: What does it mean to be human? What is the
relationship between justice, freedom and equality? What do we mean when we say something is right
or wrong? These abstract questions arise out of our everyday experiences, and the practice of philosophy
deepens and clarifies our understanding of these questions, as well as possible responses.
The aim of the philosophy course is to engage students in philosophical activity, enabling them to:
•
develop an inquiring and intellectually curious way of thinking •
appreciate the diversity of perspectives, traditions and approaches within philosophical thinking •
critically examine their own experiences and perspectives • learn from the thinking of others • articulate their own views, ideas and arguments •
apply their philosophical knowledge and skills to the world around them.
II. Curriculum model overview
The DP philosophy course comprises a shared core syllabus for all SL and HL students, consisting of the
study of the core theme “Being human”, one optional theme and one prescribed text, as well as the
completion of the internal assessment exercise. In addition, students at HL must study one further optional
theme as well as the HL extension topic “Philosophy and contemporary issues”. The recommended
teaching hours for each element of the course are summarised below.
