## CHARACTERISTICS OF TRUST

Research by Bryk and Schneider (2002) both stunned the educational world and confirmed what most believed: that trust was a necessary, but by itself insufficient, resource for improved student learning. Schools whose test scores were increasing over the period of this seven-year study had high levels of relational trust. In contrast, low-performing schools had low levels of trust. The leader, or principal in these cases, was instrumental in fostering climates in which relational trust could flourish. The researchers defined relational trust as the trust that is developed through the interpersonal social exchanges that take place in a school community: principal to teacher, principal to parent, teacher to teacher, teacher to student, and teacher to parent. Relational trust is built on four criteria: respect, competence, personal regard for others, and integrity.

- Respect is valuing the role each person plays in a child's education and being genuinely listened to.
- Competence is how well a person performs a role.
- Personal regard is the perception of how one goes beyond what is required of his/her role in caring for another person.
- Integrity is the consistency between what people say and what they do.
