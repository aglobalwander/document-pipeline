## Possible Avenues for Collecting Data

A range of possibilities exists for collecting data on the research questions above. One possible avenue for collecting data might be in-depth interviews with teachers, students, parents, and members of the community. Other possible sources of data might be videos or audiotapes of coaching conversations, teacher journals, teacher testimonies, lesson plans, teacher language, teacher questions, commercially prepared instruments, observations, and instruments in educational journals or papers. Other possibilities include measuring levels of use and stages of concern from the Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM) (Hall and Hord 2001) and observing interactions in schools and classrooms. Researchers could administer a variety of instruments before, during, and after Cognitive Coaching has been implemented.
