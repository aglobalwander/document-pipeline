## WHAT IS TEACHING?

Teaching is knowing about, inquiring into, and experimenting with content and curriculum, learners and learning, fellow teachers and teaching, and educational philosophies and goals. Teaching is also about clear values and working within the contexts of various classrooms, schools, communities, and cultures. Teaching is about applying all of this integrated knowledge in a unit of instruction, a lesson, or an in-themoment interaction.

Teachers enter the profession as novices, and a small percentage of these develop into experts. Sternberg and Horvath (1995) and Hattie (2003) characterize the expert stage as the point at which teachers have greater knowledge, are more efficient, and are more insightful than teachers at any earlier stage of development. Teachers maintain a capacity for learning throughout their careers. However, experience alone is not enough; growth is not automatic. Growth occurs by reflecting on experience and effectively using higher-order thinking processes to plan, monitor, evaluate, and modify educational tasks . Self-directed teachers practice careful reflection. They learn lessons each time they teach, evaluating what they do and using these self-critical evaluations to adjust what they do next time (Office for Standards in Education 2004, 10; Tokuhama-Espinosa 2014). Teachers are more likely to increase their capacity for learning when their thinking is mediated in a learningcentered work culture.

Expert teachers continue to develop and grow as they construct meaning, reinvest their cognitive resources, and apply new learning. As discussed in chapter 8, higher-concept teachers produce students who achieve at higher academic levels. Cognitive Coaching mediates this type of career-long development.
