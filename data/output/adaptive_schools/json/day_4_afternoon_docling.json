( Trainer does a mild slap to forehead.) Participants share responses to prompt on the screen.\n\nOPTION 3Trainer may select other appropriate activator depending on time.\n\n## WHAT and WHY?\n\n5th Meeting Standard\n\n2 types of conflict -- cognitive and affective\n\n1 -- meetings productive\n\n1 -- meetings unproductive\n\nCognitive conflict -&gt; disagreements among group members about substantive issues like goals , values , assumptions .\n\nproductive tensions tend to improve team effectiveness\n\nWhy: Meetings safe -not necessarily comfortable . Always comfortablenot talking about right things .\n\nEncouraging cognitive conflict supports group focus , creativity , communication , and decision-making .\n\n## HOW?\n\nReading\n\nENGAGE COGNITIVE CONFLICT\n\nLG, p. 94-95\n\nENGAGE COGNITIVE CONFLICT\n\n## WHAT?\n\nOne of the 5 Meeting Standards. Cognitive Conflict is disagreements among group members about substantive issues like goals, values, and assumptions.\n\n## WHY?\n\nRecognizing productive tensions tend to improve team effectiveness.\n\nHOW?\n\nRead directions on the screen.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nThe fifth meeting standard is Engage Cognitive Conflict. We're differentiating between two kinds of conflict: cognitive and affective. One makes meetings productive; one makes meetings unproductive.\n\nOn pp. 76-77, you'll see descriptions of the two kinds of conflict.\n\nDesignate A &amp; B with your partner.\n\n## WHAT?\n\nstrategy --&gt; engaging cognitive conflict\n\n## WHY?\n\nanticipate affective conflict / arrives --&gt; prepared to embrace\n\n## HOW?\n\nteach strategy as I would teach to group at beginning of meeting anticipating conflict conversations in which diverse opinions are held\n\n## Disagreement Grid:\n\nIndividually, QUICK!

DISAGREEMENT\n\n## GRID\n\n## WHAT?\n\nA 'hot' strategy for engaging cognitive conflict: Disagreement Grid\n\n## WHY?\n\nWhen we anticipate conflict or affective conflict arrives in a group, we need to be prepared to embrace it.\n\n## HOW?\n\n## Suggested Language\n\nI'm going to teach you this strategy as I would teach it to a group at the beginning of a meeting where I was anticipating conflict.\n\nShow slide or draw on chart 4 X 4 grid. (If drawing, ask participants to assume that each square is equal in dimension to the other squares.)\n\nAsk participants, ' How many squares do you see?'\n\nAs each number is offered, write it on a chart without comment.\n\nOPTIONAL: After several numbers are recorded, stop and ask people who saw different\n\nWHAT?\n\nPhrases to engage cognitive conflict\n\n## WHY?\n\nNeed replacement language -&gt; stems a stem of connection -&gt;psychological safety and create connectivity and integration among ideas and group members .

STEMS OF CONNECTION\n\n## LG, p. 96 WHAT?\n\nPhrases to use to engage cognitive conflict\n\n## WHY?\n\nTo have a variety of ways to engage cognitive conflict.\n\nWhen encouraging cognitive conflict, group members use such stems of connection to promote psychological safety and to create connectivity and integration among ideas and group members.\n\nAllows for the expression of diverse and divergent ideas\n\n## HOW?\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nWhen encouraging cognitive conflict, group members use such stems of connection to promote psychological safety and to create connectivity and integration among ideas and group members. This also allows for the expression of diverse and divergent ideas. In order to keep the connection between the speakers and the ideas, pausing, paraphrasing, and sometimes posing questions are necessary before using a stem of connection.\n\nTrainer may verbally review the points made in the What? and Why? of Engage Cognitive Conflict above.\n\nPairs read/practice stems of connection in Learning Guide and select one that might work for them. Also, Pairs can share which Stems might be useful in an upcoming meeting. Trainer can model use of Stems of Connection with a participant.\n\nShare what think impact might be.\n\nCould be weapons -&gt; if not principle centered . -&gt; productive behaviors .\n\nOffer directions on the slide.\n\n## Engage Cognitive Conflict\n\nReview the list of strategies on the charts and indicate those which might decrease affective conflict and those which might increase cognitive conflict.\n\nHow do you know someone is in Affective Conflict Raised voice, shutting down, push back, nonverbals\n\nSkill going to use first?

So without conflict, we cannot have true community. We will have what Scott Peck calls 'pseudo-community' in which people play nice. To attain true community, we have to engage cognitive conflict.\n\nGiven our exploration this morning, how has what you have explored, clarified the coin of community for you?\n\n#3 -creating environment for greatest safety , greatest learning\n\n## DESIGN THE SURROUND\n\nLG, p. 99-102\n\n## OPTIONAL\n\n## WHAT?\n\nStation Naming on the Agenda Chart\n\n## WHY?\n\nStation Naming re-acclimates participants to agenda for the day.

It is about the physical arrangement of the meeting room to support the group's purposes and tasks. This includes the seating arrangements, placement of visuals, and creating the emotional climate for productive group work.\n\n## WHY?\n\nDavid Perkins, in his book Smart Schools (1992), describes the surround as the meeting room features which by their very presence mediate thinking and behaviors.\n\n## HOW?\n\nUsing slide, cross stitch back to STRUCTURES FOR SUCCESSFUL MEETINGS\n\nDecide on Decision-making\n\n- -Clearly answering the question, 'Who decides?'\n- -Clarifying 'What topics are ours?'\n\nDevelop Standards\n\n-What are the best practices of successful meetings?\n\nDesign the Surround\n\n-What meeting room features will support the work?\n\nSuggested Language\n\n:\n\nDesign the Surround is a Structure for Successful Meetings.

The work space communicates and structures the desired interaction. The work space should comfortably accommodate collaborative participants, charts, physical movement, and subgrouping.\n\nSeating\n\n: All participants and facilitator need to be able to see and hear each other. Seating arrangements should be spacious enough to meet the group's needs, but no larger.

(Like a train conductor naming the next stop, a trainer uses the agenda chart to update participants on where we are and where are going next in the training.)\n\nProvides a model of how to utilize a public agenda\n\n## HOW?\n\nMove to agenda and reference current topic placement.\n\n## Multi-step strategy for actualizing meeting success structures and standards\n\n## TRAINERS NOTE:\n\nIt is recommended that this strategy be modeled by the trainers and that the video be purchased and used as a resource for the group. You may choose to do the model as a Fishbowl or with the whole group.\n\n## WHAT?\n\nThe Focusing Four is a prioritizing strategy; a discussion tool for getting consensus in a brief amount of time, resulting in all voices being heard and respected in decision-making strategies.\n\n## WHY?\n\nThe more successful groups are at getting important work done in meetings, the greater their collective efficacy, a can-do sense that is undeniably linked to student success.\n\n## HOW?\n\n## Suggested Language\n\nThe Focusing Four is a prioritizing strategy; a discussion tool for getting consensus in a brief amount of time, resulting in all voices being heard and respected in decision-making strategies It is usually preceded by dialogue. Facilitators working with groups require a repertoire of strategies ranging from low structure to high structure, depending upon the task and/or nature of the group. The Focusing Four is a highly structured strategy. Decisions by 100 percent consensus are rare. Focusing Four operates on the principle of 'sufficient consensus' (introduced on Day 3) in which every member doesn't need to be in agreement for a decision to be reached but rather a critical mass, such as 75 to 80 percent is achieved. With sufficient consensus each person's views are expressed and understood by the group.\n\nFocusing Four is another multi-step strategy (as Assumptions Wall) for actualizing the structures for successful meetings.\n\nPrime the pump. Quiet reflection on what was most valuable to you and record.\n\nDemonstrate with a group. You may choose to conduct the model with the whole group or a fishbowl group of about 10 participants (e.g., ask for one volunteer per table to come to the front for the demonstration).\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nWe're going to model this strategy, as well as model for you the role of facilitator and recorder. Also you will see many of the standards used that you learned about on Day 3. For those of you observing, please pair up and designate one person who will watch the facilitator and one person who will watch the recorder.\n\nConduct demonstration/model, beginning with PAG/PAU, then TAG/TAU.\n\nSuggested topic: Of all the tools, concepts, and strategies addressed in this four day training, which will be the most valuable to take back and develop with your work groups?\n\n## FOCUSING FOUR APPLICATION / REHEARSAL\n\nAfternoon break included\n\nSame building groups or job-alike groups\n\nPAG/PAU to\n\nintroduce\n\nFocusing Four\n\nOPTIONAL\n\nTime permitting, trainer may structure small group practice, following directions on slides.\n\n## FOCUSING FOUR APPLICATION / REHEARSAL\n\nRoles: Facilitator, Recorder, Engaged Participants\n\nSTEP UP!!\n\nFacilitator uses PAG/PAU to introduce Focusing Four\n\n(OPTIONAL:  Topic As Given, Topic As Understood may also be included in practice.)\n\nConduct Focusing Four\n\n1 constant recorder--stays same share facilitation last 1--#7 applications\n\n## OPTIONAL\n\nTime permitting, trainer may structure small group practice, following directions on slides.\n\n## FOCUSING FOUR APPLICATION / REHEARSAL\n\nRoles: Facilitator, Recorder, Engaged Participants\n\nFacilitator uses PAG/PAU to introduce Focusing Four\n\n(OPTIONAL:  Topic As Given, Topic As Understood may also be included in practice.)\n\nConduct Focusing Four\n\nRecorder will get signal when it's time to write (brainstorm)\n\n1 constant recorder--stays same share facilitation last 1--#7 applications\n\n## OPTIONAL\n\nTime permitting, trainer may structure small group practice, following directions on slides.\n\nRecorders wait.
