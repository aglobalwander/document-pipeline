## CONCLUSION

Each person constitutes a distinct system of mental, emotional, cultural, and physical interplays, characterized by the unique ways in which all humans hold and process information, communicate, relate to others, learn, problem solve, and become stressed. All of these ways of being are of equal value. Any combination may be more or less intelligent, compassionate, or capable of communicating meaning. As Robert Kegan noted, 'The most powerful driver for behavioral change is a change in how one understands the world. If you want powerful ongoing changes in teaching or leadership, you have to get to the underlying beliefs and

conceptions that give rise to behaviors' (cited in Sparks 2002, 70). Although this topic goes far beyond the scope of this book, we offer several general assumptions that are useful guidelines for achieving communication free of gender, racial, or ethnic bias. The following guidelines also apply to gender sensitivity (Kochman 1983):

- 1.  If you are a different race or gender than I, you carry experiences, perceptions, and meanings that I cannot know directly.
- 2.  The origins of your perceptions, processing, and communication styles emerge from personal experience. Because they are ecologically sound, they become persevering patterns.
- 3.  To the degree that our personal histories are different, my communication may be misinterpreted by you and yours by me.
- 4.  When we have misunderstandings about communication style differences, it doesn't make them go away, but understanding the source of the differences can diminish mutual mystification and blame. This makes the world a more familiar and comfortable territory.
- 5.  Our communication and the mutual interests that bring us together provide valuable opportunities to grow and learn from each other. Our differences enrich us both.
- 6.  We all have unexamined prejudices and biases. We can work respectfully together and accomplish tasks important to us to the degree that we can become conscious of and set aside these thoughts and feelings.
- 7.  My most useful personal attributes in communicating with you are integrity, consciousness, flexibility, and interdependence, manifested through respect, openness, curiosity, and inquiry. From these sources, you and I can continue to learn more about each other.
- 8.  As a result of these assumptions, I strive to be free of ethnic, racial, and gender bias in my communication.

Cognitive Coaches use the following guidelines in their private and public communication (Bettman 1984):

- They guard against making generalizations that suggest all members of a racial, ethnic, or gender group are the same. Generalizations and stereotypes may lead to insupportable or offensive assumptions while ignoring the fact that all attributes may be found in all groups.
- They avoid qualifiers that categorize others and call attention to

- racial, ethnic, and gender stereotypes. A qualifier is additional information that suggests an exception to a rule (e.g., a 'sensitive' man, a 'mathematically gifted' girl).
- They identify others by race or ethnic origin only when relevant-and few situations require such identification.
- They consciously avoid language that to some people has questionable racial, ethnic, or sexual connotations. Although a word or phrase may not be personally offensive to you, it may be to others.
- They are aware of the possible negative implications of colorsymbolic words. They choose language and usage that does not offend people or reinforce bias.

Because the making of meaning is an individual process, Cognitive Coaches are conscious of human variability. They not only promote diversity but also are effective in working with others who possess a wide range of human variables. They recognize, respect, and understand them so they can make better connections, work together more effectively, learn and teach successfully, leverage their own and others' diverse gifts and affinities, and consciously foster individual and collective development. This is critically important to developing trust, to accelerating the learning of the coach and the person being coached, and to enhancing interdependence.

The opportunities for coaches to assist others in the process of meaning making demand continual learning about human differences and developing their capacities of consciousness and flexibility. The person with the greatest flexibility has the greatest influence.

In Hawaii, the sugar planters mixed ethnic groups on purpose, their idea being that different folks would not naturally mix and that dissension among the workers would make them easier to manage and less likely to band together against their bosses, the Lunas. What actually happened, however, is a tribute to the adaptability and resiliency of the human spirit. The workers not only got along, but of necessity they shared the very elements that made them different, even as they maintained their ethnic integrity.

First they had to adapt to their new situation. There were things they

were used to in their home cultures that they simply couldn't get in Hawaii. Second, they adopted the good things from other cultures they were exposed to, but they retained some of the important cultural elements of their own ethnic groups. Finally, they made special contributions to their new multicultural society on the plantation, a working-class culture made up of many minorities who recognized the different capacities inherit in each person and developed skills to work together. This is more than an organizational need. It is a human need: to enhance the quality of life that people individually and collectively express.
