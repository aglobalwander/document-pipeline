## THE IDENTITY OF A COGNITIVE COACH

The desired identity of a Cognitive Coach is that of a mediator of thinking, one who is devoted to fostering resourcefulness in others. We refer to this as a 'default' position. In this state, a Cognitive Coach's ego is set aside when coaching others in planning, reflecting, and problem resolving. Likewise, neuroscientists, as reported by Judson Brewer at Yale (Pollan 2015), found that the default for experienced meditators was the temporary decommissioning of ego during meditation. It is the identity as a mediator of thinking that causes a Cognitive Coach to 'default to' or automatically assume the position of supporting the thinking of others. For example, when someone shares a difficult situation, a frequently asked response might be, 'What are you going to do?' Having the identity as a mediator of thinking, would cause one, instead, to paraphrase then pose questions: 'So what are your goals?' 'What are you thinking about this?' Thinking is a core value of a mediator. Thus, mediators evaluate their own performance based on the degree to which they have helped others to become more self-directed.
