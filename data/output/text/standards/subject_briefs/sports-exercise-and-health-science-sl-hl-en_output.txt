The IB Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous, academically challenging and
balanced programme of education designed to prepare students aged 16 to 19
for success at university and life beyond. The DP aims to encourage students to be
knowledgeable, inquiring, caring and compassionate, and to develop intercultural
understanding, open-mindedness and the attitudes necessary to respect and evalu­
ate a range of viewpoints. Approaches to teaching and learning (ATL) are deliberate
strategies, skills and attitudes that permeate the teaching and learning environment.
In the DP students develop skills from five ATL categories: thinking, research, social, self-management and communication.
To ensure both breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding, students must
choose at least one subject from five groups: 1) their best language, 2) additional
language(s), 3) social sciences, 4) sciences, and 5) mathematics. Students may choose
either an arts subject from group 6, or a second subject from groups 1 to 5. At least
three and not more than four subjects are taken at higher level (240 recommended
teaching hours), while the remaining are taken at standard level (150 recommended
teaching hours). In addition, three core elements—the extended essay, theory of
knowledge and creativity, activity, service—are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.

I.  Course description and aims
Sports, exercise and health science (SEHS) is an experimental science
course combining academic study with practical and investigative
skills. SEHS explores the science underpinning physical performance
and provides the opportunity to apply these principles. The course
incorporates the disciplines of anatomy and physiology, biomechanics,
psychology and nutrition. Students cover a range of core and option
topics, and carry out practical (experimental) investigations in both
laboratory and field settings. The course offers a deeper understanding
of the issues related to sports, exercise and health in the 21st century
and addresses the international dimension and ethics related to both the individual and global context.
Apart from being worthy of study in its own right, SEHS is good prepa­
ration for courses in higher or further education related to sports fitness
and health, and serves as useful preparation for employment in sports and leisure industries.
Both the SL and HL have a common core syllabus, internal assessment
scheme, and overlapping elements in the options studied. While the
skills and activities are common to all students, HL requires additional material and topics within the options.
Through studying any of the group 4 subjects, students should become
aware of how scientists work and communicate, and the variety of forms
of the “scientific method” with an emphasis on a practical approach
through experimental work. In this context, the aims of SEHS is for
students to:
• appreciate scientific study and creativity within a global
context through stimulating and challenging opportunities
• acquire a body of knowledge, methods and techniques that characterize science and technology
• apply and use a body of knowledge, methods and techniques that characterize science and technology
• develop an ability to analyse, evaluate and synthesize scientific information
• develop a critical awareness of the need for, and the value of,
effective collaboration and communication during scientific activities
• develop experimental and investigative scientific skills including the use of current technologies
• develop and apply 21st century communication skills in the study of science
• become critically aware, as global citizens, of the ethical implications of using science and technology
• develop an appreciation of the possibilities and limitations of science and technology
• develop an understanding of the relationships between
scientific disciplines and their influence on other areas of knowledge.

The group 4 project
The group 4 project is a collaborative activity where students from
different group 4 subjects, within or between schools, work together. It
allows for concepts and perceptions from across disciplines to be shared
while appreciating the environmental, social and ethical implications
of science and technology. It can be practically or theoretically based
and aims to develop an understanding of the relationships between
scientific disciplines and their influence on other areas of knowledge. The
emphasis is on interdisciplinary cooperation and the scientific processes.
III. Assessment model
It is the intention of this course that students are able to fulfill the following assessment objectives:
1.	 Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of:
• facts, concepts, and terminology • methodologies and techniques • communicating scientific information.
2.	 Apply:
• facts, concepts, and terminology • methodologies and techniques
• methods of communicating scientific information.
3.	 Formulate, analyse and evaluate:
• hypotheses, research questions and predictions • methodologies and techniques • primary and secondary data • scientific explanations.
4.	 Demonstrate the appropriate research, experimental, and
personal skills necessary to carry out insightful and ethical investigations.
