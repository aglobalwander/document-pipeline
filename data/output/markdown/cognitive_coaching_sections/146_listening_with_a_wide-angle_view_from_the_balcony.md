## Listening with a Wide-Angle View 'from the Balcony'

Compassion, or observation without value judgment, is often a by-product of the macrocentric perspective. In the macrocentric mode, one listens from a view outside the perspective of either party-'listening from the balcony.' To a degree, you have access to and yet are detached from the feelings of identification you might have been experienced with either the egocentric or the allocentric view.

Coaches gather the most information about an interaction from this macrocentric position. The deeper that coaching maps, tools, and values are internalized, the greater the ease of going to the 'balcony.' Coaches have some understanding of their own feelings, some understanding of the other person's perspective, and an awareness of the systemic nature of the conversation. To be macrocentric is to observe the interaction from a

psychological distance without identifying with either person, imagining you are viewing the interactions from a space above you.

Knowing one's intentions and choosing behaviors from a range of possible options that are congruent with those intentions requires the ability to move in and out of these three positions. This may be the most essential requirement for exercising situational flexibility. It is also the most valuable resource in modifying coaching interactions to match the other person's ways of processing information and making meaning.
