## How Leaders Support Learning in an Agile Organization

It is not the strongest that survive environmental changes, it is the most flexible-the most intelligently agile.

Megginson (1963), writing about a statement often attributed to Charles Darwin

E arly in the development of our Cognitive Coaching training experiences, we conducted a workshop for principals in a Southern California school district. The superintendent requested he be given some time at the opening of the workshop to make some announcements to the district administrators. He announced that due to budgetary cutbacks, some administrative positions were to be eliminated. 'Some of you will not be rehired for the next school year,' he stated. 'I will examine your performance over the past year and announce my decision in the next few weeks about who will be rehired and who will be released. . . . And now I'll turn it over to Art and Bob.'

Needless to say, Cognitive Coaching did not prosper in that school district. And since that time we have become acutely aware of the culture of organizations and the attributes of leaders who create fertile ground in which the seeds of Cognitive Coaching will germinate, take root, and flourish: a culture of curiosity, thinking, and learning. This final chapter describes the attributes of an organization-an agile organization-and the dispositions and actions of the leaders of those organizations that are congruent with the principles, vision, and mission of Cognitive Coaching.
