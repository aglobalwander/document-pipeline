## LISTENING FROM YOUR MISSION

There is no effective communication without listening. Listening is the tool that turns words

into communication. Physiogically, there is a part of your brain-the thalamus-that decides where to send incoming signals. The thalamus is like a great receptionist in the office of your brain. It looks at the 'phone' in your brain, sees three lights on, and says, 'No way that brain is going to take another call-I'll just get rid of this guy.' And like a good receptionist, the thalmus is highly sensitive to what's going on in the office, sees how tense people are, and it evaluates incoming traffic.

And like great receptionists, you cannot fool your thalamus. If you say, 'I am ready to take the call' but mean 'I can't believe I've got another call now, this is totally insane, I am still . . . ,' your thalamus doesn't let real content into the decision-making parts of your brain because they are already busy.

So, if you actually listen, you have to go beyond the outward steps of 'active listening' we all learned as rote procedure for dealing with conflict. You actually have to care. You might not care about the person, you might not care about the conversation or the issue, but you do care that your behavior helps you meet your real goals, your objectives. For many people, that personal mission includes some kind of problem solving, some kind of learning, some kind of personal accountability, some kind of making the world better. Chances are, if you cannot summon one of these commitments-to the person, to your mission, to your organizationthan your communication is doomed to shades of mediocrity.

People who are able to bring their hearts online are able to listen to the message beyond the words. They are able to turn conflict into a learning experience. They persevere in spite of the complexity, the messiness, the frustration (Boase 2011).
