## CONCLUSION

The five states of mind can serve as diagnostic constructs through which we can assess the resourcefulness of others and plan interventions. However, assisting others toward refinement and expression starts first with your own states of mind. From there, you can work with others, the system of which you are a part, and even students.

Keep in mind the following three attributes of the states of mind:

- They are transitory; they come and go. A person's state of mind varies depending on a number of factors, including familiarity, experience, knowledge, fatigue, and emotion.
- They are transformational. Dramatic increases in performance

- accompany heightened states of mind. Just as one's current state of confidence will affect in-the-moment competence, the states of mind access the personal resources required for peak performance.
- They are transformable, either by oneself or by another. A colleague can cheer you up or encourage you, changing in that moment your state of mind and your capacity. Similarly, your own conscious awareness of your states of mind allows you to choose and to change them.

Holonomy captures two universal human tendencies: the self-assertive desire to preserve individual autonomy and the integrative drive to part something larger than the self. When the five states of mind are thought of as a whole, they create an inner tension that asks one to consider individual needs, the drive for autonomy, in the context of community. Together they form a thoughtful scaffold for thinking that is both interwoven and interdependent. Each of these concepts supports and contributes to the success of the other, and hence we resist the urge to separate them and attempt to observe them as independent capacities.
