## Two Goals

Cognitive Coaches work to achieve their mission by supporting people in becoming self-directed, autonomous agents and self-directed members of a group. Toward this end, Cognitive Coaches regard all interactions as learning opportunities focused on self-directedness.

The goal of learning Cognitive Coaching is to develop the capacities and identity of coaches as mediators, who can in turn help to develop the capacities for self-directedness in others. The skillful Cognitive Coach:

- Establishes and maintains trust in him/herself, relationships, processes, and the environment
- Interacts with the intention of producing self-directed learning
- Envisions, assesses, and mediates for states of mind
- Generates and applies a repertoire of strategies to enhance states of mind
- Maintains optimism in the ability to mediate his own and others' capacity for continued growth
