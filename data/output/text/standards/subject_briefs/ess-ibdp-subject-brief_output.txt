The IB Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous, academically challenging and
balanced programme of education designed to prepare students aged 16 to 19
for success at university and life beyond. The DP aims to encourage students to be
knowledgeable, inquiring, caring and compassionate, and to develop intercultural
understanding, open-mindedness and the attitudes necessary to respect and evalu ate a range of viewpoints. Approaches to teaching and learning (ATL) are deliberate
strategies, skills and attitudes that permeate the teaching and learning environment.
In the DP, students develop skills from five ATL categories: thinking, research, social, self-management and communication.
To ensure both breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding, students must
choose six courses from six distinct groups: 1) studies in language and literature; 2)
language acquisition; 3) individuals and societies; 4) sciences; 5) mathematics; 6) the
arts. Students may choose to replace the arts course with a second course from one
of the other five groups. At least three, and not more than four, subjects are taken at
higher level (240 recommended teaching hours), while the remaining are taken at
standard level (150 recommended teaching hours). In addition, three core
elements—the extended essay, theory of knowledge and creativity, activity,
service—are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.
These DP subject briefs illustrate four key course components.

I. Course description and aims
Environmental systems and societies (ESS) is an interdisciplinary
course offered only at standard level (SL). This course can fulfill ei ther the individuals and societies or the sciences requirement. Al ternatively, this course enables students to satisfy the requirements
of both subjects groups simultaneously while studying one course.
ESS is firmly grounded in both a scientific exploration of environmen tal systems in their structure and function, and in the exploration of
cultural, economic, ethical, political and social interactions of societies
with the environment. As a result of studying this course, students
will become equipped with the ability to recognize and evaluate
the impact of our complex system of societies on the natural world.
The interdisciplinary nature of the DP course requires a broad skill set
from students, including the ability to perform research and investiga tions, participation in philosophical discussion and problem-solving. The
course requires a systems approach to environmental understanding and
promotes holistic thinking about environmental issues. Teachers explic itly teach thinking and research skills such as comprehension, text analy sis, knowledge transfer and use of primary sources. They encourage stu dents to develop solutions at the personal, community and global levels.
The aims of the DP environmental systems and societies course are to enable students to:
• acquire the knowledge and understandings of environmental systems and issues at a variety of scales
• apply the knowledge, methodologies and skills to analyse
environmental systems and issues at a variety of scales
• appreciate the dynamic interconnectedness between environmental systems and societies
• value the combination of personal, local and global perspectives
in making informed decisions and taking responsible actions on environmental issues
• be critically aware that resources are finite, that these could be
inequitably distributed and exploited, and that management of these inequities is the key to sustainability
• develop awareness of the diversity of environmental value systems
• develop critical awareness that environmental problems are
caused and solved by decisions made by individuals and societies that are based on different areas of knowledge
• engage with the controversies that surround a variety of environmental issues
• create innovative solutions to environmental issues by engaging actively in local and global contexts.

The group 4 project
ESS students have the option to participate in the group 4 project. For
those who participate, 10 hours of practical activities will be replaced with 10 hours of work on the group 4 project.
The group 4 project is a collaborative activity where students from dif ferent group 4 subjects, within or between schools, work together. It al lows for concepts and perceptions from across disciplines to be shared
while appreciating the environmental, social and ethical implications of
science and technology. It can be practically or theoretically based and
aims to develop an understanding of the relationships between scientif ic disciplines and their influence on other areas of knowledge. The em phasis is on interdisciplinary cooperation and the scientific processes.
III. Assessment model
There are four assessment objectives for the DP environmental systems
and societies course. Having followed the course at SL, students will be expected to do the following.
Assessment objective 1
Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of relevant:
• facts and concepts • methodologies and techniques • values and attitudes.
Assessment objective 2
Apply this knowledge and understanding in the analysis of:
• explanations, concepts and theories • data and models • case studies in unfamiliar contexts • arguments and value systems.
Assessment objective 3
Evaluate, justify and synthesize, as appropriate:
• explanations, theories and models • arguments and proposed solutions • methods of fieldwork and investigation • cultural viewpoints and value systems.
Assessment objective 4
Engage with investigations of environmental and societal issues at the local and global level through:
• evaluating the political, economic and social contexts of issues
• selecting and applying the appropriate research and practical skills necessary to carry out investigations
• suggesting collaborative and innovative solutions that
demonstrate awareness and respect for the cultural differences and value systems of others.
