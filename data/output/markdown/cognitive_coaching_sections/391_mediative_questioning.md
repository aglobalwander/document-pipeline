## Mediative Questioning

E ffective Cognitive Coaches are aware of the direct correlation between the structure of their questions and the production of thought processes. As such, they deliberately use language and syntax to construct questions in ways that mediate desired mental processes in the other person's mind.

The following sample questions come from planning and reflective conversations. The questions are designed to mediate specific mental processes. These questions are only examples, however, and they are not meant to be prescriptive.

The coach's intent with these questions is to engage, mediate, and thereby enhance another's cognitive functions. The questions are adroitly designed and posed to deliberately engage the intellectual functions of teaching. The long-range intent, of course, is self-coaching: to help the other person reach a point where he or she habitually and autonomously initiates such questions without the coach's intervention.

The left-hand column in each chart contains desired cognitive thoughts and processes. The right-hand column contains sample questions. Specific syntax cues in the questions are in boldface type. As you analyze these examples, you may wish to refer to chapter 3 to review the criteria for constructing powerful, mediative questions.
