APPENDIX B – Responses to the Public Drafts

Executive Summary
Several rounds of review were built into the development process of the Next Generation
Science Standards (NGSS) to make sure that all educators and stakeholders would have
opportunities to provide feedback.  The first public draft of the NGSS was posted online from
May 11 to June 1, 2012, and the second public draft was posted online from January 8 to January
29, 2013.  The draft received comments from over 10,000 individuals during each of the two
public review periods, including those in lead state review teams, school and school district
discussion groups, and scientific societies.  The writers then used this feedback to make substantial revisions to the draft standards.

Overall, the feedback received on both public drafts of the NGSS was very positive.  Almost all
reviewers indicated that they liked the pedagogical vision, the integration of the three dimensions
in the NGSS and the structure of the NGSS itself.  Most reviewers scored the performance
expectations highly, but some also critiqued specific issues and suggested improvements.  The
following themes emerged from the comments on how to improve the first public draft:
 Concern that there was too much material  Suggestions for additional topics  Lack of language clarity
 Concern about how engineering and technology was included and addressed
 Confusion about the role of the one practice specified in each performance expectation
 Lack of guidance for incorporating crosscutting concepts
 Lack of specificity in connections to other standards and other subjects  Concern about the organization of the standards
 Concern about the amount of support needed for implementation of the standards

Based on the feedback, the following changes were made between the first and second public
drafts:
 95% of the Performance Expectations (PEs) were rewritten based on feedback, with more specific and consistent language used
 After a college- and career-readiness review, some content was removed  Some content shifted grade levels in elementary
 Engineering was  integrated into the traditional science disciplines
 More math expectations were added to the performance expectations
 Course models were drafted for middle and high school
 “Nature of science” concepts were highlighted throughout the document  The practices matrix was revised
 A new chapter was added to describe the intent and use of crosscutting concepts
 A new chapter on equity was drafted about implementation of the NGSS with diverse student groups  A glossary of terms was added
 More flexibility in viewing the standards was provided by arranging the performance
expectations according to both topic and Disciplinary Core Idea (DCI)

The feedback on the second public draft indicated that changes had completely addressed some
issues, and the percentage of reviewers concerned about the remaining issues was greatly reduced.  Those remaining issues included:

 Concern that there was still too much material  Suggestions for a few additional topics  Lack of language clarity
 Concern about including and addressing engineering and technology
 Confusion about the role of the one practice specified in each performance expectation
 Concern about the amount of support needed for implementation of the standards
 Confusion about the coding/naming of performance expectations

Based on the feedback, the following changes were made between the second public draft and the final release of the NGSS:
 75% of the PEs were edited to increase clarity, consistency, and specific feedback.
 A review of the central focus of each DCI from the Framework resulted in the removal
of about 33% of the PEs and associated DCIs while retaining the progression of DCIs across the grade bands
 Separate ETS1: Engineering Design performance expectations were added to each grade
band to supplement performance expectations that had integrated engineering design into the traditional science disciplines
 “Storylines” with essential questions were added to the beginning of each grade band
and section to describe the context and rationale for the performance expectations
 The “All Standards, All Students” appendix was expanded to include several vignettes
about implementation of the NGSS with diverse student groups
 Performance expectations names were changed from lowercase letters to numbers to
avoid confusion with the DCI names.  For example, MS-LS1-a became MS-LS1-1

Introduction

Several rounds of review were built into the development process of the NGSS to make sure that
all educators and stakeholders would have opportunities to provide feedback.  The first public
draft of the NGSS was posted online from May 11 to June 1, 2012, and the second public draft
was posted online from January 8 to January 29, 2013.  The draft received comments from over
10,000 individuals during each of the two public review periods, including those working
together in lead state review teams, school and school district discussion groups, and scientific society commenters.

Feedback on the public drafts was reviewed, coded into sortable spreadsheets and summarized
for state and writing team consideration.  Where feedback was unclear or conflicting, lead state
teams engaged in additional discussions.  The writers then used this feedback, along with that of
the college- and career-readiness reviews, to make substantial revisions to the draft standards.
As a result of the first public review and subsequent state review, 95% of the performance
expectations were rewritten.  After the second public draft review period, 75% of the
performance expectations were edited to add clarity and consistency across the document. .

Overall, the feedback received on both public drafts of the NGSS was overwhelmingly positive.
Almost all reviewers indicated that they liked the pedagogical vision described in the National
Research Council document A Framework for K-12 Science Education, and the integration of the
three dimensions in the NGSS: Science and Engineering Practices, Crosscutting Concepts and
Disciplinary Core Ideas.  The structure of the NGSS received high praise, including the
foundation boxes that show the source of the language and ideas in the performance
expectations.  The presence of clarification statements, assessment boundaries, as well as
connections to other standards and the Common Core State Standards, were also almost
universally approved of. While these elements were applauded, some commenters suggested
improvements regarding specific wording and foundation box connections.

In addition to the overall positive feedback the first draft received, there were also critiques of
specific issues.  The following themes emerged from the comments about ways to improve the
first public draft:
 Concern that there was too much material  Suggestions for additional topics  Lack of language clarity
 Concern about how engineering and technology was included and addressed
 Confusion about the role of the one practice specified in each performance expectation
 Lack of guidance for incorporating crosscutting concepts
 Lack of specificity in connections to other standards and other subjects  Concern about the organization of the standards
 Concern about the amount of support needed for implementation of the standards 

Based on this feedback and on additional interim reviews of the standards by the lead states,
many changes were made to the standards between the first and second public drafts. The
feedback on the second public draft indicated that the changes to the draft had completely

addressed some of the issues, and had greatly reduced the percentage of reviewers that had
concerns about the remaining issues.  Those remaining issues included:

 Concerns that there was still too much material
 Suggestions for a few additional topics to include  Lack of language clarity
 Concerns about including and addressing engineering and technology
 Confusion about the role of the one practice specified in each performance expectation
 Concern about the amount of support that will be needed for implementation of the standards.

Below is a representative sampling of how each issue identified above was addressed, after a thorough review of the feedback:

Too Much Material
The Framework and the NGSS set out to define a small set of core ideas that build on each other
coherently through the grade levels.  While most reviewers of both the first and second public
drafts indicated that proficiency in the standards was sufficient for student success at the next
level, they also noted that practical classroom time constraints could prevent many students from
getting to the depth of skills and knowledge required by the standards.

In the first public draft, several topics, such as nuclear processes, were identified as being beyond
the scope of knowledge necessary for college and career readiness.  These topics, for example,
were deemed important only for those students who planned to continue in STEM career paths.
Similarly, some topics in the elementary levels were deemed more appropriate at either a higher or lower grade level.

To address these issues, the standards underwent extensive review to ensure that all content is
both necessary and sufficient for student success after high school in the 21st century.  In the K-5
standards, several performance expectations were shifted from one grade level to the next based on the feedback.

In June 2012, university and community college faculty met with workforce readiness experts to
examine all of the standards in depth.  Their feedback, together with that from the first public
draft review, led to a deletion of many performance expectations and a greater focus in many
discipline areas.  In addition, reviews from cross-disciplinary teams of higher education faculty
and the Lead State Review in September led to a further reduction in the content designated in the Disciplinary Core Ideas.

Feedback on the January 2013 draft indicated that the previous reductions in content were not
sufficient to allow for the instruction time necessary to build student proficiency in all of the
practices, core ideas, and crosscutting concepts.  Therefore, additional content was removed by
deleting both the performance expectations and associated disciplinary core idea (DCI) endpoints
that covered content beyond the central focus of each core idea.  For example, the central focus
of HS.LS2.B is the effect of cell division and differentiation on growth, so the DCI endpoints
that described the details of cellular differentiation were deleted from the expectations of the

standards.  The teachers on the NGSS writing team then performed a validity check with the
performance expectations to ensure that the scope of the expectations was practical within the
realities of a typical school year.  In many cases, the deleted endpoints could serve as the
beginnings of instructional extensions when time allows.

In addition, changes were made to ensure that the practice and core idea pairings for each
performance expectation were appropriate for all students at each grade level.  Writers ensured
that all the K-12 performance expectations would be implementable within realistic timeframes.
The knowledge and skills required by particular performance expectations are not intended to be
taught independently of others at the same grade level, and should take into account student
knowledge and skills learned at previous grade levels.  For instance, in high school physical
sciences, one would not teach about chemical reactions without also addressing the law of
conservation of mass, and these skills should build on associated middle school endpoints.

Suggestions on inclusion/exclusion of certain topics
While recognizing the sizable amount of content mastery expected of all students in the NGSS
draft, many reviewers of both public drafts voiced concerns about the omission of particular
areas of content. As writers were tasked with creating a set of standards faithful to the
Framework, many of these concerns paralleled those raised during the Framework development
process.  Major themes from the feedback on the first public draft included requests for more
ocean science context to be used in examples, for computer science concepts to be added, and for
“nature of science” concepts to be made more explicit.

One of the important components to the vision of the Framework and the NGSS is the focus on a
smaller set of core ideas that build over time.  With the practical constraints of class time
availability and the commitment to remain within the scope of the NRC Framework, the NGSS
writers were not able to add new core ideas to the standards.  They were, however, able to add
more context and examples demonstrating potential connections to ocean science and computer
science between the first and second public drafts.  In addition, where nature of science
connections already existed in the standards, they were made more explicit in the second public
draft and called out in the appropriate foundation boxes.  This addition received very positive feedback from most reviewers.

In both the first and second public drafts, many reviewers expressed concern that specific content
normally included in high school elective courses was not in the NGSS, including
thermodynamics, stoichiometry, solution chemistry and nitrogen cycles.  Much of this feedback
indicated a misunderstanding of the purpose of the NGSS.  In contrast to many current state
standards, the NGSS specify content and skills required of all students, and are not intended to
replace high school course standards.  The NGSS are meant to specify the knowledge and skills
that will provide a thorough foundation for student success in any chosen field, and can be
supplemented with further in-depth study in particular upper-level science courses.

A key consideration with regard to missing or additional content was its relation to college and
career readiness in science.  As described, a large team of postsecondary faculty and hiring
managers from across the country met to review the May draft specifically to determine if the
content represented, as understood by high school graduates, would allow for success in

=== Page 6 ===

NGSS Release
Page 6 of 9
postsecondary education and training. In each of the disciplines, (Earth/space, biology/life,
chemistry, and physics), the outcome did not support adding additional content.  In some cases,
like stoichiometry, the conceptual understanding for why chemists do stoichiometry was already
in the standards.  The teams wanted to make the mathematical practice more explicit through the
clarification statements, without having a separate performance expectation requiring that all students do gram to gram calculations.

A small number of reviewers in both public draft review periods asked that evolution not be
included in the standards.  However, an understanding of evolution was identified in the
Framework as the basis for understanding all the natural sciences.  As such, it was included in the NGSS.

In their feedback on the first public draft, several commenters perceived that “inquiry” was
missing from the standards.  A few emphasized the importance of students’ joy and passion for
learning, indicating that this should be made explicit in the standards documents.
The concept and practice of “inquiry” has not been omitted from the NGSS – instead, it is now
specified in the eight practices throughout every performance expectation.

In addition, many reviewers requested more guidance for implementation with diverse student
groups. A thorough discussion of equity and diversity issues had been planned for inclusion in
the standards.  A draft version was included in the second public draft of the NGSS, and an
expanded version with several vignettes is included in the final release.  Each performance
expectation and associated examples have been reviewed for appropriateness with all student
groups and for relevance to student interests.  The writers were committed to the creation of a
document that will help encourage all students to engage in and enjoy the study of science.

Some reviewers of both public drafts requested that the standards specify the intermediate
knowledge necessary for scaffolding toward eventual student outcomes.  However, the NGSS are
a set of goals, performance expectations for the end of instruction; they are not a curriculum.
Many different methods and examples could be used to help support student understanding of the
disciplinary core ideas and science and engineering practices, and the writers did not want to
prescribe any curriculum or constrain any instruction.  It is therefore outside the scope of the
standards to specify intermediate knowledge and instructional steps.  For example, MS-LS3-1
includes, as a student outcome, some general knowledge of the role of gene mutations.  No part
of the NGSS specifies the student outcome of defining a gene – it is instead implicit that in order
to demonstrate proficiency on MS-LS3-1, students will have to be introduced to the concept of a gene through curriculum and instruction.

Clarity of Language
Many reviewers of the first public draft remarked that the language in the performance
expectations was unclear and not user-friendly enough to support consistent implementation—
that multiple users would have different interpretations of the same language. More examples
and guidance for instruction, assessment, and curriculum development were requested.  Requests
for clarification were particularly abundant in the feedback describing the practices; the feedback

=== Page 7 ===

April 2013
NGSS Release
Page 7 of 9
suggested confusion about the meaning and scope of certain practices—particularly “developing and using models.”

In early drafts of the standards, the writers purposefully did not control for consistent language,
in order to provide several different writing styles as models.  Based on the public draft feedback
and additional feedback from lead states, the different writing styles were assessed and the
highest-rated writing style was then adapted for all of the standards.  All performance
expectations were carefully reviewed for clarity of language.  Although some examples were
added, the writers were careful to use language that was general enough to avoid prescribing
curriculum and to ensure that performance expectations could be met in multiple ways.  To help
clarify the meaning of each practice, a separate chapter on the practices was added to this draft of the NGSS.

The percentage of people with concerns about language clarity was much lower when reviewing
the second public draft. Since some concerns still remained, however, the performance
expectations that received the highest scores for clarity were used as models for editing most of
the other performance expectations. This created clearer and more consistent language, more closely aligned to that in the Framework.

Inclusion of Engineering and Technology
The initial inclusion of engineering practices and core ideas in the May 2012 draft NGSS
generated a large number of comments.  Most reviewers responded positively to the inclusion.
Others indicated that engineering shouldn’t be in the science standards because of the total
amount of content already present in the traditional disciplines and the scarcity of teachers with
training in this subject.  Still others requested that additional engineering content be added to the
NGSS.  Of those who liked the inclusion of engineering, many voiced concern that having
separate engineering performance expectations, especially in middle school and high school,
would either lead to instruction separated from science content or to an omission of the engineering components altogether.

Upon direction from the lead states, writers integrated the ETS1 (Engineering Design) core ideas
into the other disciplines for the January 2013 draft.  For example, some performance
expectations described the outcomes from both physical science core ideas and from engineering
design core ideas.  This integration resulted in a reduction of the total number of performance
expectations.  In the January 2013 draft, there were two different ways to view these same
integrated performance expectations: listed within the traditional disciplines, and also listed in separate Engineering Design standards.

Feedback on the integration of engineering in the January 2013 draft was mixed.  Reviewers
enthusiastically praised the idea of integration as a way to help ensure that engineering design
core ideas would be incorporated into science instruction, but commented that the intended
engineering design core ideas were not always explicit.  The feedback indicated that the integration was not consistently successful.

Page 8 of 9
The writers therefore reintroduced a small set of separate performance expectations addressing
ETS1 core ideas at each grade band, to ensure that the engineering design core ideas from the
Framework would be clearly represented.  In addition, some of the successfully-integrated
disciplinary core ideas are still present throughout the other disciplinary standards.

In addition to this core idea integration, the ETS ideas from the Framework are included in the
other two dimensions of the draft NGSS.  Engineering practices are incorporated into
performance expectations at every grade level.  Due to their crosscutting nature, ETS2 (Links
among Engineering, Technology, Science, and Society) core ideas have been integrated
throughout the standards in a manner similar to that of crosscutting concepts.  A thorough
discussion of the inclusion of engineering in the NGSS is in Appendices I and J.

Specifying one Practice in each Performance Expectation
While the NGSS draft was widely praised for integrating practices throughout the standards,
many reviewers in both the first and second public drafts remarked that specifying a particular
practice in each performance expectation was too restrictive and that it would be interpreted as prescribing instruction.

Response
The writers, upon direction from the lead states, have revised the front matter documents to
provide a more detailed explanation of the nature of performance expectations – that they specify
student outcomes and not instruction.  To help support student learning, all practices should be
used in instruction throughout each discipline and each year.

It is important to note that the Scientific and Engineering Practices are not teaching strategies - they are indicators of achievement as well as important learning goals in their own right. As
such, the Framework and NGSS ensure the Practices are not treated as afterthoughts. Coupling
practice with content gives the learning context, whereas practices alone are activities and
content alone is memorization. It is through integration that science begins to make sense and allows student to apply the material.

State standards have traditionally represented Practices and Core Ideas as two separate entities.
However, observations from science education researchers have indicated that the result of
having these two dimensions separate is that they are either taught separately or the Practices are not taught at all.

Implementation Support Needed
Almost every reviewer in both public drafts noted that the vision laid out in the NRC Framework
and embodied by the NGSS will likely require additional professional development and possibly
large-scale changes in education systems, to ensure that all students can meet all of these
standards.  For example, it was noted that science is not currently taught at the K-3 level in many
schools, and that many students don’t take chemistry, physics and earth science classes at the
high school level.  To help them fully understand the vision of the NGSS, reviewers requested
vignettes of classroom instruction showing integration of the three dimensions and inclusion of

engineering practices and concepts.  Many reviewers also commented that implementation of the
standards will, in practice, be impossible until aligned assessments are proposed.

Response
The NGSS writers recognize the differences between current education practice and that
envisioned by the Framework.  Many organizations, including the National Science Teachers
Association, are currently planning for programs and support for teachers and states that adopt
and implement the standards.  The National Research Council is now researching ways to assess
the kind of science education envisioned in the Framework.  Ultimately, the decision of what
assessment to use or develop will be up to each state choosing to adopt the NGSS.
