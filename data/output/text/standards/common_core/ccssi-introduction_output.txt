Introduction to the Common Core State Standards
June 2, 2010
The Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) and the National Governors
Association Center for Best Practices (NGA Center) are pleased to present the final
Kindergarten-12 Common Core State Standards documents that our organizations have
produced on behalf of 48 states, two territories, and the District of Columbia. These English
language arts and mathematics standards represent a set of expectations for student knowledge
and skills that high school graduates need to master to succeed in college and careers.
To develop these standards, CCSSO and the NGA Center worked with representatives
from participating states, a wide range of educators, content experts, researchers, national
organizations, and community groups. These final standards reflect the invaluable feedback
from the general public, teachers, parents, business leaders, states, and content area experts
and are informed by the standards of other high performing nations.
You will notice that the college- and career-readiness standards have been incorporated into
the K-12 standards, as was promised in the March 10, 2010 draft. The criteria that we used to
develop the college- and career-readiness standards, as well as these K-12 standards are:
Aligned with college and work expectations;
•
Include rigorous content •
and application of knowledge through high-order skills;
Build upon strengths and lessons of current state standards;
•
Informed by top-performing countries, so that all students are prepared to succeed in • our global economy and society; and,
Evidence and/or research-based.
•
The following links provide more information about the criteria and considerations for
standards development. The standards development process has incorporated the best
practices and research from across the nation and the world. While we have used all available
research to shape these documents, we recognize that there is more to be learned about the
most essential knowledge for student success. As new research is conducted and we evaluate
the implementation of the common core standards, we plan to revise the standards on a set review cycle.
Our organizations would like to thank our advisory group, which provides advice and guidance
on this initiative. Additional thanks are also given to the writers of the standards, who devoted
countless weekends and late nights to ensuring that the standards meet the high expectations for rigor and clarity.
