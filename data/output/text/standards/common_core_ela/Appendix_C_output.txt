Samples of Student Writing
Following are writing samples that have been annotated to illustrate the criteria required to meet the
Common Core State Standards for particular types of writing—argument, informative/explanatory text,
and narrative—in a given grade. Each of the samples exhibits at least the level of quality required to meet the Writing standards for that grade.
The range of accomplishment within each grade reflects differences in individual development as well
as in the conditions under which the student writers were expected to work. Some of the samples were
written in class or as homework; others were written for on-demand assessments; still others were
the result of sustained research projects. Where possible, each sample includes information about the
circumstances under which it was produced. The samples come from students in kindergarten through
grade 12. The students attended school in a number of states and districts across the country.
At the lower grades, the samples include “opinion” writing, an elementary type of argument in which
students give reasons for their opinions and preferences. Because reasons are required, such writing
helps prepare students for drafting the arguments they will be expected to create beginning in grade 6.
Acknowledgment
The Standards work group would like to express its appreciation to teachers and students at Monte
Vista High School in California and the Randolph Technical Career Center in Vermont; other colleagues
in California, Massachusetts, and Washington state; and ACT, Inc., and the Concord Review, who helped
find and obtain permission for several of the samples included in the set. The group also would like to
express its appreciation to the New Standards Project and to the International Reading Association,
which allowed the use of several samples from their publications, and to the other student writers who granted permission to reproduce their work here.

Zoo Field Trip
Dear Mr. ___________ and Mrs. ___________,
We have a problem. The wildlife here in __________ is very limited. There is not a lot of opportunity to
learn about conservation and wildlife preservation. If we took a field trip to __________ our problem
would be solved. __________, __________, __________ and I would like to take our class for a great
learning experience. In addition, we will provide a study guide to __________ to identify the animals and
provide information about conservation of endangered wildlife.
If we went on a field trip, we will learn about the wildlife from around the world and how __________
provides a natural habitat for them to live and breed. This information would help us to understand the
importance of science in our day to day life. We would use math to make a budget and figure out a way
to earn money. These skills will be very useful again and again. We will learn how to make a schedule
with target dates. This will provide us with a plan that covers the entire project from start to finish. The
preparation of the study guide will require lots of research and organization of information.
The first thing to do is research, research, research! Next, we will choose a fund raiser (with your
approval, of course). This will earn money for the field trip. The parents will hopefully chip in their time
and money, if we don’t get enough. We will prepare a plan schedule. This will provide the dates that
team members will need to accomplish the steps toward our goal. My competent adult model is the
Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World. It shows us step by step how to plan a trip and what to see.
Now, you are asking why should I approve a trip to __________? How does this help __________ and the
students? Besides the fact that the project planning, fund raising, budgeting and reporting will provide
an excellent learning opportunity, it will provide education. It will also provide awareness of wildlife and
the importance of conservation. This project will be evaluated by its successful planning and its ability to
involve our class in wildlife conservation. The trip will be evaluated by the student participation on the
trip and a plan of conservation that identifies what we can all do to protect and respect wildlife so they will still be around when we have children.
Sincerely, _______________

Student Sample: Grade 4, Narrative
This narrative was produced for an on-demand assessment. Students were asked to respond to the
following prompt: “One morning you wake up and find a strange pair of shoes next to your bed. The
shoes are glowing. In several paragraphs, write a story telling what happens.”
Glowing Shoes
One quiet, Tuesday morning, I woke up to a pair of bright, dazzling shoes, lying right in front
of my bedroom door. The shoes were a nice shade of violet and smelled like catnip. I found that out
because my cats, Tigger and Max, were rubbing on my legs, which tickled.
When I started out the door, I noticed that Tigger and Max were following me to school. Other
cats joined in as well. They didn’t even stop when we reached Main Street!
“Don’t you guys have somewhere to be?” I quizzed the cats.
“Meeeeeooooow!” the crowd of cats replied.
As I walked on, I observed many more cats joining the stalking crowd. I moved more swiftly. The
crowd of cats’ walk turned into a prance. I sped up. I felt like a rollercoaster zooming past the crowded
line that was waiting for their turn as I darted down the sidewalk with dashing cats on my tail.
When I reached the school building . . . SLAM! WHACK! “Meeyow!” The door closed and every single cat flew and hit the door.
Whew! Glad that’s over! I thought.
I walked upstairs and took my seat in the classroom.
“Mrs. Miller! Something smells like catnip! Could you open the windows so the smell will go away? Pleeeeaase?” Zane whined.
“Oh, sure! We could all use some fresh air right now during class!” Mrs. Miller thoughtfully responded.
“Nooooooo!” I screamed.
When the teacher opened the windows, the cats pounced into the building.
“It’s a cat attack!” Meisha screamed
Everyone scrambled on top of their desks. Well, everyone except Cade, who was absolutely obsessed with cats.
“Awww! Look at all the fuzzy kitties! They’re sooo cute! Mrs. Miller, can I pet them?” Cade asked, adorably.
“Why not! Pet whichever one you want!” she answered.
“Thanks! Okay, kitties, which one of you wants to be petted by Cade Dahlin?” he asked the cats.
None of them answered. They were all staring at me.
“Uh, hi?” I stammered.
Rrriiiiinng! The recess bell rang. Everyone, including Mrs. Miller, darted out the door.
Out at recess, Lissa and I played on the swings.
“Hey! Look over there!” Lissa shouted. Formed as an ocean wave, the cats ran toward me.

Luckily, Zane’s cat, Buddy, was prancing along with the aroma of catnip surrounding his fur. He
ran up to me and rubbed on my legs. The shoes fell off. Why didn’t I think of this before? I notioned.
“Hey Cade! Catch!”
Cade grabbed the shoes and slipped them on.
The cats changed directions and headed for Cade.
“I’m in heaven!” he shrieked.

Student Sample: Grade 6, Argument
This argument was written as homework after a class in which grade 6 students viewed a movie
titled Benchwarmers and discussed how movie writers and producers promote smoking. The letter is
addressed to the producer of a film in which smoking appears.
Dear Mr. Sandler,

Did you know that every cigarette a person smokes takes seven minutes off their life? I
mentioned this because I just watched the movie, Benchwarmers, and I noticed that Carlos smoked. Why
did you feel the need to have one of the characters smoke? Did you think that would make him look
cool? Did you think that would make him look older? It did neither of those things. As a matter of fact, I
think it made him look stupid and not very cool. Especially when he put out a cigarette on his tongue.

If I were producing a movie, I would want my characters to be strong, healthy and smart. I
would not have any smokers in my movies for many reasons. The first reason is it sets a bad example for
children. An estimated 450,000 Americans die each year from tobacco related disease. In fact, tobacco
use causes many different types of cancers such as lung, throat, mouth, and tongue. Another reason not
to promote smoking is it ages and wrinkles your skin. Who wants to look 75 if you are only 60? It turns
your teeth yellow and may lead to gum disease and tooth decay. Lastly, smoking is a very expensive
habit. A heavy smoker spends thousands of dollars a year on cigarettes. I can think of better things to spend money on.

So Mr. Sandler, I urge you to take smoking out of all future movies you produce. Instead of
having your characters smoke have them do healthy things. That will set a positive influence for children
instead of poisoning their minds. Thanks for reading my letter. I hope you agree with my opinion.
Sincerely, __________
P.S. I love your Chanukah song.

Student Sample: Grade 6, Argument
This argument (incorrectly labeled a story) is a process piece produced in class.
A Pet Story About My Cat . . . Gus

People get pets so that they will never be lonely, and they will always have a friend to be there for
them. Ask your heart, what makes the best pet??? Some people think a best pet is picky, energetic, and
sneaky, but I think my pet is the best pet because he is a cuddle bug, he’s playful, and he loves me! Gus was
about eight weeks old when we got him, now he is 4 1/2 months old, and he is about as big as a size eight
sneaker. He is a little gray and white kitten. If you look closely he has a gray tail, but there are darker gray
rings around it. He has a little white on his face, and some on his tummy and paws. He has a little stripe on
his leg but it is his back left leg only. He’s very cute, and he purrs a lot! He also has a cute little gray nose.

One of the reasons why my cat Gus is the best pet is because he is a cuddle bug. When Gus
was a baby, he had to be kept in a cage because he wasn’t allowed to interact with the other pets until
he was older. He couldn’t interact with the other pets because when Twister was a baby, the ferrets
bit her ear and dragged her under the bed, and bit her in the back of the neck and we didn’t want the
same thing to happen to Gus. Also because Twister had to be kept in a cage when she was little, too.
His cage was in my room so when he meowed, as if to say, “Get me out!” I would have to take him out
and sleep with him. All he would do is thank me for doing that by snuggling against my chin! Another
example to prove that Gus is a cuddle bug, is that when I’m feeding Gus, I put his and Twister’s bowl
up on the counter when I do so, and Twister sits there patiently while Gus is snuggling against my legs
to show affection toward me. He snuggles my leg even when I’m walking around! Well, at least he tries
to, because he follows me, and when I stop walking, he starts to cuddle. Eventually I pick him up and
cuddle him back!!! Finally, when I have nothing to do and I’m just sitting on my bed reading, Gus jumps
up with me and then he pushes away the covers to get under them, and he sleeps on my chest to keep
my company when I’m board. After he slept on my tummy many times, he finally got the nickname
__________ Cuddle Buddy. Now I always snuggle with my favorite cuddle buddy . . . Gus!!!

A second reason why Gus is the best pet is because he’s playful. Most of the time when Gus
is lying on the couch minding his own business, I’ll reach out to pet him then he’ll start biting my hand
and attacking it!!! He does this to be playful, not to hurt anyone but he just wants to have fun. It kind of
tickles when he does it, actually. Gus also has a little toy mouse that is attached to a string that I drag
around the house so that Gus will follow it. The mouse has a leopard skin pattern on it with balls of fur
as hands and feet. The mouse is about the size of the pencil sharpeners in Mrs. __________ classroom.
He goes after that mouse so fast that it’s hard to see him running by to catch it. When Gus was a baby,
I would put him in my bed to sleep with, but before we went to sleep, I would move my feet around
underneath the covers, while Gus was on top chasing them around. Eventually, he got tired and lied
down near my feet, but before he was completely asleep, I would pick him up and put him near my
pillow and we slept together. Gus loves doing that all the time. I love how Gus is so playful!!!

The last reason why Gus is the best pet is because he loves me! He always misses me whenever
I’m not there. When I come home from school and I open the door, Gus comes flying around the corner,
and starts to climb my pants! When he gets high enough. I grab him in my arms and we start cuddling
each other while Gus is happily purring. He does this a lot. Most of the time I’m in my room watching TV,
while Gus and Twister are fighting and killing each other, they come dashing around the corner and into
my room. I, of course, have to break up the fight. After that, I put them on my bed and hold them down,
but they keep squirming. Soon, they get tired and sleep with me, silently, watching TV. Gus is with me as
much as possible. Sometimes he’s busy playing with Twister, sleeping, or eating. Otherwise, he’s playing
or sleeping with me. We do so many things together and I’m glad I got him, but technically, he chose me.
It was a homeless cat shelter. They were able to catch the kittens, but not there mommy. His brothers
and sisters were all playing, but he was sleeping under the table. Soon, he walked out from under the
table and slept with me while we cuddled on the couch. That’s how I met Gus.
People have feelings for their pets that show that they love them very much. When I had to
decide what makes the best pet, I would say that Gus is the best pet because he is a cuddle bug, he’s
playful, and he loves me. When you think about the examples that I gave you, like when I told you about
how Gus snuggles against my chin, you saw that Gus IS the best pet and if you don’t believe me, you have a problem with deciding who the best pet is.

o
The last reason why Gus is the best pet is because he loves me! The writer elaborates
this point with three examples: Gus runs to greet the narrator when he returns home

Student Sample: Grade 7, Argument
This argument was produced for an on-demand assessment. Students were asked to a write a letter to
their principal about a plan to install video cameras in the classroom for safety reasons. The abbreviated
time frame of the assessment (and the consequent lack of opportunity to perform research and revise)
explains the absence of information from sources and possibly also the occasional errors.
Video Cameras in Classrooms
You are seated in class as your teacher explains and points things out on the whiteboard. You
twitch your hand, accidentally nudging your pencil, which rolls off your desk and clatters to the floor. As
you lean over to pick up your pencil, your cell phone falls out of your coat pocket! Luckily you catch it
without your teacher seeing, but it is in plain view of the video camera’s shiny lens that points straight at
you. The classroom phone rings, and after a brief conversation, your teacher walks over to your desk and
kneels down beside you. “About that cell phone of yours . . .” How did that get you in trouble? How could
it possibly be a good idea to put cameras in classrooms?
When students are in their classrooms, teachers are in the classroom too, usually. But when a
teacher goes out of the classroom, what usually happens is either everything goes on as usual, or the
students get a little more talkative. Cameras aren’t there because people talk a lot. It is the teacher’s job
to keep people quiet. If something horrible happened, somebody in class would usually report it, or it
would just be obvious to the teacher when he came back that something had happened.
If we already have cameras in the halls, why spend the money to get thirty more cameras for all
the different classrooms? Our school district already has a low budget, so we would be spending money
on something completely unnecessary. There hasn’t been camera-worthy trouble in classrooms. Camera worthy trouble would be bad behavior every time a teacher left the room. There is no reason to install
cameras that might just cause trouble, both for the students and for the budget.
Different students react differently when there is a camera in the room. Some students get
nervous and flustered, trying hard to stay focused on their work with a camera focused on them. 90% of
students claim that they do better work when they are calmer, and cameras are not going to help. Other
students look at cameras as a source of entertainment. These students will do things such as wave at the
camera, make faces, or say hi to the people watching through the camera. This could be a big distraction
for others who are trying to learn and participate in class. Still other students will try to trick the camera.
They will find a way to block the lens or do something that the camera will not be likely to catch. All of
these different students will be distracted by the cameras in their classrooms.
Instead of solving problems, cameras would cause the problems. That is why I disagree with the
idea to put cameras in classrooms. This plan should not be put to action.

Student Sample: Grade 7, Informative/Explanatory
The extended project that led to this scientific report required students to review existing research,
conduct original research, and produce a report. Although the student who wrote the report was in
grade 7, the conceptual understanding the report displays is clearly at an exemplary level.
A Geographical Report
My report is on a very rare and unique wetland that many people do not even know exists. They occur only in a few places around the world.
My topic is created by a specific geographical condition. Vernal pools in San Diego occur only
on the local mesas and terraces, where soil conditions allow, but these are the ideal place for much of
the city’s urban and agricultural development. Is it possible to find a balance between the two conflicting purposes of expansion and preservation?
This raises an interesting question; how can you establish vernal pools being thought of as a geographical asset?
METHODS
To answer my question I had to get information on vernal pools: what they are, where they are,
and how they are a sensitive natural habitat. Then I needed to examine how city expansion is affecting
vernal pools, and if it is apt to continue. I needed to know what the City thinks about the problem and what they are planning to do.
First I looked for any information available on vernal pools at public libraries, but I couldn’t find
what I was looking for. The topic is apparently too obscure. Next I went to a university library that had an
environmental department to get as much information as possible (University of San Diego).
I also interviewed several authorities in the field: the district representative for the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, the federal agency responsible for the protection of wetlands; a senior environment
planner with the City of San Diego, who wrote the City’s Resource Protection Ordinance (RPO); the
Station botanist at Miramar Naval Air Station, who is in charge of their vernal pool management plan
on the land that has the largest number of pools remaining in the City of San Diego; a biologist working
for RECON (Regional Environmental Consultants), a firm which is mapping the vernal pools for the City
of Hemet, (another city in San Diego County facing the same issues); and finally a geographer working
for SANDAG (San Diego Association of Governments), a regional organization that gathers, records,
and analyzes data associated with regional planning and environmental issues. They answered many
questions and offered their own ideas and information, including additional articles on my subject. I
looked at several maps and photos of vernal pools locations, and charts of changing land use.
To decide how much education may be needed about vernal pools, I made a questionnaire, and
surveyed two classrooms of elementary students, and a group of forty-two adults, trying to cover most age groups.
WHAT VERNAL POOLS ARE
Vernal pools are a unique and rare form of wetland. Wetlands are areas that are covered or
soaked by water enough to support plants that grow only in moist ground. Some examples of wetlands
are bogs, swamps, marshes, and edges of lakes and streams. These are what people think of when they
hear “wetland”. But vernal pools are different than these other types of wetlands. They are located on
dry and flat places. No one would expect to find a wetland in such a dry area!
San Diego vernal pools are surrounded by small mounds called “mima mounds”. The name mima
mounds come from the Mima Prairie near Olympia, Washington. People don’t know for sure how mima
mounds are formed. Some think that they were formed by gophers piling up the earth. Others think that
ice wedges from glaciers caused the upheaval, or maybe the wind pushed loose dirt, catching in clumps
of shrubs. Mounds can be found on prairies or terraces with a hardpan or clay layer underneath.

=== Page 43 ===
Common Core State Standards for english language arts  & literacy in history/social studies, science, and technical subjects appendix c  |   43
Vernal pools are depressions between the mima mounds. In winter the pools are filled by rain
storms. In spring the pools look their best, when plants are in full splendor. By summer the pools are
dry and look only like a dry pothole, (See illustration of pool cycles and typical cross section.) A vernal
pool does not dry by soaking into the ground; the layer of clay or rock underneath the pool prevents
the water from soaking through. Instead they dry out from evaporation, or use by the plants. The mima
mounds are not impervious so one pool tends to drain into another. Therefore, the pools have to be on
flat land; the pools cannot be on a slope or the water would run off, and the pools would not be filled.
[Illustration here]
Typical Cross Section of Vernal Pool [Illustration here]
Vernal Pool Cycle
WHY VERNAL POOLS ARE SO IMPORTANT
Vernal pools are a very rare, specific habitat. Hardly any are left, so we don’t have many to lose.
There used to be vernal pools on many of the mesas and terraces of San Diego County, and the Central
Valley of California. Now there are almost no vernal pools in the Central Valley, and an estimated 97%
have been lost in San Diego County. An estimated 80% of the remaining pools in San Diego are located
on Miramar Naval Air Station. (See map, next page.) [Illustration here]
Vernal Pool Distribution, San Diego County
It does not take much to disturb a vernal pool. Even grazing or off road vehicle use in the
summer, when pool species are dormant and people could think they are just a dry hole, can damage
them. Most are disturbed by grading and flattening of their habitat, or by breakup of the impervious
layer. With just flat land there would be no depressions for vernal pools to form; what would form would
be “vernal mud”. With no impervious layer the water would just sink into the ground, and would be there
only for a short period of time, not enough for wetland plants.
The mima mounds have to be protected too. If the watershed for the pools is changed, the
condition of the pools changes. If there isn’t enough water from runoff, then all plant or animal life in
them disappears, because they need enough moisture at the right time, to live. If there is too much
water, then the pool may turn into another kind of wetland, such as a bog.
Although people have begun to study them, there is still a lot to learn. One thing scientists know
is that they are a part of a larger environment. Many animals travel from other areas to feed on plants or
animals, or drink from the vernal pools. For example, water fowl from many other places will stop at the
pools to eat the fairy shrimp and snack on the plants.
Vernal pools have a large assortment of rare and exotic flora and fauna (plants and animals).
Five of them are on the federal list of endangered species, and one more is a candidate for listing. The
plants and animals in vernal pools are unusual because they have only developed recently compared to
other changes in evolution. As scientists study the pools more intently they are finding more and more
unknown species. There are temporary pools in other places around the world, but California’s vernal
pools are different because of their long drought phase, which causes the plants and animals to adapt to
the climate. They go into a dormant phase. For example, fairy shrimp lay eggs before the drought which
hatch when it gets moist enough to be active. Some plants, in a short period of time, develop seeds;
others appear to die out, but quickly spout again from the rain. Many of these species cannot survive
outside vernal pools, and some are “endemic” (species found only in a very restricted geographical area).
PROTECTION TECHNIQUES
The first step is to try to keep development away from vernal pools. But to do this you first need
to know where the pools are. Thanks to regional mapping efforts, existing vernal pools have been fairly well identified in San Diego County.

=== Page 44 ===
Common Core State Standards for english language arts  & literacy in history/social studies, science, and technical subjects appendix c  |   44
There are already laws against disturbances of vernal pools. You could go to jail or get fined
a large sum of money for disturbing a wetland. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service protects the listed
endangered species present, and the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers makes sure you don’t fill any kind
of wetland habitat, including vernal pools. The local office of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has
submitted a proposal to Washington for a stricter permit process for vernal pools.
When possible the vernal pools should be part of a large preserve of open space. That way
the pools would not be isolated islands, but part of their natural communities, and would be protected
by a buffer of distance. Fences should not be put directly around the vernal pools unless it cannot be
avoided, because it would keep some animals out, such as rabbits which spread plant seeds around when they eat them.
It is important to educate people about vernal pools so they know how important they are
and what they look like, and so they know how to preserve them. To see how much education may be
needed in San Diego, I surveyed ninety-two people (forty-two adults and fifty elementary students to try
to cover all age groups). I asked them if they had heard of vernal pools, and if they knew what they were.
About 21% thought they had heard of them, but only 7% really knew what they were. (See pie chart.) I found that much education is needed.
[Illustration here]
Survey Results
At N.A.S. Miramar the Station botanist has been putting articles dealing with vernal pools in
almost every issue of the base newspaper. Now most people on the base know about vernal pools, and know how valuable they are.
RECOGNIZING AN ASSET
Education is a key to preserving vernal pools. Vernal pools are very unique and we do not
have many to lose. Making new ones does not work. Studies done at the University of California, Santa
Barbara, have shown that after five years their complexity goes down.
First, vernal pools must be protected. There could be different ranges of accessibility, from
remote (available to research only), somewhat accessible (good for guided seasonal visits), to readily
accessible (which may have to be protected by fencing or supervision). The most accessible ones would
be a great educational opportunity for the general public. The pools closer to development could be
developed into nature centers, with raised boardwalks to protect the habitat, as is done over the hot springs in Yellowstone. (See illustration.) [Illustration here]
Cross Section of Possible Nature Center
Interpretive signs and docents could provide information. Being very unique, vernal pools would
make interesting learning centers. People would learn how the plants and animals adapt to the seasonal
changes. This would teach people the importance of vernal pools, how complex they are, how to identify
them, and how to preserve them when wet or dry. A park in the Sacramento area has an adjacent
vernal pool with hiking trails around it; and it seems to work there because the people there know how important and delicate it is.
Ecotourism, a popular concept now, would be another idea. San Diego is a place where tourists
already come. The very climate and geography that brings people here is what created vernal pools.
Ecotourism would be easy to add to the other attractions, and would indirectly benefit the city. A tour
company might be authorized to place advertisements to bring people to learn the importance of
vernal pools and their ecosystem. With many people outside San Diego knowing about vernal pools and
concerned about their well-being, there would be widespread support for vernal pool protection.

CONCLUSION
The problem of endangering vernal pools will not go away, because the City will need more
land to develop. However, vernal pools remain a rare and unique wetland, and need protection. Even
though there are laws made to protect them, pools are still being lost. Education is needed. Widespread
education showing how important vernal pools are, and how easy they are to disturb, will create widespread support for protection.
A balance between expansion and preservation will not come easily, but if the public views
vernal pools as a geographical asset, the balance will shift toward long-term vernal pool preservation.

Football
What I like doing best is playing football, mainly because it is one of my best sports. One of
the greatest things about it, in my opinion, is the anticipation, wondering what the other players are
thinking about what you might do. Football is a physical game, of course, but it’s the mental aspect that
I appreciate the most.
At times football can get grueling, which makes the game even more exciting. The first time
you make contact with another player (even with all that equipment) you get very sore. That is true for
everyone, but in time you get used to the aches and pains. After awhile, you develop mental discipline,
which allows you to ignore some of the pain. The mental discipline then allows you to go all out, to
unload everything you have, every play. That’s how you win games, everyone going all out, giving 110%.
The game takes concentration, just as much as any other sport, if not more. You develop this
aspect in practice. That is why it is so important to have hours and hours of it. Mentally, you have to
get over the fear, the fear of eleven madmen waiting for chance to make you eat dirt. And that comes
through practice. Once you overcome the fear, you can concentrate on the more important things, like
anticipating the other guy’s next move. Studying the playbook and talking with other players also helps.
During the game, your mind clears of all thoughts. These thoughts become instinct. You have
to react, and react quickly, and you develop reactions and instinct in practice. For example, when you’re
carrying the ball or about to make a tackle, you want to make sure you have more momentum than the
other guy. If you don’t you’ll be leveled. But, you should react instinctively to that situation by increasing your momentum.
Playing defense, all you want to do is hit the man with the ball, hit him hard. Right when you
unload for a stick, all your body tightens. Then you feel the impact. After you regain your thoughts, you
wonder if you’re all right. You wait for your brain to get the pain signal from the nerves. Even so, if you
do get that signal, which is always the case, you keep right on playing. You can’t let that experience shake your concentration.
On offense, while playing receiver, you can actually “hear” the footsteps of the defensive back as
you’re concentrating on catching the ball. What separates the men from the boys is the one who “hears”
the footsteps but doesn’t miss the ball. That’s mental discipline, concentration.
Football is very physical or else it wouldn’t be fun. But it is also a mental game and that is why
it’s challenging. You can get hurt in football if you screw up and ignore the right way to do things.
However, mental discipline and concentration, which you develop during hours of practice, helps you avoid such mistakes.

The Old Man and the Sea

In the book The Old Man and the Sea, Ernest Hemingway tells the story of an old Cuban
fisherman named Santiago who, considered by the villagers to be the worst type of unlucky, is still
determined to win a battle against a giant Marlin off the coast of Cuba. Santiago succeeds, but his
successes do not come without great hardship and struggle. He spends three days being dragged in his
skiff by the enormous marlin with minimal food and water, all the while enduring acute physical pain,
tiredness, and an unending loneliness due to the absence of his young friend, Manolin. It is only after
Santiago’s prize fish is completely devoured by sharks that he returns home to the village scorners and
the safety of Manolin’s trust. As his suffering and loss compound, we can see that Hemingway’s quote “a
man can be destroyed but not defeated” offers a key insight into Santiago’s life.

As the story begins, we learn that Santiago has gone eighty-four days straight without catching
a fish. Young Manolin’s parents will no longer allow the two to fish together, for they do not want their
son being exposed any more to this type of failure. Santiago and Manolin are deeply saddened by this
news, but Santiago does not let the loss of his friend or the defeat that others see him suffering keep
him off the sea. Rather, with bright and shining eyes he thinks “maybe today. Every day is a new day”
(pg. 32), and prepares to catch the biggest fish of his life. This shows that even though almost all of
Santiago’s acquaintances feel that his fishing career is over, he sees it about to reach its all time high.
Though he knows he is physically older and weaker than most of his fellow fisherman, he refuses to let
their opinions and stereotypes destroy his confidence and determination.

As the story progresses, Hemingway presents an even more vivid picture of Santiago refusing
to be destroyed by the forces that threaten to defeat him. Even after he accomplishes the difficult task
of hooking the giant Marlin, he finds his skiff being dragged by the fish for over two days. Living in
the small boat is no easy task for Santiago, and soon injury and suffering seem to take over his entire
body. His back is sore from sitting so long against the stiff wood, his face is cut from fishing hooks,
his shoulders ache, and his eyes have trouble focusing. Most difficult to endure though is the terrible
condition in which he finds his hands. The left one is weakened from a period of being tightly cramped,
and both are extremely mutilated from the burn of the moving fishing line. It would have been so much
easier for Santiago to simply give up and release the fish, yet he knows that if he endures a little longer,
victory will be his. Even when it seems he has no effort left, Santiago promises himself “I’ll try it again.”
(pg. 93) This is Santiago’s real inner determination coming through. He has encountered so many
obstacles during the past few days, yet he will not let them defeat his dream of killing the fish. There
is no outside force promising a splendid reward if he succeeds, only those that threaten to ridicule him
if he is destroyed. Santiago is working solely on his own desire to fulfill his dream and prove to himself
that, although his struggles may cost him his life, he can accomplish even the seemingly impossible.

After three long days and nights, Santiago’s determination pays off, and at last he manages to
catch and kill the Marlin. It is only a very short time that he has to relish in his triumph though, for a few
hours later vicious sharks begin to destroy the carcass of the great fish. For hours, Santiago manages
to ward them off, but this time it is not he who wins the final battle. Spirits low and pain at an all time
high, Santiago returns to the village, towing behind him only the bare skeleton of a treasure that once
was. It seems as though Santiago is ready to just curl up and die, and indeed he has reason to feel this
way. Yet as he rests alone and talk with Manolin, we see a hint of Santiago’s determination, that has
characterized his personality throughout the entire story, begin to shine through. Upon reaching home,
he begins to make plans with Manolin about future adventures they will have together. Hemingway tells
us that Santiago, in his youth, had loved to watch the majestic lions along his home on a white sand
beach in Africa, and he still returns to those dreams when searching for contentment. That night, as
Santiago drifts off to sleep, Hemingway tells that he was indeed “dreaming about the lions.” (pg. 127)
This is perhaps the truest test of how much courage and determination a person has. If even when they
have suffered the biggest defeat of their life, they are able to look to the future and realize the wonderful
things they still posses. Though the forces of nature and time destroyed Santiago’s prize fish, he refuses
to let that fact ruin the rest of his life. No one can take away his love for Manolin or memories of what
once was, and because of this, no one can ever truly defeat Santiago.

In conclusion, throughout the entire story The Old Man and the Sea, Santiago refuses to
surrender to the forces working against him. He ignores the comments of those who think he is
unlucky, endures great physical pain, and rises up from the depths of sorrow over the lost Marlin to find
happiness in what he does possess. Hemingway’s quote “a man can be destroyed but not defeated” truly
does display the amount of determination that Santiago shows throughout his life.

Student Sample: Grade 9, Argument
This argument was written in response to a classroom assignment. The students were asked to compare
a book they read on their own to a movie about the same story and to prove which was better. Students
had six weeks to read and one and a half weeks to write, both in and out of class.
The True Meaning of Friendship
John Boyne’s story, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, tells the tale of an incredible friendship between
two eight-year old boys during the Holocaust. One of the boys is Bruno, the son of an important German
commander who is put in charge of Auschwitz Camp, and the other is Shmuel, a Jewish boy inside the
camp. Throughout the story their forbidden friendship grows, and the two boys unknowingly break the
incredible racial boundaries of the time. They remain best friends until Bruno goes under the fence to
help Shmuel find his father when they are both killed in the gas showers of the camp. By comparing and
contrasting supporting characters, irony, and the themes in the movie and the book, it is clear that the
movie, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas (Mark Herman, 2008) is not nearly as good as the novel of the same title.
Characterization is very important to a story and influences how a person interprets the novel or movie,
and one important way that the book differs from the movie is how Bruno’s mother is characterized. In
the movie, she is unrealistically portrayed as an honest woman with good moral values, and is almost as
naive as Bruno is about what is going on at Auschwitz. When she discovers what her husband is doing
to people at the camp she is deeply disturbed. Mortified by her husband’s cruelty, their relationship
declines. In contrast, she is a far more sinister character in the book. Though Bruno is too young to
understand what his mother is doing, one of the reasons he dislikes Lieutenant Kotler is that, “ . . . he
was always in the living room with Mother and making jokes with her, and Mother laughed at his jokes
more than she laughed at Father’s” (162). Bruno’s mother is very unhappy in her new situation away
from Berlin, and her discontent leads her to cheat on her husband. This also leads her to unknowingly
hurt her son, for Bruno is upset that she is paying more attention to Lieutenant Kotler than she is to his
father, and the damage she causes could be magnified if she continues to disrupt their family. Further
examples of her abysmal character and unfaithfulness are revealed when Bruno’s mother finds the young
lieutenant and says, “Oh Kurt, precious, you’re still here . . . I have a little free time now if—Oh! she said,
noticing Bruno standing there. ‘Bruno! What are you doing here?’”(166). Her disloyalty further allows
the reader to see that her character is far from virtuous, contrary to the opinion of a person who viewed
the movie. Throughout the story, it also becomes apparent that Bruno’s mother is also an alcoholic,
and, “Bruno worried for her health because he’d never known anyone to need quite so many medicinal
sherries” (188). Unable to come to terms with her new circumstances and strained relationship with
her husband, Bruno’s mother tries to drink away her problems, further conveying that she is a weak
character. Bruno’s extreme innocence about his mother and situation at Auschwitz are magnified by the use of irony in both the movie and the book.
In some ways the book and the movie have similar aspects, and one of these aspects is how irony is
used to emphasize Bruno’s innocence and to greatly emphasize the tragic mood of the story. In the final
climactic scene of the movie—just after Bruno has gone under the fence to help Shmuel find his father—
the two boys are led to the gas showers to be killed. Unaware of what is about to happen to them, Bruno
tells Shmuel that his father must have ordered this so it must be for a good reason, and that they are going
into the air-tight rooms to stay out of the rain and avoid getting sick. This statement is incredibly ironic
because, unbeknownst to Bruno, his father has unknowingly commenced his own son’s death sentence. In
addition to this, the soldiers have no intention of keeping their prisoners healthy. It never occurs to Bruno
that anyone would want to destroy another human being or treat them badly, and his innocence makes
his premature death all the more tragic. Although the movie may be incredibly ironic in a few specific
instances, the book contains a plethora of ironic events that also accentuate Bruno’s childishness and
naivety. A profound example of this is exhibited when Bruno thinks to himself that, “ . . . he did like stripes
and he felt increasingly fed up that he had to wear trousers and shirts and ties and shoes that were too
tight for him when Shmuel and his friends got to wear striped pajamas all day long” (155). Bruno has no
clue that the people in the “striped pajamas” are being cruelly treated and murdered, and is jealous of
what he thinks is freedom. Bruno once again reveals his innocence when he asks Pavel, the Jewish man
from the camp who cleans him up after a fall, “If you’re a doctor, then why are you waiting on tables?
Why aren’t you working at a hospital somewhere?” (83). It is a mystery to Bruno that a doctor would be
reduced to such a state for no transparent reason, and his beliefs should be what all adults think. Though

=== Page 58 ===
Common Core State Standards for english language arts  & literacy in history/social studies, science, and technical subjects appendix c  |   58
what he says is naive, it points out the barbarity of the German attitude toward the Jews. If an uneducated
child could be puzzled by this, then how could learned adults allow such a thing? Through Bruno’s
comment, John Boyne conveys the corruptness of the German leaders during the Holocaust, an idea that
the movie does not relay to the watcher nearly as well. The book impels the reader to think deeper about
the horrors of the Holocaust, and all this ties into the true theme of the story.
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas and its movie counterpart both have different themes, but it is the book’s
theme that accurately states the author’s message. The movie ends with a race against time as Bruno’s
family searches for him in the camp, trying to find him before he is killed. They are too late, and Bruno
and Shmuel die together like so many other anonymous children during the Holocaust. The theme of the
movie is how so many children died at the ruthless hands of their captors; but the book’s theme has a
deeper meaning. As Bruno and Shmuel die together in the chamber, “ . . . the room went very dark, and
in the chaos that followed, Bruno found that he was still holding Shmuel’s hand in his own and nothing
in the world would have persuaded him to let it go” (242). Bruno loves Schmuel, and he is willing to stay
with him no matter what the consequences, even if it means dying with him in the camp that his father
controls. They have conquered all boundaries, and this makes the two boys more than just two more
individuals who died in Auschwitz. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is not the story of two children who
died in a concentration camp; this story is about an incredible friendship that triumphed over racism
and lasted until the very end. It is the story of what should have been between Jews and Germans, a
friendship between two groups of people in one nation who used their strengths to help each other.
Based on the analysis of supporting characters, irony, and themes of John Boyne’s The Boy in the Striped
Pajamas and the movie, it can be concluded that the book is far superior to the movie. Though Bruno’s
mother is a dishonest woman in the book, her bad character is more realistic for the time when compared
to the mother in the movie who is horrified by Auschwitz. John Boyne uses many examples of irony in the
book to emphasize Bruno’s innocence and to magnify the tragedy of his death. Unlike the movie the irony

Student Sample: Grade 9, Informative/Explanatory
This essay was written in response to the following assignment: Consider The House on Mango Street by
Sandra Cisneros (1984) and the movie Whale Rider, based on the novel by Maori author Witi Ihimaera
and directed by Niki Caro (2003). Write a comparison/contrast paper discussing the similarities and
differences between these two works. Keeping in mind the main characters Esperanza Cordero and Paikea
Apirana, the traditions of the two cultures, Hispanic and Maori, the role of women, religion, and symbolism,
compare and contrast how Esperanza and Pai bridge the past and the present for their people.
Lives on Mango, Rides the Whale

More than 8,000 miles of land and sea separate two seemingly contrasting young women. One
young girl lives in the urban streets of Chicago, depicted in The House on Mango Street by Sandra Cisne ros (1984), while the other thrives in the countryside of New Zealand, as shown in Whale Rider, directed
by Niki Caro (2003)—one an immigrant from a foreign country and the other a native Maori descendent.
Both girls struggle for change, fighting their own quiet wars. Despite the vast differences in lifestyle and
culture, both Esperanza Cordero of Chicago and Paikea Apirana of New Zealand are destined to be lead ers of their generation in spite of the multitude of traditions and expectations that define them as indi viduals and their role as women in society. These two natural-born leaders are bridging the gap between the ancient customs and modern-day life.

While culture has a huge impact on the Cordero and Apirana families, the protagonists of both
groups are affected the most. In Esperanza’s world, women are put down and locked inside their hus band’s houses, having no rights and absolutely no say in their own households. The patriarchal society
overwhelms every aspect of life, and Esperanza demands change through rebelling in her own quiet
war. “I have decided not to grow up tame like the others who lay their necks on the threshold wait ing for the ball and chain” (The House on Mango Street). She plans to set her own example, to forge
her own path, in the hopes that the oppressed women of Mango Street will realize alternative options.
Desperately seeking an opportunity to flee Mango Street, Esperanza dreams of the day when she will
leave just another crippled house to seek her own way in the world. However, she states, “They will not
know I have gone away to come back. For the ones I left behind. For the ones who cannot get out” (The
House on Mango Street). Paikea, on the other hand is a native of New Zealand. According to legend,
her ancestor and namesake rode on the back of a whale to this land and her family has been there ever
since. Because of her rich and influential history, Pai is very proud of her culture. She wants the best for
her people and she understands that the village and tribe must modernize and change with the times or
else they may lose everything. For example, in the movie Whale Rider, Pai walks into her kitchen to find
three elder women smoking cigarettes. Hiding the evidence, the conversation dies as soon as she enters
the room, but she says to them, “Maori women have got to stop smoking.” Pai loves her culture and the
significance of the whale, yet she, like Esperanza, demands change, starting with her grandfather Koro
accepting the fact that Pai is destined to become the first female chief of the village. Both girls dream of
the day where their women will be respected and treated as equals in their patriarchal societies.

Family also plays an important role in both The House on Mango Street and Whale Rider. The
Corderos are one happy group, with lots of strong and inspirational individuals, binding relatives togeth er like a ribbon on a present. Esperanza, the namesake and great-grandmother of the young protagonist,
was a strong-willed woman. “My great-grandmother. I would’ve liked to have known her, a wild horse of
a woman, so wild she wouldn’t marry” (The House on Mango Street). Another prominent man is Espe ranza’s Uncle Nacho. At a baptism, Uncle Nacho convinces Esperanza to dance; despite her sad brown
shoes, she in fact does with her uncle telling her how beautiful she is, making her forget her discomfort
and hatred of her shoes. Even though Esperanza may be loved in her family and close community, she is
of low social status in general. She, like Geraldo in the vignette “Geraldo No Last Name,” is “just another
brazer who didn’t speak English. Just another wetback. You know the kind. The ones who always look
ashamed.” Her father is a gardener at rich people’s houses, and her mother watches over the four chil dren (Esperanza, Nenny, Carlos, and Kiki). From a typical Mexican family, Esperanza is not poor but also
has never really experienced any luxury other than a used car.

On the other hand, Paikea comes from a broken family. Her mother died during childbirth, along
with her twin brother. After feeling the depression of loss and loneliness, Pai’s father Porourangi left
New Zealand to live in Germany, where he sculpted and sold Maori art. Pai was left to be raised by her
grandparents Koro, the current chief, and Nanny Flowers. Similar to Esperanza, Pai shares common fam ily members that inspired them and encouraged them through their trials, Nanny Flowers, for example,
raised Pai to be the woman she is—independent and tough. Regardless of the criticism from Koro, Nanny
Flowers encourages Pai to do what she knows is best, even if that results in harsh consequences. For

=== Page 61 ===

example, during the movie, Pai and the young boys of the village attend a school lesson taught by Koro.
Pai is last in line, but sits down on the front bench with the others, although Koro tells her to sit in the
back, the proper place for a woman. She refuses to move even when her grandfather threatens to send
her away, which he does because Pai will not give up her seat. As she walks away from the group, Nanny
Flowers has a proud little smile on her lips, for she knows that Pai is ordained to be the next leader. Be cause Pai is next in line to become the chief, she is of very high status, just below the current chief.

A prominent figure on Mango Street, Esperanza presents an alternative to the oppression of
women in the community. In the outside world, however, she is just another young girl with parents who
immigrated to the United States in the hopes of a better life for their children. Esperanza wants to set an
example for the women trapped in their houses, to provide an escape for those ensnared in the barbed
wire of marriage. Above all, she dreams of the day where she can leave Mango Street, yet she knows that
it is her duty to return to free her friends. As told by the Three Sisters, “You will always be Esperanza.
You will always be Mango Street. You can’t erase what you know. You can’t forget who you are.” These
three women told Esperanza that she was special and was meant to be a strong and leading person,
just like Pai and the whales. Because of the rich diversity and influences in her neighborhood, Esperanza
learns through her friends and experiences they share. Marin, Rafaela, Lucy, Rachel, Sally, and Alicia all
provided a learning experience in one way or another. As all of these young ladies are in a similar age
range with Esperanza, they undergo multiple trials side-by-side.

Contrastingly, Paikea has the blood of a leader running through her veins. She is a native, a
leader, and a change. Pai, like Esperanza, is a leading figure amongst the women of her community.
Always aware of the outer world, Pai knows that her people must adapt to the changing times or they
will be swept away by the current of technology. She holds a great love and respect for her culture and
people, and she wants what is best for them, even if it involves changing ancient traditions and ways. Pai
knows it is her duty to stay, and her desire keeps her rooted in her little village. Once, Pai’s father offered
to take her to Germany with him to start a new life, and she agreed to go with him. However, in the car
ride along the beach, a whale calls from the depths of the ocean and it is then that Pai knows she cannot
leave her people. She asks her father to turn around and she returns to the village of her people. Due to
having little to no interaction with kids her age, Pai must learn from her elders and through Koro’s reac tions. The children of the village tease and taunt Pai for her name and her big dreams, yet she pays them
no attention. Unlike Esperanza, Pai knew from the beginning that she was destined to be great and is different from others her age.

Finally, the personalities of these two protagonists are exceedingly different. Esperanza, although
older than Paikea, has low self-esteem and little self-confidence. She is afraid of adults, and as shown in
“A Rice Sandwich,” she often cries when confronted by her elders. Throughout the novel, Esperanza is
shamed by her actions, other’s actions, and other’s words. All this young girl wants is to make friends
and be loved by others, but she gets in her own way. However, when the world seems against her and
she is all alone, Esperanza writes to escape. As directed by her deceased Aunt Lupe, she continues the
poetry and short stories that free her from the chokehold of Mango Street. While she finds joy in pencils
and paper, she does not in her name. “Esperanza” in Spanish means “hope” and “waiting,” two words
that describe this girl perfectly. She is the hope for the oppressed but she must wait for her opportunity
to leave. In contrast to Pai, she actually did have a childhood, a carefree times of playing and having fun
with friends before the burden of responsibility is placed on their shoulders, like the sky on Atlas’s.

Paikea, alternatively, is a proud and confident girl. She knows what is best and what her people
must do in order to survive. Starting with the women, she tells them to change their ways at the ripe old
age of ten. Pai is a serious and mature child, with a grown mannerism and demeanor. Little can shame
her, except for her grandfather; all Pail wants is to be loved and accepted by Koro. While everyone in the
village can see that Pai is fated to become the next chief, Koro stubbornly refuses to believe until the
very end. In her position, she takes her ancestry very seriously. Pai was named after her ancestor who
rode the back of a whale to New Zealand, and she is exceedingly proud of her name, unlike Esperanza.
And unlike Esperanza, it seems as though Pai has no time for boys or any relationships between them.
She considers herself “one of the boys,” and shows no interest. Growing up with her situation and the
multiple responsibilities that followed left little time for an actual childhood.

In the end, the fate of two different cultures rests in the hands of two different young girls. While
they both strive for freedom from oppression and change, Esperanza Cordero and Paikea Apirana have
different techniques through which they reach those goals. Esperanza, a quiet and ashamed girl of 13 or
14, chooses a singular path to walk. She chooses the road she must walk alone, unaccompanied but free
from patriarchal domination. While fighting to free those sitting at the window, Esperanza finds her own
destiny as the change needed on Mango Street. Paikea, a strong and confident girl of 10 or 11, walks the
forbidden path, the path of a chief. She chooses to defy her grandfather and all traditions in order to
modernize her people. In order to save them, she must change them. Both young women, influential and
inspiring, search for the key to free the ones they love.

This short constructed response was prompted by the following test question: “Explain how civil
disobedience was used in the struggle for India’s independence.” The student had only a portion of a class period to write the response.
Civil disobedience is the refusal to follow an unjust law. Gandhi led India to independence by using civil
disobedience and non-violent resistance. His motto was, “will not fight, will not comply.” One of Gandhi’s
first acts of civil disobedience was when he refused to move to 3rd class on the train. He bought a 1st
class ticket but they wouldn’t let him sit there. He then got kicked off the train. This is just one example
of Gandhi’s enforcement of non-violent resistance. He has done many things from refusing to get off
the sidewalk to being beaten for burning his pass. He figured that if he died, it would be for the right
reasons. He said, “They can have my body, not my obedience.” Eventually he got all of India going
against Britain’s unjust laws. While it took the people of India longer to realize, Gandhi proved that civil
disobedience and non-violent resistance can be a more effective way of fighting back. Britain finally let
India have its independence.

Student Sample: Grade 10, Argument
This argument was produced by a student who was asked to write a persuasive essay that required
research. The student generated the topic and had an opportunity to revise.
__________ School Bond Levy
The __________ School Board has recently proposed a bond levy to add new facilities as well as
conduct some major repairs to the school. The bond includes building a new gymnasium, a new science
room and lab, a new Media Center/Library, new Chapter 1 and Special Education classrooms, and other
facilities such as more parking space, an increase in storage area, and new locker rooms. Along with new
construction, the board is proposing to remodel facilities such as the drama/music areas, the entire roof,
the heating system, the school kitchen, and present gym as well. This bond allowing __________ School to
add more facilities should be passed in order for young students to be provided with a better education.
Several arguments have been brought up concerning the levy since it failed in the March
election. Some say that the school doesn’t need to have brand new facilities and better classrooms,
but it does. Just this year the school had to shut down for days at a time as a result of a malfunction of
the heating system. The roof of the library also had a leaking problem all winter long. The leaking has
actually caused the ceiling tiles to rot to the point where they are having to be removed. It isn’t safe to
sit underneath them because, in fact, they have fallen to tables where students had been working only minutes before.
Another issue that people may be concerned with is the money that taxpayers have to put up
for the building. The cost of the project in its entirety will be 2.9 million dollars, meaning that for the next
25 years, taxpayers would pay 40 cents more per thousand dollars in property tax than they do this year.
The project does cost a significant amount of money, but the school needs it. If something isn’t done now,
then the facilities such as the library, the science room and others will continue to grow steadily worse.
The construction and remodeling needs to be done eventually, so why not now, when interest rates are
low and expenses are also low. Superintendent __________ commented that it would cost the taxpayers
much less money now than ten years from now. Another reason that this is a good time to pass this bond
is that the results of Ballot Measure 5 are going into effect at the same time as the levy. As it stands now,
property tax rates will go down another $2.50 by next year; however, if taxpayers don’t mind paying what
they do now and can handle a 40 cent increase, then the school can be that much better.
Many other good reasons we exist for funding this construction now. For one, better facilities
will be made available to everyone: staff members, students, and community members. The new gym
will allow student athletes to have earlier practices and more time for homework. With only one gym in
a K–12 school system, the junior high has to practice in the morning before school, starting at 6:30 A.M.,
meaning that both the girls and boys teams had to practice at the same time, with half of the court for
the girls half for the boys. After school, the high school girls would practice from 3:30 to 5:30 P.M. The
varsity boys would then start at 5:30 or 6:00 and go until 7:30. After that, the junior varsity boys would
come in for an hour and a half. It’s absurd to think that student athletes can make good use of their time
with a schedule like that. If the bond were to pass, both the new gym and the present gym would be
used for practices and athletes wouldn’t have to wait so long to practice every day.
Another reason that the gym should be built is that it is no longer adequate. The bleachers are
too close to the court and so there is no room to walk by without getting in the way during a game. The
gym also poses a problem for the cheerleaders. As it is now, there is no room for them to cheer. They
have to stand on one of the ends which, of course, is right in the way of people walking by. If a new gym
were built, enough room would be provided surrounding the court that there wouldn’t be any of the problems there are now.
Another advantage to the bond proposed is that it would provide more space in the school.
The school has always been small, which is in some ways nice, but it needs to expand. The lack of space
is a problem because everyone is crammed into one little hallway trying to make it around from class
to class. As it is, there isn’t enough room for the library to just be a library or the kitchen to just be a
kitchen. Students can’t even go to the library when they need to because Health, Media, and other
classes are held there. The Satellite Learning classroom, which shares a space with the kitchen, usually
has a difficult learning atmosphere each day people prepare food for the hot lunch program. Another

problem area is the current science room and lab. Lab facilities are outdated and cannot be replaced
for a variety of reasons related to the plumbing and electrical systems. Both science teachers have said
publicly that the chemical storage room is inadequate and unsafe. The science curriculum is a core part
of students’ education and they deserve good facilities.
It is clear then, that __________ School needs significant improvements in which case the bond
must be passed. As a community, education is an essential part of the future. In the past, __________
has relied in the timber industry for employment, but times are changing and the younger generations
need to be better prepared to meet the challenges that arise. For example, they need to able to take
part in a variety of activities and be able to achieve in many different areas. If the school is inadequate,
how can the younger generations be provided with the education and training they need to be successful in the future?

This essay was produced for an on-demand assessment. Students were told to write about a character
in a work of literature whose pride or selfishness creates problems. The abbreviated time frame of
the assessment situation (and the consequent lack of opportunity to revise) explains the absence of
information and quotations from researched sources and perhaps the occasional spelling errors as well.
Animal Farm
In the novel, Animal Farm, by George Orwell, there is one very particular character whose pride and
selfishness creates problems. This character had just merely good ideas in the beginning. However, as
time went on, his true self-interest began to shine through. This character started a free republic of
animals and turned it into a plantation that used animals as slaves. He never did have enough and always
wanted more, regardless of the price that others had to pay. This character whose pride and selfishness
creates problems, is none other than the great leader of Animal Farm himself, comrade Napolean [Napoleon], the pig.
Comrade Napolean is a powerful authority on Animal Farm. In fact he is the leader of Animal Farm and a
high strung leader at that. After Old Major died, Napolean lived upon Old Major’s ideas. Napolean lead all
the animals to rebellion so that Manor Farm ceized to exist, and Animal Farm was born. In the first year,
he even worked the fields and helped bring in their biggest harvest ever. Little did the animals know, but
he would soon change. Eventually the animals started receiving less food because Napolean needed
more food to power his “large” brain. Later, he goes and runs off his successor, Snowball, so he can have
the whole farm to himself. Then he stopped working the fields. He started taking young animals and
selling them or using them for his own use. He stopped sleeping in the hay and slept in the farm house
instead. Finally, he took away half the grain fields so he could plant barely to make himself beer. This
Napolean was a power hungry, selfish individual for sure.
Being power hungry, always causes problems, and boy did Napolean cause problems. The animals
had received so little food that many were starving, you could see their bones, and some even died of
starvation. Nopoleans’s lack of work meant the animals had to work harder, and it wasn’t easy on an
empty stomach. Many animals would break their legs or hoofs but would continue to work. The lack of
new workers due to Napolean’s selling them off, meant that nobody could retire, and one old animal
even died in the fields. Snowball was a great teacher for the animals, and now that he was gone, they
lacked education. Then with finally only half of the fields being productive for food, the animals starved
even more and worked harder to make beer that they never saw. Not to mention that they had to sleep
on a dirt floor while the lazy Napolean slept in his nice comfortable bed. His selfishness had deffinately created problems.
Napolean’s experience had changed the farm drastically. He thought things were getting better while the
animals knew they were only getting worse. After the rebellion, many humans disliked Animal Farm and
the animals disliked humans. Nopoleans’s selfish ways were much like those of a farmer. So eventually as
Napolean became more “human,” the town’s people began to like him. Napolean could care less about
his animals, just so long as he was on good terms with the humans. By the novel’s end, Napolean is great
friends with every human in town. However, his animal slaves are no longer happy as they once were.
They still hate humans which means now, they hate Napolean. So due to Napolean’s pride, the story has
changed its ways from start to finish. He has turned friends into foe and foe into friends, but at great cost.
In the novel, Animal Farm, by George Orwell, Comrade Napolean is a character whose pride and
selfishness creates problems. The starving animals have suffered greatly because of their leader’s pride.
On the other hand, Napolean has gained great success through his selfishness. Unfortunately, that’s just
the way it is. You can’t have pride without problems. Even if they are little problems, it’s still due to pride.
Now, if Napolean had pride in his farm rather than in himself, well then maybe the humans would’ve
hated him, but he’d still has his true friends of four legs. However, he chose to follow a different path
and he burned those bridges along the way. So for now, Comrade Napolean’s pride and selfishness has
created problems for the animals, but someday, it will create problems for himself.

The essay that follows was written in response to this assignment: “Reflection Topic #3: Pride and
Acceptance. Wright struggles to find his ‘place’ in society. He refuses to forgo his morality and beliefs
to conform to the status quo. Examine Wright’s pride. Find examples in the text that demonstrate the
influence pride has on Wright’s actions. How does his pride influence his decisions? Is pride a positive or
negative influence in Wright’s life? How does Wright’s pride affect how his family members treat him?”
Students had one week to complete this assignment. The maximum length allowed was three pages.
Marching to His Own Beat
Pride is often criticized by society and habitually seen as a negative characteristic evoking
such connotations as conceit, egotism, arrogance, and hubris. In Richard Wright’s struggle to find his
“place” in society in Black Boy, pride has both negative and positive connotations. Despite the negative
consequences, pride allows Wright to maintain his moral compass, oppose conformity, and pursue his
passion of writing, thus demonstrating pride’s positive influence on Wright’s life.
Wright’s pride prompts him to make principled decisions and carry out actions that illustrate his
morality and inherent beliefs. Wright refuses to neglect his values and chooses right over wrong even
when he recognizes that failure to adhere to what is expected of him will ultimately result in negative
and often violent consequences. When he receives the title of valedictorian and refuses to read the
speech prepared for him by his principal, choosing instead to present his own speech in spite of the
threat of being held back, Wright’s pride is demonstrated. Although he comprehends the consequences
and the gravity of his decision, Wright refuses to compromise his beliefs: “I know that I’m not educated,
professor . . . But the people are coming to hear the students, and I won’t make a speech that you’ve
written” (174). Though urged by his family members and his classmates to avoid conflict and to comply
with the principal’s demand, Wright refuses because he does not believe it is the morally correct thing
to do. Even though his pride is negatively perceived by his peers and relatives as the source of defiance,
they fail to realize that his pride is a positive factor that gives him the self confidence to believe in
himself and his decisions. Wright’s refusal to acquiesce to his family’s ardent religious values is another
illustration of his pride. Wright is urged by his family and friends to believe in God and partake in their
daily religious routines; however, he is undecided about his belief in God and refuses to participate in
practicing his family’s religion because “[His] faith, such as it was, was welded to the common realities
of life, anchored in the sensations of [his] body and what [his] mind could grasp, and nothing could ever
shake this faith, and surely not [his] fear of an invisible power” (115). He cannot put his confidence into
something unseen and remains unwavering in his belief. Pride allows Wright to flee from the oppressive
boundaries of expectations and to escape to the literary world.
Wright’s thirst and desire to learn is prompted by his pride and allows him to excel in school
and pursue his dreams of becoming a writer. The reader observes Wright’s pride in his writing when
he wrote his first story. Pleased with his work, he “decided to read it to a young woman who lived next
door . . . [He] looked at her in a cocky manner that said: . . . I write stuff like this all the time. It’s easy”
(120-121). This attitude of satisfaction permits Wright to continue to push himself to improve and pursue
his craft. Pride eventually leads Wright to submit his work to the local newspaper; his obvious pride in
his work is clearly portrayed when he impatiently tells the newspaper editor, “But I want you to read it
now” (165) and asks for his composition book back when he does not immediately show interest in his
story. Pride in his academic achievements motivates him to excel in his studies; after Wright advanced to
sixth grade in two weeks, he was elated and thrilled at his astonishing accomplishment: “Overjoyed, I ran
home and babbled the news . . . I had leaped a grade in two weeks, anything seemed possible, simple,
easy” (125). Wright’s pride in his intelligence and studies allows him to breeze through school: “I burned
at my studies . . . I read my civics and English and geography volumes through and only referred to them
in class. I solved all my mathematical problems far in advance” (133). Pride provides him with the self confidence and contentment that his family and society fail to give him. It removes Wright from both
the black culture and the white culture and moves him rather to the “art culture”, in which Wright can achieve higher than what is anticipated of him.
Wright’s ability to oppose conformity and forego the status quo also stems from his pride. Pride
propels him to assert himself even if it defies what is expected of him as a black individual. Upon telling
one of his old employers, a white woman, that he wants to be a writer, she indecorously scoffs at him
and makes an impudent remark “You’ll never be a writer . . . Who on earth put such ideas into your . . .

=== Page 71 ===
Common Core State Standards for english language arts  & literacy in history/social studies, science, and technical subjects appendix c  |   71
head?” (147).  This remark causes him to almost immediately quit his job; Wright remarks, “The woman
had assaulted my ego; she had assumed that she knew my place in life . . . what I ought to be, and I
resented it with all my heart” (147). Wright’s refusal to simply go along with what is expected of him,
thoroughly disappoints and aggravates his family and society, yet his pride has a positive influence on
his life; pride allows Wright to not only remove himself from the boundaries of the black vs. white society
and the insidious effect of racism but it also sets Wright free from the constraints of acceptance. Pride
ultimately frees Wright to pursue his passion and identify himself not as a black or white person but rather as a “writer”.
In Wright’s struggle to overcome the overwhelming expectations he is faced with by society,
pride puts him at odds with his family and society but ultimately serves as a positive influence, allowing
him to withstand conformity and escape the status quo. This attitude allows Wright to maintain his
moral compass, believe in his self worth, and pursue his passion. Pride is more than pure arrogance and
haughtiness. To Wright, pride is something far greater; pride is the characteristic that gives him the
strength to march to his own beat; to the beat of the literary world.

The essay that follows was written in response to an extra credit assignment in an anatomy and
physiology class. Students were asked to summarize key points about a topic from given information
and from their own research on the Internet and to explain how the topic was relevant to their future. A
list of sources was not required in the assignment.
Summary of Key Points
For many years, scientists and researchers weren’t able to examine normal, healthy brains. They
only got brain data from autopsies and surgeries. Even so, they were able to learn a lot about how the
brain functioned because when people suffered brain damage to parts of the brain, they could see
what functions were impaired and know the parts of the brain that were responsible for that function.
MRI technology has changed that because now scientists can examine healthy brains at all stages of
development, including getting functional results that show areas of the brain that “light up” while
performing tasks. Therefore, scientists are now able to measure how the brain works.
95% of the brain has been formed by age 6, but through MRI studies researchers now know
that changes in the brain structure continue to occur late in child development. The prefrontal cortex
has a growth spurt just before puberty and then prunes back in adolescence. This part of the brain is
responsible for reasoning, controlling impulses, and making judgments. The growth and pruning is a
very important stage of brain development, so when this second wave is happening teen’s activities can
affect how their brain responds for the rest of their lives.
Researchers have found waves of growth and change in other parts of the brain as well,
including the corpus callosum and the cerebellum. The corpus callosum influences language learning,
and the cerebellum helps physical coordination and is also used to process mental tasks and higher
thought such as math, philosophy, decision-making, etc.

This recent research has confirmed what scientists have known for many years . . . that different
parts of the brain mature at different times. However, the brain is much more changeable than previously
thought, with structural changes taking place into adolescence and beyond. Knowing more about the
brain’s structure is only one piece of the puzzle. Much more research is needed to draw conclusions
about how the brain structure and function directly cause behavior.
Conclusion:
MRI technology has enabled researchers to learn much more about the brain’s growth and
development. They have learned that parts of the brain, such as the pre-frontal cortex, an area of
the brain that controls reasoning and judgment, goes through a second growth spurt just before
puberty, and that this helps to explain why teenagers begin to have more control over their impulses
and are able to make better judgments. Additionally, scientists have been able to confirm that some
brain characteristics are genetic, and others are affected by environmental factors. Confirming that
different parts of the brain mature at different times and that the brain has structural changes through
adolescence is very important, but there is a great deal more research that needs to be done to learn
about how brain structure and function relate to behavior.
How is this article relevant to my future?
Knowing more about the brain and how it influences behavior will have a major impact on how
children and teenagers are raised and educated. For example, one of the researchers, Giedd believed
that the growth and pruning can happen at a time of brain development when the actions of teenag ers can affect them the rest of their lives, his “use it or lose it principle.” This is the time when music or
academic development could be “hardwired.” This theory puts more emphasis on parents to make sure
their teens have the right focus and guidance. Most parents already believe in a basic approach to raising
and educating their children, but this research could lead to a very specific timetable and a do and don’t
guide to child development, making sure that their child is exposed to the appropriate factors at the right time.

Student Sample: Grade 12, Argument
This essay on dress codes was written for a university/college placement assessment. Two different
perspectives on an issue (whether or not dress codes should be adopted in school) were provided in the
prompt, and students were advised to either support one of the two points of view given or present a
different point of view on the issue. The students were allowed thirty minutes to write.
I believe that it would be beneficial for our schools to adopt dress codes. Although some may
argue that this action would restrict the individual student’s freedom of expression, I do not agree. Our
right to express ourselves is important, but in our society none of us has unrestricted freedom to do as
we like at all times. We must all learn discipline, respect the feelings of others, and learn how to operate
in the real world in order to be successful. Dress codes would not only create a better learning environ ment, but would also help prepare students for their futures.
Perhaps the most important benefit of adopting dress codes would be creating a better learn ing environment. Inappropriate clothing can be distracting to fellow students who are trying to concen trate. Short skirts, skimpy tops, and low pants are fine for after school, but not for the classroom. T-shirts
with risky images or profanity may be offensive to certain groups. Students should espress themselves
through art or creative writing, not clothing. With fewer distractions, students can concentrate on get ting a good education which can help them later on.
Another benefit of having a dress code is that it will prepare students to dress properly for dif ferent places. When you go to a party you do not wear the same clothes you wear to church. Likewise,
when you dress for work you do not wear the same clothes you wear at the beach. Many professions
even require uniforms. Having a dress code in high school will help students adjust to the real world.
Lastly, with all the peer pressure in school, many students worry about fitting in. If a dress code
(or even uniforms) were required, there would be less emphasis on how you look, and more emphasis on learning.
In conclusion, there are many important reasons our schools should adopt dress codes. Getting
an education is hard enough without being distracted by inappropriate t-shirts or tight pants. Learning
to dress for particular occasions prepares us for the real world. And teens have enough pressure already
without having to worry about what they are wearing.

Student Sample: Grade 12, Argument
This essay was produced in a two-hour-long college placement exam. Students first read a passage of
approximately a thousand words titled “In Praise of Boredom.” The passage was adapted from an essay
published by Ellen Ruppel Shell in 2000. Students were then asked to respond to Shell’s views, drawing
on anything else they had previously read, their observations, and/or their experiences.
Freedom From Structure
Children are blank slates that are subject to the environment around them. Allowing a child to interact
with their surroundings is difficult for adults because it leaves each decision, and each consequence
of that decision, up to them. Ellen Ruppel Shell believes that children miss out on experimenting and
discovering aspects of the world that cannot be taught in a classroom or read about in a book. I agree
that children can learn many important lessons about social interaction and the products of creativity by
playing on their own, or with other children, in a free and open environment.
To relieve the inevitable boredom that every child eventually encounters, they can nourish their creative
minds by playing alone. As a child, I was content to sometimes play by myself in a land of make-believe.
If it was cold and rainy outside, I would pretend it was the middle of summer. Night became day, my
bedroom became a kingdom, my bed was a castle, my floor was a mote, and I was a princess. Playing
“let’s pretend” allowed me to imagine and create my own world when reality seemed too mundane.
“Boredom leads to exploration, which leads to creativity,” and nothing is more creative than a world that exists in the mind of a child.
There are endless opportunities for parents to stimulate and teach their kids that come with instructions
and rules and boundaries, but I agree with Shell when she declares that “the best play is spontaneous
and unpredictable.” Plain and simple freedom is invaluable, and we are only so free as children. As we
grow up, our minds become molded around society’s rules and we learn to conform to a certain way of
thinking and creating. If adults see a soccer ball, they will only think of how to play soccer. If children see
a soccer ball they will immediately create their own rules and proceed with an entirely different game.
The ability to be spontaneous and imaginative is strongest in children because they know nothing else.
Adults and parents that bombard their kids with structured activities are wasting the unique and innate
ability of children to create; however, a parent’s reasoning for such structure is not unsupported.
There are many life lessons that can be difficult to learn on your own, so adults establish controlled
environments for their children to learn about the world. For example, making new friends can be an
awkward and terrifying process for kids, so parents will try to make friends for their children. What most
adults don’t realize is that they are robbing their child of a chance to open up and reach out to another
person. The kid they meet on the jungle gym will be more beneficial to them than the kid their parent
forced them to play with. “We don’t believe that they can navigate the world, so we try to navigate it for
them.” Shell believes that adults need to trust their kids to discover the world for themselves and that it’s
just as important for them to fail as it is for them to succeed.
For children, it’s not about the final product, it’s how they get there. When forced to follow rules and
obey boundaries, kids are not given the opportunity to use their imagination. I agree with Shell and I
believe that it is more beneficial for children to make believe, be spontaneous, and discover as much as they can about the world for themselves.

In the Wake of the Spanish Lady:
American Economic Resilience in the Aftermath of the Influenza Epidemic of 1918
Whatever does not kill me makes me stronger.1 —Friedrich Nietzsche

America in the years leading up to 1918 was as confident in its medical ability as it had ever
been. In only one century, it had seen the successful vaccination, containment, or cure for the notorious
menaces of smallpox, anthrax, rabies, meningitis, typhoid, malaria, yellow fever, diphtheria, cholera, and
tetanus.2 Due to the new strides in bacteriology, germ theory, and sanitation, as well as new methods
devised to control food-, water-, and insect-borne diseases, Americans were experiencing an era of
unprecedented health. Whereas in all previous wars, more American soldiers were lost to disease than in
action, American troops in World War I saw an all-time low in the number of deaths due to disease. Army
camp inspections, carried out by William Henry Welch, the respected doctor and assistant to the Army
Surgeon General, revealed that, though camps were overcrowded, “the health of the army proved to be as
good as any reasonable doctor could expect.”3 Unfortunately, the new light that had been shed on disease
control did not apply to air-borne viruses. Because neither antibiotics nor a way to control the spread of
air-borne diseases had been invented yet, America was as vulnerable to the deadly grip of influenza that
would befall it in 1918 as Medieval Europe had been to the Bubonic Plague of the 14th century.

More people died of the Spanish Flu in the 10 months that it devastated the world than had died
of any other disease or war in history. A commonly cited estimate of deaths is 21 million worldwide, yet
prominent demographer Kingsley Davis estimates that the disease killed approximately 20 million in the
Indian subcontinent alone.4 The actual number of deaths will never be known, but the modern estimate
is somewhere between 50 and 100 million.5 If an equal percentage of the world population died today,
that would be close to 2 billion victims.6 A bare minimum of 550,000 Americans, or .5 percent of the
American population, died in the apocalyptic pandemic.7 Yet, due to some historical and demographic
particulars of the 1918 flu, the American economy—which nearly collapsed in some areas during the outbreak—was not crippled in any lasting way.

The flu is not generally thought of as a killer. Instead, it is perceived as a pesky annual virus,
slightly more troublesome than the common cold, but nothing serious. In reality, the average yearly flu
is an extremely virulent disease, infecting anywhere from 30 to 60 million Americans annually, of whom
about 36,000 die (usually the very old or the very young.)8 It mutates so frequently that humans are
never fully immune to it, so a yearly vaccine must be produced to counteract it, whereas most viruses
require only one vaccination in a lifetime.9 The killer flu of 1918, dubbed the Spanish Flu or the Spanish
Lady, was a particularly deadly mutation of this influenza virus.10 In comparison to the .1 percent of
infected who die of the annual flu, it killed 2.5 percent of those who contracted it.11 This mutation had
a propensity to cause pneumonia, untreatable at the time, and clogged its victims’ lungs with bloody
sputum until their faces turned dark purple and they died of suffocation.12

The origins of the Spanish Flu are uncertain, but most experts believe that the first wave in the
U.S. emerged in Fort Riley, Kansas, on March 11, 1918, when one of the men came down with a milder form
of the mysterious illness.13 As of the next day, 414 soldiers had contracted the virus, and by the end of
the week at least 500 were sick.14 In total, 48 men died from the first influenza-pneumonia strain by the
time it had run its course in the camp—too low a number to merit any concern in the medical community
in 1918.15 Even though the virus struck at least 13 other military camps, there was sparse evidence that
civilians were similarly affected, and, besides, disease was a fact of life in any military camp.16 So, little
attention was directed to the budding pandemic. America instead focused on the new draft calls, the
war in Europe, the suffragette movement, and the Bolshevik tumult in Russia, while ignoring the mild outbreak of a hard-to-identify flu.17

As expected, the flu subsided quickly with a forgettable number of casualties. Unforeseen,
however, was the deadlier second wave that would emerge that August to explode in September with

=== Page 81 ===
Common Core State Standards for english language arts  & literacy in history/social studies, science, and technical subjects appendix c  |   81
unprecedented virulence. Influenza viruses thrive in cold, dry weather, which is why flu season tends to
be during the winter.18 The fact that it exploded like it did in August, which is neither cold nor dry, makes
this flu remarkable. The epidemic first struck Camp Devens, an overcrowded military camp thirty miles
from Boston, on September 8 after brewing in Europe for about a month.19 From there, it spread to the
rest of the United States in an unsettlingly erratic manner, hitting most of the East coast, then some of the
Midwest and the Gulf Coast region, then the West coast, and ultimately striking the interior.20 Although at
times slow in reaching certain regions, the Spanish Flu was horrifyingly thorough in its damages.

Nearly every city in the United States was affected economically by the flu in the short-term. In
many places, the workforce was paralyzed because 21-to-29-year-olds suffered the greatest casualties.21
So many people died at uncommonly young ages that the average life expectancy dropped 12 years,
from 51 in 1917 to 39 in 1918.22 Whether or not the infected had been young, healthy, and robust prior
to contracting the flu was of little consequence. The military, which consisted of a particularly young,
healthy, and robust demographic, was hit the hardest of any social group in America: 40 percent of
the Navy and 36 percent of the Army developed the flu in 1918.23 With victims’ average age being 33,
the volume of death claims by flu victims blind-sided the life insurance companies.24 One life insurance
company handled $24 million worth of unanticipated death claims for 68,000 deaths.25 The fact that
the majority of victims were in the prime of their lives defied actuarial projections, confusing insurance
companies, destroying families, and disrupting the economy at large.

In the most severe stages of the flu, the “essential services” of cities verged on collapse as
policemen, firemen, garbage collectors, telephone operators, and even the doctors, nurses, and social
workers who were struggling to fight the flu, were absent from work.26 The Bureau of Child Hygiene
strove to handle an overwhelming population of orphans as the fathers and mothers of America, those
in the most vulnerable age-range, were decimated by influenza.27 Employment standards plummeted,
the only requirement in some places being “two hands and willingness to work.”28 Worst off of any
“essential service” were the processors of the dead. As morgues filled up, in some places with bodies
stacked three and four high, corpses accumulated in the streets, spreading bacteria and the residual
influenza virus.29 In some situations, the dead were left untended, festering in their homes for days.30 The
primary emergency during the flu was in these “essential services,” which could not have held out much
longer than they did. While those services continued functioning, even at a minimal level, the rest of the
economy was able to rebound to normal capacity within three years, the “Roaring Twenties” as evidence
of this resilience. Despite the chaos, the nation persisted.

In The Review of Economic Statistics of December 1919, the year 1919 was deemed a “year of
readjustment,” one in which the United States was healing from the tensions of 1918.31 According to the
article, in 1918, “industries were straining their energies to meet the unusual demands occasioned by the
war,” yet it should be noted that the strain was also partially due to the Spanish Flu.32 In one county in
West Virginia, during the fall of 1918, the three months of flu had left 6,000 ill, of whom 500 died.33 This
sapped the county economy to near-collapse as 80 percent of the labor force fell ill.34 Coupled with the
large population overseas for the war, situations like this compromised cities across the nation, especially
with Surgeon General of the Army William Crawford Gorgas shipping thousands of America’s fittest
young doctors and nurses to Europe, where he believed they were most necessary.35 The doctors and
nurses who continued to serve at home, like many of the civilians who remained, were generally too old,
or too young, or too disabled to adequately respond to the Spanish Flu.36

When the epidemic reached cities with a deficient work force and incompetent, sparse medical
care, the critical damage to the economy was compounded by restrictive public health ordinances. In
an effort to restrict exposure to the virus, the Surgeon General had issued public health ordinances that
prohibited most public gatherings and required gauze masks to be worn at all times.37 In Philadelphia
alone, it is estimated that theaters, cinemas, and hotels lost $2 million to the flu from the ordinances, while
saloons lost $350,000.38 These ordinances turned out to be fairly pointless: even in places that strictly
adhered to the recommendations of the Surgeon General the case and death rates were no lower than
those in lenient cities.39 On a smaller scale, tobacco sales dropped off about 50 percent in places that
strictly required cotton face masks because men could not smoke while wearing masks.40 These masks
turned out to be completely ineffective, because the weave of the gauze proved too porous to stop a virus,
usually a tiny sphere with a diameter of about 1/10,000 of a millimeter.41 The futile public health ordinances
and gauze masks temporarily damaged business during the flu crisis, yet the economy rebounded.

When contagious diseases attack a society, it tends to hit the poorest sector of economy the
hardest. One of the reasons for this is that they are more prone to infect people who have cramped

=== Page 82 ===
Common Core State Standards for english language arts  & literacy in history/social studies, science, and technical subjects appendix c  |   82
living quarters, poor hygiene, inadequate water and food supplies, and exposure to parasites—some
of the consequences of poverty.42 Because the working class would be disproportionately affected
by disease, the work force would be disproportionately affected by disease, the work force would be
disproportionately diminished in the lowest-paying, most essential jobs during an epidemic. By contrast,
the Spanish Flu, being an air-borne disease (and thus not preventable through good hygiene and
health), affected all sectors of the economy equally. It killed vast numbers of people, but, as noted by
historian Alfred W. Crosby, it “ignored the differences between rural and urban, patrician and peasant,
capitalist and proletarian, and struck them all down in similar proportions.”43 Because it was so unbiased
in its selection, no social hierarchies were overturned, nor were any particular divisions of employment
gutted of laborers. Influenza’s only prejudice was that it ravaged the young, healthy age-range—
something fairly irrelevant to economic status—and thus the only long-term economic imbalance was
proportional: there were fewer people to work and fewer people sharing in the wealth.

Although the Spanish Flu killed a lower percentage of the population than it affected and lasted
for a shorter period of time, the economic benefits of the epidemic can be compared to those of the
Black Death. One of the peculiar positive effects of the Black Death, according to historian Norman
Davies, was that it marked “the decisive point in the decline of the feudal system in Western Europe.”44
Although social upheaval may have already been gaining momentum, the deadly epidemic that killed
approximately one-third of Europe allowed formerly impoverished and powerless serfs to assert their
independence.45 With an absence of competition in the work force and a high demand for menial labor,
serfs were able to gain comparative economic freedom with rising pay.46 This escalation of the price of
labor and goods during the plague is echoed in the aftermath of the Spanish Flu epidemic. The Review
of Economic Statistics of December 1919 observes the post-influenza wage inflation, noting that the
“efficiency of labor, unfortunately, has not materially improved and is still generally below the pre war level,” yet “rates of wages have remained high during 1919 and have continued to rise rather than
decline.”47 The Review also remarks on the oddity that “unemployment has not developed, in spite of
the demobilization of the army; and in many sections labor is still reported to be scarce.”48 The unusually
high wages and low labor supply despite the re-absorption of troops into the work force could be
attributed to the fact that so many people had succumbed to the pandemic on the home front that the
re-entry of troops had normalized, rather than overwhelmed, the labor market.

In the years following 1918, the influenza pandemic, though surely seared in the memories of
those it personally affected, quickly subsided from national consciousness.49 Even during the epidemic,
the flu was rarely mentioned in the papers or truly noticed on a national level. As noted by Crosby, “The
Reader’s Guide to Periodical Literature, 1919-1921 has 13 inches of column space devoted to citations of
articles about baseball, 20 inches to Bolshevism, 47 to Prohibition, and 8 inches to the flu.”50 As the United
States emerged victorious from the devastations of World War I, the brief but deadly nightmare of the
Spanish Flu was lost to the national memory. The war had put pressure on Americans to sacrifice as much
as possible: the government urging people to grow what food they could, eat less meat and fewer luxury
foods, buy war bonds, and serve in the army as required by the draft. Wartime America was dealing
with death on a regular basis as the war casualties continued to grow, ultimately reaching approximately
117,000 deaths—about 53,000 in battle, the remainder due to disease.51 With such a high proportion of
war losses due to disease and the influenza deaths accompanying the hardships on the home front, the
flu must have seemed so intricately enmeshed in the reality of war that it became unremarkable.

After the war had ended and the flu had essentially run its course in most places, the thrifty
attitudes about consumption enforced by the war effort and the strict public health ordinances were
immediately discarded. Americans had a brief attention span for such restrictions—they were only
heeded during the war for patriotic reasons or in the midst of a deadly, dramatic pandemic. The Review
of Economic Statistics of December 1919 remarked that “extravagant expenditure, both public and
private, is found on every hand.”52 San Franciscans—who endured the worst hit of the Spanish Flu on
the West Coast—had complied with the October-November 1918 masking ordinance that had required
gauze masks be worn at all times.53 Yet, a mid-December masking recommendation of that same year
met the fierce opposition of 90 percent of the city and was struck down by the San Francisco Board
of Supervisors.54 The intolerance for what were thought at the time to be potentially life-saving health
measures reflects the prevalent mood at the time of impatience with inconvenience that trumped even fear of death.

Perhaps the Spanish Flu would have drawn more attention if only it had left the scar of a long
depression in its wake. Yet, after the crippling 10 months of the flu, the American economy was not only

=== Page 83 ===
Common Core State Standards for english language arts  & literacy in history/social studies, science, and technical subjects appendix c  |   83
undamaged, but booming. Following the “year of readjustment” of 1919, the United States experienced a
sunny era of unprecedented prosperity.55 The national income, which had remained stagnant from 1890 to
1918, rose more than $200 per capita and laborers enjoyed a workday diminished from 12 to eight hours,
as well as a paid annual vacation.56 With the advent of mass-production due to the innovations of the
assembly line and expanded industrial exploitation of electricity, productivity soared to unheard-of levels.57
In the mere 30 years between 1899 and 1929, industrial production expanded by 264 percent.58 All of this
was accomplished by a manufacturing labor pool that, according to historian William E. Leuchtenburg
in his book The Perils of Prosperity, contained “precisely the same number of men in 1929 as it had in
1919.”59 The workforce to attain these new heights was the same workforce that been described in 1919 as
generally sufficient, yet which was in many sectors “still reported to be scarce.”60 In the same way that the
Renaissance thrived in the wake of the Black Plague by benefiting from capital redistribution to a greater
demographic, the destruction of the Spanish Flu had opened up a decade of culture and materialism to a
population that benefited from the resulting availability of jobs and higher wages.

With thousands of the fittest soldiers, doctors, and nurses overseas and the stress of coping
with wartime and its strict economic regulations, a flu epidemic was the last thing that Americans of 1918
needed, or expected. It was especially traumatic when even the enormous strides that had been made
in recent years in the medical community were insufficient to control this epidemic of a traditionally
unobtrusive disease. Disturbingly, young, healthy adults were the most likely to succumb to the virus
and die of a violent, delirious pneumonia. With the backbone of the economy debilitated and inept
medical care, U.S. society could have collapsed. However, the flu lasted for a short enough time that it
did not permanently disable the workforce. Also, because the primary target was an age-group rather
than a class, the virus infected different socioeconomic sectors evenly. As a consequence, though
in many places the workforce was reduced to the point of near-collapse, the population retained its
socioeconomic balance. Finally, because the flu took place for 10 months during and after World War I,
the most devastated demographic was replaced by the return of soldiers who could then be reabsorbed
easily into society, thereby alleviating the labor-pool crisis. From the perspective of its victims and
their loved ones, the 1918 influenza was a tragedy; however, viewed within an economic paradigm, the
Spanish Lady smoothed the transition from the turbulence of the 19th and early 20th centuries into the prosperity of the 1920s.

The writer of this piece • introduces a topic.
o
More people died of the Spanish Flu in the 10 months that it devastated the world
than had died of any other disease or war in history. . . . Yet, due to some historical and
demographic particulars of the 1918 flu, the American economy—which nearly collapsed
in some areas during the outbreak—was not crippled in any lasting way.
•
organizes complex ideas, concepts, and information so that each new element builds on that which precedes it to create a unified whole.
o
The information is organized logically (and, in places, chronologically). The introduction

Details: In only one century, it had seen the successful vaccination, containment, or
cure for the notorious menaces of smallpox, anthrax, rabies, meningitis, typhoid,
malaria, yellow fever, diphtheria, cholera, and tetanus.2 . . . The war had put pressure on
Americans to sacrifice as much as possible: the government urging people to grow what
food they could, eat less meat and fewer luxury foods, buy war bonds, and serve in the army as required by the draft.
o
Examples: It mutates so frequently that humans are never fully immune to it . . . The
killer flu of 1918, dubbed the Spanish Flu or the Spanish Lady, was a particularly deadly mutation of this influenza virus.10 o
Facts: Following the “year of readjustment” of 1919, the United States experienced a
sunny era of unprecedented prosperity.55 The national income, which had remained
stagnant from 1890 to 1918, rose more than $200 per capita and laborers enjoyed a
workday diminished from 12 to eight hours, as well as a paid annual vacation. 56 o
Quotations: As noted by Crosby, “The Reader’s Guide to Periodical Literature, 1919 1921 has 13 inches of column space devoted to citations of articles about baseball, 20
inches to Bolshevism, 47 to Prohibition, and 8 inches to the flu.”50 . . . All of this was
accomplished by a manufacturing labor pool that, according to historian William E.
Leuchtenburg in his book The Perils of Prosperity, contained “precisely the same number of men in 1929 as it had in 1919.”59 •

feedback and instructional support while creating the portfolio.
Fact vs. Fiction and All the Grey Space in Between
The modern world is full of problems and issues—disagreements between peoples that stem from
today’s wide array of perceptions, ideas, and values. Issues that could never have been foreseen are
often identified and made known today because of technology. Once, there were scatterings of people
who had the same idea, yet never took any action because none knew of the others; now, given our
complex forms of modern communication, there are millions who have been connected. Today, when a
new and arguable idea surfaces, the debate spreads across the global community like wildfire. Topics
that the general public might never have become aware of are instantly made into news that can be
discussed at the evening dinner table. One such matter, which has sparked the curiosity of millions, is the
recent interest in the classification of literature as fiction or nonfiction.
A number of questions have arisen: What sparked the booming interest? Where exactly is the line that
separates fiction from nonfiction, and how far can the line be stretched until one becomes the other? Are
there intermediaries between the two, or must we classify each piece of literature as one or the other?
Do authors do this purposefully, or with no intent? The answers to these questions are often circular and
simply lead to further dispute. In modern times, the line between the classification of literature as either
fiction or nonfiction has become blurred and unclear; the outdated definitions and qualifications have
sparked the development of new genres and challenged the world’s idea on the differences between the two.
The Spark Which Lit the Fire
Though it had been a fairly relevant and known topic to members of the literary world, the idea that a
book is not always completely fiction or nonfiction seemed to be an obscure and unnecessary subject
for the public to ponder. However, the average Monday morning watercooler conversation was forever
changed when what has become known as the “Million Little Lies Scandal” broke out in early 2006. It
started on October 26, 2005 when author James Frey appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show. He was the
only guest of the day, there to promote and discuss his book entitled A Million Little Pieces. The book, a
nonfiction memoir, recounts Frey’s experience as an alcoholic, drug addict, and criminal, and the heroic
story of his overcoming of every obstacle in his path to getting clean. After his appearance on the show
and addition into Oprah’s highly esteemed and publicized book club, the novel skyrocketed to the top of
the charts, eventually becoming a number one best seller. But his success was short lived; in the months
that followed, The Smoking Gun, a Web site that posts legal documents, arrest records, and investigates
celebrity police dealings, unearthed some discrepancies between Frey’s story and the police documents that should have supported his claims.
Though the Web site had originally only been searching for Frey’s mugshot, one small inconsistency
soon led to another, and after a six-week investigation, the site released its findings. Investigators had
taken any parts of Frey’s story that could be verified by a police record, matched it with his actual
records, and were shocked by what they found; nearly all of Frey’s memoir was either highly embellished
or flat out fabricated. Huge discrepancies between the truth and what was stated in Frey’s book became
headline news; instances like Frey claiming to be in jail for eighty-seven days when in reality he was
incarcerated for a mere four hours, or the serious drug charges that he claimed were filed against him that were never found on any record.
Frey was caught, and on January 8, 2006, The Smoking Gun published an article called “A Million Little
Lies,” which took an in-depth look at every provable inconsistency in the novel. By comparing direct
quotes from the book to police records—or rather, the lack of police records—Frey’s entire novel was
pieced apart until there was nothing remaining. Completely discredited, yet still somehow maintaining
the entire situation was a misunderstanding, Frey attempted to salvage his namesake by reappearing on
Oprah; in the end, this proved to be more damaging than helpful. He had his reasons for what he’d done, he tried to explain.

=== Page 90 ===
Common Core State Standards for english language arts  & literacy in history/social studies, science, and technical subjects appendix c  |   90
Reasons that were valid and legitimate according to him, as he stated that he would not have been
able to get the book signed unless he was willing to sell it as nonfiction. Details had been slightly
exaggerated, he conceded, but this was only to allow the novel to fluctuate and flow in a way that would
not have been possible had he stuck to the bare facts.
Regardless, in the end, it was proved beyond anyone’s reasonable doubt that James Frey’s novel landed
dead center in the proverbial grey area between black and white—his novel was partially fiction and
partially nonfiction. And so started the media frenzy; the scandal covered newsstands for weeks, people
took sides with either Frey or his critics, and similarly themed novels were called into question. Suddenly
the world cared about a novel’s validity; they no longer assumed that the words fiction and nonfiction
could themselves define the amount of fact that stood behind a piece of literature. People also realized,
simultaneously, that they might not exactly know what defined and separated fiction and nonfiction, or
if, in more modern times, the two might mesh together a bit more than in the literature of old.
With Difficulty, the Line is Drawn
Fiction and nonfiction: they’re two words that are surprisingly hard to define. It’s difficult to ascertain
what the words have meant in the past, what they each encompass today, and how past and present
definitions have been molded and shaped by the literature of the time. Traditionally, fiction is ‘a tale
drawn from the imagination’ and nonfiction is ‘a statement of fact’; however, the two are so much more
complex than that. For many, the word ‘fiction’ is associable with the word ‘story,’ as if the two are
equal or interchangeable. Subgenres of fiction often contribute to this perception; novels, short stories,
fairy tales, comics, films, animation, and even video games help the mind classify fiction as a substance
completely fabricated in the mind. Fiction is largely assumed to be a form of art or entertainment, and in
many cases this is true—science fiction and romance novels are two examples of how we are entertained
by a good book. But frequently, stories are told to educate—to raise awareness regarding a certain topic about which the author is concerned.
Stories like Cormac McCarthy’s The Road, George Orwell’s 1984, and Ayn Rand’s Anthem all warn us
about terrible futures that may arise as the result of the choices of humanity. Uzodinma Iweala’s Beasts
of No Nation is a short work of fiction based entirely around fact; while it tells the tale of a fictional little
African boy thrown into a bloody civil uprising, his story of being a recruited child soldier is happening
to hundreds of similar boys to this very day. Fables and parables are other, more subliminal examples of educational, moral-based fiction.
In the same way, nonfiction is surrounded by many presumptions; people assume that anything read
in a nonfiction book is true, otherwise the literature would be labeled as fiction. Nonfiction literature
is factual literature, but there is one important note to make. Nonfiction is literature that is presented
as fact. This presentation may be accurate or inaccurate; in other words, the author is presumed to
be writing what he or she believes to be the truth, or what he or she has been led to believe is the
truth. Examples of nonfiction include essays, documentaries, scientific papers, textbooks, and journals.
Nonfiction differs from fiction, however, in the areas regarding how the literature is presented and used.
Directness, simplicity, and clarity are all aims of nonfiction literature.
Providing straight, accessible, understandable information to the reader is the purpose of nonfiction, and
the ability to communicate well to the audience is what defines a skilled writer of the field. And despite
the truth behind nonfiction writing, it is often necessary to persuade the reader to agree with the ideas
being presented; therefore, a balanced, coherent and informed argument is also vital.
More Than Simply Black or White
The line between fiction and nonfiction starts to blur, however, when one considers genres that seem to
mesh the two; historical fiction, new journalism, and biographies/autobiographies. These are only three
of the defined new genres encompassed by what has become the intermediary between fiction and
nonfiction— literary nonfiction. When one explores these three genres, it becomes blaringly obvious how easily fiction and nonfiction can blur into one.
Historical fiction is the product when an author takes real people and real events and tells the story
of what actually happened to them, but inserts characters of their own creation and a plot line that
they invent in order to tie the entire novel together. This idea is perfectly exampled in Ann Rinaldi’s
An Acquaintance with Darkness. This novel takes real historical aspects (the assassination of President

=== Page 91 ===
Common Core State Standards for english language arts  & literacy in history/social studies, science, and technical subjects appendix c  |   91
Lincoln; the trial of the only woman associated with his murder; the society of Washington, D.C., at the
time of his death; the history behind the practice of grave robbing) and inserts the character of a young
girl and her dying mother who, between the two of them, manage to tell the historical side of the story
along with their own imagined one. All the pieces of history are told completely as they happened; so on
some level, this novel is nonfiction. Yet it is also blatantly fiction—it has characters.
New journalism, biographies, and autobiographies, however, blur the lines in a slightly different way; they
call into question people’s ability to relay information truthfully and with no bias. New journalism is the
term coined in the 1960s to describe the then unconventional journalism techniques that brought the
reader inside the life and mind of the story. It’s a practice very common today; just watch any network
investigation series. The journalist attempts to get inside the mind of whomever is being investigated; he
or she digs up information regarding that person’s past, present, and potential future. The author then
takes all the factual background information they’ve collected and pairs it with the emotions, memories,
and feelings described to them by the person, and writes the complete story. If the complete work is to
be published as a book rather than a news article or made into a television script, it often ends up being
sold as a fiction novel. Yet is this the correct classification, given that all the information is true?
One excellent example of new journalism is Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood. When asked about it, Capote
himself even called it “unclassifiable.” Capote traveled to Kansas to investigate the murder of a family of
four; he ended up staying there for years, befriending the people of the town, discovering what he could
about the murders from them, and piecing together his book from interviews and information he gained
during his stay. When it was published, the novel became a best seller and also one of the first highly
noted pieces of literature to border the line between fiction and nonfiction; it was the first of its kind to
bring the idea of the blurring line to households across the United States.
Biographies and autobiographies are often questioned in the same way. Though not always thought of
as controversial and previously considered nonfiction, biographies and autobiographies don’t appear to
fit into today’s definition of fiction or nonfiction. The authors of both are simply telling the story of their
own life or of someone else’s life, but that begs an obvious question; is a highly detailed, written record
of a person’s feelings and perceptions able to be considered nonfiction? How can we classify people’s
emotions and memories as fact? An outstanding example of an autobiographical piece that cannot be
defined is Tim O’Brien’s The Things They Carried. His self-proclaimed ‘nonfiction novel’ is a collection
of stories stemming from both his imagination and his personal experience in Vietnam during the war.
O’Brien feels that the idea of creating a story that is technically false yet truthfully portrays a situation—
as opposed to just stating the facts and stirring no emotion within the reader—is the correct way to
educate the public in a meaningful, everlasting way. He, like many others, believes that biographies and
autobiographies should be left as their own separate being; a genre where the reader may classify for
himself or herself what truth and what fiction might lie within the literature. All of the issues mentioned
above are shrouded in debate; there are no straightforward answers.
Fiction and nonfiction are two polar opposites on a scale that today offers little to no gradient. In years
past, these two words have been definition enough and have managed to encompass all types of written
word. Times change, however, and in the modern day, authors have begun to push the boundaries and
discover the furthest extent of where literature can take us. Since they feel as if their literature does not
fit into the classifications of fiction or nonfiction, authors are creating new genres where their novels and
books can be properly sorted and defined. An update is long overdue—both an update to the definitions
currently used to classify books, and an update in which we create new areas into which books can be classified.

The Making of a Human Voice and How to Use It
The violin is arguably the most cherished and well-known orchestral instrument in the world. Many are
moved by its unique quality of sound; it is known as the only instrument close to the sound of a human
voice. Maybe the violin is so revered because “humans in all times and places are powerfully moved, or
threatened, by the possibility that with our hands and minds we can create something that is perfect”
(Ebert). But the sound of this instrument was not magically created overnight; the creation of the very
first violin took many years and has been a product of much experimentation. This is the reason that
every beginning violinist should learn to appreciate the art of making a violin and the process of holding
and bowing his instrument so that he will have the knowledge to play it well.
The process of constructing a violin is an age-old tradition that has been developed and refined for
centuries. Each step is crucial to the quality of the instrument’s sound. The violin’s body consists of a
rib structure, which is made from six thin maple ribs that are bent to shape by applying dry heat. The
ribs are reinforced at the joints by wood blocks that are located in each of the four outward curving
corners, one at the top rib, and one at the lower rib. To reinforce the glue-joints between the ribs and
the table and back of the violin, strips of willow or pine are glued along the inside edges of the ribs to
create the lining. The back plate of the violin is made from either one or two matched pieces of maple.
The wood chosen for these pieces is very important and affects the sound production of the violin. The
outline of the plate is drawn onto the maple and sawn out, and the arching (the outward bulge) is then
painstakingly carved to a thickness of about five millimeters. The front plate of the violin, or table, has
two soundholes carved from it on either side of the bridge. These soundholes are [shaped like the letter
f] and are made to project the sound. Purfling is done by inlaying thin strips of wood around the top
and back of the violin a short distance from the rim. Purfling strengthens the delicate edgework and
produces a beautiful frame around the instrument’s outline (Gusset).
The bridge is cut from a thin sliver of maple. Intricate shapes are carved from it, known as the “heart,”
“ears,” and the two “feet” that allow it to stand on the violin table. The bridge is placed directly between
the small nicks cut in the middle of each [soundhole]. The top of the bridge is curved to conform to the
arch of the violin table, which allows the player to play each string individually (Skinner). The bridge is
held onto the instrument by as much as seventeen pounds of pressure exerted from the four strings,
which makes it a very delicate piece that must be checked periodically for leaning or warping. A bass bar is fitted to the underside of the table underneath the left foot of the bridge. Underneath the right
foot of the bridge, a soundpost is wedged between the front and back panel. The soundpost is made of
spruce or pine and resists the downward pressure of the strings and improves the sound.
A neck is fitted to the top rib and is made to hold the fingerboard above the table. The fingerboard is
a piece of ebony that extends beyond the neck and gradually widens towards the bridge. At the top of
the neck is a pegbox that has holes drilled into each side in which the pegs are held. The pegs are used
for a wide range of tuning. The pegbox slopes slightly backwards, which tensions the strings across the
ebony nut at the top of the fingerboard and keeps them raised above the fingerboard. At the top of the
pegbox is a scroll, added during the baroque period as an artistic flourish to provide an aesthetic touch
to its already pleasing appearance (Vienna Online Magazine). The strings are wrapped around the pegs,
stretched across the bridge, and held by an ebony or boxwood tailpiece. Anywhere from one to four fine
tuners can be attached to the tailpiece; these are used to tighten or loosen the string to change its pitch
for fine-tuning. The tailpiece is held into place by a loop of gut or nylon that is wrapped around an ebony
end button located in the middle of the bottom rib.
After gluing is done, the violin must be exposed to air and sun for several days to a few weeks to darken
the wood through the process of oxidation (Gusset). A protective varnish is brushed onto the surface of
the violin, which has a slight dampening effect to the sound, but it is primarily used to protect the wood
from perspiration, dust, dirt, and humidity (Kolneder 21). “The classical Italian makers appear to have
used different formulations for the ground coat, which seals and protects the wood and does much to
bring out its natural beauty, and the top coats, which were tinted with rich red, yellow and golden-brown

colours . . . Recent research suggests that walnut or linseed oil may have been an important constituent
of the finest old Italian varnish, later supplanted by recipes based on shellac and alcohol” (Stowell 5).
Both the construction of the violin and the way it is played are equally important to its sound
production. This is very critical to learn early so that a bad habit does not need correcting later on.
The modern violin is held between the chin and the left shoulder, with the scroll angling towards the
left. Violin teachers will have varying ideas of the correct position to hold a violin, but many great
violinists have held their instruments in different ways and have been successful. Some will hold a violin
directly under the chin, and others believe that the highest position on the shoulder is best. A chinrest
is usually attached to the left side of the tailpiece to make it more comfortable for the violinist to hold.
Sometimes a shoulder rest can be attached to the back of the violin which can be taken off after playing.
The shoulder rest can be made of various materials and provides height and padding to the violinist’s shoulder.
The left hand gently moves along the neck and fingerboard of the violin. The left fingers press down
upon the string, shortening its length, which creates a higher pitch. The right hand holds the bow, which
consists of a long stick of wood and a gathering of horsehair stretched from one end of the bow to
the other. “In the bowing area, two C-shaped indentations (the waist) accommodate the bow’s motion
across the strings” (Kolneder 13). The four strings can be bowed with the horsehair, plucked, or bounced
with the stick of the bow to produce vastly different colors of sound. “Bowing across the string is the
normal manner of tone production, but the process is actually extremely complicated and in its most
minute details not yet entirely understood . . . The strings’ basic pitch depends on its length, thickness,
material . . . and tension. These factors determine the frequency, that is, the number of vibrations . . . per
second” (Kolneder 16). The bow must be rosined frequently to allow the strings to vibrate to create the fullest sound.
Even if a luthier, or stringed instrument maker, takes years to complete a violin, it can only produce its
best sound if every step of its construction and every piece is made with is of the best quality. The same
is true of the time needed for a musician to play the violin well. A player must learn that what counts is
not how much time is spent practicing, but the quality of practice. A private teacher is also required, so
proper instruction will be given. A musician must also fully understand and appreciate the skill required
for constructing a violin. Not until then will a violinist be able to use his knowledge to bring forth their instrument’s fullest and most beautiful sound.

Student Sample: Grade 12, Informative/Explanatory
A high school senior wrote the essay that follows for a career and technical class. The student had unlimited time to research and write this paper.
Wood Joints
Have you ever wondered how to design complex wood joinery? The types of wood joinery have been
around for thousands of years. There are only twelve different main types of joints but there are many
that combine more than one for aesthetics or strength. The first step in designing joints is understanding
the different types and what their uses are. After you understand the strengths and weaknesses of the
different joints you can compare and contrast the joints for aesthetics. This and a lot of practice are what make excellent wood joinery.
The first step in designing joints is to figure out what way the wood will move so it won’t destroy the
joint. Then figure in the stresses that will be put on the joint. The three types of stresses on joints are
compression, tension, and shear. Compression is the weight pushing down on another piece and making
it crush down. Tension is things being pulled apart. Shear is when a piece breaks off when overloaded.
There are two categories of joints there are sawed joints and shaped joints. A sawed joint is one that can
be cut in one pass with a saw. The shaped joints can be complicated and take multiple cuts. Joints are
either made to lock together which are the shaped ones or to make glue surfaces to glue together which
are the sawed ones. The twelve types of joints are the butt joints, miter joints, rebate joints, dado joints,
groove joints, and lap joints are sawed joints. Scarf joints, finger joints, dovetails, mortise and tenon,
dowel joints, and spline joints are shaped joints.
To lay out good joints there are a few tools necessary. You need a good square that is accurate, a steel
ruler for measuring, a miter square, a sliding bevel, a protractor, and a caliper. The square is to draw
perfect ninety-degree lines. The miter square is so you can check your miters for accuracy. The sliding
bevel and protractor is to draw angles other than forty-five degrees. The caliper is to make sure the pieces getting joined are the right thickness.
For a good joint the fit should be tight. But if it is too tight it is not good because the wood joint could
crack or break. It should be tight enough that you can either push it together or give it a light tap with a
hammer to seat it. Another reason it can’t be too tight is because when the glue is applied the wood will
expand. Then it may not fit. The reason the wood expands is because putting the glue on is like putting water on it.
The way to make a tight joint is in the layout. A marking knife is a lot more accurate than a pencil. Also
make sure you use the same ruler throughout the project because there could be slight variations in
different ones. Always mark the waste side of the line and make sure you follow on the right side of the
line. If you cut on the wrong side of the line it will not be tight enough.
Now that you know what tools to use the next thing in tight joinery is to make sure all the pieces are the
same thickness or the thickness needed. Boards should be cut to a rough length so they are easier to
run through the machines. This will leave less room for error because the pieces won’t be so bulky. Also
make sure that the plywood is the thickness it’s claimed to be because it could be off 1/64 of an inch.
Whenever possible trace the mate for the joint to ensure a good fit.
If the joint is cut too small there are four different repairs. You can fill small gaps with a mixture of
sawdust of the same species of wood and glue. For loose parts you can add shims and sand or file to fit.
You could also make a design feature for loose parts. A slot cut in the end of a loose tenon with a wedge
put in it makes a nice design feature. But if it is real noticeable you should just replace it. When buying
lumber, always make sure you buy a couple of extra boards for mistakes or defects you didn’t notice when you bought it.
Out of the twelve different joints, I’ll start with the ones easiest to make. Butt joints are the easiest joints
to make. A butt joint is wood joined face to edge or edge to end. There are several ways to attach the
two pieces. They can be nailed or screwed together but should have a pilot hole drilled or the pieces
may split. Corrugated or metal fasteners can be used. Also you can make wooden triangles or blocks to

=== Page 99 ===

strengthen up corners. The pieces can also be doweled together, which is one of the stronger ways to
attach the two pieces. The two pieces can also be biscuit jointed together which is another fairly strong way to attach them.
Another fairly simple joint is the lap joint. The lap joint is where the two pieces of wood to be joined are
cut so only half the thickness of each piece is left. They are then glued, nailed, or screwed together. The
lap joint is mostly used for frames that will have plywood on them. The joint is also used in latticework,
which is used for decoration in different pieces of furniture. The downside to this joint is that it isn’t very
strong but it does look nice in some applications.
The next joint is a little more complicated but still fairly simple. The only thing complicated about the
miter joint is figuring out the angles for different shapes. A square is simple but you have to make sure
the saw is exactly square or the joints won’t fit tight. But as you get into different sided shapes the
angles are harder to figure out, especially if they have to be a compound miter. That is where it is cut on
an angle in two different directions. The miter joint looks good because there is no end grain but it isn’t
very strong. But biscuits can be added for some extra strength.
The next joint is the dado joint. Dados are slots cut across the grain. They are cut using a dado blade in
the table saw, on a router, or hand chiseled. The uses of a dado are for putting shelves in the sideboards
of a bookcase or other piece of furniture. The dado can be stopped short of the edge of the board to
form a stopped dado. This is useful when you don’t want the joint to be seen.
A joint similar to the dado is a groove. A groove runs with the grain instead of against it. There are
several ways to cut a groove. You can use a dado blade, router, molder, or shaper. A groove is usually
used in making raised panels. It is what holds the pane in between the rails and stiles.
A joint similar to a groove is the spline. The spline joint can either be a solid spline like tongue and
groove. That is where one board has a groove and another one has a piece with both edges are cut off
leaving the middle. A loose spline is a board with two grooves cut and then apiece of wood inserted in
the tow grooves and glued. The uses good for the spline is siding and paneling. It also works fairly well
in making large panels because the tongue helps to keep the boards aligned. You can dress up the spline
joint by putting a chamfer or bead on the edge of the boards.
A good joint for joining backs to furniture is the rebate joint. It also works well for joining the tops and
bottoms of furniture. A rebate joint is a dado at the end or edge of a board and usually has a piece of
wood in it the same thickness as the dado. The wood is usually nailed or screwed into place. Another
version of the rebate joint is one that is stopped. The stopped rebates are used when you don’t want the joint to show.
A joint that can be quite complicated is the scarf joint. The scarf joint is used to make two boards into a
a longer one. This joint is mostly used in timber frames. The joint came around in Europe when they had
cut all the long big trees down and had to find a way to make the long beams needed for their buildings
(Ramuz, 279). Then when the settlers came to America, they didn’t need it for another hundred years or
so until they did the same thing over here. The joint is usually about eight times longer than the width of
the board or beam. It is made to have a lot of glue surface to make it a fairly strong joint. But it is not as strong as a full-length board or beam.
Another joint that can be quite complicated until you have the jig made for it is the finger joint. The
finger joint is easy once the jig is made you just have to stand at the table saw and keep running the
boards over the dado bade. The finger joint is several grooves on the end of a board with the other
board cut to mate. They are very strong because it really increases the glue surface. The joint can also be
used as a hinge if the corners are rounded and a dowel put all the way through the joint.
The last two joints left are some of the most complicated ones to design and cut. These joints are the
real give away of quality joinery. If these joints are done properly they can last for hundreds of years and
will really make your work look professional. The two joints are the mortise and tenon and dovetails. You
can either cut these by hand or machine. If cut by machine, they aren’t as complicated to make as they
are when you cut them by hand. The joints aren’t cut by hand as much anymore, but when they are you can take more pride in your work.
I will start with the mortise and tenon. The mortise and tenon has been around for hundreds and hundreds

=== Page 100 ===
Common Core State Standards for english language arts  & literacy in history/social studies, science, and technical subjects appendix c  |   100
of years. There are many uses including timber frame, attaching aprons to the legs on tables, and
attaching rails and stiles on doorframes. Mortise and tenon are very strong joints. The timber frame barns
and buildings are still standing after hundreds of years. The only reason they fall is because of decay and
neglect. The mortise is a square hold cut to a certain depth and size. A through mortise is a square hole
that is cut all the way through the board or beam. The tenon is the mate to a mortise.  It is a square cut
on the end of a board or beam. They are usually in the center of the board but can be offset if there is
going to be more than one joint in the same spot. It also could be offset if it was going to be close to the
edge of the other post or leg. A through tenon can look good with a wedge, or you can peg the tenon for
strength. Mortises can be cut with a mortise, router, or drilled out and squared up with a chisel. Tenons
can be cut by router, table saw, or by hand. But whatever way you do it they still mean good quality work.
The other hallmark of quality wood joinery is the dovetail. Dovetails can either be cut by a router and
template or by hand with a lot of practice. A dovetail is similar to a finger joint except that it has angles.
The dovetail has been around for thousands of years and there is a reason why. It is very aesthetically
pleasing and strong enough to last for a very long time. Dovetails are very strong because it is made to
pull apart in only one direction so from any other direction it can handle extreme loads.
Now to make dovetails by hand you need to take your time and be patient. They aren’t as hard as you
may think but does take practice. When the joint is completely cut it should fit together with a light push
and should be very stiff. Dovetails are used in making drawer frames and the main box in cabinets. There
are two types of dovetails and they are through dovetails and half-blind dovetails. Through dovetails
are the ones where both boards go all the way through each other leaving the joint exposed. Half-blind
dovetails are usually used to attach drawer fronts to the rest of the frame. On those, only half of the joint
is visible because the other half ends short by 1/8 inch or more.
Now that you know the basics, here are a few more things you should know to make strong dovetails. If
creating dovetails out of softwood, you should have a slope of 1 to 6 on the dovetails. If making them out
of hardwood, the angle should be 1 to 8 (AM-wood.com). The reason for this is because softwood splits
easier, this way the dovetail won’t spread the wood as much when pulled on.  If you are making multiple
joints it is better to make a pattern so they are all the same. Plus it won’t take as long because you won’t
have to lay them out every time. Dovetails are made up of two parts and they are pins and tails. It doesn’t
matter which ones you choose to cut first but you should always trace its mate to get a perfect fit.
That is all twelve woodworking joints. Now lets talk about beefing them up a little. Sure there are nails,
screws, and other mechanical fasteners, but I’m talking about shop made ones. Dowels and biscuits are
excellent ways to strengthen joints unnoticeably. But wedges, pegs, and wooden blocks are good ways
and could even add some decoration. On through tenons, you can cut slots in the end of the tenon and
add some wedges as a design and a way to keep it from pulling out. On mortise and tenons you can drill a hole and insert a peg for strength and looks.
To sum it all up there is a lot of information on the twelve different wood joints. Some of them can be
quite complicated but with practice you could become an amateur woodworker. I have learned a lot
about the different joints and techniques behind them. This research helped a lot in deciding what joints
to use and how to construct them for my tech project. My tech project is designing and building a gun
cabinet. In my gun cabinet I’m going to use rebates, grooves, dados, lock miters, dovetails, mortise
and tenon and lap joints. I hope you have learned as much as I have about choosing and creating
joints in wood. There is still more to be learned but this is a very good start in becoming a professional woodworker.

TIG/GTAW Welding
Welding is a highly demanded trade across the US. There are many types of welding such as wire feed,
stick, TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas), and oxy acetylene welding. I will explain the most perfected and efficient
welding process of them all, TIG welding. I will take you through shielding gases, tungsten materials,
tungsten shapes and shaping, heat and warp age, welding flaws, and some recommendations to prevent welding flaws.
There are many purposes for shielding gases in the welding industry. In general, shielding gases are
one of the many variables throughout the TIG welding processes. There are four types of gases and
they all have their own characteristics. Shielding gases protect the molten metal and the tungsten from
the impurities in the air during welding. Shielding gases also have an effect on the temperature the arc
produces and the physical appearance of the weld bead. Flow rates in the TIG welding processes can also affect the shielding aspects of your weld.
The four types of shielding gases throughout the TIG welding processes are: argon (Ar), helium (He),
hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N). Any of those four gases can be mixed together.
Argon is a by-product of oxygen and nitrogen. Before it was produced on a huge scale, argon was a
rare gas. Since argon is denser than air, argon can shield welds in deep grooves and tight places. But
since argon is denser than air, when overhead welding is necessary, flow rates need to be increased
because the argon will fall from the weld. Argon is fairly easy to ionize so it makes it convenient for AC (Alternating Current) welding.
Helium is a by-product of natural gas. Helium increases your weld penetration. Helium is great for
welding aged aluminum and is also great for tube mills since helium allows you to weld at higher speeds.
Helium is usually mixed with argon to help the shielding aspects since helium is lighter than air. Helium is
not used with the AC since it doesn’t have the cleaning aspects that argon has.
Hydrogen is not used so much as a shielding gas as much as an additive to other shielding gases.
Hydrogen is used when weld penetration and speed is needed. Hydrogen is not used when welding
stainless steel since hydrogen is the number one cause of porosity and cracking in mild and stainless steel.
Similar to hydrogen, nitrogen is used as an additive to argon. It also can cause porosity in some ferritic
steels. Ferritic steels are defined as a group of stainless steels with a chromium content range of 12-18o.
Such steels do not respond well to heat treatment or temperament.
Nitrogen is used to increase penetration when welding copper alloys. Nitrogen is also a stabilizer when
welding alloys. When it comes to shielding gases it makes a big difference in your welds. There are many
characteristics to consider when you weld different materials.
Tungsten is a base material the electrode is made of. The electrode is the part of the welding torch that
transfers the electrical arc to the weld material. Tungsten materials are another huge variable when it
comes to TIG welding. Tungsten materials can affect your weld in similar ways as shielding gases. There
are many characteristics of each material and depending upon what you are welding you may have to
make some choices. Each tungsten is labeled by a color to make choosing easier.
There are five common types of tungstens including: pure tungsten (green), 1 % thorium (yellow) and 2
% thorium (red), 1/4to 1/2 % zirconium (brown), 2 % cerium (orange), 1 % lanthanum (black).
Pure tungsten has limited use for AC welding, and has the poorest heat resistance and electron flow,
since there is no other material mixed with pure tungsten, it doesn’t have any of there characteristics
including electron flow rates or heat resistance. Pure tungsten is mostly used for aluminum and magnesium.

Thoriated tungsten improves current flow, but to maintain an arc with thoriated tungsten requires more
voltage. Thorium increases service life of the tungsten and makes arc starting easier. Thoriated tungstens do
not work well with AC welding since it is hard to maintain a ball end shape, which is required for AC welding.
Zirconium tungstens help emit electrons more freely and can be used with AC and DC (Direct Current)
welding processes, unlike thoriated tungstens. Unlike thoriated tungstens zirconium tungstens are not
radioactive. So they have less contamination aspects than thoriated tungstens.
Cerium tungstens have many of the same characteristics as thoriated tungstens, they were actually
made to replace thoriated tungstens since they are not radioactive, which makes them safer. Lithium
tungstens are also non-radioactive like cerium. They are similar to thoriated tungstens, except they have a higher arc voltage.
Tungsten shaping and heat penetration are directly related to each other. When you change the
thickness of the materials you are welding, you need to maybe consider changing shielding gases or
tungeten types but you also need to think about the shape on the end of the tungsten especially since it changes weld penetration.
There are three basic shapes to choose from You can modify each as you learn more about all the
variables you can choose from The three basic shapes are: pointed end, rounded end, and tapered with ball end (FIGURE 1).
There are special ways to grind and shape your tungstens. When you grind your tungsten, you need to
make sure you use a grinding wheel that you have never grinded with before. If you use a used grinding
wheel, the tungsten may become contaminated, and eventually contaminate the metal you are welding.
You also need to make sure when you grind a point on your tungsten, to grind the tungsten parallel to
the grinding wheel. Grinding your tungsten parallel to the grinding wheel allows electrons to flow easier,
and prevents further contamination to the tungsten. You need to make sure when grinding a pointed
end tungsten that the length of the tapered part of the tungsten is twice as long as the diameter of
the tungsten. Tungsten shape and shaping is another large element of TIG welding that needs to be considered to make your welds most efficient.

Heat is the main reason for warpage in the welding industry. Warpage needs to be considered when
welding since the shape of the material will change after applying heat. There are different ways metals
warp depending on where the heat is applied and how much heat is applied. Many professional welders
know through experience how much a project will warp with different settings on the welder.  They
can also predict and correct warpage before it happens. Warpage can also depend on tungsten shape,
tungsten material, amperage, shielding gases, weld angles and weld distances. There are also different ways metal warps depending on the weld joint.

As shown in FIGURE 2, once the heat from the welding process is applied to the objects, the two arrows
show which way the metal is warped. The two dots represent the weld. There are many different ways
metal can warp and this shows just an idea of how the weld warps the metal.
There are many TIG welding flaws you can run into when you are not fully experienced. These flaws must
be looked at, especially when people’s lives depend on it, such as in constructing bridges and buildings.
Many common welding failures are caused by welding flaws such as porosity, inclusions, inadequate
penetration, and cracks, just to name a few. All of these problems can cause your weld to be weaker than you intended.
Porosity is caused when gases are dissolved in the weld, forming air bubbles in and on the weld. The
result of porosity is caused by improper shielding gases or pressure settings. The shielding gases are
what protect the molten metal when welding and eliminates porosity.
Inclusions are when non-metallic metals such as slag enters the molten metal. This can be caused by
multiple weld starts. It can be fixed by welding one continuous bead.

Inadequate penetration can weaken the weld severely along with inclusions and porosity. When you
don’t get the right amount of penetration you don’t allow the full amount of materials to fuse together.
The main cause of improper penetration are a misdirected arc and not enough amperage. Simply, the weld bead is too small for the job.
Cracks are another flaw that can have drastic effects. Cracks are caused during the solidifying stages of
welding. When the metals drastically drop temperature, the weld materials are vulnerable to cracking.
Slowing your weld speed is one of the main corrections to cracking. When welding it is most important
to ask questions if you need to since someone’s life could depend on it.
TIG welding processes can weld many more materials than wire feed of stick welding. TIG welding
processes are capable of welding many types of materials such as: copper, aluminum, mild and low
carbon steels, stainless steel, and magnesium. This is what makes TIG welding so different than any other
welding process. You can weld so many different materials. This is where TIG welding becomes the most
perfected welding process in the welding industry. The TIG welding process can weld the most materials of all the welding processes.
Some recommendations will help you perform better welds, these fall into categories like welding
angles, arc distance control, tungsten types, and shielding gas considerations. TIG welding can be a
lot to take in when it comes to an essay, but if you can remember different recommendations such as
these you will increase your abilities to weld with a TIG welder. The first recommendation is to consider
all your variables throughout the whole process, ask questions when needed and take your time. Speed
will eventually come as time goes on. To clear up how the TIG welding process works check out the illustration below.

Now that you know about some recommendations on how to improve your weld abilities, I will explain
how to protect yourself during welding. Safety is a huge deal when it comes to welding in general. You
need the proper protective equipment to make your job or experience as safe as it can be.  You need
to protect your eyes, skin, and lungs. You need a proper welding helmet to protect your eyes and face
from the bright arc and spatter. You will also need thick gloves and a long sleeve cotton shirt to protect
your skin from burning from the bright light. You should leave no skin uncovered or unprotected. Burns
can lead to blindness and skin cancer. You should also have pants and steel toe boots to protect against
further burns or falling objects. A respirator should be used when welding specific metals to protect your respiratory system from cancer and other damage.
Learning about TIG welding has been a very helpful experience for me since it will help me in my college
career, and in my job after school. I am going to be a certified welder. This learning experience has
helped me greatly. TIG welding is something that needs to be learned not only by textbook or paper
but also by hands on learning. And thankfully, I have gotten that experience to weld hands on. It makes learning so much easier
