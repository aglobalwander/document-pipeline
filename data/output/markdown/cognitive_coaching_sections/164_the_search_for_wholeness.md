## THE SEARCH FOR WHOLENESS

If we represent knowledge as a tree, we know that things are divided and yet connected. We know that to observe the division and ignore the connections is to destroy the tree.

-Wendell Berry

Every person's story is about moving toward wholeness. Forward-looking professional development programs know and support this. Carl Jung, one of the 20th century's most influential psychologists, describes this as the joining of opposites, which can be depicted by a snake eating its tail or the joining of poles to make a single whole. Others describe the development toward wholeness as an evolving journey of deepening complexitycognitively, morally, and in ego states (Kegan 1994).

Holonomy, the study of wholeness, was described in chapter 1. Each person strives to resolve a duality-to develop and preserve a unique, separate, and personal identity and, at the same time, to strive for affiliation and reciprocity with others.

Recognizing people as holonomous beings reveals the polarity that drives much of their emotive behavior. Self-assertion finds an outlet in personal ambition, competitiveness, and aggressive or defensive behaviors. On the other hand, the integrative potential finds fulfillment through authenticity, or internal and external congruence, in identification with family, community, or other social groups. This simultaneous drive for self-assertion and affiliation is a continuing source of tension among individuals and within groups (Koestler 1972).
