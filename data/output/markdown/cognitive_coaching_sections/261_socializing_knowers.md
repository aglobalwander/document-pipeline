## Socializing Knowers

For a person at this stage of development, a pond, once still, disturbed by a fallen leaf, might express the gratifying connections with others. 'I am my relationships' this image intends to evoke. Adults at this developmental level are sensitive to and influenced by the perspectives of others. They seek approval and want to maintain approval in their relationships with coaches and people in authority. They have a need to be accepted by colleagues. In contrast to adults operating at the previous way of knowing, these people have greater capacity for reflection, they can think in abstract terms, and can subordinate personal needs and desires to those of others. Adults at the socializing stage perceive conflict as a threat, tend to feel responsible for the feelings of others, and feel little personal agency about

their own feelings. They behave as if others have 'caused' their feeling. To support these adults, employ practices that facilitate developing and voicing their own views to help them be less dependent on the views of others. Engage them in journal writing or in one-to-one or small-group sharing before engaging with the full group. Foster increased capacity to look inward to express their own perspectives. Consciousness and efficacy are important growth states of mind. Provide noncontingent reinforcement, and keep these persons in an ongoing relationship.
