## Invitational

An approachable voice is used with invitational questions. There is a lilt and a melody in the questioner's voice rather than a flat, even tenor. Plurals are used to invite multiple rather than singular concepts (You will also observe this in video 3-4):

- What are your goals for this project?
- What ideas do you have?
- What outcomes do you seek?
- What alternatives are you considering?

Words also are selected to express tentativeness:

- What conclusions might you draw?
- What may indicate his acceptance?
- What hunches do you have to explain this situation?

Invitational stems (dependent clauses and prepositional phrases) are used to enable the behavior to be performed:

- As you think about . . .
- As you consider . . .
- As you reflect on . . .
- Given what you know about the children's developmental levels . . .

Both invitational stems and the paraphrase that precedes the question often employ positive presuppositions. Positive presuppositions assume capability and empowerment. A presupposition is something that a native speaker of a language knows is part of the meaning, even if it is not overtly present in the linguistic structure of the communication. We sometimes receive these deeper meanings unconsciously because they are not communicated by the surface structure of the words and syntax.

Subtle, and not-so-subtle, presuppositions embedded in our statements carry meanings that can either hurt or support others. For example, the statement, 'Even Bill could pass that class!' conveys the ideas that (1) Bill is not a great student, and (2) the class is not challenging. Neither of these pieces of information is present in the surface structure of the sentence. Still, the sentence communicates, 'Even Bill [who is not a great student] could pass that class [so therefore the class can't be that challenging]!' The two unstated pieces of information are inferred by the listener as presuppositions, or assumptions underlying the sentence (Elgin 1980).

By paying attention to the presuppositions we use and choosing our words with care, we more positively influence the thinking and feelings of others with whom we communicate. For example, consider the positive presuppositions in the following sentences:

- 'What are some of the benefits you will derive from this activity?' (Presuppositions: You can anticipate outcomes; you will derive benefits; your thoughts are more important than my own ideas.)
- 'As you anticipate your project, what are some indicators that you will be aware of that tell you that they are progressing and succeeding?' (Presuppositions: You are someone who plans and anticipates; you will progress and succeed; your indicators are more

- important than anything I might suggest; you are alert to cues and are self-monitoring.)
- 'Given your experience and knowledge of learning styles, what are some of your ideas about this?' (Presuppositions: You are experienced, your experience has value because you have reflected on and grown from it, you know about learning styles, you can generate ideas; your ideas have great value.) The phrase 'your experience and knowledge of learning styles' tends to pull into short-term memory content with which to process the question.
