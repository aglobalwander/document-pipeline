## A THIRD-POINT CONVERSATION

The document being used in the calibrating conversation becomes what is called a third point in the communication. The third point serves as a focus separate from each of the parties in the conversation. A conversation between two people looking at each other is called two-point conversation. In a third-point conversation, the data-in this case, the standards rubricis set in a position that both parties can look at it, rather than each other. The value of designating a third point is that both parties can refer to it in an impersonal way. The third point does not belong to either party; it is simply a reference point for the conversation. Physically referencing the third point in a space off to the side between the parties provides a psychologically safe place for information and depersonalizes ideas. Thus, placement of the conversational focus creates a triangle, either literally or referentially, keeping the conversational container psychologically safe (Lipton and Wellman 2011). As can be seen in video 13.1, establishing a visible 'third point' for the conversation increases psychological safety for the teacher by shifting the focus to the data and promotes conversations about the factors producing positive results and what may be causing any perceived performance gaps (Grinder 1997).
