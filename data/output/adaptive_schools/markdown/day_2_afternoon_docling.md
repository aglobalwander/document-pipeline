## SPONGE/ACTIVATOR - Bumper Stickers

## WHAT?

Sponge/Activator Inclusion activity

## Suggested Language:

Welcome back from lunch. To get the blood flowing back to your brain and away from your digestive system, and refocused on Adaptive Schools, we're going to use a strategy called Bumper Sticker.

## WHY?

The purpose of this strategy is to energize and to focus and to support you in synthesizing learning from the morning by identifying important points. If everything is important, then nothing is.

## HOW?

At your table, using the strip of paper we've given you, create a bumper sticker you would like to see on the bumper of every car in your school's parking lot. When finished post it on the wall.

## Optional:

Have groups create their bumper sticker and share out without using chart paper.

What: text as expert, use of written word

<!-- image -->

Why: when construct own understanding -&gt;understand at deeper level, retain ponder collectively to construct understanding Inquiry is central to professional communities that produce stable gains in student learning

What: disposition to be developed within school (was originally one of the 7 norms)

How: Say something-supports collaboratively constructing meaning from written text

## clarifications?

OPTIONAL:

Say Something

## TRAINER NOTE:

Presenter may invite participants to read pages in the LG at a later time.

## WORKING AGREEMENTS

LG, p. 44

Suggested Language:

## WHAT?

Adaptive Schools distinguish between 'Norms,' which are the general best practices of all productive groups and 'Working Agreements,' which are the ad hoc agreements that each group creates depending on their needs. For example, 'Come on time,' 'Silence cell phones,' and 'Demonstrate mutual respect,' are Working Agreements.

Setting working agreements with participant groups may be contextually driven. That is, they are congruent with the group's purposes and development. Agreements are also a way of applying the Norm of Paying Attention to Self and Others.

## WHY?

Creating and posting Working Agreements honors participant needs and styles, and provides a social lubricant for productive work. They also provide psychological safety for talking about difficult topics.

## HOW?

Tee Up using cartoon such as 'I've got him on vibrate!'

<!-- image -->

'group courtesies' and are idiosyncratic / specific to group

Norms instead are ongoing, best practice of high performing groups the more friendly the group, the greater the need hard to refocus friends just

if someone tries, then 'who died and made her queen? what's up with her? trying to have fun here!'

ex: 'Given this agenda, what might be our working agreements to get work done in any skillful group member can set / test working agreements safe way?'

Ex: I'm requesting that we make an agreement to start and end on time. 2x started 10 min late / finished 15 min later than planned.

Dialogue, discuss…then decide on working agreement of starting on time Test 2 weeks later: I'd like to talk about decision we made 2 weeks ago about starting on time. Not happening. What do we need to do to keep our agreement?

working agreements as 3rd point in meetings

work safe -&gt; deepen level of talk -environment safe -&gt; not always comfortable if safe- then can say 'I don't know how to teach inference.'

## norms = skills

## clear examples:

- •Start on time / end on time
- •Silence electronics

## fuzzy examples:

•Come prepared

- •Fulfill expectations

add clarity to working agreement using 'by' and adding behavioral examples

Other examples:

- •Bring materials
- •Balance talk time
- •100% commitment/focus
- •Rank has no privilege
- •Finger-pointing and blame have no place
- •Use creativity over capital; mind over money
- •Think externally (avoid divisional/functional/silo'd thinking/us-them thinking)
- •No silent objectors. Do not leave in silent disagreement.
- •Respectful disagreement is encouraged.
- •Confidentiality-If it's said in the room, it stays in the room
- •Both/and not either/or
- •Adopt 'yes if' mindset. Eliminate 'can't' and 'no, because…'
- •Eliminate 'we've always done it this way.'
- •Ask why, why not, what if
- •Be bold

## What: SEVEN NORMS

skill set and behaviors

Why: be habituated in groups -&gt; builds conversational capacity norms = skills

as groups become more skillful, less need for working agreements

## •toolkit for both dialogue / discussion

•assists groups to become skillful in both ways of talking

Norms of Collaboration LG, p. 46 Display banner WHAT? 7 Norms of Collaboration

## WHY?

Suggested language:

Norms of are the 'glue' that hold together the Two Ways of Talking. They provide a toolkit for promoting a spirit of inquiry in dialogue and discussion and assist groups in becoming skillful in both ways of talking.

When used consistently and appropriately, they reduce affective conflict. The norms provide a structure for assessing individual and group development.

## HOW?

Show the Norms on the Ways of Talking graphic from Day 1 in LG and on the banner, and share the WHY.

<!-- image -->

What: Norms of collaboration live within the system in 2 Ways of Talking

•toolkit - dialogue / discussion

•assist groups -&gt; skillful in both ways of talking

•reduce affective conflict

•structure for assessing individual and group development

## Comes from 'normal'

behaviors people know how to do explicitly named, taught, practiced, assessed-&gt;become normative -expected and part of the way groups work on a normal basis

Premier tool kit-high level communicator at home and work. WHAT?

Introduction to the Norms of Collaboration

## WHY?

Suggested language:

Norms comes from the word 'normal.' These are behaviors most people know how to do, but they are not habits of behavior in groups. As they are explicitly named and practiced they become normative. That is, they are expected and part of the way groups work on a normal basis.

Norms are important because we want to promote a spirit of inquiry. Therefore, I want to pause, I want to paraphrase, I want to inquire .

HOW?

Differentiate between Norms and Working Agreements.

## Suggested language:

While Working Agreements vary from group to group, based upon the needs of group members; Norms of Collaboration are 'best practice' across high performing groups. The Norms have their origin in the work of:

Peter Senge and colleagues at Harvard, in their 5 th Discipline Fieldbook work;

Art Costa, and colleagues Bill Baker and Stan Shallit, in their early work with Habits of Mind;

Bob Garmston and Bruce Wellman, as well as Adaptive Schools trainers' work with collaborative groups around the world.

What: self-assessment of the Norms

Norms Inventory: Seven Norms of Collaboration LG, pp. 47-48 WHAT?

The inventory is a self-assessment of the Norms.

## WHY?

Inventory elucidates the details of the Norms Inventory develops consciousness about one's own behaviors

## HOW?

Suggested Language:

To have a point of reference for you, think of your own behavior in a specific group with which you work. Using the inventory, rate your own behaviors when you are with that group.

Read the directions on the slide describing Glow and Grow.

not suggesting starting with all Norms

## WHAT?

Pausing - hallmark of group's reflective listening / responding

WHY?

supports brain -&gt; organizes thoughts / connects prior experience, knowledge, feelings honors people -&gt; reflective style

WHAT?

A norm that is a hallmark of a group's reflective listening and responding.

## WHY?

Pausing supports the brain as it organizes thoughts and connects them to prior experience, knowledge and feelings. It honors people who have a reflective style.

<!-- image -->

## WHAT? study pausing

WHY? deepened thinking when given wait time / pausing

similar to wait time in instructional process pausing to construct response -&gt; respect for what said / enables us to listen fully while other is talking

'think' time-uninterrupted-the gift of pausing. -&gt; 'grow' complex thought system requires shared experience / conversation (ideas multiply, become refined, produce questions) equate quick responses = intelligence!! not so

Mary Budd Rowe: average wait-time after asking question before teacher cues, redirects, or tells answer / restates question -&gt; .5 seconds. Respond w/next question in less than second wait time is time to think, gift of pausing

all classrooms- SPED, gifted / talented results when waited 3-5 seconds after asking question:

•students who ordinarily did not answer, did so (less 'I don't know')

•was improvement in language / logic

•answers were full sentences, not single words / phrases (length of responses increased 300-700%)

•answers were at higher levels of thinking

•students started responding to each other and commenting on each other's answers (students don't always do when competing for teacher attention).

- •Required less 'show and tell' from teacher

•more inferences were supported by evidence and logical argument

- •speculative thinking increased

•questions from students increased (less procedural 'how do we...?')

- •discipline moves decreased
- •student confidence went up
- •scores of academic achievement tests went up
- •teachers own questioning strategies became varied / flexible (fewer quantity/greater quality)
- •teacher expectations for performance improved

Article written by Mary Budd Rowe: http://www.sagepub.com/eis2study/articles/Budd%20Rowe.pdf wait-time I: After asking a question-gives time to form response

ESL-10-20 seconds (students labeled 'nonverbal' responded spontaneously 2x as much- in 1st hour!! invisible kids became visible.)

similar finding when wait-time II and III used.

wait-time II- after the student/adult answers answer often extended-strong correlation -&gt; higher level thinking If wait -&gt; may elaborate

Stahl-2nd wait time most powerful

wait-time III: before the facilitator/teacher responds gives facilitator/teacher wait-time / signals what doing is important facilitator / teacher also needs to think

HOW?

Connect pausing to the wait time research of Mary Budd Rowe. Explain the 4 types, using 10-2 and referencing

## 'positive pause'

idea on table -&gt; all pause 15 seconds think how idea might work designate 'pauser' -&gt; signal group to pause at designated intervals or setting timer

frozen gesture - meeting no pausing 'Please hold on.  talking - 3 important ideas.' 3 fingers / paraphrasing 3 big ideas 'So what do we want to focus on right now?'

countdown - 'When I ask question -&gt; hold response for 5 seconds.' holds up fist, raising 1 finger at time, until 5 seconds up

Share strategies groups can use to pause.

## Suggested Language:

A superintendent in California uses the 'positive pause.'  Whenever anyone puts an idea on the table, he asks that everyone pauses for 15 seconds to think about how the idea might work.

Another strategy is to designate a 'pauser' who will signal the group to pause at designated intervals. This can also be done by setting a timer.

A third strategy is to use frozen gesture. This strategy can be used by one person in the group to get the whole group to pause. Let's imagine that you are at a meeting and no one is pausing, resulting in a fast-paced conversation. Looking around, you can tell that some people are not following the conversation. So you hold up your hand and say, 'Please hold on. We're talking about 3 important ideas.' You hold up 3 fingers on your hand and talk very slowly, paraphrasing the 3 big ideas. Then you say something like, 'So what do we want to focus on right now?'

Optional: To honor the triple track agenda and give a classroom example, share the strategy of 'Classroom Countdown,' whereby the teacher says to students, 'When I ask a question, hold your response for five seconds.' To support kids the teacher holds up a fist, raising one finger at a time, until the 5 seconds is up.

<!-- image -->

Covey-pause is 'arena of consciousness' wherein deep thinking can occur.

John Maxwell-minute of thought is greater than an hour of talk

<!-- image -->

I need thinking time when someone asks me a searching question.

I wonder why it seems to be so uncomfortable for many people to wait through the silence.

People of all ages have deep feelings, and if we have the patience to wait through the silence, it's often astounding what people will tell us.

## Suggested Language:

For this next piece, you're going to have an opportunity to connect with one of your fractal partners. Please pack up your things, find your fern partner and sit with him/her.

Then predict which of the 7 Norms is the Neglected One.

Why: primary and potent tool.

Requires deep levels of listening-&gt;want people listening to one another.

## WHAT?

Paraphrasing -3 intentions listening, care, understand (trying to)

People believe they know how to paraphrase and many do, yet often at a fairly pedestrian level of sophistication.

taught as language tool, not listening tool

Because the paraphrase is the single most influential and generic communication tool, it is helpful to give ourselves permission to learn more about it, and find ways to help others value it.

Pace for negative impressions.

Capture essence

Shorter than original

YOU, not I

## WHAT?

Trainer Input on the three types of paraphrase, using slide and referencing the diagram at the bottom of the LG page.

## Suggested Language:

Perhaps the most familiar form of paraphrasing has the intention of acknowledging what has been said. This paraphrase reflects the essence of the speaker's words.

<!-- image -->

## Suggested Language:

The first type of paraphrase may be most familiar. It is an Acknowledging Paraphrase.

Use prompt on screen. Allow time for pairs processing, then whole group share.

Add, if necessary:

- •Pronoun 'you' rather than I
- •Focused on thinking or feeling
- •No long preamble
- ·Reflect essence of speaker's message: The slide uses a mirror to indicate that this is reflective listening

<!-- image -->

## Suggested Language:

One intention might be to let the speaker know we are listening, we care, and that we are trying to understand. We may intend to establish rapport.

Give directions using slide.

<!-- image -->

organizing --&gt; indispensable for facilitators / group members responses into containers --&gt; theme(s) to speakers' thoughts.

## Suggested Language:

A second type of paraphrase is called an Organizing Paraphrase.

With quartet, what are some of the things you are noticing about these examples?

<!-- image -->

Allow time for quartets processing, then have whole group share. Add, if necessary: Sorting multiple issues/topics

Offering containers for ideas

Often using physical gestures such as counting on fingers or holding out hands

The image of the suitcases suggests that lots of items are being placed in containers so we can carry them.

<!-- image -->

## Suggested Language:

A different intention might be to help the speaker clarify thinking. For a person or group that is overwhelmed, the intention might be to break a large task into smaller increments.

Give directions using slide.

<!-- image -->

abstracting -&gt; thinking to abstract (or sometimes concrete) level exploring what behind speaker's words - goal, belief, value that informs thinking / feeling Suggested Language:

The third form of paraphrase is Abstracting, which takes the speaker's thinking to either a more abstract or concrete level. It has the intention of exploring what is behind the speaker's words, the goal, belief, or value that informs their thinking and feeling.

<!-- image -->

ladder image -&gt; classic work in semantics by S.I. Hayakawa, Language in Thought and Action.

using ladder of abstraction can respond on the same rung of the ladder-same level of thinkingacknowledging and organizing paraphrases.

can invite speaker to climb the ladder and elevate level of thinking -&gt; abstracting paraphrase.

From concrete details given, can abstract to bigger picture.

<!-- image -->

## same rung -- synonym.

'My car has broken down, and I don't know how I am going to get to work.' A response on the same rung of the ladder might be: 'So, you're having a problem with your automobile.' While this may reflect what was said, it may not do much beyond that.

'So, there is an issue with transportation.'

while the first paraphrase leaves us stuck with a broken car/auto, the abstracting example opens our thinking to alternatives such as public transportation, jogging, bicycling, carpooling, etc.

While we may not use it as much, it is also possible to move down the ladder of abstraction to greater concreteness and detail: 'So, you want to get to the Ford dealership.'

<!-- image -->

## Suggested Language:

A different intention might be to help the speaker shift or re-frame thinking.
