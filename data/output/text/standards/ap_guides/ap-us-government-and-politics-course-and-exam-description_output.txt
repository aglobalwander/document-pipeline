AP Equity and Access Policy
College Board strongly encourages educators to make equitable access a guiding
principle for their AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared
students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination
of barriers that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and
socioeconomic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented. Schools
should make every effort to ensure their AP classes reflect the diversity of their
student population. College Board also believes that all students should have
access to academically challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes,
which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to
equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.

About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking
AP courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and
AP Exams are developed and scored by college faculty
and experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges
and universities in the United States grant credit,
advanced placement, or both on the basis of successful
AP Exam scores; more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the content
and skills that are the focus of the corresponding
college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also
organizes the content and skills into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many AP teachers have
told us they follow in order to focus their instruction.
The intention of this publication is to respect teachers’
time and expertise by providing a roadmap that they
can modify and adapt to their local priorities and
preferences. Moreover, by organizing the AP course
content and skills into units, the AP Program is able to provide teachers and students with formative assessments—Personal Progress Checks—that
teachers can assign throughout the year to measure
student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students:
Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically
challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to equitable preparation and
access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses:
The AP Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP
courses must participate in the AP Course Audit, a
process through which AP teachers’ course materials
are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.
﻿ V.1 | 1

=== Page 9 ===
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the
AP teacher and the school principal (or designated
administrator) to confirm awareness and understanding
of the curricular and resource requirements. A syllabus
or course outline, detailing how course requirements
are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The
AP Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor;
all AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision,
piloting, and analysis to ensure that questions are
accurate, fair, and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development,
College Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher
education institutions. This feedback is carefully
considered to ensure that AP courses and exams are
able to provide students with a college-level learning
experience and the opportunity to demonstrate their
qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam
development process, relies on the expertise of both
AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice
questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course performance
assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands
of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are
scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion
is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained,
and their work is monitored throughout the Reading
for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief
Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers
in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of
the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a curve.
Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which means that
every student who meets the criteria for an AP score of
2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no matter how many
students that is. The criteria for the number of points
students must earn on the AP Exam to receive scores
of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently
validates for credit and placement purposes—include:
§Bullet The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
§Bullet The number of points researchers have found to be predictive that an AP student will succeed when placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
§Bullet Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP scores as follows:
AP Score
Credit
Recommendation
College Grade
Equivalent 5
Extremely well qualified
A 4

B-, C+, C 2

While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and
universities. To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/ placement policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/creditpolicies
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score the free-response sections of the AP Exams.
Ninety-eight percent of surveyed educators who took
part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an
AP Reader, including opportunities to:§
Bullet educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college §
Bullet Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure
to the quality and depth of the responses from the
entire pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.§
Bullet Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel. §
Bullet Score from home: AP Readers have online
distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects.
Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details. §
Bullet Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs):
AP Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide suggests a
sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds skill instruction across units, organizes content
into topics, and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course topics and skills, create
customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.
*To report misuses, please call, 877-274-6474 (International: +1-212-632-1781).

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
§Bullet Teachers and students sign in to or create their College Board accounts.
§Bullet Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
§Bullet Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
§Bullet Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP Coordinator.
§Bullet Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and
AP Coordinators to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following
additional benefits:
§Bullet Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
§Bullet Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
§Bullet Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student pack.
The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
§Bullet Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

About the AP U.S.
Government and Politics Course
AP U.S. Government and Politics provides a college-level, nonpartisan introduction to
key political concepts, ideas, institutions, policies, interactions, roles, and behaviors that
characterize the constitutional system and political culture of the United States. Students will
study U.S. foundational documents, Supreme Court decisions, and other texts and visuals
to gain an understanding of the relationships and interactions among political institutions,
processes, and behaviors. They will also engage in disciplinary practices that require them to
read and interpret data, make comparisons and applications, and develop evidence-based
arguments. In addition, they will complete a political science research or applied civics project.
College Course Equivalent
AP U.S. Government and Politics is equivalent to a one-semester introductory college course in U.S. government.
Prerequisites
There are no prerequisite courses for AP U.S. Government and Politics. Students should be
able to read a college-level textbook and write grammatically correct, complete sentences.
Project Requirement
The required project adds a civic component to the course, engaging students in exploring
how they can affect, and are affected by, government and politics throughout their lives.
The project might have students collect data on a teacher-approved political science topic,
participate in a community service activity, or observe and report on the policymaking
process of a governing body. Students should plan a presentation that relates their
experiences or findings to what they are learning in the course.

Preface
We offer this course framework for AP U.S. Government and Politics to the
American public and education community. Dedicated teams of college
professors and AP high school teachers have worked on this framework for
years, gathering wide-ranging input and feedback from the public at large.
The committee members and College Board staff
worked with a special intensity and care. We realize that this course is more than just one more class
period in a crowded school day; it must be a space in
which students immerse themselves in the ideas and knowledge essential to our democracy.
AP U.S. Government and Politics offers students the
opportunity to see how individuals and their ideas
can shape the world in which they live; it invites them
to explore central questions of liberty and justice in practice. The Supreme Court opinions explored in this course are not museum pieces but deeply felt expressions. They all represent real choices and decisions with enormous consequences. We aim for students to read them and discuss them with openness and insight.
The ideas at the heart of the American founding remain as vital and urgent as they were more than
200 years ago; it is our task as educators to make
them vivid once more. As we reflect on this course, five principles become clear:
1.	 Command of the Constitution lies at the center of this course, the touchstone for informed citizenship and scholarship.
2.	 Students are not spectators but analysts; they must analyze the documents and debates that
formed our republic and animate public life today.
3.	 Knowledge matters; we define a focused body of shared knowledge while leaving room for the
variety of state standards and the imaginations of individual teachers.
4.	 We can’t avoid difficult topics, but we can insist on a principled attention to the best arguments on both sides as students read and write.
5.	 Civic knowledge is every student’s right and responsibility; we therefore have the obligation to make the best learning resources, such as the National Constitution Center’s Interactive
Constitution, freely available for all.
The aims of this course framework are timeless, and its
roots are deeply embedded in the American experiment
and the intellectual traditions that animated our founding.
Aristotle famously described humankind as a “political
animal.” He argued that a person who lives without a
political life is incomplete and alone, like an isolated
piece on a game board. For Aristotle, participation in
civic life is necessary to live fully. In more modern times,
President Eisenhower declared that “politics ought
to be the part-time profession of every person who
would protect the rights and privileges of free people
and who would preserve what is good and fruitful in our national heritage.”
We are grateful to the AP community of teachers
and their colleagues in colleges across our country, whose shared devotion to students forged this
course framework. A framework is only an outline of
content and skills; the real craft is in the decisions that knowledgeable teachers make every day in the
classroom as they develop their curriculum. We are
confident that in the hands of AP teachers, this course
framework will open doors of opportunity for students throughout their lives.
—From David Coleman, CEO,
College Board

Introduction
The AP U.S. Government and Politics course detailed in this framework
reflects what political science teachers, professors, and researchers agree
that a college-level government and politics course should teach students to
do: analyze and interpret the Constitution, important political documents,
and data to better understand the American national government and the political actors who interact with it.
The AP U.S. Government and Politics Course and Exam Description defines what representative
colleges and universities typically expect students to
know and be able to do in order to earn college credit
or placement. Students practice the skills used by
political scientists by studying data, political writings
from the founding era to the present, the structure
of the government as established by the Constitution, and constitutional interpretations handed down by the Supreme Court. Students will show mastery of
these skills on the exam through a variety of means,
including concept application, data analysis, Supreme
Court case comparisons, and writing political science arguments.
Although the course framework is designed to provide
a clear and detailed description of the course content
and skills, it is not a curriculum. Teachers create their
own curricula to meet the needs of their students and any state or local requirements.
The National Constitution Center and College Board
In partnership with the National Constitution Center,
College Board has developed a series of classroom
lessons and materials related to the U.S. Constitution.
This series includes resources to support instruction
in AP U.S. Government and Politics, AP Comparative
Government and Politics, AP U.S. History, and
AP English Language and Composition. These lessons
and resources are available to AP teachers via the
course homepages at AP Central and to all teachers
through the National Constitution Center’s website.
Maintaining Political Balance
AP U.S. Government and Politics is a nonpartisan course and has been endorsed by the National
Constitution Center as well as a range of conservative
and liberal scholars for its political balance. The
required readings are the Declaration of Independence,
the U.S. Constitution, the Articles of Confederation,
representative Federalist Papers, Brutus No. 1, and
Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Letter from a Birmingham Jail.”
In addition, there are 14 required Supreme Court cases.
Additional readings and assignments that teachers select to supplement the course must, as a whole,
maintain a political balance. It is expected and required
that all AP-authorized courses maintain political balance through a nonpartisan curriculum.

Course Framework
Components
Overview
This course framework provides a description of the what students should know
and be able to do to qualify for college credit or placement.
The course framework includes two essential components:
1   
The disciplinary practices and reasoning processes for this course are
central to the study and practice of government and politics. Students
should develop and apply the described practices on a regular basis over the span of the course.
2   COURSE CONTENT
The course content is organized into commonly taught units of study that
provide a suggested sequence for the course. These units comprise the
content and conceptual understandings that colleges and universities
typically expect students to master to qualify for college credit and/or
placement. This content is grounded in big ideas, which are cross-cutting
concepts that build conceptual understanding and spiral throughout the course.

Reasoning Processes
Reasoning processes describe the cognitive operations that students will be required to apply when engaging with practices
on the AP Exam. Students should organize their response around a specific reasoning process that aligns to the intent of the
question. The reasoning processes ultimately represent the way practitioners think in the discipline. Specific aspects of the
cognitive process are defined under each reasoning process.

Course
Content
Based on the Understanding by Design® (Wiggins and McTighe) model, this course
framework provides a description of the course requirements necessary for
student success. The framework specifies what students should know and be able
to do, with a focus on big ideas that encompass core principles and theories of the
discipline. The framework also encourages instruction that prepares students for
advanced political science coursework and active, informed participation in our constitutional democracy.
Big Ideas
The big ideas serve as the foundation of the course and enable students to create
meaningful connections among concepts. They are themes that become threads
that run throughout the course. Revisiting the big ideas and applying them in a
variety of contexts allow students to develop a deeper conceptual understanding.
Below are the big ideas of the course and a brief description of each.
2
BIG IDEA 1: CONSTITUTIONALISM (CON)
The U.S. Constitution establishes a system of checks and balances among
branches of government and allocates power between federal and state
governments. This system is based on the rule of law and the balance between majority rule and minority rights.
BIG IDEA 2: LIBERTY AND ORDER (LOR)
Governmental laws and policies balancing order and liberty are based on the
U.S. Constitution and have been interpreted differently over time.
BIG IDEA 3: CIVIC PARTICIPATION IN A REPRESENTATIVE
DEMOCRACY (PRD)
Popular sovereignty, individualism, and republicanism are important
considerations of U.S. laws and policy making and assume citizens will engage and participate.

BIG IDEA 4: COMPETING POLICY-MAKING INTERESTS (PMI)
Multiple actors and institutions interact to produce and implement possible policies.
BIG IDEA 5: METHODS OF POLITICAL ANALYSIS (MPA)
Using various types of analyses, political scientists measure how U.S. political
behavior, attitudes, ideologies, and institutions are shaped by a number of factors over time.
UNITS
The course content is organized into commonly
taught units. The units have been arranged in a logical sequence frequently found in many college courses and textbooks.
The five units in AP U.S. Government and Politics and
their weighting on the multiple-choice section of the
AP Exam are listed below.
Pacing recommendations at the unit level and on the
Course at a Glance provide suggestions for how to teach the required course content and administer the Personal Progress Checks. The suggested class
periods are based on a schedule in which the class
meets five days a week for 45 minutes each day. While these recommendations have been made to aid
planning, teachers should of course adjust the pacing based on the needs of their students, alternate
schedules (e.g., block scheduling), or their school’s academic calendar.
TOPICS
Each unit is broken down into teachable segments
called topics. The topic pages (starting on page 40)
contain the required content for each topic. Although
most topics can be taught in one or two class periods,
teachers are again encouraged to pace the course to suit the needs of their students and school.

Guides
Introduction
Designed with extensive input from the community of AP U.S. Government
and Politics educators, the unit guides offer all teachers helpful guidance
in building students’ skills and knowledge. The suggested sequence was
identified through a thorough analysis of the syllabi of highly effective
AP teachers and the organization of typical college textbooks.
This unit structure respects new AP teachers’ time by providing one
possible sequence they can adopt or modify rather than having to build
from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units enable the AP Program
to provide interested teachers with formative assessments—the Personal
Progress Checks—that they can assign their students at the end of
each unit to gauge progress toward success on the AP Exam. However,
experienced AP teachers who are satisfied with their current course
organization and exam results should feel no pressure to adopt these units,
which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

Foundations of American Democracy
Developing Understanding
More than 200 years after the U.S. Constitution was ratified, the compromises that were
necessary for ratification—which in some instances led to ambiguity—continue to fuel debate
and discussion over how best to protect liberty, equality, order, and private property. This
first unit sets the foundation for the course by examining how the framers of the Constitution
set up a structure of government intended to stand the test of time. Compromises were
made during the Constitutional Convention and ratification debates, and these compromises
focused on the proper balance between individual freedom, social order, and equality of
opportunity. In subsequent units, students will apply their understanding of the Constitution
to the institutions of government and people’s daily lives.
UNIT 1
Building the
Disciplinary Practices
4.A  4.B  5.A  5.B
In the study of government and political science, text-based qualitative sources help political scientists understand how governmental and political institutions and actors function and the reasons for their behaviors. These sources are often actually arguments about what the government does (or should do) and how these actions impact citizens and other people in the country.
In this course, students also learn to write their own arguments. Arguments should be organized around a specific reasoning process that aligns to the purpose for writing (e.g., to explain similarities and differences among political principles, or to explain political processes). Choosing the right reasoning process allows students to establish the line of reasoning for the argument and helps them organize the essay.
In their arguments, students should write claims that take a position, going beyond simply stating facts. Claims should also include additional information that sets up the evidence. This is usually developed through a “because” statement, as in “My claim is the strongest because . . .”, which is then followed by specific relevant evidence.
Evidence is relevant when it relates to and supports the claim.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The AP U.S. Government and Politics course requires students to apply their knowledge in a variety of contexts and to real-world scenarios. It’s not enough for students to know the definition of governmental terms and concepts. On the AP Exam, they will be asked to show a deeper understanding of how these concepts actually work, often by describing and explaining an interaction or application within a given scenario on both multiple-choice and free-response questions.
Students often struggle with explanations.
They may define or describe a concept but not fully explain the how or why in the context of the question. Have students practice by asking them to explain the steps, stages, and interactions of processes; explain and link causes and effects; or explain the significance of similarities and differences.

Required
Supreme Court Cases
Supreme Court cases are necessary for students to understand significant
legal precedents may serve as the focus of AP Exam questions. The following
list represents required Supreme Court cases and their holdings as related to
the enduring understandings in the content outline.
AP U.S. Government and Politics students should
be familiar with the structure and functions on the U.S.
Supreme Court, as well as how the court renders its decisions. This includes knowing how holdings are
decided and that justices who are in the minority often
write dissents that express their opinions on the case
and the constitutional questions. While students will not
need to know any dissenting (or concurring) opinions
from the required cases, it is important for students to
understand the role of dissenting opinions, especially as they relate to future cases on similar issues.
The required Supreme Court cases are widely considered essential content in college courses.
Some of the cases may be seen as controversial and
some were decided by thin majorities (5 to 4 decisions).
Students are not expected or required to either
agree or disagree with the Court’s decision. Teachers should encourage students to be familiar with the
legal arguments on both sides of leading constitutional cases and thoughtfully analyze the majority and dissenting opinions.

Foundations of American Democracy
Developing Understanding
More than 200 years after the U.S. Constitution was ratified, the compromises that were
necessary for ratification—which in some instances led to ambiguity—continue to fuel debate
and discussion over how best to protect liberty, equality, order, and private property. This
first unit sets the foundation for the course by examining how the framers of the Constitution
set up a structure of government intended to stand the test of time. Compromises were
made during the Constitutional Convention and ratification debates, and these compromises
focused on the proper balance between individual freedom, social order, and equality of
opportunity. In subsequent units, students will apply their understanding of the Constitution
to the institutions of government and people’s daily lives.
UNIT 1
Building the
Disciplinary Practices
4.A  4.B  5.A  5.B
In the study of government and political science, text-based qualitative sources help political scientists understand how governmental and political institutions and actors function and the reasons for their behaviors. These sources are often actually arguments about what the government does (or should do) and how these actions impact citizens and other people in the country.
In this course, students also learn to write their own arguments. Arguments should be organized around a specific reasoning process that aligns to the purpose for writing (e.g., to explain similarities and differences among political principles, or to explain political processes). Choosing the right reasoning process allows students to establish the line of reasoning for the argument and helps them organize the essay.
In their arguments, students should write claims that take a position, going beyond simply stating facts. Claims should also include additional information that sets up the evidence. This is usually developed through a “because” statement, as in “My claim is the strongest because . . .”, which is then followed by specific relevant evidence.
Evidence is relevant when it relates to and supports the claim.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The AP U.S. Government and Politics course requires students to apply their knowledge in a variety of contexts and to real-world scenarios. It’s not enough for students to know the definition of governmental terms and concepts. On the AP Exam, they will be asked to show a deeper understanding of how these concepts actually work, often by describing and explaining an interaction or application within a given scenario on both multiple-choice and free-response questions.
Students often struggle with explanations.
They may define or describe a concept but not fully explain the how or why in the context of the question. Have students practice by asking them to explain the steps, stages, and interactions of processes; explain and link causes and effects; or explain the significance of similarities and differences.

Interactions
Among Branches of Government
Developing Understanding
BIG IDEA 1
Constitutionalism CON
Bullet Which branch of government is the most powerful? Why?
Bullet Are there really checks and balances when one political party controls all three branches of government? Why or why not?
BIG IDEA 4
Competing Policy-
Making Interests PMI
Bullet In what ways has the evolution of government powers affected
Americans and their daily lives?
In this unit, students continue to explore policy making, focusing on its complexity and the
idea that it is a process involving multiple governmental institutions and actors. Students will
look at issues or policies from several different perspectives and then apply their knowledge
to better understand the complexity of the policy-making process.
The Constitution grants specific powers to Congress, the presidency, and the courts,
each of which exercises informal powers (developed through political practice, tradition,
and legislation). Because power is widely distributed, and checks prevent one branch from
overreaching or usurping powers from the others, institutional actors are in the position where
they must both compete and cooperate in order to govern.
Building the
Disciplinary Practices
2.A
2.B 3.A 3.B
The gerrymandering cases in this unit provide an opportunity to introduce students to Supreme Court case analysis. It can help to start by having students describe the facts of the cases, focusing on the reasoning behind the majority opinion. Students often get stuck on the details of a case, or what they think is fair. Guide them to focus on the constitutional issues the justices applied when deciding the case. This focus will help students connect the details from a required case to other sources.
This unit also introduces students to data analysis. Provide opportunities for students to practice identifying data from different types of graphs. At this point in the course, you can have them practice identifying data, patterns, and trends in the data, and drawing conclusions. Students will need direction in order to know how to draw conclusions and apply information from data.
Help them practice these skills by linking data to political behaviors using the different branches of government or budgets of bureaucratic agencies.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Exam, students will need to make connections between political concepts, Supreme Court cases, and arguments in text-based sources. One way that political scientists often think about those connections is to make comparisons between concepts, and students will need to make comparisons and draw conclusions on both the multiple-choice questions and the free-response questions.
When making comparisons, it’s important for students to begin by identifying the relevant categories of comparison (i.e., what characteristic or attribute they should compare). Two common mistakes that students make are discussing similarities and differences that are 1) not relevant based on the given task or 2) not shared by the objects of comparison. Once students have identified an appropriate and relevant category of comparison, they can then develop their explanation of why the similarities or differences exist and why they are significant.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples
below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways
that they approach teaching the content and skills in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional
Approaches section beginning on p. 139 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 2.2
Graphic Organizer
Have students complete Venn diagrams comparing the structure, functions, and powers
of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Make sure students use the graphic
organizer thoughtfully and are not simply “filling in the blanks.” 2.5
Quickwrite
As preparation for a free-response question (FRQ) in which students explain political
principles, institutions, processes, policies, and behaviors in different contexts
(such as in FRQ 1), have them quickwrite ways the president’s agenda can affect congressional behavior.
3 2.11
Socratic Seminar
Use one of the essential questions, such as Which branch of government is the most
powerful? Why?, to initiate a discussion in which students can illustrate their understanding
of the learning objectives and essential knowledge statements.
4 2.15
Match Claims and Evidence
In early stages of practicing argumentation, ask small groups of students to write claims
and supporting evidence statements based on a question that resembles the argument
essay prompt (such as one about whether the President or Congress has more power
over the bureaucracy). Have groups trade claims and evidence, revise or modify the claims
(if necessary), match the claims and evidence, and write statements explaining why the evidence supports the claim.
Unit Planning Notes
Use the space below to plan your approach to the unit. Consider how you can introduce each branch of
government and use the disciplinary practices to help students understand how they interact.

Civil Liberties and Civil Rights
Developing Understanding
Students will connect the founding principles of our government to the debates over the
appropriate balance of liberty and order, noting how citizens and other groups have pursued
policy solutions to protect the civil liberties and civil rights of all Americans, laying the
foundation for later discussions about other ways citizens can participate in the government.
The U.S. Constitution, primarily through the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment,
protects the civil liberties and civil rights of citizens, though the extent of those protections
and the need to protect the safety and general welfare of individuals has long been debated.
Through social movements, legal challenges, and acts of Congress, citizens have attempted
to restrict the government from unduly infringing on individual rights and from denying equal protection under the law.
Building the
Disciplinary Practices
Preparing for the AP Exam
2.C 5.A 5.B
The SCOTUS comparison free-response question on the AP Exam asks students to go beyond simply identifying the similarities and differences between cases. They apply information from a required case and explain how that information is relevant to a non required case. Then, students demonstrate the ability to transfer understanding of political concepts, behaviors, or processes from a required Supreme Court case to a non-required one.
This unit focuses on the analysis and application of SCOTUS cases. In addition to knowing the facts and decision of the required SCOTUS cases, students should analyze the majority opinion, focusing on the constitutional issues (such as the various interpretations of the Bill of Rights, including the due process clause) considered by the justices. This level of knowledge allows students to think like political scientists and compare two cases that relate to the same constitutional issue and draw conclusions about why the Supreme Court may have ruled in a similar or different way in each case.
Students continue to develop the practice of argumentation in this unit by using relevant evidence to support their claim. When using documents as evidence, students should not focus on summarizing the content of a document, but instead on explaining the significance of the evidence and explaining how and why it supports the claim and line of reasoning.
Students should be able to use the required
Supreme Court cases in other ways, such as applying knowledge about a required case to a reading, a scenario, and possibly a political cartoon. Students often struggle with analyzing political cartoons. They should practice interpreting visual clues and then using these clues to determine the argument
and relate it to political principles, institutions, processes, or behaviors.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples
below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways
that they approach teaching the content and skills in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional
Approaches section beginning on p. 139 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 3.2
Graphic Organizer
To practice comparing required Supreme Court cases to a related case, give students a
pair of cases—for example, Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972) and Oregon v. Smith (1990)—and
have them use a Venn diagram to come up with similarities and differences between the
cases. Guide students to use valid categories for comparison, such as facts, majority
opinion, and the reasoning (constitutional question) for the majority opinion.
2 3.3
Think-Pair-Share
To practice comparing required Supreme Court cases to a related case, give students a
pair of cases—for example, Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District
(1969) and Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser and have them use Think-Pair-Share to
come up with similarities, differences, and relevance to political institutions or processes.
3.10
Fishbowl
Ask students to discuss the arguments presented in “Letter from a Birmingham Jail.”
Have some students form an inner circle to discuss how the arguments relate to political
activism and how citizens can affect our government and its policies. The remaining
students will form an outer circle to listen, respond, and evaluate.
4 3.11
Matching Claims and Evidence
Ask small groups of students to write claims and supporting evidence statements based on
an argument essay question (such as Which had more of an impact on the expansion of civil
rights: an activist Supreme Court, a motivated legislature, or movements by citizens?). Have
groups trade claims and evidence, revise or modify the claims (if necessary), match the
claims and evidence, and write statements explaining why the evidence supports the claim.
Unit Planning Notes
Use the space below to plan your approach to the unit. Consider how you want to pace your teaching of the
many required Supreme Court cases in this unit so students have time to fully understand them.

American Political
Ideologies and Beliefs
Developing Understanding
Connecting the application of political science methods to the development of social
and economic policies that Americans support, advocate for, and adopt is foundational
to understanding the ideologies of political parties and patterns of political participation.
American political beliefs are shaped by founding ideals, core values, linkage institutions (i.e.,
elections, political parties, interest groups, and the media in all its forms), and the changing
demographics of citizens. These beliefs about government, politics, and the individual’s role in
the political system influence the creation of public policies.
Building the
Disciplinary Practices
3.C  3.D  4.C
This unit provides a great opportunity to integrate data analysis with an investigation of American attitudes about government and politics, how those attitudes develop and change over time, and how political scientists measure and evaluate political attitudes and behaviors. Students should be able to correctly interpret and connect what they see in the data to course concepts in order to draw conclusions. Drawing conclusions requires students to make inferences based on the patterns and trends in the data and their knowledge of political concepts.
This is also a good time to have students analyze political concepts from secondary sources and explain how they relate to a political concept. Books by political scientists, opinion pieces in major publications, and scholarly online articles will often connect to current events and be a great resource.
Students should analyze the argument, considering how the author responds to opposing or differing perspectives.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The AP Exam requires students to analyze quantitative data presented visually and apply that analysis to their understanding of political concepts in both the multiple-choice and free-response sections.
In both types of questions, students will
need to be able to: (1) identify and describe the data, (2) describe patterns or trends in data, (3) draw conclusions about patterns or trends in data, and (4) explain how the data relates or demonstrates a political concept, principle, or behavior.
Students often struggle to connect conclusions drawn from data to political concepts, such as behavior. Encourage them to take their conclusions further and explain the relationship. Political scientists use data and their knowledge of political institutions and processes to explain how, for example, members of a political party, voters, or interest groups may react to certain public opinion data.

Building the
Disciplinary Practices
3.D 5.A
5.C 5.D
Throughout the course, students have been gradually introduced to argumentation and have had regular opportunities to practice this skill. In this unit, students continue to write defensible claims, support claims with relevant evidence, and establish a line of reasoning, but now also use refutation, concession, or rebuttal when they respond to alternative perspectives.
Just as political scientists do in their arguments, students should be able to identify an opposing or alternate perspective about a political principle, institution, process, or behavior and use evidence to explain why that perspective is not as valid or credible as their own claim.
As students build toward more complex skills, it helps to ask them to identify and explain limitations they discover when analyzing and interpreting quantitative data.
Limitations can include data from a limited demographic, opt-in polling (like on social media), a biased polling source, the way questions were asked, and more.
Preparing for the AP Exam
To complete their argument essays, students will respond to an opposing or alternative perspective. It is not enough for students to simply identify an opposing or alternative perspective. They must demonstrate a correct understanding of the perspective by briefly describing it, and then refute, concede, or rebut that perspective.
This task is often difficult for students.
Many students can identify an opposing or alternative perspective, but they struggle to explain why the other perspective is incorrect or why another perspective might be equally as valid as their own argument.
To help students master this skill, ask them to identify evidence that would support an alternative perspective when establishing their own claims. Then, have them explain why, in the face of this evidence, they still chose to support a different claim. This thought process shows students one way of effectively rebutting, refuting, or conceding an alternative perspective. Key phrases such as “while some may argue” or “even though some evidence supports” can help them frame their counterarguments.
Political Participation
Developing Understanding
Students should understand the many ways that they can influence policy-makers and impact the decisions that will affect their daily lives.
The principle of rule by the people is the bedrock of the American political system and
requires that citizens engage and participate in the development of policy. Under our
Constitution, governing is achieved directly through citizen participation, although there are
institutions (e.g., political parties, interest groups, and mass media) that inform, organize, and
mobilize support to influence government and politics, resulting in many venues for citizen influence on policy making.

UNIT 5
SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples
below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways
that they approach teaching the content and skills in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional
Approaches section beginning on p. 139 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 5.2
Look for a Pattern
Using a complex graph with at least two data sets—for example, showing voting
patterns by age and gender—have students compare the data to find a trend and draw a
conclusion. They should also explain their reasoning. For example, a graph may show that
less than 40 percent of people under the age of 24 vote, but over 70 percent of people
aged 65–74 vote. Students could conclude that candidates are unlikely to champion
issues favored mostly by the young because young people are not as likely to vote as older people.
2 5.7
Debate
Facilitate a debate about the various groups that influence policy in our government today.
Ask students to take a position on which group they believe has the most influence and to
provide relevant supporting evidence to back up their claims.
3 5.13
Self/Peer Revision
Ask students to write an argument based on the following prompt: Which of the following
factions have the most impact on national elections today: political parties, special interest
groups, or the media? Ask students to use evidence from Federalist No. 10 to support
their claims. Have students perform self- and peer revisions of their practice argument
essays so they have the opportunity to review their practice claims, supporting evidence, sourcing, and analysis and reasoning.

Unit Planning Notes
Use the space below to plan your approach to the unit. Consider how you want to scaffold your student
practice of argumentation in conjunction with the unit content. If teaching this unit near the beginning of
the year, it helps to focus on teaching students to write claims and establish supporting evidence instead of writing full argument essays.

Making the
Civic Connection
To be authorized as an AP U.S. Government and Politics course, teachers must submit a
course syllabus for review that complies with the following:
Curricular Requirement 14: Students are provided with an opportunity to engage in a political
science research or applied civics project tied to the AP U.S. Government and Politics course
framework that culminates in a presentation of findings. (See AP U.S. Government and
Politics Course Audit Curricular Requirements on AP Central.)
The project can involve student participation in nonpartisan service-learning opportunities,
government-based internship programs, or a choice from a teacher-approved list of research project ideas.
While the project is not part of the AP Exam grade, it does provide students with the opportunity
to engage in a sustained, real-world activity that will deepen their understanding of course
content and help them develop the disciplinary practices that are assessed on the exam.
Project Guidelines
A relevant project applies course concepts to real-world political issues, processes,
institutions, and policy making. For example, students might investigate a question by
collecting and analyzing data; participate in a relevant service learning or civic event;
or develop a sustained, applied investigation about local issues. Students would then
communicate their findings or experiences in a way that conveys or demonstrates their understanding of course content.
You have flexibility in how to set up, connect, and assess student performance on the project.
The following are important considerations.
The project must require students to:§
Bullet Connect course concepts to real-world issues§
Bullet Demonstrate disciplinary practices§
Bullet Share/communicate their findings in an authentic way (e.g., presentation, article, speech,
brochure, multimedia, podcast, political science fair)
The project may be:§
Bullet Undertaken either by individuals or small groups of students§
Bullet Completed before or after the AP Exam or integrated throughout or at a specific point in the course§
Bullet Partisan based, if so chosen by the student(s)
Return to Table of Contents
Project Guide V.1 | 131
AP U.S. Government and Politics Course and Exam Description © 2022 College Board

=== Page 139 ===
You should:
§Bullet Ensure that the project complies with local school/district guidelines and policies
§Bullet Consider the length of the course (half year versus full year) when determining the complexity of the project §Bullet Ensure that projects are appropriate for:
◆
Bullet the age and maturity of the student ◆
Bullet the availability of resources and necessary transportation ◆
Bullet the political climate in your community
§Bullet Assist students in choosing project topics and determining scope
§Bullet Provide feedback to students about conceptual understanding and skill development
You should not:
§Bullet Assign students to partisan-based projects; while allowed, such projects must be of the student’s own choosing
GUIDING STUDENTS IN SELECTING REASONABLE POLITICAL ISSUES OR
FIELDS OF INQUIRY
The key to a successful project is choosing an appropriate issue or inquiry, which may be
difficult for students. You may want to prepare a list of ideas for student research. Because
students will be sharing their work in some capacity, each student or group should work on a different issue or inquiry.
The AP U.S. Government and Politics course framework is packed with content that
can generate project or topic ideas. Asking students to turn enduring understandings
into questions to be answered is a great way to help them begin the process of inquiry.
Additionally, the required foundational documents or Supreme Court cases might spark interest and provide context for a project.

Selecting and Using
Course Materials
Using a wide array of source material helps students become proficient with the disciplinary practices and develop a conceptual understanding of the
U.S. government and its interactions. In addition
to using a college-level textbook that will provide
required course content, students should have regular opportunities to examine primary and secondary
source material in different and varied forms, as well
as other types of political science scholarship. Rich,
diverse source material provides more flexibility in
designing learning activities that develop the habits of
thinking like a political scientist that are essential for student success in the course.
Textbooks
The AP U.S. Government and Poltics course requires
the use of a college-level textbook. Also, because the
disciplinary practices are fundamental to the course, a
textbook that focuses on skill instruction is useful.
While nearly all college-level U.S. government textbooks
address the five units of the AP U.S. Government and
Politics course, they do not always do so in a balanced
fashion. In that case, it will be important for teachers to identify other types of secondary sources and
supplement the textbook accordingly to ensure that
each of the five topic areas receives adequate attention.
Some textbooks review historical contexts of events
such as the constitutional debates or various civil rights
movements. Since this is a political science course
rather than a history course, teachers should focus on
how those debates or movements shaped or relate to
our present-day government. Ultimately, it is best to
select a textbook that closely aligns with the course framework and the disciplinary practices.
While teachers select textbooks locally, an example
textbook list of college-level textbooks that meet the
AP Course Audit resource requirements is found on
AP Central.
Supreme Court Cases
AP U.S. Government and Politics students should be
familiar with the structure and functions of the U.S.
Supreme Court as well as how the court renders its decisions. This includes knowing how holdings are
decided and that justices who are in the minority often
write dissents that express their opinions on the case
and the constitutional questions. While students will not
need to know any dissenting (or concurring) opinions
from the required cases, it is important for students to
understand the role of dissenting opinions, especially as they relate to future cases on similar issues.
For the required Supreme Court cases, students should
know the major details of each case, the holding in the
majority opinion, and the constitutional principle used
by the majority of justices to support their finding.
On the AP Exam, students will need to apply this
information to a real-world scenario or in comparison to another case.
The course framework requires the analysis of 14 cases, which are listed on page 32.
There are four key elements for students to understand about these U.S. Supreme Court cases:
the facts, the issue(s), the holdings, and the reasoning behind the decisions.

Text-Based Qualitative Sources (Primary and Secondary Sources)
Political science writing differs from writing in other
fields. It focuses on what influences political behavior
and attitudes (e.g., voting, party identification, candidate support) and how political ideas and policies are developed and implemented.
Students in this AP course are required to analyze primary and secondary source material, including
arguments written by political scientists and others, in
order to deepen their understanding of the key concepts
addressed by the textbook and to engage in the required
disciplinary practices. Students are not expected to
conduct original research, but they should be introduced to scholarly political science research articles.
FOUNDATIONAL DOCUMENTS
The AP U.S. Government and Politics course features
nine required foundational documents to help students
understand the philosophies of the founders and their
critics, and how discussions about ways to implement those philosophies have shaped the government.
These documents are:
§Bullet The Declaration of Independence §Bullet The Articles of Confederation §Bullet Federalist No. 10
Bullet Brutus No. 1 §Bullet Federalist No. 51 §Bullet The Constitution of the United States §Bullet Federalist No. 70 §Bullet Federalist No. 78 §Bullet “Letter from a Birmingham Jail”
Most of these documents were written in the late
18th century and contain some high-level language. It is
important for students to be able to read and accurately interpret these documents.
SECONDARY SOURCES
Student success in the course also depends on exposure to and analysis of multiple secondary sources in which political scientists present and
explain their arguments. The most common secondary
sources students should encounter include editorials,
journal articles, news media articles, Supreme Court case analyses, and essays and books by political
scientists. The course framework includes suggested supplemental readings for many of the essential knowledge statements, but the choice of which
secondary texts to use is entirely up to you. Choose a
variety of sources that represent different points of view
and that will engage students while enhancing learning.
Select high-interest readings and add new articles to keep up with rapidly changing events.
Quantitative Sources
Political science courses require students to
engage with data in a variety of ways. The analysis, interpretation, and application of quantitative
information are vital skills for students in AP U.S.
Government and Politics. New textbooks and publishers’ resources often contain quantitative
information presented via charts, graphs, or other
infographics, but that data may soon become out of
date. Research institutions such as the Pew Research
Center are good resources for current data to practice quantitative skills with students.
Visual Sources
Students will encounter a variety of visual sources on the AP U.S. Government and Politics Exam. Some
visuals contain data, such as a map showing Electoral
College results. Other visuals may illustrate political
principles, processes, or behaviors, such as a map of a gerrymandered congressional district. Visual
information may also be expressed in a political cartoon or an infographic.
It is important to give students practice with a wide
variety of visual sources. The textbook may contain
some maps and cartoons, and the following resources
provide a wealth of visuals to choose from for bell ringer exercises and skills practice.
Additional resources include:
§Bullet The Political Maps website §Bullet The Week (U.S. edition) website
§Bullet The cartoons section of the U.S. News & World
Report website
Evaluating Quality and Credibility of Different Sources and Perspectives
Students have unprecedented access to information, so it is more important than ever to help them
determine the credibility of sources. The disciplinary
practices require students to evaluate the quality
and credibility of different information sources and perspectives and derive supportable conclusions.
Teachers might want to provide students with a list
of news media websites with different perspectives,
such as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal,
Return to Table of Contents
Instructional Approaches  V.1 | 142
AP U.S. Government and Politics Course and Exam Description © 2022 College Board

=== Page 150 ===
the Huffington Post, Politico, and the Christian Science
Monitor. Real Clear Politics also offers a wide range
of articles each day from different sources and on a variety of topics.
Students can examine international perspectives on U.S. government and politics through the BBC
website, and English language versions of Al Jazeera and TASS. Schools might subscribe to databases of
credible articles from trusted sources such as Issues and Controversies, available through the ABC-CLIO database.
The table below explains how students might address credibility or reliability of various sources.
Criteria
Considerations
Examples and Illustrations
Credibility
§Bullet Credibility requires students to obtain information from
sources with knowledge and expertise in political science.
Sources can be print, online, or expert interviews.
§Bullet Because many students are using the Internet or database sources, they should consider the following:
◆
Bullet The domain name extensions, which indicate who publishes and owns the domain
Bullet Commonly used extensions, including:
● .edu (educational organization) ● .com (company) ● .org (any organization) ●	 .gov (government agency) ●	 .net (network) ◆
Bullet The author(s) of the website ◆
Bullet The credibility of sources cited in the materials as well as any websites they link to
§Bullet Read past the first slash in the domain name to see if the
page might be someone’s personal page. A personal page
might be less credible or include a bias that distorts the facts.
§Bullet Finding out who the authors are, their credentials, and the
organization(s) they are associated with will help determine
whether they are qualified to write about the topic.
§Bullet An article that includes citations of resources is often more credible.
§Bullet Design a lesson to help students identify political perspective by comparing the headlines from different news sources, such as Fox
News and MSNBC.
§Bullet Have students examine the language used in the lead stories, as well as the pictures that accompany them.
§Bullet Ask students to compare the focus of local news with that of national and international sources and discuss possible reasons certain stories are not covered in the news.
§Bullet Have students synthesize their findings in a short paper examining the role of the media in providing citizens with political information.
Reliability
§Bullet Students should examine the content of a source (the
evidence) to ensure it supports their claims and provides
insight and knowledge that relates to the topic. This means
that evidence is only relevant when it addresses both the topic in context and the student’s argument.
§Bullet Because we are investigating political processes and
institutions that are changing and evolving, it is important to consider whether the information provided is the most current.
§Bullet An article about the life of Supreme
Court Justice Ruth Bader-Ginsburg may not be relevant in supporting a claim about a particular Supreme
Court decision.
§Bullet A public opinion poll from 2008 might not be relevant in 2018.

Instructional Strategies
The AP U.S. Government and Politics course framework details the concepts and
skills students must master in order to be successful on the AP Exam. In order
to address those concepts and skills effectively, it helps to incorporate a variety
of instructional approaches and best practices into daily lessons and activities.
The following table presents strategies that could help students apply their understanding of course concepts.
Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Create
Representations
Students create tables, graphs, or other infographics to interpret text or data.
Helps students organize information using multiple ways to present data.
Give students a set of data, such as voting patterns by gender and ethnicity, and have them create a graph that best shows the data and the trends.
Close Reading
Students read, reread, and analyze small chunks of text word for word, sentence by sentence, and line by line.
Develops comprehensive understanding of text.
When students are reading the required foundational documents, have them highlight relevant words and passages that support the author’s claim.
Critique
Reasoning
Through collaborative discussion, students critique the arguments of others, questioning the author’s perspective, evidence presented, and reasoning behind the argument.
Helps students learn from others as they make connections between concepts and learn to support their arguments with evidence and reasoning that make sense to peers.
Using Federalist No. 70, have students critique the argument for a strong executive. Have them examine the author’s perspective and the evidence and reasoning he uses to support his position.
Debate
Students present an informal or formal argument that defends a claim with reasons while others defend different claims about the same topic or issue. The goal is to debate ideas without attacking the people who defend those ideas.
Gives students an opportunity to collect and orally present evidence supporting the arguments for or against a proposition or issue.
Have students debate which branch of government is the most powerful, using evidence and reasoning to support their claims.

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Debriefing
Teachers facilitate a discussion that leads to consensus understanding or helps students identify the key conclusions or takeaways.
Helps students solidify and deepen understanding of content.
For complex issues such as the bureaucracy, lead students in a debrief to ensure understanding.
Discussion Group
Students engage in an interactive, small group discussion, often with assigned roles (e.g., questioner, summarizer, facilitator, evidence keeper) to consider a topic, text, or question.
Helps students gain new understanding of or insight into a text or issue by listening to multiple perspectives.
Assign students to groups to discuss a learning objective, such as Explain how cultural factors influence political attitudes and socialization, with a view to helping them gain information and show their understanding.
Fishbowl
Some students form an inner circle and model appropriate discussion techniques while an outer circle of students listens, responds, and evaluates.
Provides students with an opportunity to engage in a formal discussion and to experience roles both as participant and active listener; students also have the responsibility of supporting their opinions and responses using specific textual evidence.
Use this strategy to discuss the arguments presented in the required documents and how they relate to our current government.
Graphic
Organizer
These provide a way to represent ideas and information visually (e.g., Venn diagrams, flowcharts, cluster maps).
Provides students with a visual system for organizing multiple ideas, details, and/or textual support to be included in a piece of writing.
Graphic organizers can be helpful when comparing political beliefs, ideologies, principles, and models.
Make sure students use any organizer thoughtfully and are not simply “filling in the blanks.”
Guided
Discussion
A guided discussion is an umbrella strategy that allows for the use of different techniques as you guide students through the lesson.
Helps students see the big picture and builds their confidence when dealing with difficult content or new skills.
Use brainstorming and quickwrite as strategies during a guided discussion to help students understand polling data about fiscal policy and how the data may affect political behavior.
Jigsaw
Each student in a group reads a different text or different passage from a single text, taking on the role of “expert” on what was read. Students share the information from that reading with students from other groups and then return to their original groups to share their new knowledge.
Helps students summarize and present information to others in a way that facilitates an understanding of a text (or multiple texts) or issue without having each student read the text in its entirety; by teaching others, they become experts.
Use this strategy to facilitate understanding of high-level readings, such as the
Federalist Papers and other foundational documents.

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Look for a
Pattern
Students evaluate data or create visual representations to find a trend.
Helps students identify patterns that may be used to draw conclusions.
Show students a complex graph with at least two data sets—for example, showing voting patterns by age and gender—and have them compare the data to find a trend and draw a conclusion.
Making
Connections
Students are given a concept, term, required case, or document and asked to write what they know about it. Then, students are paired and asked to determine, describe, and then explain the connection between the two concepts.
Reinforces the fact that political concepts are often connected and provides the opportunity for students to make and explain connections between and among these concepts.
Write concepts related to one of the course big ideas on cards and place them in a box. Have students pick a card at random. Give students a few minutes to gather and recall information about the term and then pair students and ask them to find the connection between their concepts. Finally, ask the pairs to write a brief explanation of how the concepts are related.
Match Claims and Evidence
Students are given sample claims (most of which can be improved upon) to evaluate and revise. Then students match their revised claims with pieces of evidence that can be used to support the claims. Once matched, students write a statement explaining how and why the evidence supports the claim.
Provides opportunities for students to edit existing claims and match those claims with evidence in preparation for writing their own argument essays.
In the early stages of practicing argumentation, ask small groups of students to write claims and supporting evidence statements based on a question structured in the same way as FRQ 4 (such as which branch of government is the most powerful). Have groups trade claims and evidence, revise or modify the claims (if necessary), match the claims and evidence, and write statements explaining why the evidence supports the claim.
Quickwrite
Students write for a short, specific amount of time about a designated topic.
Helps generate ideas in a short time.
As preparation for the free response question in which students apply content knowledge to political processes, principles, or behaviors (as in FRQ 1), have them write ways the president’s agenda can affect Congress or ways congressional behaviors can affect bureaucratic agencies.

Example
Self/Peer
Revision
Students work alone or with a partner to examine a piece of writing for accuracy and clarity.
Provides students with an opportunity to edit a written text to ensure the correctness of identified components.
Have students perform self and peer revisions of their practice argument essays so they have the opportunity to review their practice claims, supporting evidence, sourcing, and analysis and reasoning.
Socratic Seminar
This is a focused discussion tied to a topic, essential question, or selected text in which students ask questions of one another. The questions initiate a conversation that continues with a series of responses and additional questions.
Helps students arrive at a new understanding by asking questions
that clarify: challenging assumptions; probing perspective and point of view; questioning facts, reasons, and evidence;
or examining implications and outcomes.
Use the essential questions, such as Which branch of government is the most powerful? Why? to initiate discussion during which students can illustrate their understanding of the learning objectives and essential knowledge statements.
Think-Pair-Share
Students think through a question or issue alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with the class.
Enables the development of initial ideas that are then tested with a partner in preparation for revising ideas and sharing them with a larger group.
To practice comparing required Supreme Court cases to other related cases, give students a pair of cases and have them use Think-
Pair-Share to come up with similarities, differences, and relevance to political institutions or processes.

Developing the
Disciplinary Practices
Throughout the course, students will develop skills that
are fundamental to the discipline of political science.
Since these disciplinary practices represent the complex
skills that adept political scientists demonstrate,
students will benefit from multiple opportunities to develop these skills in a scaffolded manner.
While a high school civics course provides students with information about American government, a
college-level political science course will challenge
students to put that knowledge into action through various discipline-based practices common to
the field. One of the aims of the AP U.S. Government
and Politics course is to have students think like political scientists.
The disciplinary practices articulated in the course
framework equip students to understand, analyze, and
apply political information in a process similar to that
followed by political scientists. This process begins with a
close analysis of quantitative and qualitative sources and
reaches its conclusion when evidence is used effectively
to support an argument about political principles, institutions, processes, policies, or behaviors.
College Board has developed several skills-based activities in partnership with master teachers.
These individual activities include both course content
and scaffolded skills development and are listed in the
Available Resources section of the Topic Pages.
Resources include:
§Bullet SCOTUS Case Analysis Activities ◆ Provide practice for SCOTUS Application (Practice 2) §Bullet Data Analysis Activities ◆ Provide practice for Data Analysis (Practice 3) §Bullet Analytical Reading Activities ◆ ◆Provide practice for Source Analysis (Practice 4) §Bullet Argumentation Activities ◆ Provide practice for Argumentation (Practice 5)
The course framework features a suggested skill
for each course topic. However, teachers are free to
use either that skill or one of their choosing to allow
students to practice the skills using course content.
It is important to help students develop all the skills
throughout the course, and teachers should use their professional judgment to sequence and scaffold them appropriately for their students.
The tables on the pages that follow look at each of
the skills and provide examples of questions along
with instructional strategies for incorporating those practices into instruction.

Disciplinary Practice 3: Analyze and interpret
quantitative data represented in tables, charts, graphics, maps, and infographics
The analysis, interpretation, and application of quantitative information are vital skills for students
in AP U.S. Government and Politics. Analysis skills can be taught using any type of quantitative
information, but students should use current data so that they can draw accurate conclusions
and apply that knowledge to the enduring understandings and learning objectives in the course framework.
The table that follows provides examples of questions and instructional strategies for
implementing quantitative resources in the course.

Strategies 3.A. Describe the data presented.
§Bullet How is the data presented?
§Bullet What does the data show?
Have students analyze a bar graph showing the percentage of voters in presidential elections by age range and have them determine what the data shows. (Topic 5.2) §Bullet Look for a Pattern §Bullet Create Representations 3.B. Describe patterns and trends in data.
§Bullet What do you notice about the data?
§Bullet What trends and patterns can you identify from the data?
Ask students to describe the patterns and trends in the data, such as that voting percentage increases as people age.
(Topic 5.2) §Bullet Debriefing §Bullet Create Representations 3.C. Explain patterns and trends in data to draw conclusions.
§Bullet Why is the data displayed as it is?
§Bullet What does the author of the chart or graph want to show us?
§Bullet What conclusions can you draw by comparing the trends you found in the data?
§Bullet What evidence do you have to support that conclusion?
Challenge students to compare the trends and draw a conclusion about the data.
They should also explain their reasoning. For example, a graph may show that less than 40% of people under the age of 24 vote, but over 70% of people aged 65–74 vote. Students could conclude that candidates are unlikely to champion issues favored mostly by the young because young people are not as likely to vote as older people.

Disciplinary Practice 4: Read, analyze, and interpret foundational documents and other text-based and visual sources
TEXT-BASED SOURCES
The AP U.S. Government and Politics course requires students to analyze texts in terms of
perspective, conclusions, and supporting evidence, and understand how they illustrate principles
and processes of U.S. government. The primary function of using sources in this course is to
help students understand the principles and processes of U.S. government. In these texts, the
founders, political scientists, and other scholars develop their ideas and arguments.
To understand the argument, reasoning, and implications of these texts, students should:
§Bullet Identify the author and the author’s perspective
§Bullet Put the author’s thesis or claim in their own words
§Bullet Identify the reasoning the author uses to justify the claim
§Bullet Explain the evidence used to support the argument and the reasoning
§Bullet Identify evidence that supports alternative perspectives
§Bullet Explain how the alternative perspectives refute or rebut the author’s argument
§Bullet Critique the author’s argument, pointing out its strengths and weaknesses
§Bullet Explain the implications of the author’s argument
§Bullet Explain how the author’s argument relates to political principles, institutions, processes, policies, or behaviors
The table that follows provides examples of questions and instructional strategies for
implementing qualitative text-based resources in the course.

VISUAL SOURCES
Maps, infographics, and political cartoons can also help students understand the principles and
processes of U.S. government. Often the visual presentation of a political science concept, such
as gerrymandering, carries more weight than a textual source provides. At the same time, political
cartoons provide insight into factions, ideologies, and the relationship between the government and the people.

Disciplinary Practice 5: Develop an argument in essay format
Political scientists examine data, evidence, and differing perspectives to develop claims about
political principles, institutions, processes, policies, and behaviors. As they begin to articulate
their positions, political scientists use reasoning processes that rely on their awareness of
different types of relationships, connections, and patterns within the data, evidence, and
perspectives. They then formulate a claim, or thesis, and develop an argument that explains how the claim is supported by the available evidence.
A strong argument also accounts for how some evidence might seem to refute or rebut the claim,
addressing alternate perspectives. Students should practice creating persuasive and meaningful
arguments to improve their proficiency with each of these practices in turn.
APPLYING REASONING
In order to develop an argument, political scientists formulate a claim, or thesis, that is based on
logical reasoning. A meaningful claim must be based in evidence, defensible, and evaluative; it
must take a stance on an issue that could plausibly be argued differently; and it must go beyond
simply listing causes or factors, qualifying its assertions by looking at an issue from multiple
perspectives or through different lenses. The reasoning used in the thesis often sets up the
structure of the argument in the essay that follows. These reasonings might involve:
§Bullet Explaining political processes, relationships among or between processes, and/or issues or implications surrounding these processes
§Bullet Identifying areas of similarity or difference between issues, policies, ideologies, or institutions
in order to consider possible underlying reasons for similarity or difference
§Bullet Considering both the immediate causes or effects of an event as well as long-term causes or
effects, and assigning a relative significance to each
The table that follows provides examples of questions and instructional strategies for teaching
students to successfully write an argument essay in the course.

Developing the
Reasoning Processes
Reasoning processes describe the cognitive operations
that students will be required to apply when engaging with practices on the AP Exam. Students should
organize their response around a specific reasoning
process that aligns to the intent of the question. The reasoning processes ultimately represent the way practitioners think in the discipline.
Tasks based on the reasoning processes lend
themselves to developing assessment questions. The
examples in the table below provide several ideas.
In addition, the course learning objectives can also be broken down by reasoning process. For example,
let’s look at Learning Objective PMI-4.A: Explain how
the ideologies of the two major parties shape policy
debates. In order for students to perform that task, they
would need to use the process of causation to explain how ideology affects policy debates.
The following table provides some suggestions for
ways of approaching the reasoning processes in the
AP U.S. Government and Politics course.

Questions 7–9 refer to the excerpt below.
The vice of the groupist theory is that it conceals the most significant aspects
of the system. The flaw in the pluralist heaven is that the heavenly chorus
sings with a strong upper-class accent. Probably about 90 percent of the people cannot get into the pressure system.
The notion that the pressure system is automatically representative of the
whole community is a myth fostered by the universalizing tendency of
modern group theories. Pressure politics is a selective process ill designed to
serve diffuse interests. The system is skewed, loaded, and unbalanced in favor of a fraction of a minority.
—E. E. Schattschneider, The Semisovereign People, 1960

(A)	Pluralist democracy, which seeks to shield elites from popular opinion,
functions best when individual citizens do not participate in the process.
(B)	 Participatory democracy, which emphasizes limited participation,
marginalizes those who do not have the economic means to participate.
(C)	 Pluralist democracy, though it involves groups at different stages of
the process of developing policy, excludes a significant portion of the population.
(D)	Participatory democracy, which emphasizes expanded participation, creates too much conflict within the system.
8.	 Which of the following statements about interest groups would the author most likely agree with?
(A)	Interest groups play the important function of including more people in elections.
(B)	 Interest groups undermine stability by creating too much conflict and polarization in politics.

Section II: Free-Response
The following are examples of the kinds of free-response questions found on the exam.
Concept Application (Free-Response Question 1 on the AP Exam)

The National Association of Home Builders, a national interest group that
represents over 140,000 members in the home construction industry, has
endorsed David Valadao (R) for reelection in California’s Twenty-First
Congressional District in the 2018 midterm election.
“Rep. Valadao has made housing and home ownership a top national priority and
understands that expanding housing opportunities for all Americans is essential
to the economic and social well-being of our nation,” said Randy Noel, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders.
“We are proud to endorse Rep. Valadao for reelection in November because he
helped to shepherd the landmark tax reform bill through Congress that will put
more money into the pockets of hard-working families, reduce the tax burden for
small businesses and promote job and economic growth,” Noel said.
Recent polls show Valadao holding an 11-point lead over Democratic challenger
T. J. Cox.
Source: “Valadao Picks Up Several Endorsements,” Hanford Sentinel (Hanford, CA), October 19, 2018.
After reading the scenario, respond to A, B, and C below:
(A)	Describe an action being taken by the National Association of Home
Builders in the scenario.
(B)	 Explain how the action described in Part A affects policy making in Congress.
(C)	 Another group interested in conserving land in California supports the
Democratic candidate in the election. Rather than having 140,000 members,
the group is led by a few very wealthy families. Explain how this difference
will likely affect the conservationist group’s strategy in the election.

SCOTUS Comparison (Free-Response Question 3 on the AP Exam)

In 1935, Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which among
other things guaranteed workers the right to join a labor union and collectively
bargain with employers. The law also established the National Labor Relations
Board (NLRB), an independent agency responsible for enforcing the law.
The Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation fired ten workers attempting to
unionize its plant located in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania. When the National Labor
Relations Board determined this to be in violation of the recently passed NLRA,
the company sued claiming that labor relations had only an indirect effect on
commerce, and thus Congress did not have the constitutional power to regulate it.

In the subsequent case, National Labor Relations Board v. Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation (1937), the
Supreme Court ruled in favor of the National Labor Relations Board by a 5–4 vote, holding that the Jones and
Laughlin Steel Corporation conducted interstate commerce and that industrial labor relations affects that commerce.
(A)	Identify the constitutional clause that is common in both United States v. Lopez (1995) and National Labor
Relations Board v. Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation (1937).

Learning Objectives:  PMI-5.E   PMI-5.G
(A)
Describe an action being taken by the National Association of Home
Builders in the scenario.
Acceptable description:
Bullet	 By releasing a statement supporting Representative Valadao, the Home Builders Association is
educating voters about the candidate in the upcoming election.
1 point
1.D
(B)
Explain how the action described in Part A affects policy making in Congress.
Acceptable explanations include:
Bullet	 By publicly supporting candidates in elections, interest groups demonstrate to members of Congress
their ability to affect elections, which could lead to members of Congress supporting the legislation promoted by the Home Builders Association.
Bullet	 If interest groups publicly support candidates, members of Congress will likely recognize the political
power of those interest groups when considering legislation that affects those groups. So, if members
of Congress oppose this legislation, they run the risk of facing potential opposition from the Home
Builders Association in the next election.
1 point
1.E
(C)
Explain how this difference will likely affect the conservationist group’s strategy in the election.
Acceptable explanations include:
Bullet	 Groups with more members, such as the Home Builders Association, are generally more active
in endorsing and publicly supporting candidates because they have strength in numbers with
their memberships. A group that does not have many members but has funding, such as the
conservationist group described in the scenario, will need to consider a different strategy, such as
forming a political action committee or a super PAC.
Bullet	 A conservationist group will probably use a different strategy because they have less members. Since
they have money for funding they could collect large amounts of money to donate to the campaign.

(D)
Explain how public education spending as shown in the information graphic demonstrates the principle of federalism.
Acceptable explanations include:
Bullet	 While the national government requires states to provide education, states are permitted to create

2.A
One point for correctly explaining how the facts of both cases led to a different holding.
Bullet	 In United States v. Lopez, gun possession was not an economic activity that could be considered
interstate commerce under the commerce clause. In the NLRB v. Jones case, Congress determined
that labor disputes were related to interstate commerce and, thus, could be regulated by the federal government.
1 point
2.C
(C)
Explain how the holding in National Labor Relations Board v. Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation
affected the balance of power between the states and the national government
Acceptable explanations include the following:
Bullet	 By granting Congress more authority to make laws under the commerce clause, and also to establish
a regulatory agency to rule in labor disputes, it substantially increased the power of the federal government.
Bullet	 The NLRB v. Jones case applied a very broad interpretation of what affects “interstate commerce”
under the commerce clause. This increases the authority of Congress to make laws and establish
agencies which increases the power of the federal government.

Responses that do not earn this point:
Bullet	 The intended claim or thesis only restates the prompt
Bullet	 The intended claim or thesis does not make a claim that responds to the prompt
Responses that earn this point:
Bullet	 The claim or thesis responds to the prompt rather than restating or rephrasing the prompt and establishes a line of reasoning
Bullet	 The response must include a defensible claim or thesis that establishes a line of
reasoning about which of the three models of representative democracy – participatory,
pluralist, or elite – best achieves the founders’ intent for American Democracy
Examples that do not earn this point:

Bullet	 “Three models of representative democracy—participatory,
pluralist, and elite - are all ways of achieving a stable government”
Does not respond to the prompt
Bullet	 “The founders’ intent for American democracy was to ensure a stable government as shown in the Constitution”
Examples that earn this point:
Bullet	 “It is clear that the main intent of the founders best aligns with the model of elite
representative democracy. The rules crafted for appointment of Congress members and
the president demonstrate an elitist model of democracy for the nation”
Bullet	 “The founders wanted the people to play a main role in the government and that is why
the participatory model of representative democracy best describes the American political system”
Bullet	 “The model that best describes the American political system is the pluralist theory of
representative democracy, where groups compete to make society better”

system. In this system, the people are allowed the initial vote for president, or the
‘popular vote,’ which determines the composition of the electorate”
Bullet	 “The Constitution includes a Bill of Rights which includes the rights/liberties of the
people. This gives people an incentive to be part of the governing process”

in government. For example, the 17th Amendment gives the people the power to vote
for their senators allowing them to participate more in the government”

Describes an alternate perspective but does not refute, concede, or rebut that perspective
Bullet	 “Although it is obvious that the elite model of democracy is
what the founders intended, some argue that the founders
actually wanted a participatory system of democracy in order to give the people authority over the government”
Examples of acceptable responses to an alternate perspective may include:
Bullet	 “Advocates of the participatory theory may argue that citizens have the power to
participate by voting in elections in the United States. However, the founders designed
a government which allowed for representation of the people, while leaving the more
complex and important decisions to a well-educated few, as demonstrated by the
systems of elections for both senators and the president”
Bullet	 “A counter argument is that the elite model is the best. This is supported by the United
States Constitution, which gives the most power to property holding, wealthy, white
males. This does not best reflect the founders’ intent because the founders wanted the
people, the citizens, in the United States to be in control. This is not possible with the
elitist theory because only the wealthy have any say in the government under the elitist model, not all citizens”
Additional Notes:
Bullet	 To earn this point, the response must have a defensible claim or thesis (earned the point in Row A)
