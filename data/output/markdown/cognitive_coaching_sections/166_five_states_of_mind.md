## Five States of Mind

We all have the extraordinary coded within us, waiting to be released.

-Jean Houston

In his popular book Drive , Daniel Pink (2009) describes what motivates us: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. We identify such drives as five states of mind that inform human perception and are the resources that human beings access as they resolve the tensions inherent in holonomous settings. They are the tools of disciplined choice making and the primary vehicles in a lifelong journey toward integration.

These basic human drives influence, motivate, and inspire our intellectual capacities, emotional responsiveness, high performance, and productive human action. We categorize and define them as shown in figure 7.1: efficacy, flexibility, craftsman-ship, consciousness, and interdependence.

- 1.  The capacity for efficacy : Humans quest for competence, learning, self-empowerment, mastery, and control.
- 2.  The capacity flexibility: Humans survive by developing repertoires of response patterns that allow them to see other perspectives and create, adapt, and change.

- 3.  The capacity for consciousness: Humans uniquely strive to monitor and reflect on their own and others' thoughts and actions.
- 4.  The capacity for craftsmanship: Humans yearn to become clearer, more elegant, precise, congruent, and integrated.
- 5.  The capacity for interdependence: Humans grow in relationship to others and are social beings in need of reciprocity and community.

Although some of the states of mind may periodically be more dominant than others, these five distinctly human forces unite the expression of wholeness in an individual. The capacity to access and channel these forces provides the continuing sources of excellence in all of life's endeavors, both professional and personal. The states of mind are recognizable in our language and actions, and they are at once dispositional and cognitive. They inform and make possible the application of strategies and the selection of thinking processes appropriate to a situation. They contribute to increased accomplishment and satisfaction.

The five states of mind are innate in our brains and bodies. Being capacities, they are invisible in that they represent a person's perceptions, emotions, and decision-making processes for responding intelligently to the ever-changing, in-the-moment context of life.

There is a dimension of the universe unavailable to the senses.

Like gravitational or electromagnetic fields, these states of mind cannot be observed directly; they are known by their effects. The ball falls from our hand; we label gravity as a cause. Likewise, we label invisible powers in professional educators-their states of mind-that generate profound, observable effects in classrooms and throughout the school culture.

The five states of mind are not fixed; rather, there is the potential for being liberated, expanded, or atrophied. Normally, infants are imbued with curiosity-they explore and seek novelty yet, when raised in an impoverished environment, the capacity for normal development is compromised. It is well known that while babies are born with the natural capacity to learn any language, this capacity disappears with disuse. Neuronal connections in their brain are formed through hearing, mimicking, and experimenting with sounds. Through neural pruning, they give up the sounds and patterns they do not hear and strengthen their use of the language they do hear. What they do not hear and use atrophies. Living in a responsive environment and being recognized will reinforce these tendencies.

Similarly, all humans have a natural, innate capacity for efficacy, consciousness, craftsmanship, flexibility, and interdependence. When suppressed, the expression of these factors declines. Even changes in leadership can diminish this capacity from being active. Likewise in adults, these states of mind are subject to many factors: environmental conditions, developmental levels, emotional states, situational conditions, interpersonal relationships, and individual styles. They can be blunted if they are not exercised or practiced or if external (environmental) or internal (personal/physical/emotional) conditions stunt their development. They can become inaccessible or limited.

Efficacy, consciousness, craftsmanship, flexibility, and interdependence, while native to humans, must be refined, nurtured, supported, practiced, and fulfilled on a regular basis if they are to remain constants. When treating humans as if they are intelligent, they actually become more so. When challenging tasks requiring persistence are given, when children and adults experience complex thinking, when they have to solve their own problems and are held responsible for solving them and for experiencing the consequences, these capacities are developed more fully and are more likely to continue developing over time. Cognitive Coaching strengthens and makes these resources more accessible in the moment and over time.

What follows is (1) an exploration of the sources of each of the states of mind as innate, human drives; (2) an explanation of the meaning and manifestations of that state of mind; (3) how Cognitive Coaches mediate by liberating and enhancing that state of mind; and (4) indicators of each state of mind as a source of excellence in educational settings.
