About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking
AP courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and
AP Exams are developed and scored by college faculty
and experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges
and universities in the United States grant credit,
advanced placement, or both on the basis of successful
AP Exam scores; more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the content
and skills that are the focus of the corresponding
college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also
organizes the content and skills into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many AP teachers have
told us they follow in order to focus their instruction.
The intention of this publication is to respect teachers’
time and expertise by providing a roadmap that they
can modify and adapt to their local priorities and
preferences. Moreover, by organizing the AP course
content and skills into units, the AP Program is able to provide teachers and students with formative assessments—Personal Progress Checks—that
teachers can assign throughout the year to measure
student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students:
Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically
challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to equitable preparation and
access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses:
The AP Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP courses
must participate in the AP Course Audit, a process through which AP teachers’ course materials are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.

AP English Language and Composition Course and Exam Description

=== Page 9 ===
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the
AP teacher and the school principal (or designated
administrator) to confirm awareness and understanding
of the curricular and resource requirements. A syllabus
or course outline, detailing how course requirements
are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The
AP Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor;
all AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision,
piloting, and analysis to ensure that questions are
accurate, fair, and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development,
College Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher
education institutions. This feedback is carefully
considered to ensure that AP courses and exams are
able to provide students with a college-level learning
experience and the opportunity to demonstrate their
qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam
development process, relies on the expertise of both
AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice
questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course performance
assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands
of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are
scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion
is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained,
and their work is monitored throughout the Reading
for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief
Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers
in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of
the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a curve.
Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which means that
every student who meets the criteria for an AP score of
2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no matter how many
students that is. The criteria for the number of points
students must earn on the AP Exam to receive scores
of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently
validates for credit and placement purposes—include:
§§ The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
§§ The number of points researchers have found to be predictive that an AP student will succeed when placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
§§ Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP scores as follows:
AP Score
Credit
Recommendation
College Grade
Equivalent 5
Extremely well qualified
A 4
Well qualified
A-, B+, B 3
Qualified
B-, C+, C 2
Possibly qualified n/a 1
No recommendation n/a

While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and
universities. To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/ placement policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/creditpolicies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score the free-response sections of the AP Exams.
Ninety-eight percent of surveyed educators who took
part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an
AP Reader, including opportunities to:
§§ Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
§§ Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure
to the quality and depth of the responses from the
entire pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
§§ Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
§§ Score from home: AP Readers have online
distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects.
Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
§§ Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs):
AP Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide suggests a
sequence and pacing of content and scaffolds skill instruction across units.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course topics and skills, create
customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.
*To report misuses, please call 877-274-6474 (International: +1-212-632-1781).

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
§§ Teachers and students sign in to or create their College Board accounts.
§§ Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
§§ Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
§§ Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP Coordinator.
§§ Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and
AP Coordinators to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following
additional benefits:
§§ Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
§§ Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
§§ Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student
pack. The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for preadministration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
§§ Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

Instructional
Model
Integrating AP resources throughout the course can help students develop skills and
conceptual understandings. The instructional model outlined below shows possible ways to incorporate AP resources into the classroom.
Plan
Teachers may consider the following approaches as they plan their instruction before teaching each unit.
§§ Use the Unit Overview table to identify the enduring understandings, skills, and essential
knowledge that build toward a common understanding.
§§ Use the Instructional Planning Page to shape and organize instruction by considering
text selections, course skill and essential knowledge sequencing, lesson pacing, and instructional activity selections.
Teach
When teaching, supporting resources can be used to build students’ conceptual understanding and their mastery of skills.
§§ Use the unit guides to identify the required content.
§§ Integrate the content with a skill, considering any appropriate scaffolding.
§§ Reference the Instructional Approaches section for ideas of activities to help students develop particular course skills.
Assess
Teachers can measure student understanding of the content and skills covered in the unit and provide actionable feedback to students.
§§ At the end of each unit, use AP Classroom to assign students the online Personal
Progress Checks, as homework or as an in-class task.
§§ Provide question-level feedback to students through answer rationales; provide unit- and
skill-level feedback using the progress dashboard.
§§ Create additional practice opportunities using the AP Question Bank and assign them through AP Classroom.

About the AP English
Language and Composition Course
The AP English Language and Composition course focuses on the development and revision
of evidence-based analytic and argumentative writing, the rhetorical analysis of nonfiction
texts, and the decisions writers make as they compose and revise. Students evaluate,
synthesize, and cite research to support their arguments. Additionally, they read and analyze
rhetorical elements and their effects in nonfiction texts—including images as forms of text—
from a range of disciplines and historical periods.
College Course Equivalent
The AP English Language and Composition course aligns to an introductory college-level rhetoric and writing curriculum.
Prerequisites
There are no prerequisite courses for AP English Language and Composition. Students
should be able to read and comprehend college-level texts and write grammatically correct, complete sentences.

AP ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND COMPOSITION

Introduction
An AP English Language and Composition course cultivates the reading
and writing skills that students need for college success and for intellectually
responsible civic engagement. The course guides students in becoming
curious, critical, and responsive readers of diverse texts and becoming
flexible, reflective writers of texts addressed to diverse audiences for
diverse purposes. The reading and writing students do in the course should
deepen and expand their understanding of how written language functions
rhetorically: to communicate writers’ intentions and elicit readers’ responses in particular situations.
To support these objectives, this AP English Language and Composition Course and Exam Description delineates the knowledge and skills colleges and
universities typically expect students to demonstrate
in order to receive credit for an introductory college composition course.
This publication is not a curriculum. Teachers create
their own curricula by selecting and sequencing the
texts and tasks that will enable students to develop the
knowledge and skills outlined in this document. In some
cases, teachers also need to meet certain state or local
requirements within the AP curriculum they develop
for their school. The objective of this publication is to
provide teachers with clarity regarding the content
and skills students should learn in order to qualify for college credit and placement. The AP Program
recognizes that the real craft is in the skill with which teachers develop and deliver instruction.
Students develop the skills of rhetorical analysis and composition as they repeatedly practice analyzing
others’ arguments, then compose their own arguments.
As a model for teachers, the course content and
skills are presented in nine units. The objective of this
unit structure is to respect new AP teachers’ time by suggesting one possible sequence they can adapt rather than having to build from scratch.
An additional benefit is that these units enable the
AP Program to provide interested teachers with free formative assessments—the Personal Progress
Checks—that they can assign their students at the
end of each unit to gauge progress toward success on the AP Exam. However, experienced AP teachers who
are satisfied with their current course organization and
results should feel no pressure to adopt these units,
which comprise an optional, not mandatory, sequence for this course.
Because these nine units only delineate the skills
students should be developing across the AP English
Language and Composition course but do not specify
the content or themes students will study, teachers
can assign a theme or title to each of the nine units
(e.g., Humanity and Nature, Industry and Technology,
Family and Community) or can dedicate multiple units
to the same theme (e.g., Family and Community I, II,
and III). This enables teachers to avail themselves of
the scaffolded skill progressions detailed in each unit
to help focus their students’ learning and practice and then assign students the relevant Personal
Progress Checks.

Big Ideas and Enduring
Understandings
The big ideas serve as the foundation of the AP English Language and
Composition course and enable students to create meaningful connections among
course concepts. They are threads that run throughout the course, and revisiting
them and applying them in a variety of contexts helps students to develop deeper
conceptual understanding. Below are the big ideas of the course, along with the enduring understanding associated with each one:
1
RHETORICAL SITUATION (RHS)
Enduring Understanding RHS-1: Individuals write within a particular
situation and make strategic writing choices based on that situation.
CLAIMS AND EVIDENCE (CLE)
Enduring Understanding CLE-1: Writers make claims about subjects, rely
on evidence that supports the reasoning that justifies the claim, and often
acknowledge or respond to other, possibly opposing, arguments.
REASONING AND ORGANIZATION (REO)
Enduring Understanding REO-1: Writers guide understanding of a text’s
lines of reasoning and claims through that text’s organization and integration of evidence.
STYLE (STL)
Enduring Understanding STL-1: The rhetorical situation informs the strategic stylistic choices that writers make.

AP English Language and Composition Course and Exam Description

=== Page 23 ===
UNITS
The course skills are organized within nine units that scaffold student development of the analysis and
composition skills required for college credit. For each
unit, the teacher selects a theme or topic and then
chooses texts, typically short nonfiction pieces, that
enable students to practice and develop the reading and writing skills for that unit.
Each unit culminates in a Personal Progress Check
made up of 1) a free-response question and scoring
rubric for the teacher to administer in class or online
and 2) online multiple-choice questions that provide each student with personalized feedback and the teacher with a class summary of skills for which
students are on track for college credit and skills for which focus and practice are needed.
Pacing recommendations shown within the Course at
a Glance and the unit guides provide suggestions for
how to teach the required course content and administer the Personal Progress Checks. The suggested class
periods are based on a schedule in which the class
meets five days a week for 45 minutes each day. While these recommendations have been made to aid
planning, teachers should of course adjust the pacing based on the needs of their students, alternate
schedules (e.g., block scheduling), or their school’s academic calendar.

AP ENGLISH LANGUAGE
AND COMPOSITION
Course
Skills
Throughout the course, students will follow the pattern of reading others’
arguments and then writing their own. Students will analyze what makes others’
arguments convincing or confusing, engaging or dull, persuasive or powerless.
They will then turn to the act of composition themselves, seeking to emulate
effective argumentation they have encountered in their reading and analysis.
This pattern should be repeated in every unit of the course, ensuring students
are moving back and forth between analysis of the arguments they read and composition of their own arguments.
Accordingly, the AP English Language and Composition skills consist of paired
reading and writing skills. These skills will be the basis for the AP Exam questions.
The unit guides in this publication provide additional detail about these skills through essential knowledge statements.
Other than some focused instruction on punctuation in Unit 7, the teaching of
English grammar and mechanics is not the focus of this course. Students should
be able to write complete sentences before beginning the class, and through
frequent reading and analysis of the arguments of others and emulating such
models in their own writing, students’ proficiency in written English will increase
during the course. When students write essays within the AP Exam, small
grammatical errors typical of unrevised writing in a timed environment will not
negatively impact the score. Performance is only hurt by grammatical errors that
are so prevalent and significant as to interfere with communication.
More information about teaching these skills can be found in the Instructional
Approaches section.

AP ENGLISH LANGUAGE
AND COMPOSITION
Unit
Guides
Introduction
The course consists of nine units that scaffold student development
of the analysis and composition skills required for college credit. For each
unit, the teacher selects a theme or topic and then chooses texts—typically
short nonfiction pieces—that enable students to practice and develop the reading and writing skills for that unit.
Some teachers assign each unit a different theme (e.g., education, ethics,
technology and society, human rights, civic engagement) or assign the
same theme/topic for two to three units in a row. Others who are teaching a
survey will assign a specific historical period or movement to each unit. And
yet others will explore nine figures or movements in depth, assigning a unit
to each (e.g., the transcendentalists, the civil rights movement).
This unit structure respects new AP teachers’ time by suggesting one
possible sequence they can adapt and modify rather than having to build
from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units enable the AP Program
to provide interested teachers with formative assessments—the Personal
Progress Checks—that they can assign their students at the end of each unit
to gauge progress toward success on the AP Exam. These Personal Progress
Checks each include an essay question. In the early units, to scaffold
student learning, this is not a full AP free-response question, but is instead
designed to assess the skills students should be demonstrating early in the
course. Experienced AP teachers who are satisfied with their current course
organization and exam results should feel no pressure to adopt these units,
which comprise an optional, not mandatory, sequence for this course.

Using the Unit Guides
Unit titles are written in by the teacher based on how they choose to organize the course.
Enduring understandings are important concepts that a student
should retain long after the completion of the course.
Skills define what a student should learn, practice, and develop
in order to qualify for college credit. These skills are thus the targets of assessment for the AP Exam.
Essential knowledge statements describe the knowledge required to perform the skills.
The Instructional Planning Page provides a place for teachers
to plan their instruction and pacing for each unit.
When planning, be sure to:
§§ Select texts and tasks that best facilitate students’ learning
of the required skills and essential knowledge for this unit.
§§ Schedule time at the end of the unit for students to write the
Personal Progress Check (PPC) essay at home online, in class online, or in class with paper and pencil.
§§ Schedule a separate class period for the PPC multiple choice questions, which can only be administered online,
if you want students to do this in class. (Alternatively, the
AP Program recommends assigning the PPC multiple-choice questions as homework.)
§§ Reserve a class period for additional teaching and practice
of any skills identified by the PPC multiple-choice question results as challenging for your students.
UNIT OVERVIEW
To provide teachers with time to focus on skills their students have not yet mastered, this final unit only
includes a small number of additional essential knowledge statements. AP teachers should utilize
information they have gained from the Personal Progress Checks (PPCs) to identify the skills where their
students most need additional instruction and practice, and focus the remaining class periods accordingly.
Teachers can use the AP Question Bank to create additional practice on the skills the PPCs identified as students’ greatest needs for further focus.
While the skills outlined in this unit represent the required course content, teachers are free to teach the
skills within the unit in any order they choose. Teachers should strategically select the texts they will teach,
keeping in mind that a single text might be used to teach a range of skills.

Unit 1:
UNIT OVERVIEW
Too often, students are rushed into writing full essays without having honed the skills of crafting a claim
and defending it with textual evidence. Students will benefit from frequent practice during this unit writing
paragraphs that include a claim that demands proof or defense and the textual evidence that furnishes that proof or defense.
One of the greatest initial challenges for students in composition classes is developing claims that require
defense with textual evidence, rather than mere statements of fact that require no defense. By keeping the
writing tasks in this unit focused on paragraphs rather than full essays, the likelihood of students receiving
specific, consistent, and sustained feedback on the quality of the claims they are developing vastly increases.
Until students can read closely for evidence and then use that cluster of evidence to construct a claim
that requires defending, it will be difficult for students to develop full essays with thesis statements and clear
lines of reasoning. Each day, students should practice assembling evidence and developing claims, starting
with one paragraph that includes a claim with evidence and then generating several claims about a subject,
each communicated in its own paragraph with supporting evidence.
While the skills outlined in this unit represent the required course content, teachers are free to teach the
skills within the unit in any order they choose. Teachers should strategically select the texts they will teach,
keeping in mind that a single text might be used to teach a range of these skills.

UNIT OVERVIEW
In this unit, students will continue to develop proficiency in recognizing claims and evidence in other writers’
arguments, while emulating such models in their own paragraphs. In addition, they will begin identifying
the ways effective writers appeal to and persuade their audiences, while practicing such appeals in their
own paragraphs. During this unit, students should build a collection of claims and evidence about a topic
or issue so that they can move beyond individual paragraphs to derive a thesis statement from the patterns they see within their collection.
While the skills outlined in this unit represent the required course content, teachers are free to teach the

A writer’s thesis is not necessarily a single sentence or an
explicit statement and may require a thorough reading of the
text to identify, but when a thesis is directly expressed, it is called a thesis statement.
[Note: While the texts you assign your students to analyze
may not always contain obvious thesis statements, they
should each have a thesis. It can be good practice for
students to write a thesis statement for such texts. On the
AP Exam, a clear communication of the thesis is required in students’ essays.] 4.B  Writing – Write a thesis statement that requires proof or defense and that may preview the structure of the argument.

UNIT OVERVIEW
Students should continue to see themselves as evidence collectors, continually assembling and reviewing
a range of evidence to identify overarching patterns that can be used to craft a thesis statement. But in
this unit, students should focus on improving the ways they explain and connect evidence and claims
to establish a clear line of reasoning through their essay. Students will also become familiar with several
traditional methods of development that writers have used for centuries to advance their arguments.

UNIT OVERVIEW
Students should enter this unit having learned to evaluate evidence to develop a thesis statement and
organize an argument. Now the focus is on improving the quality, interest, and power of the argument
by crafting introductions and conclusions that demonstrate a real understanding of the rhetorical
situation. In addition, students will practice a few additional methods of development.
While the skills outlined in this unit represent the required course content, teachers are free to teach the
skills within the unit in any order they choose. Teachers should strategically select the texts they will teach,
keeping in mind that a single text might be used to teach a range of skills.

UNIT OVERVIEW
This unit asks students to recognize and account for biases and limitations within the evidence they are
utilizing in an argument. Students should develop an initial thesis statement and line of reasoning based on
a pool of evidence that is fairly consistent, and then the teacher should introduce contradictory evidence
that requires the students to revise their thesis statements to account for it. Accordingly, teachers should
be especially thoughtful in sequencing the readings and evidence base for the topic of this unit. This unit
also continues to examine the subtle and significant impact of specific words and phrases, with students
analyzing how connotations of particular words convey an author’s attitude or feeling about a subject.
While the skills outlined in this unit represent the required course content, teachers are free to teach the
skills within the unit in any order they choose. Teachers should strategically select the texts they will teach,
keeping in mind that a single text might be used to teach a range of skills.

UNIT OVERVIEW
In this unit, students should continue to practice revising claims (and sometimes the overarching thesis
statement) to account for nuance, complexity, and contradictions in their sources. By the end of this
unit, students should be highly facile consumers of evidence, able to determine quickly whether a new
piece of evidence supports, refutes, or qualifies their claims, and then able to use modifiers to revise claims accordingly.
This unit also includes an understanding of how punctuation and design contribute to a writer’s purpose.
However, grammar and mechanics are not the focus of this course. Students should be able to write
complete sentences before beginning the AP class, and through frequent reading and analysis of others’
arguments and by emulating such models in their own writing, students’ proficiency in written English will
increase during the course. When students write essays within the AP Exam, small grammatical errors typical
of unrevised writing in a timed environment will not negatively impact the score. Performance is only hurt by
grammatical errors that are so prevalent and significant as to interfere with communication.
While the skills outlined in this unit represent the required course content, teachers are free to teach the
skills within the unit in any order they choose. Teachers should strategically select the texts they will teach,
keeping in mind that a single text might be used to teach a range of skills.

UNIT OVERVIEW
To provide teachers with time to focus on skills their students have not yet mastered, this penultimate unit
only includes a small number of additional essential knowledge statements. AP teachers should utilize
information they have gained from the Personal Progress Checks (PPCs) to identify the skills where their
students most need additional instruction and practice, and focus the remaining class periods accordingly.
Teachers can use the AP Question Bank to create additional practice on the skills the PPCs identified as students’ greatest needs for further focus.
While the skills outlined in this unit represent the required course content, teachers are free to teach the
skills within the unit in any order they choose. Teachers should strategically select the texts they will teach,

UNIT OVERVIEW
To provide teachers with time to focus on skills their students have not yet mastered, this final unit only
includes a small number of additional essential knowledge statements. AP teachers should utilize
information they have gained from the Personal Progress Checks (PPCs) to identify the skills where their
students most need additional instruction and practice, and focus the remaining class periods accordingly.
Teachers can use the AP Question Bank to create additional practice on the skills the PPCs identified as students’ greatest needs for further focus.
While the skills outlined in this unit represent the required course content, teachers are free to teach the
skills within the unit in any order they choose. Teachers should strategically select the texts they will teach,
keeping in mind that a single text might be used to teach a range of skills.

Selecting and Using
Course Materials
Reading
The AP English Language and Composition course
requires nonfiction readings (e.g., essays, journalism,
political writing, science writing, nature writing,
autobiographies/biographies, diaries, history, criticism)
that give students opportunities to identify and explain
an author’s use of rhetorical strategies and techniques.
If fiction and poetry are also assigned, their main purpose should be to help students understand how various
effects are achieved by writers’ rhetorical choices.
The course focuses on effective reading and writing practices, emphasizing depth of knowledge over
breadth. This is not a content-driven course, so the curriculum need not cover every work on a long
reading list; rather, students should come away from
the course with intensive practice of literacy skills
that they can apply to further reading. Furthermore, although the course should provide students some
practice in sustained reading of complex arguments,
the inclusion of many lengthy texts throughout the
course may be antithetical to achieving the goals of the
course, as students may focus on the content of a text
while overlooking its rhetorical structure or techniques.
A focus on flexibility in applying language skills in
multiple contexts to accomplish multiple purposes, along with an emphasis on depth of rhetorical
understanding, permits the inclusion of multiple shorter works that students can read and respond to in a narrow timeframe.
USE OF RHETORICAL TERMINOLOGY
Growth in skills cannot be measured or assessed as
students’ mastery of a vocabulary of rhetorical terms.
While older versions of this course (including questions on the AP English Language and Composition Exam
itself) relied on knowledge of terminology as a way
of assessing student work, the AP English Language and Composition Exam has evolved to emphasize
the appropriate application of such terminology in
students’ analyses of texts. Any rhetorical terms that
appear in this course are best situated as part of the
teacher’s vernacular, not the students’. A rule of thumb
for students’ vocabulary may be to reinforce language
often heard in public discourse, or what we may call
terms for functional rhetoric. These terms may include, but are not limited to context, appeals, purpose, audience, attitude, diction, and syntax.
READING LEVEL OF COURSE TEXTS AND
VOLUME OF READING
The College Board does not prescribe specific texts
for an AP English Language and Composition course.
That said, several guidelines are useful in determining the appropriateness of texts used in this course.
These guidelines include the following:
§§ Texts that represent a clear rhetorical situation (e.g., topical nonfiction)
§§ Texts that speak to one another through a variety of genres §§ Texts that could be read in an introductory composition class in college
§§ Texts that require teacher direction for students to discern meaning
§§ Texts that rate as upper high school level on a
Lexile chart1
Neither does the College Board prescribe an amount of
reading for an AP English Language and Composition course. Several questions, however, are useful in
assessing the volume of reading students should be assigned in this course:
§§ Are students reading challenging texts every day?
§§ Do students employ rereading as an interpretive strategy?
§§ Do students gain sufficient practice to develop skills in reading purposefully and rhetorically?
§§ Do students write on a regular basis about what others have written?
§§ Do the selected readings provoke responses from multiple perspectives and thus generate public discussion?

Instructional Approaches V.1 | 85
AP English Language and Composition Course and Exam Description

=== Page 93 ===
§§ Are students given the opportunity to immerse themselves in substantive texts—ones that require
several days or weeks to read—as well as texts that
can be read and reread within a single class period?
§§ Are students spending at least eight hours per week
(both inside and outside of class) engaged in their reading and writing? Is there a clear connection between their reading and writing?
§§ Are students reading texts that require teacher involvement or scaffolding, or can the texts be read independently?
CONTROVERSIAL TEXTUAL CONTENT
Issues that might, from particular social, historical,
or cultural viewpoints, be considered controversial,
including references to ethnicities, nationalities, religions, races, dialects, gender, or class, may
be addressed in texts that are appropriate for the
AP English Language and Composition course. Fair
representation of issues and peoples may occasionally
include controversial material. Since AP students have
chosen a program that directly involves them in college level work, participation in this course depends on a
level of maturity consistent with the age of high school
students who have engaged in thoughtful analyses of
a variety of texts. The best response to controversial
language or ideas in a text might well be a question
about the larger meaning, purpose, or overall effect of
the language or idea in context. AP students should
have the maturity, skill, and will to seek the larger
meaning of a text or issue through thoughtful research.
GENERAL AND TOPICAL READERS
Some AP English Language and Composition teachers may want students to explore ways that people
inquire, argue, and deliberate on a variety of topics
and questions. For this kind of course, many textbook
publishers design “readers” that are divided into units,
each featuring a collection of responses to a question that generates public controversy.
TRADE BOOKS
Contemporary trade books (investigative journalism,
designed for the reading public instead of for the
classroom) give students practice in reading complex,
extended arguments that are historically and culturally
situated. Unlike readers, which contain a collection of
short texts offering various perspectives on a single
topic, trade books generally provide a single, in-depth
argument on a single topic. Authors of texts appropriate
for study in this course include the following: Nicholas
Carr, Dave Eggers, Jonathan Safran Foer, Jane Goodall,
Malcolm Gladwell, Peter Singer, Rebecca Skloot, and
E.O. Wilson. A good way to search for possible texts is
to look at the New York Times Nonfiction Best Seller list.
EXTENDED TEXTS
Books by important writers of past eras also provide
students with practice in deciphering and responding to complex and extended arguments from historical
and cultural settings different from their own. Authors of
texts that might be used in the AP English Language and
Composition course include Mary Wollstonecraft, Henry
David Thoreau, Charles Darwin, and Rachel Carson.
SPEECHES
Because speeches emerge from particular rhetorical
occasions, they are especially good for illustrating how
arguments are successfully or unsuccessfully crafted
to target particular audiences in particular situations in
an effort to accomplish particular purposes. Authors
of speeches suitable for the AP English Language and
Composition course include Abraham Lincoln, Sojourner
Truth, Chief Joseph, King George IV of England, Franklin D.
Roosevelt, Martin Luther King Jr., Robert Kennedy, Indira
Gandhi, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama.
ESSAYS
From 18th-century journalists and pamphleteers to present-day essayists whose writing appears in
newspapers, journals, and essay collections, the essay
is a historically favored genre for the conduct of public
conversation about consequential questions. Students
should learn to distinguish between essays that serve
primarily as personal expression or autobiographical
narration and those that serve primarily as instruction,
inquiry, or political or social advocacy. Students should
also consider how essayists of all kinds participate in public discussion of consequential topics and
questions. Well-known political and literary essayists
appropriate for AP English Language and Composition
reading lists include Samuel Johnson, Thomas Paine,
Ralph Waldo Emerson, John Muir, Virginia Woolf,
Martin Luther King Jr., Annie Dillard, John McPhee,
Susan Sontag, Charles Lamb, Thomas De Quincey,
Richard Rodriguez, Oscar Wilde, Scott Russell Sanders,
Joyce Carol Oates, Alice Walker, David Sedaris, and
Wendell Barry. However, contributions of less canonical
“literary” essayists also have a place in the course and may come from opinion pages in newspapers and magazines, personal blogs, and organizational websites.
POPULAR CULTURE TEXTS
Because the AP English Language and Composition
course seeks to cultivate rhetorical reading skills, texts
with persuasive purposes drawn from popular culture
are suitable for inclusion in the course reading list.
Advertisements, propaganda, advice columns, television and radio talk shows and interviews,
newspaper columns, cartoons, political commentaries, documentary films, TED Talks, and YouTube videos

are only a few examples of texts that represent
contributions to public discussion of consequential topics and questions.
IMAGINATIVE LITERATURE
Although public conversations about consequential topics and questions never unfold exclusively in
poetry, short stories, novels, and plays, these forms
of imaginative literature often play a part in public discussion. Since the AP English Language and Composition course emphasizes argumentation and
rhetorical analysis, works of imaginative literature are
appropriate for use in the course only if they were
composed to accomplish a rhetorical purpose (e.g.,
George Herbert’s carpe diem poetry, George Orwell’s
Animal Farm, Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle) or are
excerpts that enact particular rhetorical functions
within literary texts (e.g., Marc Antony’s “I Come to Bury
Caesar” speech in Julius Caesar).
Images as Texts
Writing teachers have expanded their understanding
of texts to include more than written words. Teachers of writing imagine how images, among other modes
of communication, should be taught and included as
part of authentic composing processes and contexts.
Historically, visual texts predate alphabetic literacies;
however, composing with images is ubiquitous in
almost all writing contexts outside of school, where the
double-spaced, one-inch-margin essay containing only
written words is still the dominant genre. In order to
prepare students for writing contexts outside of school,
writing teachers are expanding their notion of literacy
to include a larger range of texts and technologies. In the AP English Language and Composition course, students should learn to analyze and evaluate the
rhetorical use of images, graphics, video, film, and design components of print- and web-based texts.
Visual texts are most commonly understood as images
that either stand alone or can be combined with other
modalities to communicate much like written texts.
Images can be used to make or support arguments,
as in the case of editorial cartoons or photographic
journalism. Other images such as charts, graphs, and
tables are effective in presenting large amounts of
information in ways that make it accessible to readers.
Such images are also particularly good at showing or suggesting cause-and-effect relationships or
comparisons that can be meaningful to contemporary
audiences. A quick internet search of “infographics” yields a wide range of creative ways to present
information, and 21st-century writers with increasing
access to imaging software have the ability to create high-quality visuals to accompany written texts.
Images are not the only alternative to written texts
finding their way into writing classrooms. Gunther Kress and the New London School2 are famous for coining
the term multiliteracies and advocating an approach
to communication that includes written, visual, oral, gestural, spatial, and multimodal communication.
Kress claims that these modalities do not all function the same way; they are not interchangeable, and he challenges us to consider how authentic
communication in the world draws on different modes to communicate a message. Therefore, classroom
writing assignments that focus exclusively on written texts ignore other commonly available means of
persuasion and provide too limited a range of texts for students who need a much broader understanding of communication to function in the world.
Written texts without images still have a visual component because writers are often charged with
considering how the layout and design of the page will
affect audiences. Layout and design elements include
fonts, text size, spacing, color, margins, and paper
size and shape. While random or nonstrategic use of
these features can be distracting, rhetorical choices of
layout and design can be an important tool for writers
of authentic texts and should be connected with genre and audience expectations.

Argumentation
While the AP English Language and Composition
course should offer students several opportunities
to write in a variety of modes of discourse, teachers should allow a significant amount of time to
foster student understanding of the intricacies of
argumentation through critical thinking experiences that allow students to:
§§ Read and analyze different kinds of arguments (definitional arguments, arguments of evaluation, causal arguments, proposals).
§§ Examine different structures of argumentative writing (classical argument, Rogerian argument,
Toulmin argument) that help move an argument forward.3
§§ Analyze the unique rhetorical features of arguments that demonstrate how language performs social action that accomplishes particular purposes or
intents. Such features include appeals (e.g., ethos,
pathos, logos), structural choices (e.g., inductive vs. deductive reasoning, author’s purpose), and argumentative moves (e.g., concession, rebuttal).
§§ Examine the appropriateness of using different
kinds of evidence to support a claim. Such evidence could include anecdotes and observations, facts
and statistics from experts in a variety of fields of study, arguments of respected authorities, other outside sources, or personal experience.
§§ Assess the critical role of audience in writing an effective argument. Students need to learn to challenge their own assertions and to provide
substantial evidence to explain and justify a position to an often skeptical audience.
§§ Effectively synthesize information and perspectives from research sources to enter an intellectual conversation and develop one’s own position on the topic.
§§ Develop the habit of thinking about argument as a way to participate in a conversation of an
unresolved question, instead of engaging the issue as an adversary.4
The goal is for students to construct a clear, rhetorically sound argument that supports an assertion with
convincing evidence, using a structure that advances the argument logically and persuasively.

Synthesis
The rhetorical analysis of multiple sources in the inquiry process we know as research presents the
same demands as the rhetorical analysis of a single
speech, letter, or essay, with one large exception:
the development of a much fuller context. While the
analysis of a single text in isolation certainly benefits
from an understanding of the context in which it was composed and published or delivered, the analysis of multiple sources in concert with one another broadens the context, provided that these sources
represent different, often opposing, stakeholders in a given situation.
The synthesis process may serve various purposes.
For example, synthesis may lead to an evaluation of a
particular decision, or it may generate an argument for
one of several possible options. Alternatively, synthesis may produce not an argument or a judgment but a
more comprehensive understanding of the question or
problem. This explanatory (or Rogerian) use of synthesis
yields a deeper appreciation of the complexity of the
topic under examination. Students performing this type
of synthesis may conclude by considering the factors,
perspectives, investments, and so forth that underlie
discussions of a controversial topic. Because synthesis
serves a multitude of purposes, synthesis tasks in the AP English Language and Composition course
may assume a variety of forms, such as submitting a
proposal, developing an original definition, or creating an appropriate plan.
How students approach synthesis depends largely
on their ability to read texts rhetorically. By fully
understanding relationships among writers, audiences,
and purposes, students will recognize writers of the
sources they consult as participants in conversations
about specific questions. Additionally, students will
discover that by attending to a variety of viewpoints
and arguments they develop a critical and informed
understanding of the controversy and gain the authority
to enter the conversation themselves. Students will find that the sources they consult may agree with
one another on some points but not on others; that
they may represent different perspectives, values, and assumptions; and that they may support or
supplement one another or call one another’s positions into question.
There are three distinct manifestations of synthesis:
§§ Source-based synthesis: Body paragraphs feature sources in conversation with one another. Sources
agree with, disagree with, or qualify each other, and such an approach toward synthesis is recognizable for both writers and readers. Typically, these sources align based upon content or position.
§§ Conceptual synthesis: Students determine the
key factors, concepts, or categories of a particular issue. They may see, for example, that one source is representative of a Keynesian approach toward economics, or that another source represents a more conservative or liberal approach toward a topic. Typically, such writers have had prior
experience in the process of rhetorical invention.
§§ Synthesis of voice: Writers have adopted the vernacular and cadence of those involved with the existing conversation.
The following are suggested steps for engaging students in the synthesis process.
Step 1: Authentic Inquiry
Synthesis of sources should be a process of authentic inquiry motivated by questions for which readers genuinely want answers, not by desire to affirm
preexisting positions. While it is entirely possible, and perhaps even worthwhile, for readers to commence
research with some inclination or predisposition about
a given topic, successful synthesis means proceeding
with an open mind and finding an array of sources that
satisfactorily broadens the context of one’s research
question. Part of authentic inquiry is an understanding
of rhetorical invention, or the processes by which students—while they are thinking and reading—
determine how the issues they are examining can be viewed from multiple perspectives.

Instructional Approaches V.1 | 89
AP English Language and Composition Course and Exam Description

=== Page 97 ===
What students experience in responding to the synthesis question on the AP English Language and
Composition exam is not authentic inquiry; the source materials that accompany the prompt may be seen
as products of authentic inquiry representing multiple
perspectives that students must consider and weigh against one another—or synthesize—in order to
compose a response that is informed by the sources
and situated in the conversation they represent. To
promote authentic inquiry in the AP English Language and Composition classroom, teachers should offer
students the experience of creating authentic original questions, searching for answers, and developing informed responses to these questions. Students
should have the experience of entering into unfamiliar
conversations: Transformative research encourages
students to change or develop their positions, while
transactional research merely affirms the opinions that students already hold.
Step 2: Linking the Sources
In source-informed argument, the predominant (though
by no means only) mode of college writing, effective
synthesis begins with understanding others’ positions,
views, or arguments. Students should comprehend the
major claims in the texts they consult, understand how
these claims are substantiated, and identify how they might appeal to intended or unintended audiences.
Students then need to know how to develop their own
original arguments by acknowledging and responding
to the claims they’ve encountered in their sources.
Students should be careful to avoid misattributing claims or oversimplifying an argument. Such an
approach reflects a superficial reading of the sources
or a refusal to consider points of view that conflict with a writer’s preconceived position.
Step 3: The Source-Informed
Argument
Strong arguments developed through synthesis of
multiple sources generally exhibit the following qualities:
§§ Sophistication of thought: Sometimes referred to as complexity, sophistication means looking at multiple perspectives, arguments and counter arguments, and broader implications of particular events or decisions. Implications of arguments or positions are important for students to consider, as they often rely upon hypothetical examples abstracted from the real world of cause and effect; the challenge for students is to present
implications as concretely as possible, based upon available evidence.
§§ Effectiveness (development) of argument: The completeness of an argument’s development enhances its persuasiveness. Such development
may mean an in-depth analysis of a few sources or a broad review of a wide range of sources.
§§ Unity/coherence: Coherent, or unified, arguments—with or without sources—develop logically; the writer’s own position emerges from a thoughtful consideration of the sources. An important marker of coherence is the use of idea based transitions, often topic sentences of body paragraphs that move the argument forward in ways
alluded to in “sophistication of thought.” Another
marker of coherence is the careful selection of the sources that “speak to one another.” A coherent approach to synthesis requires students to consider the conversation among sources rather than regarding individual sources in isolation.

Developing Course Skills
Throughout the course, students will develop skills that are fundamental to the
discipline of rhetoric. Since these skill categories represent the complex skills that
adept rhetoricians demonstrate, students will benefit from multiple opportunities
to develop these skills in a scaffolded manner. Skills in this course are organized by
reading and writing, and students can benefit from opportunities to write about the
texts they read and read texts that emulate the kind of writing they want to develop.
Furthermore, throughout the course, students should engage in all stages of the
writing process to develop proficiency in course composition skills, to deepen their
understanding of writing as a recursive process, and to build their ability to think
critically about their own and others’ writing in order to make writerly choices.
Big Idea: Rhetorical Situation
Individuals write within a particular situation and make strategic writing choices based on that situation.
The table that follows provides examples of questions to guide students’ exploration
of rhetorical situations. (Note: The texts referenced in this section are not course
requirements but are used here simply to offer a context for examples.)
Skill Category 1: Rhetorical Situation – Reading Explain how writers’ choices reflect the components of the rhetorical situation.
Skills
Key Questions
Sample Instructional Activity
1.A: Identify and describe components of the rhetorical
situation: the exigence, audience, writer, purpose, context, and message.
§§ Who or what is the writer, audience, message, purpose, and context that comprise this rhetorical situation?
§§ What provoked or inspired the writer to develop this text?
§§ What is the writer’s purpose for developing this text?
§§ How does the writer consider the rhetorical situation when crafting their message?
§§ What perspectives on the subject might the audience have due to their shared and/or individual beliefs, values, needs, and backgrounds?
§§ How do the writer’s choices in the text reflect both the constraints and the available means of persuasion within the context?
§§ How do the writer’s rhetorical choices in the introduction and/or conclusion not only reflect their purpose and context but also address the intended audience’s needs and perspective on the subject?
Lead students through a guided reading of Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Letter from a Birmingham Jail,” but first provide them with a brief historical reading about the 1963 Birmingham Campaign and King’s incarceration. Then provide students with “A Call for Unity,” the open letter in the Birmingham News that King read while in jail. Ask students to begin analyzing “Letter from a Birmingham
Jail” by identifying and describing the writer, audience, message, purpose, exigence, genre, and context of the text, using evidence from the text as support.

2.A: Write introductions and conclusions appropriate to the purpose and context of the rhetorical situation.
§§ What are the components of your rhetorical situation?
§§ What are the particular circumstances of the context in which you write, and how do these circumstances inform your writing choices?
§§ What are your audience’s knowledge, beliefs, values, and perspective regarding the subject?
§§ What is your relationship with the audience, and how do you want the audience to perceive you?
§§ What is the relationship between your introduction and conclusion and your thesis?
§§ Will presenting your thesis in the introduction or conclusion more effectively accomplish your purposes?
§§ When writing an introduction to an argument, which rhetorical choices might you make to orient, engage, and/or focus the audience?
§§ What are the boundaries placed on the writing choices you can make in your context?
§§ When writing a conclusion to an argument, which rhetorical choices might you make to engage and/or focus the audience?
§§ What should your introduction and conclusion accomplish?
Before students write introductions for arguments, ask them to engage in prewriting activities in which they consider their audience’s familiarity with the subject, and the purpose(s) the students are trying to accomplish through their introductions.
Then, have them draft introductions that consider the audience and the students’ purposes.
For example, if you ask students to write an article about the value of social media, a student might decide to write an opinion article for their school newspaper about the effects of social media on teenagers. She might brainstorm what she knows about her audience—her high school student body—and determine that because her audience is so familiar with the subject of her argument, in her introduction she will juxtapose an anecdote of typical social media use that her audience will find relatable and a statistic that her audience might find surprising.
This would engage her audience while also illustrating the conflict surrounding social media use.

Key Questions
Sample Instructional Activity
2.B: Demonstrate an understanding of an audience’s beliefs, values, or needs.
§§ Who is the intended audience of your argument?
§§ What do you know or assume about your audience’s values, beliefs, needs, and background, particularly as they relate to the subject of your argument?
§§ What rhetorical choices might you make to achieve your purpose and relate to your audience’s emotions and values?
§§ In your argument, how might you seek to persuade or motivate action though appeals—the modes of persuasion?
§§ How might you make comparisons (e.g., similes, metaphors, analogies, or anecdotes) that your audience will understand in order to relate to them and advance your purposes?
§§ What diction and syntax choices should you make in order to influence not only how your audience perceives you but also the degree to which they may accept your argument?
§§ How do you choose words that increase your credibility with a particular audience?
§§ How do you recognize your own biases and then make word choices in your argument in consideration of those biases?
Before students begin writing arguments, ask them to engage in prewriting exercises in which they identify what they know and assume about the audiences for whom they write.
For example, the student writing about the value of social media might consider her audience—her high school student body—and determine that she will write the article in a more conversational style but avoid unnecessary slang in order to emphasize the seriousness of the issue and to establish a persona of authority on the subject. She might also decide not to define social media terms that her peers would already understand because they use social media extensively.

Big Idea: Claims and Evidence
Writers make claims about subjects, rely on evidence that supports the reasoning
that justifies the claim, and often acknowledge or respond to other, possibly opposing, arguments.
The table that follows provides examples of questions to guide students’ exploration
of claims and evidence. (Note: The text referenced in this section is not a course
requirement but is used here simply to offer a context for examples.) continued on next page
Skill Category 3: Claims and Evidence – Reading Identify and describe the claims and evidence of an argument.
Skills
Key Questions
Sample Instructional Activity
3.A: Identify and explain claims and evidence within an argument.
§§ What claim does the writer attempt to defend, and how does that claim convey the writer’s position on the subject?
§§ Where in the text does the writer establish a claim?
§§ How does the writer use particular sentences and words to establish a claim?
§§ What kind of evidence (e.g., facts, anecdotes, analogies, statistics, examples, details, illustrations, expert opinions, personal observations, personal experiences, testimony, or experiments) does the writer use to defend their claim?
§§ How does the writer’s choice of evidence reflect the rhetorical situation and advance their purposes?
§§ What is the function (e.g., to illustrate, to clarify, to set a mood, to provide an example, to associate, to amplify or qualify a point) of particular evidence in the writer’s argument, and how do they convey that function?
§§ How does the writer’s commentary establish a logical relationship between evidence and the claim it supports?
§§ How and why does the writer consider, explain, and integrate others’ arguments into their own argument?
§§ How does the writer acknowledge others’ intellectual property in their argument?
§§ How does a writer’s consideration of a source’s credibility or reliability and the use of that source in the writer’s argument affect both the writer’s credibility and their argument’s persuasiveness?
When examining “Letter from a Birmingham
Jail,” have students determine the kind of evidence King uses when referencing
St. Thomas Aquinas and Adolph Hitler when discussing just and unjust laws.
Then ask students to analyze how the evidence King uses reflects his rhetorical situation and supports his claim about the distinction between just and unjust laws.

Key Questions
Sample Instructional Activity
3.B: Identify and describe the overarching thesis of an argument, and any indication it provides of the argument’s structure.
§§ What is the writer’s thesis (i.e., the main, overarching claim they seek to defend or prove by using reasoning supported by evidence)?
§§ Is the writer’s thesis explicitly stated in the argument, or is it implicit?
§§ How does the writer’s thesis reflect their position and perspective on the subject?
§§ How does the writer’s syntactical and word choices in their thesis reflect their rhetorical situation and the scope of their argument?
§§ How does the writer’s thesis preview their argument’s line of reasoning?
§§ Where in the argument does the writer present their thesis, and why might they have chosen this particular placement?
After reading “Letter from a Birmingham
Jail,” have students work in small groups and articulate King’s thesis. In those same small groups, have students return to the text to evaluate whether the thesis they proposed adequately represents his overarching claim for the entire letter.
During this small-group discussion, students may revise their initial articulation of King’s thesis. Next, students should examine the text to determine whether King presents an explicit thesis statement that resembles the group’s thesis or whether
King’s thesis is implicit. Ask students to mark the text if they find a statement in King’s argument that resembles the thesis that the group articulated. Finally, have small groups share their observations with the whole group, and the entire class participates in a discussion to reach a consensus on King’s thesis and how it is presented in the text.
3.C: Explain ways claims are qualified through modifiers, counterarguments, and alternative perspectives.
§§ What is the scope of the writer’s claim?
§§ How does the writer contextualize the claim by establishing boundaries or limitations?
§§ How does the writer select modifiers— specific words, phrases, or clauses—to qualify claims?
§§ To what degree does the writer’s claim support, complement, or contrast with others’ claims on this subject?
§§ How does the writer respond to an ongoing conversation about a subject?
§§ How and why does the writer concede, rebut, and/or refute another’s claim?
§§ How might conceding, rebutting, and/ or refuting alternative perspectives on a subject affect the writer’s credibility?
Have students analyze “Letter from a
Birmingham Jail” to:
§§ Identify where King addresses others’ claim about “outsiders coming in” to protest.
§§ Determine whether King’s argument supports, complements, or contrasts with others’ claim about “outsiders coming in” to protest.
§§ Analyze how and why, through concession, rebuttal, or refutation, King chooses to respond to others’ claim about “outsiders coming in” to protest.

Skill Category 4: Claims and Evidence – Writing Analyze and select evidence to develop and refine a claim.
Skills
Key Questions
Sample Instructional Activity
4.A: Develop a paragraph that includes a claim and evidence supporting the claim.
§§ What claim are you attempting to defend, and how does that claim convey your position on the subject?
§§ Where in your argument might you establish a claim?
§§ How might you use particular sentences and words to establish a claim?
§§ What kind of evidence (e.g., facts, anecdotes, analogies, statistics, examples, details, illustrations, expert opinions, personal observations, personal experiences, testimony, or experiments) might you use to defend your claim?
§§ How does your choice of evidence reflect the rhetorical situation and advance your purposes?
§§ What is the function (e.g., to illustrate, to clarify, to set a mood, to provide an example, to associate, to amplify or qualify a point) of particular evidence in your argument, and how do you convey that function?
§§ How does your commentary establish a logical relationship between evidence and the claim it supports?
§§ How and why might you consider, explain, and integrate others’ arguments into your own argument?
§§ How might you acknowledge others’ intellectual property in your argument?
§§ How might your consideration of a source’s credibility or reliability and the use of that source in your argument affect both your credibility and your argument’s persuasiveness?
To help students establish a position on the subject of their arguments and develop a claim, guide them in generating questions that provoke their critical thinking about the subject. Then guide them to developing a claim and selecting evidence that defends it.
For example, the student writing about the value of social media might generate and answer questions about the value of social media, how she and her peers think about and use social media, and the effects of social media use on various aspects of her life and that of her peers.
Then, the student might decide to claim that social media is detrimental to teenagers’ self-esteem. The student’s own experiences with social media, observations from the experiences of other students at her high school, and research on the subject inform her establishment of this claim and serve as potential evidence to defend it.

Key Questions
Sample Instructional Activity
4.B: Write a thesis statement that requires proof or defense and that may preview the structure of the argument.
§§ What is your perspective on the subject?
§§ How do you consider your perspective on the subject and narrow ideas to establish a position on the subject?
§§ How can you consider your perspective and position on a subject to develop a thesis (i.e., the main, overarching claim you seek to defend or prove by using reasoning supported by evidence)?
§§ How do you develop a thesis of appropriate scope for the rhetorical situation and avoid oversimplifying complex subjects?
§§ What syntactical and word choices might you make to develop a thesis statement?
§§ How might you preview your argument’s line of reasoning in your thesis statement?
§§ Where might you strategically present your thesis statement in your argument?
§§ How might you revise your thesis statement in light of new evidence?
To prepare students for writing thesis statements, guide them through a variety of prewriting strategies, such as brainstorming, a quickwrite, or generating questions, to gather ideas for developing a thesis statement that conveys their overarching claim. Next, ask students to highlight ideas and parts of ideas that they think should be included in their thesis statements. Then have them synthesize the highlighted ideas into one or more sentences to create their thesis statement.
For example, the student writing about social media might develop the following
thesis statement: Social media proves to be a negative influence on teenagers.
4.C: Qualify a claim using modifiers, counterarguments, or alternative perspectives.
§§ What is the scope of your claim?
§§ In what context(s) is your argument plausible?
§§ How might you contextualize your claim by establishing boundaries or limitations?
§§ How might you select modifiers— specific words, phrases, or clauses— to qualify your claim?
§§ To what degree does your claim support, complement, or contrast with others’ claims on this subject?
§§ How do you respond to an ongoing conversation about a subject?
§§ How and why might you concede, rebut, and/or refute another’s claim?
§§ How might conceding, rebutting, and/ or refuting alternative perspectives on a subject affect your credibility?
Have students draft portions of their argument and engage in a peer review focusing on the scope of their claims.
For example, the student writing about social media might receive feedback from a peer indicating that the scope of her claim seems too narrow and doesn’t consider or respond to clearly beneficial influences of social media on teenagers’ social behavior.
The student then qualifies her claim and revises the thesis statement to the following:
Although many individuals would like to claim that social media is either beneficial or detrimental to teenagers, social media’s influence on teenagers is both positive and negative because it merely amplifies the positive and negative social interactions that exist already.

Big Idea: Reasoning and Organization
Writers guide understanding of a text’s line of reasoning and claims through that text’s organization and integration of evidence.
The table that follows provides examples of questions to guide students’ exploration
of reasoning and organization. (Note: The text referenced in this section is not
a course requirement but is used here simply to offer a context for examples.)
Skill Category 5: Reasoning and Organization – Reading Describe the reasoning, organization, and development of an argument.
Skills
Key Questions
Sample Instructional Activity
5.A: Describe the line of reasoning and explain whether it supports an argument’s overarching thesis.
§§ What premise(s) does the writer explicitly communicate, and how does the premise fit into a logical progression of ideas that justifies the thesis?
§§ Does the writer’s reasoning proceed from an established claim, or does the reasoning advance toward a claim?
§§ How does the writer’s reasoning through commentary logically connect chosen evidence to a claim?
§§ How does a particular body paragraph not only establish relationships among the claim, evidence, and commentary but also contribute to the reasoning of the writer’s argument?
§§ How does the writer’s sequencing of paragraphs reveal the argument’s line of reasoning?
§§ Does the writer demonstrate any flaws in their reasoning, and if so, how does this flawed reasoning affect the argument?
§§ To what degree does the writer’s quantity and quality of evidence provide apt support for their line of reasoning?
Have students analyze King’s “Letter from a Birmingham Jail” to trace the progression of ideas that create a distinction between just and unjust laws. Then ask them to analyze how King’s reasoning about the differences between just and unjust laws justifies his claim that one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.

Key Questions
Sample Instructional Activity
5.B: Explain how the organization of a text creates unity and coherence and reflects a line of reasoning.
§§ How does the writer organize and arrange their ideas to develop a coherent argument?
§§ How does the writer use repetition, synonyms, pronoun references, or parallel structure to indicate or develop a relationship between elements of a text?
§§ How does the writer use transitional elements (e.g., words, phrases, clauses, sentences, or paragraphs) to show relationships among ideas and create coherence among sentences, paragraphs, or sections of their argument?
§§ How does the writer achieve coherence at different levels of their argument:
clause, sentence, paragraph, section, etc.?
§§ How does the writer use transitional elements to introduce evidence or indicate its relationship to other ideas or evidence?
After reading “Letter from a Birmingham
Jail,” have students chunk the text into several sections, choosing sections according to how ideas seem to work together or seem to be achieving the same purpose. Then ask them to analyze the argumentative function of each section and determine how the organization reflects the reasoning of King’s argument and demonstrates coherence among the sections.
5.C: Recognize and explain the use of methods of development to accomplish a purpose.
§§ Which method(s) of development does the writer select to develop their ideas?
§§ How and why does the writer select and use a particular method of development to advance their purpose?
§§ What is the relationship between the method of develop a writer uses and their line of reasoning?
§§ How does the writer organize ideas when using a particular method of development?
Have students use “Letter from a
Birmingham Jail” to identify methods of development that King uses throughout his argument, such as using comparison when King likens himself to the Apostle
Paul and classification to differentiate just from unjust laws. As students identify a method of development that King employs, they should analyze why King selects the method of development to accomplish his purpose (e.g., drawing a distinction between just and unjust laws advances King’s purpose of persuading the clergymen that segregation is an unjust law worthy of defying). They should also analyze how he uses the method of development to do so (e.g., by describing characteristics and qualities of just and unjust laws and using various relevant examples to illustrate those attributes, King advances his purpose of persuading the clergymen that segregation is an unjust law worthy of defying).

Skill Category 6: Reasoning and Organization – Writing Use organization and commentary
to illuminate the line of reasoning in an argument.
Skills
Key Questions
Sample Instructional Activity
6.A: Develop a line of reasoning and commentary that explains it throughout an argument.
§§ What premise(s) might you explicitly communicate, and how might the premise fit into a logical progression of ideas that justifies your thesis?
§§ What premise(s) should you implicitly communicate or leave unsaid because you assume the audience knows are shares it?
§§ How do you address the subject’s complexities in your reasoning and avoid oversimplifications and generalizations?
§§ Does your reasoning proceed from an established claim, or does your reasoning advance toward a claim?
§§ How does the reasoning in your commentary logically connect chosen evidence to a claim?
§§ How does a particular body paragraph not only establish relationships among the claim, evidence, and commentary but also contribute to the reasoning of your argument?
§§ How might you sequence the paragraphs of your argument to enhance your line of reasoning?
§§ How might you evaluate your reasoning to avoid flaws that might negatively affect an audience’s acceptance of your argument?
§§ To what degree do the quantity and quality of your evidence provide apt support for your line of reasoning?
After a guided-writing activity in which you demonstrate how to develop and organize a line of reasoning for an argument, have students use a graphic organizer to develop ideas for their reasoning. Then ask them to consider the organization of that reasoning.
For example, after a particular guided writing activity, a student might determine to lead readers through their reasoning and present the thesis statement near the end of a piece. In that case, have the student develop an outline, organizing their reasoning and rearranging ideas so that they proceed logically and conclude with the thesis statement.

6.B: Use transitional elements to guide the reader through the line of reasoning of an argument.
§§ How might you organize and arrange your ideas to develop a coherent argument?
§§ How might you use repetition, synonyms, pronoun references, or parallel structure to indicate or develop a relationship between elements of a text?
§§ How might you select and use transitional elements (e.g., words, phrases, clauses, sentences, or paragraphs) to show relationships among ideas and create coherence among sentences, paragraphs, or sections of your argument?
§§ How might you use transitional elements to achieve coherence at different levels of your argument: clause, sentence, paragraph, section, etc.?
§§ How might you use transitional elements to introduce evidence or indicate its relationship to other ideas or evidence?
Ask students to work in pairs. Have them read their peer’s argument aloud while the writer listens to ensure that the argument is coherent throughout, identifying any sections of the argument that seem misplaced or disjointed by marking those places in the draft. Then ask students to revise their drafts on their own and add transitional elements and conjunctions or rearrange sentences to better convey coherent relationships among ideas.
For example, the student writing about social media might decide she wants to transition from commentary about a series of statistics to her claim that social media can diminish one’s self-esteem. She wants a transition that establishes that her claim is a conclusion based on her reasoning about the statistical evidence. As a result, the student selects the word therefore as a transition between her commentary and claim.
6.C: Use appropriate methods of development to advance an argument.
§§ Considering your line of reasoning, which methods of development might you use to develop your ideas and advance your purposes?
§§ How do you organize your ideas when using particular methods of development?
Before having students draft arguments, ask them to outline their drafts and note their purposes in each section. Then ask them to consider and note which methods of development they will use to accomplish these purposes. Finally, have students note how ideas are organized when using these methods of development to offer them strategies for organizing their own ideas.
For example, the student writing about social media determines that she wants a portion of her argument to claim that social media can have positive effects.
Therefore, she uses description and cause-effect methods of development to explain how social media has helped people to organize social movements in different countries, which resulted in positive change in those countries.

Big Idea: Style
The rhetorical situation informs the strategic stylistic choices that writers make.
The table that follows provides examples of questions to guide students’ exploration
of style. (Note: The text referenced in this section is not a course requirement
but is used here simply to offer a context for examples.).
Skill Category 7: Style – Reading Explain how writers’ stylistic choices contribute to the purpose of an argument.
Skills
Key Questions
Sample Instructional Activity
7.A: Explain how word choice, comparisons, and syntax contribute to the specific tone or style of a text.
§§ How does the writer strategically choose words based on not only their denotations and connotations but also their potential effect in the rhetorical situation?
§§ How does the writer choose descriptive words and words with particular connotations to create a tone?
§§ How does the writer’s precise word choice reduce potential confusion and affect how the audience perceives the writer’s perspective?
§§ How do the word choice, syntax, and conventions employed by the writer contribute to their writing style?
§§ How does the writer’s style and tone contribute to a complex, ironic, and/or changing perspective on the subject?
When reading “Letter from a Birmingham
Jail,” ask students to analyze how King’s strategic word choices, comparisons, and syntactical choices convey his tone toward the notion of his being an “extremist.”
7.B: Explain how writers create, combine, and place independent and dependent clauses to show relationships between and among ideas.
§§ How does the writer convey main ideas through independent clauses?
§§ How does the writer convey clear relationships between ideas within and across sentences?
§§ How does the writer arrange clauses, phrases, and words to emphasize ideas?
§§ How does the writer arrange sentences in a text to emphasize ideas?
Using “Letter from a Birmingham Jail,” have students analyze how King conveys his ideas about why he is in Birmingham through his construction of independent clauses. Then ask students to analyze how
King uses coordination and subordination to combine and place details, phrases, and clauses to emphasize ideas relating to the opposing forces in the African American community regarding segregation.
7.C: Explain how grammar and mechanics contribute to the clarity and effectiveness of an argument.
§§ How does the writer use punctuation and text features to achieve a purpose and/or create an effect (e.g., clarify, organize, emphasize, indicate purpose, supplement information, contribute to a tone)?
As students read “Letter from a
Birmingham Jail,” have them trace how
King uses quotation marks in various ways throughout the text to advance specific purposes and to create specific effects.

Skill Category 8: Style – Writing Select words and use elements of composition to advance an argument.
Skills
Key Questions
Sample Instructional Activity
8.A: Strategically use words, comparisons, and syntax to convey a specific tone or style in an argument.
§§ Which words might you choose in your argument after considering not only the words’ denotations and connotations but also their potential effect in the rhetorical situation?
§§ How might you choose descriptive words and words with particular connotations to create a tone?
§§ How might more precise word choices reduce potential confusion and affect how the audience perceives your perspective?
§§ How do the word choices, syntax, and conventions that you employ contribute to your writing style?
§§ How do your style and tone contribute to your complex, ironic, and/or changing perspective on the subject?
Review students’ arguments to provide feedback on whether the language they chose appropriately reflects their rhetorical situations.
For example, in the case of the student writing about the value of social media, you might review her draft and identify a couple of places where she could reconsider her word choice. As a result, the student might agree that her audience could find her tone too harsh, and substitute a few word choices to soften the tone.
8.B: Write sentences that clearly convey ideas and arguments.
§§ How do you write sentences that convey a main idea?
§§ How do you convey clear relationships between ideas within and across sentences?
§§ How might you arrange clauses, phrases, and words to emphasize ideas?
§§ How might you arrange sentences in a text to emphasize ideas?
After students have written arguments and received peer feedback, have them revise their arguments, paying particular attention to whether sentences convey a main idea and how they convey clear relationships with other ideas.
For example, during a peer review of the student’s piece on social media, a fellow student comments that certain ideas in adjacent sentences seem related, but their relationships could be clearer. As a result, the writer edits the sentences, coordinating them to clarify the relationship.

8.C: Use established conventions of grammar and mechanics to communicate clearly and effectively.
§§ How might you use punctuation and text features to achieve a purpose and/or create an effect (e.g., clarify, organize, emphasize, indicate purpose, supplement information, contribute to a tone)?
Give students a checklist of writing considerations to evaluate and have them proofread their arguments carefully to ensure that ideas are presented clearly and that the arguments use punctuation to communicate clearly.
For example, the student writing about social media knows this evaluation is an important step before publishing her article. She wants her peers and other students in the school and beyond to respect her perspective on social media, so she carefully evaluates and proofreads her argument to identify and correct any errors in punctuation that might hinder communication due to unclear relationships between ideas. Also, she identifies an opportunity in her argument to emphasize an idea by revising a sentence so that it employs a dash.

The second section of the AP English Language and Composition Exam includes three questions.
FREE-RESPONSE QUESTION 1: SYNTHESIS
Free-response question 1 presents students with six to seven sources organized
around a specific topic. Two of the provided sources are visual, including at least one
quantitative source. The remaining sources are text-based excerpts containing about
500 words per source. Students are asked to write an essay that synthesizes material
from at least three of the provided sources and develops their own position on the
topic. This question assesses students’ ability to do the following:
§§ Respond to the prompt with a thesis that may establish a line of reasoning.
§§ Provide evidence from at least three of the provided sources to support the
thesis. Indicate clearly the sources used through direct quotation, paraphrase,
or summary. Sources may be cited as Source A, Source B, etc., or by using the description in parentheses.
§§ Explain the relationship between the evidence and the thesis.
§§ Demonstrate an understanding of the rhetorical situation.
§§ Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating the argument.
All Synthesis essay questions will be worded in a similar way. A sample question and the stable prompt wording are provided below.
Sample Question
Eminent domain is the power governments have to acquire property from private
owners for public use. The rationale behind eminent domain is that governments
have greater legal authority over lands within their dominion than do private owners.
Eminent domain has been instituted in one way or another throughout the world for hundreds of years.
Carefully read the following six sources, including the introductory information for each
source. Write an essay that synthesizes material from at least three of the sources and
develops your position on the notion that eminent domain is productive and beneficial.

Sample Exam
Questions
The sample exam questions that follow illustrate the relationship between the course
framework and the AP English Language and Composition Exam and serve as examples
of the types of questions that appear on the exam. After the sample questions is an answer
key and alignment table that shows how the questions relate to the course framework.
Section I: Multiple-Choice
The first set of questions assess reading skills and the second set of questions assess writing skills.
Questions 1–8 refer to the passage below.
The following passage is an excerpt from a speech delivered by a leading women’s rights activist in 1913.
If I were a man and I said to you, “I come from a country which professes to have representative
institutions and yet denies me, a taxpayer, an inhabitant
of the country, representative rights,” you would at once
understand that that human being, being a man, was
justified in the adoption of revolutionary methods to get
representative institutions. But since I am a woman it is
necessary in the twentieth century to explain why women
have adopted revolutionary methods in order to win the rights of citizenship.
You see, in spite of a good deal that we hear about
revolutionary methods not being necessary for American
women, because American women are so well off, most of
the men of the United States quite calmly acquiesce in
the fact that half of the community are deprived absolutely
of citizen rights, and we women, in trying to make
our case clear, always have to make as part of our
argument, and urge upon men in our audience the fact— a very simple fact—that women are human beings.
It is quite evident you do not all realize we are human beings
or it would not be necessary to argue with you that women
may, suffering from intolerable injustice, be driven
to adopt revolutionary methods. We have, first of all to convince you we are human beings, and I hope to
be able to do that in the course of the evening before
I sit down, but before doing that, I want to put a few
political arguments before you—not arguments for the suffrage,* because I said when I opened, I didn’t mean to do that—but arguments for the adoption of
militant methods in order to win political rights.

A great many of you have been led to believe, from
the somewhat meager accounts you get in the newspapers,
that in England there is a strange manifestation taking
place, a new form of hysteria being swept across part of
the feminist population of those Isles, and this manifestation
takes the shape of irresponsible breaking of windows,
burning of letters, general inconvenience to respectable,
honest business people who want to attend to their
business. It is very irrational you say: even if these
women had sufficient intelligence to understand what
they were doing, and really did want the vote, they have
adopted very irrational means for getting the vote. “How are
they going to persuade people that they ought to have
the vote by breaking their windows?” you say. Now, if
you say that, it shows you do not understand the meaning
of our revolution at all, and I want to show you that
when damage is done to property it is not done in order
to convert people to woman suffrage at all. It is a practical
political means, the only means we consider open to
voteless persons to bring about a political situation, which can only be solved by giving women the vote.
Suppose the men of Hartford had a grievance, and
they laid that grievance before their legislature, and the
legislature obstinately refused to listen to them, or to
remove their grievance, what would be the proper and
the constitutional and the practical way of getting their
grievance removed? Well, it is perfectly obvious at the next
general election, when the legislature is elected, the men of Hartford in sufficient numbers would turn out
that legislature and elect a new one: entirely change
the personnel of an obstinate legislature which would
not remove their grievance. It is perfectly simple and
perfectly easy for voting communities to get their
grievances removed if they act in combination and make
an example of the legislature by changing the composition
of the legislature and sending better people to take the place of those who have failed to do justice.
But let the men of Hartford imagine that they were
not in the position of being voters at all, that they were governed without their consent being obtained,
that the legislature turned an absolutely deaf ear to their demands, what would the men of Hartford do then?
They couldn’t vote the legislature out. They would have to
choose; they would have to make a choice of two evils:
they would either have to submit indefinitely to an unjust
state of affairs, or they would have to rise up and adopt
some of the antiquated means by which men in the past got their grievances remedied.

Questions 9–17 are based on the following passage.
The passage below is a draft.
(1) After an unsuccessful search, NASA determined that instead of following
a trajectory that would allow the Orbiter to enter orbit around Mars, it
came too close to the planet, causing it to enter and disintegrate in Mars’s
atmosphere. (2) The culprit was a discrepancy in the software that controlled
the spacecraft’s thrusters: one team of engineers had calculated the force
needed from the thrusters in pounds, an imperial unit, while another team calculated the force in newtons, a metric unit.
(3) The Orbiter mission failure is just one reason, albeit an extremely
expensive one, that the United States needs to abandon future Mars
survey missions. (4) Most of the world uses the metric system, a decimal
measurement system that allows for simple scaling and calculations by
adding the relevant prefixes: one kilometer, for example, is 1,000 meters, and
one kilogram is 1,000 grams. (5) The imperial measurement system used
in the United States assigns values haphazardly: one mile is 5,280 feet long, while one pound is 16 ounces.
(6) The United States is one of only three countries—the others are Liberia
and Myanmar—that have not fully adopted the metric system. (7) Not only
are conversion errors such as the Orbiter one costly, they can be deadly.
(8) Wrong dosing of medicine due to unit confusion (teaspoons versus
milliliters) results in trips to the emergency room each year. (9) Switching to
the metric system would also benefit United States industries; the European
Union, for example, has been requiring its member states to standardize their metric systems since 1971.
(10)	Converting to metric may seem difficult, but the United States already
uses it more than you might think, from races (that 5K you’re running) to
soft drinks (that 2-liter bottle you bought) to high school science classes
(those 250-milliliter beakers you used in chemistry). (11) It’s time for the
United States to make the leap to metric in everything else it measures.
9.	 Which of the following sentences, if placed before sentence 1, would both
capture the audience’s interest and provide the most effective introduction to the topic of the paragraph?
(A)	NASA’s Mars Climate Orbiter was launched on December 11, 1998, from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.
(B)	 On September 23, 1999, NASA officials were aghast when the $125 million
Mars Climate Orbiter vanished as it prepared to enter the red planet’s orbit.
(C)	 As part of a new set of missions intended to survey the planet Mars, the
Mars Climate Orbiter was launched by NASA scientists to study Mars’s climate and weather.
(D)	When NASA officials lost contact with their Mars Climate Orbiter on
September 23, 1999, they immediately instigated a search for the spacecraft
using NASA’s Deep Space Network of radio antennae.
(E)	 The Mars Climate Orbiter carried two instruments when it attempted and
failed to enter Mars’s orbit in September, 1999: the Mars Climate Orbiter Color
Imager (MARCI) and the Pressure Modulated Infrared Radiometer (PMIRR).

10.	 In sentence 2 (reproduced below), the writer wants an effective transition from
the introductory paragraph to the main idea of the passage.

The culprit was a discrepancy in the software that controlled the spacecraft’s
thrusters: one team of engineers had calculated the force needed from the thrusters
in pounds, an imperial unit, while another team calculated the force in newtons, a metric unit.

Which of the following versions of the underlined text best achieves this purpose?
(A)	(as it is now)
(B)	 thrusters; the data from the spacecraft and the data from NASA’s computers
on the ground had not been matching up for months since the launch of the Orbiter
(C)	 thrusters (two different engineering teams—one from Lockheed Martin
Astronautics and another from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory—had
worked on creating different parts of the software)
(D)	thrusters—software that was used to calculate the trajectory the Orbiter
needed to take in order to enter Mars’s orbit successfully
(E)	 thrusters: four thrusters were used for trajectory correction maneuvers as
well as pitch and yaw control, while another four were used for roll control
11.	 In sentence 3 (reproduced below), which of the following versions of the
underlined text best establishes the writer’s position on the main argument of the passage?

The Orbiter mission failure is just one reason, albeit an extremely expensive one,
that the United States needs to abandon future Mars survey missions.
(A)	(as it is now)
(B)	 should consider privatizing space exploration (C)	 needs to adopt the metric system
(D)	should partner with other countries on future missions to outer space
(E)	 must stress STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education starting at an early age
12.	 The writer wants to add a phrase at the beginning of sentence 5 (reproduced
below), adjusting the capitalization as needed, to set up a comparison with the idea discussed in sentence 4.

The imperial measurement system used in the United States assigns values
haphazardly: one mile is 5,280 feet long, while one pound is 16 ounces.

Which of the following choices best accomplishes this goal?
(A)	Furthermore, (B)	 For example, (C)	 Similarly, (D)	By contrast, (E)	 In fact,

13.	 In sentence 9 (reproduced below), the writer wants to provide a convincing
explanation for why switching to the metric system would benefit United States industries.

Switching to the metric system would also benefit United States industries; the
European Union, for example, has been requiring its member states to standardize their metric systems since 1971.

Which version of the underlined text best accomplishes this goal?
(A)	(as it is now)
(B)	 industries: since most of the world already uses the metric system, it is likely to be the only measuring system in the future
(C)	 industries; in fact, the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988,
passed by Congress and signed into law by President Ronald Reagan,
encouraged United States industries to adopt the metric system
(D)	industries: those with products in both domestic and international markets
would no longer need to design in and produce to two different measurement
systems, reducing both product overlap and manufacturing inefficiencies
(E)	 industries; the United States Metric Board was established in 1975 as part of
the Metric Conversion Act to encourage the adoption of the metric system in
the United States, something it continued to do until it was abolished in 1982
14.	 The writer wants to add the following sentence to the third paragraph
(sentences 6–9) to provide additional explanation.

This means that the United States must convert to metric units whenever it is dealing with the rest of the world.

Where would the sentence best be placed?
(A)	Before sentence 6 (B)	 After sentence 6 (C)	 After sentence 7 (D)	After sentence 8 (E)	 After sentence 9
15.	 The writer wants to add more information to the third paragraph
(sentences 6–9) to support the main argument of the paragraph. All of the
following pieces of evidence help achieve this purpose EXCEPT which one?
(A)	An airplane that ran out of fuel mid-flight because of a conversion error by
the pilots when they calculated how much fuel they needed
(B)	 A mechanical failure on an amusement park ride that occurred because the
imperial size of a particular part was ordered instead of the metric size
(C)	 A quote from Thomas Jefferson’s eighteenth-century proposal for a new
decimal system to standardize weights and measures
(D)	Data from a United States company demonstrating an increase in profits because of its conversion to the metric system
(E)	 A map showing the countries that use the metric system shaded in one
color and those that use the imperial system shaded in another color

16.	 In the fourth paragraph (sentences 10–11), the writer wants to expand on the
concession that converting to the metric system may seem difficult. Which of
the following claims would best achieve this purpose?
(A)	The imperial system the United States uses today functions perfectly well, so there’s no need to change it.
(B)	 Many attempts to make the United States adopt the metric system have already been made.
(C)	 The units in the imperial system were first officially defined by the Office
of the Exchequer in Great Britain in 1824, but they have existed as the
Winchester Standards since 1588.
(D)	Some people in Great Britain, which adopted the metric system decades ago, want to return to the imperial system.
(E)	 It would be extremely costly as well as confusing for the United States to
manage the overwhelming task of converting everything from road signs to measuring cups to the metric system.
17.	 In the fourth paragraph (sentences 10–11), the writer wants to provide further
evidence to rebut the claim that converting to the metric system might be difficult.
Which of the following pieces of evidence would best achieve this purpose?
(A)	A 2012 petition, signed by over 25,000 people, urging the White House to adopt the metric system in the United States
(B)	 An interview from an opponent of adopting the metric system in the
United States
(C)	 A personal anecdote about a failed attempt to make a cake because of a measurement conversion error
(D)	A description of the successful adoption of the metric system by Great
Britain, which had previously used the imperial system
(E)	 A United States government report estimating the cost of converting
highway signs on state roads at $334 million dollars

[W]hat do I mean by human progress? I believe that all human beings share certain
fundamental aspirations. They want protections for their lives and their liberties. They
want to think freely and to worship as they wish. They want opportunities to educate
their children, both boys and girls. And they want the dignity that comes with having to be asked for their consent to be governed.
All too often, difference has been used to divide and dehumanize. I grew up in
Birmingham, Alabama—a place quite properly called the most segregated city in
America—and I know how it feels to hold aspirations when half your neighbors think
that you’re incapable of or uninterested in anything higher. And I know there are some in this audience who have perhaps faced the same.
And in my professional life, I have listened in disbelief as it has been said of men
and women in Asia and Africa and Latin America and Eastern Europe and Russia,
from time to time, that they did not share the basic aspirations of all human beings.
Somehow these people were just “different.” That meant “unworthy of what we enjoy.”
“Maybe they’re just not ready for democracy,” it would be said. But of course this was
once said even about black people. We were just too childlike. We didn’t care about
rights or citizenship or the vote. We didn’t care about freedom and liberty.
Well, today in the Middle East, the last bastion of that argument, people are putting
a nail in the coffin of that idea. They are not just seeking their freedom, they are
seizing it. But freedom and democracy are not the same thing. Freedom and rights
have to be institutionalized into rule of law, into constitutions. And if you don’t think
constitutions matter, just remember this: When Martin Luther King Jr. wanted to say
that segregation was wrong, in my hometown of Birmingham, he didn’t have to say
that the United States had to be something else—only that the United States had to be
what it said it was. That is why the creed matters.
But stable democracy requires more than just the institutionalization of freedom. It
requires that there can be no tyranny of the majority. And most importantly, it requires
that the strong cannot exploit the weak. Indeed, democracy is only as strong as its
weakest link. And indeed, if every life is equal before the law, and within the eyes of
God, then every life is worthy. Every life is capable of greatness. And it truly doesn’t
matter where you came from, it matters where you are going.
At SMU, you have been taught the importance of service. You have been taught to
serve those who are less fortunate. And yes, it will help them, but it will help you more.
Because when you encounter those who are less fortunate, you cannot possibly give
way to aggrievement—“Why do I not have?”—or its twin brother, entitlement—“Why
don’t they give me?” In fact, you will ask instead, not “Why do I not have?” but
“Why have I been given so much?” And from that spirit, you will join the legions of
impatient patriots and optimists who are working toward a better human future. And
yes, sometimes it seems very hard indeed. But always remember in those times of trial,
that what seems impossible seems inevitable in retrospect.
I read one summer the biographies of the Founding Fathers, when things weren’t
going very well for us in the Bush Administration.* And by all rights, the United States
of America should actually never have come into being—what with a third of George
Washington’s troops down with smallpox on any given day, the Founding Fathers
squabbling among themselves, and against the greatest military power of the time— but we did come into being.
And then we fought a civil war, brother against brother, hundreds of thousands dead
on both sides—and yet we emerged a more perfect Union.

And those of us who live in the West and have ever come across the Continental
Divide know that they did it in covered wagons. And they had to be optimists, because
they didn’t even know what was on the other side and they kept going anyway.
And in Birmingham, Alabama, a little girl whose parents can’t take her to a movie
theater or to a restaurant—her parents nonetheless have her convinced that she
may not be able to have a hamburger at Woolworth’s lunch counter, but she can be
president of the United States if she wanted to be, and she becomes the Secretary of
State. You see, things that seem impossible very often seem inevitable in retrospect.
*Rice was Secretary of State from 2005 to 2009 under George W. Bush.
Argument (Free-Response Question 3 on the AP Exam)
The late Barbara Jordan, a former United States representative, once warned,
“[T]his is the great danger America faces—that we will cease to be one nation and
become instead a collection of interest groups: city against suburb, region against
region, individual against individual; each seeking to satisfy private wants.”
Write an essay that argues your position on Jordan’s claim that “private wants” threaten national identity.
In your response you should do the following:
§§ Respond to the prompt with a thesis that may establish a line of reasoning.
§§ Select and use evidence to develop and support your line of reasoning.
§§ Explain the relationship between the evidence and your thesis.
§§ Demonstrate an understanding of the rhetorical situation.
§§ Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.

Carefully read the six sources, found on the AP English Language and Composition Classroom Resources page, including the introductory
information for each source. Write an essay that synthesizes material from at least three of the sources and develops your position on the role, if
any, that public libraries should serve in the future.
Source A (Kranich)
Source B (calendar)
Source C (Shank)
Source D (charts)
Source E (Siegler)
Source F (ALA)
In your response you should do the following:
•
Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible position.
•
Select and use evidence from at least three of the provided sources to support your line of reasoning. Indicate clearly the sources
used through direct quotation, paraphrase, or summary. Sources may be cited as Source A, Source B, etc., or by using the description in parentheses.
•
Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.
•
Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.

educational benefits and the comfort libraries provide when in need and the historical
implications, it is essential to society to keep these public reading spaces alive.” •
“Libraries serve vital roles in society: they hold historical significance and teach people
how to properly engage with civics, they help build and reinforce communities, and
libraries provide resources for the less fortunate. All in all, libraries should be funded and
should continue to serve these roles in the future.”

•
The thesis may establish a line of reasoning that structures the essay, but it needn’t do so to earn the thesis point.
•
A thesis that meets the criteria can be awarded the point whether or not the rest of the response successfully supports that line of reasoning.
