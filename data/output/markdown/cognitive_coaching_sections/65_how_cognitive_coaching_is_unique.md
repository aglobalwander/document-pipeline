## HOW COGNITIVE COACHING IS UNIQUE

Anyone planning to use Cognitive Coaching must be able to clearly distinguish the four functions of evaluation, consulting, collaboration, and Cognitive Coaching described above. These various forms of support are summarized in table 1.1. No one cognitively coaches all the time, and it is important for a Cognitive Coach to know when it is appropriate and how each function differs from the others. Chapter 13 elaborates this dimension of a supervisor's or support provider's decision making.

Cognitive Coaching is a unique form of coaching. It differs from other forms of mentoring, supervision, and peer review in that it mediates invisible, internal mental resources and intellectual functions, as represented in figure 1.2. These resources and functions include perceptions, cognitive processes, values, and internal resources. Other forms of 'coaching' may focus on the behaviors, the problem, the lesson, the topic, the meeting, or the activity. We regard these forms of assistance as consulting, not coaching.

'We are grateful to Laura Lipton and Bruce Wellman for sharing their thinking about distinctions across the support services of   coaching; collaborating, and   consulting. Like Lipton and Wellman, we regardthese as listed  in order   of teacher  work and self-directedness; Wellman, B. with C. Humbard.

The underlying premise of Cognitive Coaching is that a person's actions are influenced by internal forces rather than overt behaviors. Therefore, Cognitive Coaches focus on the thought processes, values, identities, and beliefs that motivate, guide, influence, and give rise to the overt behaviors, as represented in figure 1.3.

Although only those charged with legal responsibilities can evaluate, a principal, peer, mentor, department chairperson, curriculum specialist, or resource teacher may serve as a Cognitive Coach. A Cognitive Coach helps another person take action toward his or her goals while simultaneously helping that person develop expertise in planning, reflecting, problem solving, and decision making. These are the invisible skills of being a professional, and they are the source of all teachers' choices and behaviors. The successful Cognitive Coach takes a nonjudgmental stance and uses tools of pausing, paraphrasing, and posing questions. The successful coach focuses on the other person's perceptions, thinking, and decision-making processes to mediate resources for selfdirected learning.

The Cognitive Coaching model, then, is predicated on a set of values, maps, and tools that, when combined with nonjudgmental ways of being and working with others, invites the shaping and reshaping of thinking and problem-solving capacities. This shift happens for the person being coached and for the coach as well. Reciprocal learning is a critical component of the model.

Integral to Cognitive Coaching is the ability to work effectively with oneself and others across style differences and philosophical preferences. One fundamental element of a coach's effectiveness is the capacity to work within a colleague's world-view. As a result, the viewpoints of both participants are widened, which enables an exploration of new ideas along with existing beliefs and values.
