I. Course description and aims
Individual students have different needs, aspirations, interests and ­abilities.
For this reason there are two different DP subjects in mathematics,
­Mathematics: analysis and approaches and Mathematics: applications and
interpretation. Each course is designed to meet the needs of a particular
group of students. Both courses are offered at SL and HL.
The IB DP Mathematics: analysis and approaches course recognizes the
need for analytical expertise in a world where innovation is increasingly
dependent on a deep understanding of mathematics. The focus is on
developing important mathematical concepts in a comprehensible,
coherent and rigorous way, achieved by a carefully balanced approach.
Students are encouraged to apply their mathematical knowledge to
solve abstract problems as well as those set in a variety of meaningful
contexts. Mathematics: analysis and approaches has a strong
emphasis on the ability to construct, communicate and justify correct
mathematical arguments. Students should expect to develop insight
into mathematical form and structure, and should be intellectually
equipped to appreciate the links between concepts in different topic
areas. Students are also encouraged to develop the skills needed to
continue their mathematical growth in other learning environments.
The internally assessed exploration allows students to develop
independence in mathematical learning. Throughout the course
students are encouraged to take a considered approach to various
mathematical activities and to explore different mathematical ideas.
The aims of all DP mathematics courses are to enable students to:
z
z develop a curiosity and enjoyment of mathematics, and appreciate its elegance and power z
z develop an understanding of the concepts, principles and nature of mathematics z
z communicate mathematics clearly, concisely and confidently in a variety of contexts z
z develop logical and creative thinking, and patience and persistence in
problem solving to instil confidence in using mathematics z
z employ and refine their powers of abstraction and generalization z
z take action to apply and transfer skills to alternative situations, to other
areas of knowledge and to future developments in their local and global communities z
z appreciate how developments in technology and mathematics influ­ ence each other z
z appreciate the moral, social and ethical questions arising from the work
of mathematicians and the applications of mathematics z
z appreciate the universality of mathematics and its multicultural, inter­ national and historical perspectives z
z appreciate the contribution of mathematics to other disciplines, and as
a particular “area of knowledge” in the TOK course z
z develop the ability to reflect critically upon their own work and the work of others z
z independently and collaboratively extend their understanding of mathematics.

The Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19
age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and
inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students
to develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them
to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core. Students study
two modern languages (or a modern language and a classical language), a humanities
or social science subject, an experimental science, mathematics and one of the creative
arts. Instead of an arts subject, students can choose two subjects from another area.
It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma Programme a
demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university
entrance. In each of the academic areas students have flexibility in making their
choices, which means they can choose subjects that particularly interest them and
that they may wish to study further at university.
Normally, three subjects (and not more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and
the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends 240 teaching hours for
HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth
than at SL. In addition, three core elements—the extended essay, theory of knowledge and
creativity, activity, service—are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.
This IB DP subject brief has three key components:

III. Assessment model
Problem-solving is central to learning mathematics and involves the
acquisition of mathematical skills and concepts in a wide range of situations,
including non-routine, open-ended and real-world problems.
The assessment objectives are common to Mathematics: analysis and
approaches and to Mathematics: applications and interpretation.
z
z Knowledge and understanding: Recall, select and use their knowledge
of mathematical facts, concepts and techniques in a variety of familiar and unfamiliar contexts.
z
z Problem solving: Recall, select and use their knowledge of mathematical
skills, results and models in both abstract and real-world contexts to solve problems.
z
z Communication and interpretation: Transform common realistic
contexts into mathematics; comment on the context; sketch or draw
mathematical diagrams, graphs or constructions both on paper and
using technology; record methods, solutions and conclusions using
standardized notation; use appropriate notation and terminology.
z
z Technology: Use technology accurately, appropriately and efficiently both to explore new ideas and to solve problems.
z
z Reasoning: Construct mathematical arguments through use of precise
statements, logical deduction and inference and by the manipulation of mathematical expressions.
z
z Inquiry approaches: Investigate unfamiliar situations, both abstract
and from the real world, involving organizing and analyzing information,
making conjectures, drawing conclusions, and testing their validity.
The exploration is an integral part of the course and its assessment, and is
compulsory for both SL and HL students. It enables students to demonstrate
the application of their skills and knowledge, and to pursue their personal
interests, without the time limitations and other constraints that are associated with written examinations.
About the IB: For over 50 years, the IB has built a reputation for high-quality, challenging programmes of education that develop internationally
minded young people who are well prepared for the challenges of life in the 21st century and are able to contribute to creating a better, more peaceful world.
