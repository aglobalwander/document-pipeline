Developing and using models 3.
Planning and carrying out investigations 4.
Analyzing and interpreting data 5.
Using mathematics and computational thinking 6.
Constructing explanations (for science) and designing solutions (for engineering) 7.
Engaging in argument from evidence 8.
Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information 2 Crosscutting Concepts 1.
Patterns 2.
Cause and effect: Mechanism and explanation 3.
Scale, proportion, and quantity 4.
