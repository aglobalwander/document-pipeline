## Consciousness in Educational Settings

The complexity of classroom life, the conditions in which teachers are called on to react, makes the ability to regulate behavior in socially and culturally appropriate ways critical for teachers. The regulation of behavior is a product of an individual's ability to impose thinking on actions-to

examine oneself, to assess the situation, and to decide how and when to react. Such teachers:

- Are aware that certain events are occurring and are able to direct their course
- Monitor their own values, intentions, thoughts, and behaviors and their effects on others and the environment
- Have well-defined value systems that they can articulate and generate
- Hold and apply internal criteria for decisions they make
- Seek improved strategies through practicing mental rehearsal and editing of mental pictures

Christina Linder, a middle-school English teacher, reports: 'In learning to more clearly project outcomes for my lessons, I found that I was planning more precisely, and that smaller, more tangible goals were appearing in my lesson plans. I had often suspected that at times specific student needs had been sacrificed in attainment of the broader goal.'

At the same school, Jan Whitaker wrote the following: 'After a few Cognitive Coaching sessions, I realized it wasn't the material that was important but how it caused thinking in my students. Missing in my very detailed and organized lessons was the opportunity for students to develop creativity, craftsmanship, application, analysis, and higher levels of thinking.'

Both teachers commented on how this awareness led to changes in their teaching. Consciousness is the monitoring arena for each of the other states of mind. If one's personal efficacy becomes depleted, if one is rigidly seeing from only a single perspective, or if one is acting impulsively at the moment of consciousness of these responses, one has choice among alternate responses.
