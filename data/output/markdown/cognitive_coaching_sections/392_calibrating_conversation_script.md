| You have the self-assessment instrument for presenters, and you' had a chance to look at it and rank yourself as to where you are. There are several different areas there which one would you like to focus on? | Well, under communication, really wanted to on verbal, and if we have any additional time Vd like to look at nonverbal. So my first choice is verbal communication while presenting:. focus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Select a focus.                                                                            |
| So when you look at this, and where you placed yourself, what are some of the data you have with both frequency and proficiency?                                                                                 | What stands out for me is marked highly skilled in paraphrasing and high frequency because thats something do deliberately; and of unconscious competence its just who am. So that stood out for me Choosing appropriate voice was another one marked highly skilled and that use quite conscious when /m presenting to groups of the approachable voice intentionally and the credible voice intentionally with groups and also the pitch and modulation at other times. myself yet really using using | Identify existing level of performance placement on a rubric and give supporting evidence. |
| So a couple of different things that stand out for you that you're already aware of. You have high skill and high frequency in these, so that's going really well for you.                                       | Yes.

Absolutely. And something that surprised me was Vm not confident in redirecting resistance. And so as reflected on that, thought at Vm pretty proficient, then changed that to partially proficient. The reason think Vm partially proficient is I dont have any fist-fights during my presentations (laughs) and people feel heard, yet want to become more conscious and skillful in redirecting resistance.

Another Ive seen presenters do, and Id want to be more mindful of, is offering a polarity paraphrase; It helps relieve the tensions and helps people expand their perspective.
