## Two Ways of Talking That Make a Difference for Student Learning

P What we talk about in our schools and how we talk about those things says rofessional  communities  are  born  and  nurtured  in  webs  of  conversation. much about who we are, who we think we are, and who we wish to be, both in the moment and in the collective future that we are creating for ourselves as colleagues and for the students we serve.

Research on the social nature of learning and cognition proposes three central themes as frames  for  thinking  about  the  construction  of new ideas and perspectives (Penlington, 2006; Putnam and Borko, 2000).

(1) Cognition is centered in specific physical and social contexts. Creating communities of  thought  is  the  ultimate  outcome  of  developing a high functioning team or department. Thinking together is both the expectation and the reward in such communities. As we pointed out  in  chapter  3  the  word  community  itself is  rooted  in  the  word  communicate.  We  hold things  in  common  by  attending  to  the  form and  function  of  collective  talk.  The  physical organization of meeting rooms enhances these processes. For more details on managing space and the surround to enhance collaborative engagement see chapter 6.

(2) Cognition is social in nature. Thought is  a  collective  process.  Our  outer  talk  reflects internal thought patterns and in the process of language construction, we modify those same thought  patterns.  In  this  way,  our  external talking  alters  our  inner  speech.  By  listening to  the  perspectives  of  others,  reflecting  those thoughts back in the form of paraphrases, and inquiring into the ideas of others we shape both their thinking and our own. These same alterations  in  the  patterns  of  thought  occur  when others paraphrase us and inquire into our ideas.

(3)  Cognition  is  distributed  between  individuals and tools. No one person has all the answers or all of the ideas. Collectively we are typically  smarter  than  when  working  alone. Yet,  working  together  is  not  always  easy.  It requires skills, dispositions, and a shared toolkit of maps and tools for talking to manage the cognitive  and  emotional  load  of  productive collaboration.

Group talk is the organizing ingredient of shared  learning,  yet  it  is  dangerous  and  often counterproductive  to  put  people  in  a  room without  frameworks  and  tools  for  skilled  interaction.  The  group-member  capabilities  and norms of collaboration described in the previous chapter supply part of the equation. What is missing is a map for two kinds of talking that make a difference for student learning (Garmston and Wellman, 1998).

An elementary school staff was struggling with the reduced budget for instructional aides. Although  consensus  and  fairness  were  their goals, they reported that they felt like turkeys being asked to vote on the merits of Thanksgiving. No one really wanted his or her aide time cut. One first-grade teacher was adamant: She would agree to lose aide time 'over my dead body.' Six months later, as part of a schoolwide effort  to  support  development  of  literacy  and reading  skills,  this  same  teacher  volunteered to share her classroom aide with a third-grade

tutoring program 'if it will really make a difference in helping those students learn to read.'

What  happened?  In  six  months  these teachers  learned  to  distinguish  and  practice two  different  ways  of  talking:  dialogue  and discussion.  They  adopted  the  seven  norms  of collaboration,  and  individually  reflected  on their capabilities for professional discourse and openly reflected  on  these  in  order  to  improve personal and collective practice.

Developing  a  staff's  skills  for  talking together  professionally  is  no  panacea,  but  it can  represent  one  of  the  single  most  significant  investments  that  faculties  can  make  for student learning.

These capabilities form the core of a professional  community.  Such  communities  talk about  hard  issues;  they  honor  cognitive  conflict and minimize affective conflict (Amason, Thompson,  Hochwarter,  and  Harrison,  1995); and  they  make  decisions  based  on  objective data,  shared  values,  and  deep  examination  of mental  models.  They  measure  success  by  increased student learning and adults' satisfaction with their work.

To  develop  shared  understanding  and  be ready to take collective action, working groups need knowledge and skill in two ways of talking. One way of talking, dialogue, leads to collective meaning making and the development of shared understanding. The other way of talking, discussion, leads to decisions that stay made.

Both  forms  of  professional  discourse  use common tools. The four capabilities described in chapter 4 guide group members in selecting tools  and  help  them  to  monitor  the  effectiveness of their participation.

Figure 5.1 shows the pathways of dialogue and discussion. First we will define the terms in the diagram. Then, we will describe how groups

use these concepts to guide their interactions. Finally, we will report the ways that we introduce groups to these maps, tools, and skills.

Dialogue honors the social-emotional brain, building a sense of connection, belonging, and safety. As a shape for conversations, it connects us  to  our  underlying  motivations  and  mental models. This way of talking forms a foundation for  coherent,  sustained  effort  and  community building. In dialogue we hear phrases like 'An assumption I have is . . .' and 'I'd be curious to hear what other people are thinking about this issue.' In the following video (5.1), some internal complexities of being in dialogue are revealed in this interview between Carolyn McKanders and Robert Garmston.

Discussion,  in  its  more  skillful  form,  requires  conversations  that  are  infused  with sustained  critical  thinking,  careful  consideration  of  options,  and  respect  for  conflicting points  of  view.  This  way  of  talking  leads  to decision making that serves the group's and the school's vision, values, and goals. In a discussion we hear phrases like 'We need to define the  problem  we  are  solving  before  jumping to solutions' and 'I'd like to see the data that these  assumptions  are  based  on  before  we  go much further.' A school in Virginia reports that learning the distinctions between these ways of talking made a profound difference in their collaborative work. What they had to say did not change, how they said it did (Cunneen, 2015).

## Conversation and Deliberation

When  groups  come  together,  they  'converge'  and  'converse.'  These  words'  respective Latin roots mean that group members 'turn together'  and  'associate  with  one  another.' Conversation  is  informal  talking  in  which participants  share  information,  anecdotes,  and opinions  to  learn  from  one  another  or  simply to  enjoy  one  another's  company.  When  the conversation  takes  on  an  organized  purpose, to  either  deepen  understanding or make a decision, a group that understands that there are two ways of talking acknowledges this point of deliberation and consciously chooses to engage in either dialogue or discussion. Deliberation in its Latin root, deliberare , means to weigh, as in to evaluate, assess, or ponder.

Group  members  have  this  choice  point available  to  them  only  when  they  have  road maps  for  ways  of  talking  and  consciousness about  group  processes  and  group  purposes. A significant part of this awareness is recognizing that  culturally  embedded  patterns  shape  behaviors-patterns from the larger surrounding culture  and  patterns  from  organizational  and group  culture.  Many  groups  default  into  the Western cultural habit of polarized discussion and  debate.  Our  media-saturated  world  bombards  us  with  arguments  framed  by  commentators  as  point-counterpoint,  pro  and  con,  left versus  right,  and  other  polarities,  the  regrettable byproduct of the contentious Gore Vidal and  William  F.  Buckley  debates  televised  at the  presidential  conventions  of  1968.  These models  transfer  to  conversations  in  working groups; they then frame how participants listen to others and how and when participants speak. If group members are not careful, they end up listening not to understand, but to hear gaps in the logic of other speakers, or they interrupt to make a point even before the current speaker is finished.  Conversations  then  break  down  into verbal combat, with winners and losers.

All  too  often,  valued  colleagues  become conscientious objectors, choosing not to participate in the fray. The group then loses perspective and potential alternative viewpoints. The loudest and  most  persistent  voices  become  the  policymakers, and in the worst cases, the process sows the seeds of passive noncompliance or sabotage in those who feel excluded or devalued.

When  groups  understand  that  they  have more than one way of talking available to them, they can consciously choose to pursue the path of dialogue or to follow the path of discussion. Most  important  issues  require  explorations along  both  pathways.  Many  sensitive  issues, especially those with high stakes for the participants,  call  for  separate  sessions  in  which  the dialogue and discussion are separated in time and  sometimes  space.  One  useful  facilitation technique  is  to  explicitly  label  agenda  items as either dialogue or discussion and offer language models to further mark the distinctions between the two forms of discourse.

As group members become more sophisticated with the ways of talking, the pathways become more malleable. For example, during a dialogue, a group member senses an emerging consensus on an issue. He or she then inquires if this is so and frames a proposal to move the item  to  a  decision.  In  another  case,  during  a discussion,  emotions  rise  and  the  details  become  muddled.  Someone  then  proposes  that the group switch to a dialogue format for a set time  to  explore  the  feelings  and  underlying issues that are present.

## The Path of Dialogue

Dialogue  is  a  reflective  learning  process in  which  group  members  seek  to  understand one  another's  viewpoints  and  deeply  held  assumptions.  The  word dialogue comes  from the Greek dialogos . Dia means 'through' and logos means  'word.'  In  this  meaning-making through  words,  group  members  inquire  into their own  and  others'  beliefs,  values,  and mental models to better understand how things work  in  their  world.  In  dialogue,  listening  is as  important  as  speaking.  For  skilled  group members, much of the work is done internally.

Physicist  and  philosopher  David  Bohm (1990) described dialogue as a process of eliciting  and  altering  the  'tacit  infrastructure  of thought.' As a quantum physicist, Bohm draws an analogy between dialogue and superconductivity. Electrons that are cooled to extremely low temperatures  dramatically  change  their  behavior, operating more as a coherent whole and less as  separate  parts.  In  supercool  environments, electrons flow around barriers and one another without  resistance,  creating  very  high  energy. The same electrons radically change behavior in a new environment. At higher temperatures they operate as separate entities, with random movement and loss of momentum (Isaacs, 1993).

Dialogue  creates  an  emotional  and  cognitive safety zone in which ideas flow for examination  without  judgment.  Although  many of  the  capabilities  and  tools  of  dialogue  and skilled  discussion  are  the  same,  their  core  intentions are quite different and require different personal and collective monitoring processes.

## Monitoring Dialogue

Mindful  group  members  pay  attention  to three essential elements during productive dialogue. They monitor themselves, the process of the dialogue, and the new whole that is emerging within the group.

## Self

Dialogue is  first  and  foremost  a  listening practice. When we 'listen to our listening,' we notice whether we are internally debating with the speaker, reviewing our mental catalogue of related information and personal anecdotes, or composing a response. Noticing these common internal processes allows us to switch them off so that we can hear others without judging.

Dialogue requires choice making. Typical choices include how and when to talk. Do we paraphrase prior comments to check for understanding and/or synthesis? Do we inquire into the ideas and assumptions of others? Do we put a new idea or perspective on the table to widen the frame?

Listening set-asides (chapter 4) and suspension are essential internal skills in dialogue. To suspend judgment, group members temporarily set  aside  their  own  perceptions,  feelings,  and impulses  and  carefully  monitor  their  internal experience. Points of personal conflict can eas-

ily emerge when we believe that others are not hearing us or that they are distorting our point of  view.  Points  of  conflict  also  surface  when our own values conflict with those of a speaker. These areas of discomfort influence our listening and our responses,  which  in  turn  influence  the thoughts and behaviors of other group members.

Senge, Roberts, Ross, Smith, and Kleiner (1994)  note  that  suspension  also  involves  developing  an  awareness  of  our  own  assumptions  and  purposely  'hanging  them  from  the ceiling'-that is, suspending them in front of the group so that all can examine them. These assumptions are beliefs-often unexaminedabout  why  we  think  things  work  as  they  do. Our assumptions drive our perceptions, simultaneously opening and blinding us to possibilities in the world around us.

## Process

Dialogue as a process requires focusing on the goal of developing shared understanding. In our action-oriented work environments, this is often countercultural. Yet in every group with which we've worked, all the participants could recite  examples  of  decisions  that  were  poorly conceived,  poorly  communicated,  simply  ignored, or, in the worst cases, violated by many organizational members without consequence. At the root of all these stories were group processes that were not thought out, but rather often hurried and inappropriately facilitated. The rush to action pushed unclear decision-making processes  and  timelines  onto  the  group  without sufficient attention to developing a shared understanding of both problems and solutions.

By  going  slow  and  honoring  the  flow  of dialogue,  groups  can  often  go  fast  when  they get  to  the  choice  points  in  decision-making. When the assumptions and the implications of those  assumptions  have  been  explored  during dialogue,  group  members  don't  second-guess the motives of others during discussions.

Meetings should be safe but not necessarily comfortable. When a group confuses safety with  comfort,  it  sacrifices  productive  tension for the ease of conviviality. Humor and banter can  be  avoidance  strategies  as  much  as  they can be social lubricants. A lack of comfort with discomfort  weakens  dialogue  and  undermines the learning possibilities in that moment.

## Whole

Thought is both a personal and a collective process.  We  influence  and  are  influenced  in turn  by  others.  During  dialogue,  the  line  between self and others blurs when we open ourselves to the possibilities within the communal thought space. This created whole is in itself a goal of dialogue. Communities move forward together.  Collective  understanding  leads  to shared goals and shared practices that tap the power of cumulative effect for student learning and for the adult learning community.

The whole is always greater than the sum of  the  individual  parts.  In  many  ways  it  is both  process  and  product  simultaneously.  By learning  to  observe  the  processes,  patterns, and  results  that  emerge  from  our  dialogues, we can more consciously participate and more consciously  contribute  to  the  whole  of  which we are the parts.

## Understanding as the Outcome

Well-crafted  dialogue  leads  to  understanding.  This  is  the  foundation  for  conflict  resolution,  consensus,  and  professional  community. Decisions that don't stay made are often the result of group members feeling left out or having their  ideas  discounted  by  the  group.  Dialogue gives voice to all parties and all viewpoints.

Misunderstanding  lies  beneath  most  intragroup  and  intergroup  conflict.  Dialogue illuminates  and  clarifies  misunderstandings when  the  underlying  values  and  beliefs  are brought to the surface for examination. There is  often  alignment  at  this  level;  it  is  at  the solution  level  that  opinions  differ.  Working from  a  foundation  of  shared  understanding, group members can more easily and rationally resolve  differences,  generate  options,  and make  wise  choices  when  they  move  to  the discussion side of the journey.

## The Path of Discussion

Discussion , in its Latin  root discutere , means  'to  shake  apart.'  It  focuses  on  the parts  and  their  relationships  to  one  another: the  causes,  the  effects,  and  the  ripple  effects of proposed actions and solutions. In its most ineffective forms, discussion consists of serial sharing  and  serial  advocacy  without  much group-member  inquiry  into  the  thinking  and proposals  of  others.  Participants  attempt  to reach  decisions  through  a  variety  of  voting and  consensus  techniques.  When  discussion is  unskilled  and  dialogue  is  absent,  decisions are often low-quality, represent the opinions of the most vocal members or leader, lack group commitment, and do not stay made.

Three  elements  (chapter  6)  shape  skilled discussions: (1) clarity about decision-making processes and authority; (2) knowledge of the boundaries  of  the  topics  open  to  the  group's decision-making  authority;  and  (3)  standards for  orderly  decision-making  meetings.  Most meetings are, in fact, structured discussions.

## Monitoring Discussion

Mindful  group  members  pay  attention  to three  essential  elements  during  productive  discussion. They monitor themselves, the processes of  skilled  discussion,  and  the  details  of  the problem solving, planning, and decision-making processes in which they are engaged.

## Self

Productive discussions require group members  to  have  emotional  and  mental  flexibility. When our goal is to influence the thinking of others and we give up the model of winning or losing, we are more able to notice our thoughts and  actions  and  the  effects  of  those  thoughts and actions on others.

Mentally,  this  requires  taking  a  balcony view. This perceptual position is neither egocentric (I am intensely aware of my thoughts, feelings,  and  intentions  and  know  my  own boundaries)  nor allocentric (I  am  aware  of how something looks, feels, and sounds from the  point  of  view  of  another).  The  balcony view is a third perceptual position, a macrocentric perspective,  in  which,  with  compassion and detachment, we try to understand the nature  of  the  situation  the  group  is  in  at  the moment.  It  is  with  this  view,  looking  down upon the group, that we gain the most knowledge about our group, the group's interactions, and ourselves.

From the balcony we can make the most strategic choices about how and when to participate. Should I advocate or should I inquire? At what points should I press? When should I probe for detail or let go? How might I phrase an  idea  for  greatest  influence?  These  are  the same internal skills that teachers employ when they monitor and adjust in their classrooms.

## Process

Skilled  discussion  as  a  process  requires mindfulness  about  focusing  on  one  topic  and applying  one  process  tool  at  a  time  (chapter 6). When  topics  and  processes  blur,  group members lose focus. To maintain focus requires clear structure, purposeful facilitation, impulse control  on  the  part  of  individual  group  members, and recovery strategies if the group strays off course.

Effective  group  members  share  responsibility  with  the  facilitator  for  maintaining  the flow  of  the  discussion,  for  encouraging  other group members to share knowledge and ideas, and for hearing and exposing points of confusion or murkiness.

When working  groups  stray  from  skilled discussion,  they  often  move  to  an  unskilled form of debate. This occurs when group mem-

bers overlook the useful advocacy of ideas and proposals and start listening for and challenging  the  fallacies  in  the  arguments  of  others. Battuere ,  the  Latin origin of the word debate , means 'to fight or beat down.' When meetings descend to the level of street debate rather than academic  debate,  we  focus  on  beating  down the ideas of others. Scoring points becomes the goal, and winning comes from intimidation and intonation  as  much  as  from-or  more  thanlogic or reason.

## Details

Whereas successful dialogue requires attention to the whole, successful discussion focuses on  the  details,  both  in  isolation  and  in  their interactions. The  path  of  discussion  is  also  the path of decision. As such, groups need to identify any constraints under which they might be working, such as timelines, deadlines, budgets, product  standards,  nonnegotiable  items,  task assignments, and, most important, who they are in  the  decision-making process. Groups skilled in discussion employ many intentional cognitive skills. There is no set sequence for these efforts. The task before the group determines the necessary intellectual tool kit.

Groups need tools for the following:

- · Generating ideas, including a repertoire of brainstorming and creative thinking strategies and protocols;
- · Organizing  ideas,  including  both  conceptual and graphic tools;
- · Analyzing  ideas,  including  a  variety  of tools for illuminating  assumptions  and clarifying particulars;
- · Deciding among alternatives, including the clarification of decision-making roles and processes.

## Decision as the Outcome

Decision, in its Latin root decidere , means 'to  cut  off  or  determine.'  In  practice this means to cut off some options. The pur- pose of discussion is to eliminate ideas from a field of possibilities and allow the stronger ideas to prevail. Groups must learn to separate people from ideas in order for this to work effectively. If ideas are 'owned' by individuals, then to cut the idea away is the same as cutting the  person  away.  Ideas,  once  stated,  should belong to the group, not to individuals. In this way  they  can  be  shaped,  modified,  and  discarded to serve the group's greater purposes. The next  chapter  will  address  decision-making issues in greater detail.

## Professional Community

Professional  community  is  both  a  cause and  an  effect  of  the  two  ways  of  talking. As a  cause,  being  in  a  community  provides  the motivation  and  vision  of  ways  of  interacting and  working  together.  As  an  effect,  a  strong professional community results from both what is talked about and how people talk. Such talk requires courage, confidence in self and others, and skillfulness in applying the maps and tools for developing shared understanding and strategic decision-making practices.

## Consensus as the Holy Grail

Consensus is one form of decision making, but not the only form. Some groups get stuck trying  to  use  consensus  processes  without  a consciousness  of  the  difference  between  dialogue and discussion.

There  are  two  types  of  consensus:  (1) opening  consensus,  which  develops  through dialogue,  and  (2)  focusing  consensus,  which develops through discussion. Opening consensus involves the consideration of perspectives and possibilities. Focusing consensus involves winnowing  choices  by  clarifying  criteria  and applying these criteria to the choices. Focusing consensus  for  complex  decisions  depends  on effective opening consensus.

Ultimately, consensus is a value and a belief system and not simply a decision-making process.  Unless  groups  are  willing  to  hang

out  with  the  process  for  as  long  as  it  takes, they are not usually ready for full consensus decision making.

Most  groups  with  whom  we  work  are better  served  by  'sufficient  consensus.'  This generally  means  that  at  least  80  percent  of the group is willing to commit and act. It also means  that  the  others  agree  not  to  sabotage. Sufficient  consensus  relies  on  both  dialogue and discussion for its effectiveness. The practice of balancing  advocacy  and  inquiry  is essential. Any  dissenting  voices  must  be  able to  influence  and  persuade  80  percent  of  the group  to  carry  the  day.  This  also  means  that other group members can paraphrase and draw matters to a close when only a few voices line up on one side of an issue. Groups more easily come to common ground when they distinguish positions (divisive) from concerns.

## Norms and Values

Professional  community  is  built  on  the bedrock of norms and values, which are both honed  by  dialogue  and  discussion.  Strong schools  have  core  values  about  how  children learn, what they should learn, and how faculties should work together. Some norms about faculty work are philosophical (e.g., everyone can be involved in decision making, or no one has to be involved, but once decisions are reached they are binding on everyone). Carl Glickman (1993) calls this a charter, or guiding rules of governance. This type of norm signals what is important to the organization.

Another  type  of  norm  specifies  how  the values  of  the  organization  can  be  achieved. Our work with schools emphasizes the use of the seven norms of collaboration described in the  previous  chapter.  When  school  faculties make  these  seven  tools  into  norms-that  is, normal  operating  behaviors  in  formal  and  informal  interactions  within  the  school-adult relationships  improve,  groups  work  skillfully to  explore  members'  mental  models  and  assumptions,  and  both  dialogue  and  discussion are  served.  These  norms  also  have  a  tremen- dous payoff in the classroom for both teacherstudent  interactions  and  student-student  interactions. In many cases faculties take them on with the dual agenda of enhancing both faculty and student performance.

## Getting Started

The collaborative norms of the group (chapter 4) have more influence on the possibility of success than do the knowledge and talents of the group  facilitator.  Thus,  our  staff  development energies  must  go  to  groups,  not  to  designated leaders  of  groups.  We  have  found  this  to  be helpful  in  groups  that  achieve  high  levels  of skills in the challenging talk that is required in professional communities.

<!-- image -->

Any group that is too busy to reflect on its work is too busy to improve. Every working group has many more tasks to do than time in which to do them and so is naturally reluctant to  spend  time  monitoring  and  reflecting  on its  working  processes.  Many  groups  commit themselves to a task-process ratio to overcome this  tendency;  they  budget  a  protected  percentage  of  each  meeting  for  examining  how well the group is working and what it might do to improve.

Reflection can take many forms. Typically the least effective form involves a process observer-a special role for gathering data about the frequency or distribution of behaviors that the group believes are important. Because this places the gathering of data outside the group members, they ultimately become less accurate

in  gathering  their  own  data  and  self-assessments. A process observer can be useful when after  gathering  requested  data,  the  data  are shown  without  comment  and  members  are invited  to  interpret  them.  The  most  effective form  is  through  reflection  on  the  four  capabilities described in chapter 4. This can occur through journal writing, round-robin reflection, and  dialogue  that  is  focused  on  personal  and collective learning about the power of attention to process. For reflecting on discussions use the meeting inventory (appendix I) in which members assess criteria for successful meetings.

Human beings are a social species. Living and working in groups is an important part of our  genetic  heritage.  It  is  ironic,  then,  that  in many schools,  professionals  who  are  charged with  preparing  students  to  be  successful,  collaborative citizens are themselves cut off from the  rich  resources  offered  by  true  collegiality. That we talk together in our schools is vitally important  in  these  changing  times.  How  we talk is just as important, for it is how we talk that influences the personal and collective satisfaction  that  motivates  us  to  effectively  talk together in our schools.

## PART III

## MEETINGS ARE TEACHERS' WORK

<!-- image -->

Meetings can  be  and  are successful  in  many settings.  In  working  with  countless  schools on  several  continents  over  the  years,  we've seen  good  meetings  get  better  and  poor  ones become satisfying and effective. In part III, we will reveal the surprisingly simple patterns for making this  happen. These  ideas  are  straightforward  conceptually,  but  not  always  easy  to implement.  Many  groups  have  unproductive patterns of behavior that require unsticking to make room for new habits.

Successful  meetings  are  those  in  which a  great  deal  of  work  is  done  in  a  minimum amount  of  time  with  a  great  deal  of  member satisfaction. Three factors contribute to producing  such  meetings.  (1) Adopting  five  meeting standards,  informed  by  research  and  proven effective in the field. (2) Working from sound agendas.  Good  agendas  require  planning,  just as is true for good lessons. This section of the book  offers  principles  for  agenda  design  and samples of model agendas. (3) Applying skillful meeting  facilitation  concepts,  strategies, and moves. While many of the skills involved are similar to making presentations to groups, the  facilitation  role  is more  complex.  This leadership  role  requires  neutrality  toward  the meeting content, a process tool kit for helping the group get its work done, and the courage to intervene  when  needed  to  support  task  focus and group development.
