## Distortion

Distortion is the process by which we alter our perceptions; it is the source of creativity, play, humor, and multiple versions of remembering or interpreting an event. Three linguistic cues may signal distortions that are limiting to the speaker.

Cause-and-effect statements inaccurately name the source of an event. This type of distortion may be a cue to low efficacy, placing the power outside oneself for responses: 'They make me mad.' In that case, a coach might respond, 'They have that much control over you?' or 'When do you first notice that you are becoming angry?'

Mind reading is the expression of interpreting another person's intentions, thinking, or feelings. It differs from the paraphrases in a pace in that it is expressed as an explanation of another person's behavior rather than an attempt to understand when someone says something such as: 'He is doing that to annoy me.' In that situation, the coach might respond, 'What other possible reasons might he have?' or 'Can you think of a time when you have done something similar for a different purpose?' or 'If he had a positive intention, what might it be?'

A nominalization names a process as if it were a thing. It describes a

verb as if it were a noun. The words relate , love , learn , communicate , and trust are all nominalizations. In the sentence 'They don't respect each other,' the word respect is used as an abstraction, or nominalization. Respect can mean a number of things. The question 'What might they be doing when they are respecting each other?' returns the conversation to a description of behaviors. These can be understood by both parties and therefore addressed.

Coaches seek to return active status to nominalizations because we are doomed to frustration and failure whenever we try to solve an abstraction. For example, nothing can be done about 'resistance,' because the language form characterizes it as a nominalization, a thing, an immovable object. 'Resisting,' however, has form: a beginning, middle, and an end with which a person can observe, interact, and intervene. Denominalized words allow participation and efficacy.

Nominalized forms suggest choicelessness and low efficacy. When someone says, 'Their resistance is the problem,' the coach might respond, 'What are they doing when they resist?' or, 'How does the resisting begin?' or, 'What would they be doing if they were not resisting?'
