## Making In-the-Moment Decisions

During university days for Art and Bob, they were jolted as they realized how valuable it could be to shift supervision styles. They were working with a graduate student administrative intern. Both of them, by nature, tend toward a mediative, inquiry-based style of supporting others. Examination of progress with 'Paul,' however, revealed little follow-though on his part and insufficient understanding of the administrative position in which he was interning. Recalling Glickman's description of the relationship between levels of abstraction and levels of commitment to supervisor actions, they decided that Paul was relatively low on both continuums and therefore might benefit from a more direct information approach. Paul's performance and understanding immediately improved as he was provided with descriptions of what he should do next. Even though they had switched to a more direct informational style with Paul, they had not lost sight of their mission: extending his capacity for self-directed learning.

Paul's story represents the coach's dilemma of not knowing what kind of support to offer. More often, the issue is not whether to offer information or questions, but when . This is a delicate situation, and it is possible that only the most experienced coaches can make sound judgments most of the time. Many factors come into play. Is this a new teacher, a new assignment, or a new relationship? What is the person's general state of efficacy and craftsmanship? What is he asking for? How do you know if what she asks for is what is needed? What degree of stress is present?

Our colleagues Laura Lipton and Bruce Wellman address similar issues related to mentoring. They believe that a mentor's major responsibility is to increase the novice teacher's capacity to generate knowledge. Lipton and Wellman envision three stances that a mentor might take along a learning-focused continuum of interactions: The mentor might consultthat is, inform a teacher regarding processes and protocols, advise based on the mentor's expertise, or advocate for particular choices and actions. Another stance is to collaborate-that is, to participate as equals in planning, reflecting, and problem solving. At other times, the mentor might decide that coaching-that is, the nonjudgmental mediation of thinking and decision making-is the most effective option.

Whether to deviate from coaching is the most critical question for a

support provider. Lipton and Wellman suggest that mentors give thought to three related questions: if, when, and how. If their answer to 'if I should deviate' is yes, then consideration must be given to when and how.

Decisions about when and how to deviate from coaching are largely driven by the coach's attention to the verbal and nonverbal cues that signal what someone is thinking and feeling. The coach must read the colleague's communication: Is it confidence, confusion, or discomfort? This may move the coach to offer an organizing paraphrase, leave an area of inquiry for another time, or ask a mediative question. Inexperienced coaches sometimes move to consulting because of their own discomfort, not the teacher's. For example, if a coach feels he is not doing his job because the teacher failed to accurately self-evaluate, the novice coach might be tempted to give advice. Whether to move to another support function seems to be the most complex question. In general, one chooses a support function based on a teacher's resourcefulness.

Several factors influence the choice of services to provide. As in the case of Paul, Glickman's concepts about the level of abstraction and commitment may apply. Abstraction refers to the teacher's ability to examine situations from a variety of perspectives, to generate and examine alternative solutions, to test and modify instructional practices, and generally to reflect about her work. Commitment refers to the amount of work the teacher is willing to invest. In brief, the support provider determines how much initiative, thought, and action the teacher expends in his teaching. Glickman (1985) regards these two factors as developmental. He would have support providers increase the ratio of collaborative, or nondirective, work (coaching) as teachers become more highly abstract or committed.

Coaches must be aware of how a foreign-born speaker's language might influence a coaching interaction. Cultural realities must be considered when imagining that a teacher is at a lower level of abstraction when, in fact, the teacher may be translating concepts into his or her first language. The percentage of teachers in the English-speaking countries for whom English is a second language is increasing.
