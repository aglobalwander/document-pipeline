## 2. Mediating Students' Meaning Making

Learning is viewed as a continual process of engaging and transforming the mind. Constructivist teachers cast students in the role of producers of knowledge rather than consumers of knowledge. They conceive their role as a facilitator of meaning making. They intervene between the learner and the learning so as to cause students to approach activities in a strategic way, to help them monitor their own progress in the learning, to construct meaning from the learning and from the process of learning, and then to apply the learnings to other contexts and settings (Feuerstein, Falik, and Feuerstein 2015).

Constructivist teachers' meditational questioning and problem posing stimulate the brain to engage in higher-order and creative cognitive functions. They raise and illuminate perplexing situations, problems to solve, discrepancies, and intriguing phenomena-the answers to which are not readily apparent. Day-to-day, real-life problems are the best way to practice problem solving.

Constructivist teachers seek elaboration of initial responses. Initial responses are just thatinitial . People's first thoughts about issues are not necessarily their final thoughts or their best thoughts. Inviting elaboration causes others to reconceptualize and reassess their own language, concepts, and strategies.

In dialogue, constructivist teachers use cognitive terminology. The words we hear and use in dialogue affect our way of thinking and ultimately our actions. Constructivist teachers deliberately choose words

intended to activate and engage mental processes. Finding relationships, predicting outcomes, analyzing, and synthesizing are mental processes that require others to draw forth their knowledge, make connections, and create new understandings (Costa and Kallick 2008, 124-25).
