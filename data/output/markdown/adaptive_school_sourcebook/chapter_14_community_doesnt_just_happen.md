## Chapter 14  Community Doesn't Just Happen

Through community character is built. The schools that do it best 'are those that cultivate intense, think community. Most of the time, character is not an individual accomplishment. It emerges through joined hearts and souls. And in groups.'

-Brooks, 2015

C resource and a state of being. 'Community is an outward and visible sign ommunity doesn't just happen in schools. It is simultaneously a fragile of an inward and invisible grace, the flowing of personal identity and integrity into the world of relationships' (Palmer, 1998, p. 90). These networks of relationships bind people to one another and to important ideas and work.

The  modern  sense  of  schools  as  communities is relatively new. Not long ago, the individual  teacher  was  the  center  of  most attempts  to  improve  the  quality  of  teaching and learning in schools. Today, new promise is held in the growing recognition of the power of  school-based  professional  communities  to support  teacher  development  and  improve student  learning.  Louis,  Marks,  and  Kruse (1996)  found  that  professional  communities in schools are characterized by a shared sense of purpose,  a  collective  focus  on  student learning,  collaborative  activity,  deprivatized practice,  and  reflective  dialogue.  Such  communities develop collective responsibility for student learning, producing schoolwide gains in student achievement.

turing do not necessarily result in student learning. In fact, he finds only a weak relationship between  the  two.  Reorganizing  the  school  by modifying  schedules,  grouping  patterns,  and teaching  arrangements  does  not  automatically ensure a collaborative climate.

Rosenholtz  (1989)  found  that  a  major difference  between  stuck  schools  and  moving schools  is  teacher  talk  and  teacher  efficacy. Studying  secondary  schools,  Little  and  McLaughlin  (1993)  found  that  teacher  membership in a learning community is strongly related to student learning in specific subject areas and at  entire  schools,  significantly  exceeding  the learning  of  control  groups.  However,  Elmore (1995)  cautions  that  efforts  at  school  restruc-

True collaboration arises from beliefs and skills.  In  this  dynamic,  teachers  are  reinventing  instruction  and  cocreating  responses  to educational  dilemmas.  We  have  stressed  that for  professional  community  to  exist,  teachers must talk. Equally important, however, is what they talk about. We have identified the sources for professional  conversations  that  lead  to improved student learning. It seems that when teachers  talk  about  real  students,  real  student work,  and  ways  to  reinvent  instruction  to support  greater  student  learning,  achievement soars.

Developing  school  communities  is  even more  complex,  because  all  group  members belong to other groups as well. The site-based decision-making team has members who think of themselves as primary teachers, special education  teachers,  parents,  administrators,  taxpayers, and many other roles. To be a member of  a  given  group,  each  individual  must  sort

out and resolve conflicting loyalty and identity issues. This is a central 'Who am I?' question that each group member must clarify.

David  Brooks  (2015)  notes  that  community  contributes  to  character  development  for students  and  cites  the  Denver  School  of  Science  and  Technology  (where  one  of  us  has  a niece) and the Leaders School in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn,  as  exceptional  examples.  Patterns we have described in Adaptive  Schools  forge similar  benefits.  Just  a  few  of  these  are  allocentrisim, working for the benefit of the whole, valuing differences, norms emerging not from rules but from shared understandings of one another, and effective ways of working together.

## The Principles of Community

Creating communities requires vision, values, perseverance, hard work, and time. Community doesn't just happen. Sergiovanni (1994) notes  that  schools  are  more  like  a  functional family than a fast-food chain. Like any healthy family, a community requires work to develop it and keep it together. We offer the following seven principles in this important journey:

- 1. Community doesn't just happen.
- 2. Community is the other face of conflict.
- 3. Diversity enriches community.
- 4. Both things and energy matter.
- 5. We cannot not be connected.
- 6. Community lives within.
- 7. Community doesn't last forever.

## Community Doesn't Just Happen

If  values  are  the  heart  of  a  community, communication is the pulse, bones, and physiology.  Most  teaching  groups,  isolated  from peers for so many years, need to learn ways of talking  together.  The  task  is  complicated,  because it requires at least four languages. First is the language of emotion and passion, providing speech  for  what  moves  us.  After  nearly  two thousand years in Western civilization, the role of emotion in professional life and its necessity for sound decision making is finally being legitimized by Goleman (1995), Damasio (1994), and  others.  Second  is  the  language  of  logic and analysis, to apply a variety of perspectives in  reasoned  reflection  and  planning.  Third  is the  language  of  dialogue,  to  develop  shared understanding;  and  fourth  is  the  language  of discussion,  to  make  decisions  that  stay  made. Dialogue  and  discussion  are  ways  of  talking that are fundamental to the success of any community (see chapter 5).

Developing community also requires paying  attention  to the environmental  aspects described  in  chapter  8.  Teachers  need  space and  time  to  collaborate.  Darling-Hammond (1997)  describes  how  'push-in'  efforts  in  a number  of  restructuring  elementary  and  high schools  allow  more  time  for  collaboration, involve staying with the same students for two or  more  years,  and  provide  teaching  teams with  distributed  expertise.  These  schools  are eliminating 'pull-out' services to students, and special staff members are reassigned to reduce teacher-pupil  classroom  ratios.  Darling-Hammond describes an elementary school in Chicago in which the teachers teach four full days of academic classes each week and spend the fifth  day  planning  in  multigrade  teams  as  the students rotate to resource classes in music, fine arts,  computer lab, physical education, library science, and science lab.

At an elementary school in South Carolina, the  teachers  have  eighty  minutes  per  day  for planning. In Cincinnati, an elementary staff reorganized the schedule to free up five and a half hours per week for planning time and reduced the pupil-teacher ratio to fifteen to one by using  push-in  strategies. We've  even  heard  of  a school in the central valley of California where an impenetrable fog sometimes delays the start of school. Buses are delayed until visibility is safe.  School leaders realized that if fog could keep the kids home, so could the teachers' need for collaborative work time. Once a week, now,

the schools in the district have a 'teachers' fog day.'

Only 32 percent of instructional-staff time in  traditional  high  schools  is  spent  teaching, compared  to  60  percent  to  85  percent  of staff  time  in  elementary  schools,  intermediate schools,  and  alternative  high  schools,  according  to  Cooper,  Sarrel,  and Tetenbaum  (1990). Yet  high  schools,  too,  are  creating  more  time for  the  school's  major  purpose:  teaching. The same study finds that nonteaching time in traditional high schools is not spent on collaborative planning  and  curriculum  work,  which  is  the case  in  other  countries.  Changing  this  is  not easy, yet restructuring high schools are modifying these realities, most often at a great cost in terms of the psychological effects of change.

Darling-Hammond (1997) describes International  High  School,  in  which  the  principal, the  assistant  principals,  and  all  the  other  staff work with students in advisory councils. Guidance counselors are attached to teaching teams. The  librarian  is  a  teacher  with  classes.  Fulltime teachers constitute 67 percent of the staff. At  Central  Park  East  Secondary  School,  virtually everyone works with students, and fulltime teachers constitute 73 percent of the staff. Darling-Hammond observes the following:

Shared  time  for  planning,  professional  development,  and  governance  is  much  more extensive in the restructured schools. In International  High  School,  cluster  teachers  share 70 minutes of planning time daily and a half day  each  week  for  staff  development  and collective  work  while  students  are  in  clubs. (1997, p. 185)

To  accomplish  the  structural  changes  described  above  requires  more  than  communication skills. Communities must keep their values clear  and  continue  developing  the  resources  to see themselves and their students through rough times.  Not  the  least  of  these  resources  are  the five  energy  sources  for  high  performance  that we  have  discussed:  efficacy,  flexibility,  craftsmanship, consciousness, and interdependence.

## Community Is the Other Face of Conflict

Community  and  conflict  are  intertwined. Conflict is a manifestation of interdependence; without  people's  need  for  one  another,  there would be no conflict. Conflict is necessary in order to have community. Conflict forges new lifeforms.  Canyons,  beaches,  and  mountains are created from conflicting energies. Because human conflict is uncomfortable, groups often seek to avoid it. When they do so, they live in a state of community building that Scott Peck (1987) calls pseudocommunity. This is a stage of extensive  politeness.  Being  comfortable is  the  goal.  Members  of  pseudocommunities ignore or make light of problems, withholding their true feelings. They ignore individual differences and avoid people or issues that make them uncomfortable.

Groups  move  from  this  stage  by  asking transition questions: 'Who are we?' 'Why are we doing this?' 'What is our purpose?' Challenging  nominalizations  and  generalizations will  also  move the group to the next stage of development: chaos.

Peck's  use  of  the  term chaos is  different from, but not totally unlike, the meaning of the term  in  quantum  physics:  a  dynamic  system  in which  many  variables  are  constantly  interacting-each  affecting  another,  which  affects  another, and so on. In Peck's model, chaos is a time of fighting and struggling. Differences move into the open. Most often the fighting at this stage is neither  respectful  nor  skillful.  Members  try  to convert others to their views. They demonstrate fix-it behaviors and try to heal. Others resist the attempts  to  change.  They  look  for  someone  to blame and develop cliques and alliances.

Groups  have  two  choices  at  this  point: to  move  toward  community  or  away  from  it. Many  groups  and  leaders  attempt  to  achieve peace  by  overregulating  potential  problems. Organizations attempt to resolve differences by developing policies, structuring committees, and establishing chains of command, but these treat only the surface manifestations of conflicts.

The way toward community at this point is  through  engaging conflict and embracing it with special tools. Peck calls this stage emptiness.  Members empty themselves of the need to convert or fix others. They empty themselves of the need to control, of the sense that there is one right way, of ideologies, and of prejudices against  other  people.  Members  empty  themselves of barriers to communication and work to  make  a  transition  from  rigid  individualism to an acceptance of interdependence. Individualism is valued, but so is collegiality. Ways are sought to achieve the best of both worlds. Silence is an asset. Also prominent in the toolkit are the metacognitive strategies of suspension and the balcony view (see chapter 5). Concepts about and tools for conflict (see chapter 12) are also helpful.

At  Peck's  next  stage,  groups  realize  true community. Here people are open, lucid, vulnerable,  and  creative.  They  bond  together across their differences for common purposes.

## Diversity Enriches Community

Healthy  biological  cultures  are  diverse. Monocultures are at greatest risk for disease and trauma. If  only  one  type  of  pine  tree  grows  in the forest, then one species of insect, fungus, or other parasite can destroy all the trees. Botanists cross-pollinate, splice genes, and graft stems to different root stocks to increase the resistance to pestilence and disease. On the edges of ecosystems,  at  points  of  transition  between  habitats, lifeforms are the most profuse and evolving.

As  long  as  the  group  and  its  subgroups know that they are a system, diversity of cognitive style, educational beliefs, ethnicity, culture, gender, role, and age increase the quality of group decisions and offerings to students. In fact, there are some indications that a staff that is  too  heavily  weighted  with  males  will  have greater difficulty working collaboratively than a  group  that  has  more  gender  balance  (Louis and Kruse, 1995).

Diverse ideas help groups to form rich responses  to  educational  perplexities.  Disagree- ments  that  focus  on  substantive,  issue-related differences  of  opinion  actually  improve  team cohesiveness,  commitment,  and  effectiveness. Disagreements  that  become  expressed  as  personal attacks or judgments about others, however, insert a destructive energy flow into group work. What groups need to know and be able to do in order to engage in cognitive conflict without affective conflict includes the collaborative norms (see chapter 4), dialogue and discussion (see chapter 5), and using conflict as a resource (see chapter 12).

## Both Things and Energy Matter

Throughout this book we have advocated building  the  energy  resources  of  schools;  yet energy  is  not  enough.  Prairie  Ridge  High School in the Crystal Lake District in Illinois was designed as an adaptive facility, capable of supporting independent and interdependent activities within the building (Saban et al., 1998). Constructed to operate as an 1,800-student high school,  the  building  can  also  be  transformed to  work  as  two  900-student  schools  or  four 450-student schools. The thoughtful placement of special spaces, such as science labs, and the flexibility of interior walls that are not weight bearing  make  this  so.  Prairie  Ridge  was  designed  to  serve  the  relationships  among  the mind (classroom and academic areas), the body (physical education and athletic areas), and the spirit (the theater and art area).

Each of these areas is zoned to be able to act  independently  from  the  others,  yet  in  the course of a normal school day the three areas interdependently  form  a  total  learning  community. In addition, each area contains design elements to support the staff and the students in developing the five energy sources of high performance:  efficacy,  flexibility,  craftsmanship, consciousness,  and  interdependence.  A  prime example of this is the lack of separate offices for each academic department. Teachers share a well-provisioned common preparation area.

Although  this  example  is  exceptional  in its  scope  and  execution,  things  do  matter  in

achieving educational aims. The 'surround,' as David Perkins (1992) terms it, is tantamount to being a thinking member of the human community, interacting in countless ways to influence human learning.

One of the authors is reminded of his first year as a fully credentialed teacher. The principal met him outside the building on the first day of school and asked, 'Are your desks in rows?' Trembling  with  anger  and  anxiety,  the  young teacher asked if the conversation could be continued in the principal's office. Once there, he asserted  that  he  understood  his  role  to  be  the responsibility for learning in that class, and if that was the case, he would decide the furniture arrangement that would best suit that purpose.

Values matter. Values have life as energy. Statements  of  mission  and  beliefs  are  things that  are  printed,  framed,  and  hung  on  the wall. Things without energy are not enough; the things must support the energy. To focus group  energy  we  offer  the  following  tipsbased on our work over the last decade with many seminar participants and group leaders in a variety of settings-for setting and maintaining goal focus:

- 1. Adopt the meeting standards (see chapter 6).
- 2. Rotate  the  facilitator  and  recorder  roles (see chapter 6).
- 3. Select  one  or  two  of  the  collaborative norms to develop (see chapter 4).
- 4. Decide what is nonnegotiable.
- 5. Teach the essentials of group development (see chapter 9).
- 6. Provide space, tools, and time.
- 7. Lighten up: Laugh a lot, learn from experience, and locate power within the group.

## We Cannot Not Be Connected

If  there  is  no  other,  there  will  be  no self.  If  there  is  no  self,  there  will  be none to make distinctions.

- -Chuang Tzu, Chinese philosopher

Wherever we look, we find only ourselves. This appears to be true at every level of organization of which we can conceive.

Physicist  Fritjof  Capra  (1982),  writing about quantum theory, explains that subatomic particles are not  isolated  grains  of  matter. Rather,  they  'are  probability  patterns,  interconnections  in  an  inseparable  cosmic  web that includes the human observer and her consciousness' (pp. 91-92).

Albert  Einstein  disclosed  that  even  space and  time  are  products  of  our  five  senses.  We see and touch things and experience events in sequential order.

Depak  Chopra  (1993)  advises  that  the atoms of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen that you exhale were, just a moment ago, locked up in solid matter. 'Your stomach, liver, heart,  lungs  and  brain  are  vanishing  into  thin air, being replaced as quickly and endlessly as they are being broken down' (p. 9).

Scientists  and  sages  seek  to  understand  a universal  connectedness  in  which  individual entities exist but have no separation. About the process  of  self-creation,  Wheatley  and  Kellner-Rogers (1996) say the following:

Differentness comes into the world, a desire to be something separate. From a unified field, individual notions of self arise. This process, like all those that describe self, is enticingly paradoxical.  First, something  appears  for which there is  no  known  antecedent. Where does the self that is organizing originate? Or why  does  it  attempt  to  separate  itself  from the  unified  fields?  Why  does  this  movement toward differentiation even start? (p. 51)

Aikido master Thomas Crum recommends that personal  boundaries  not  determine  our identity.  Boundaries  are  misperceived  if  we interpret  them  as  separations  from  others.  If the self does not remember its connectedness, it will expire. Each act of ours creates the conditions for other lives.

Capra  (1996)  reminds  us  that  to  understand our essential interdependence is to understand our relationship to other people and other

things. 'It requires the shifts in perception that are  characteristic  of  systems  thinking-from parts  to  the  whole,  from  objects  to  relationships, from contents to patterns' (p. 298).

## Community Lives Within

As  a  friend  of  ours  used  to  say,  'This one  is  an  inside  job.'  Being  in  community involves a tension, nearly always present, between self-assertion and integration. It requires an  acceptance  of  the  self  as  both  whole  and part,  a  dichotomy  described  by Arthur  Koestler  (1972)  as  holonomy. The  word holonomy comes from the Greek holos , meaning 'whole,' and on , meaning 'part.' This conveys a combination of opposites, functioning autonomously while  working  interdependently. Although  all five  energy  sources  contribute  to  consciously holonomous living, interdependence makes the most direct contribution.

Ultimately,  the  success  of  individuals depends on the success of the community as a  whole,  and  the  success  of  the  community depends  on  the  growth  and  development  of each member.

There  seems  to  be  no  objective  reality; perception  combined  with  intention  creates reality. As you see a thing, that is what you will have. As you describe a thing, that is what you will see.

## Community Doesn't Last Forever

Of one thing we are certain: Things change. Experiences  accumulate;  learning  occurs  at different  rates  in  different  areas  for  different people.  Life  stages  bring  new  developmental challenges to the young adult, the middle-age professional,  and  the  person  near  retirement. Although community is robust and can prevail for long periods, it is also fragile and subject to changing conditions. Groups that lose their capacity to work effectively with conflict plunge back into chaos. They can recover, move back toward organizing conflict away, or move into pseudocommunity. Wheatley and Kellner-Rogers (1996) ask the following questions:

As we act together  in  the  world,  our  organization's  identity  grows  and  evolves.  It helps periodically to question what we have become. Do we still love this organization? Do  we  each  organize  our  work  from  the same  shared  sense  of  what  is  significant? We return to the place where our community took form, where we first became inspired by what we could be in the world. From remembering  that  place,  together  we  can  decide what we want to be now. (p. 62)

## Widening Our View

We've  been  talking  about  collaboration and  being  in  true  community  as  the  cutting edge  of  our  work,  the  leading  edge  of  professional  learning.  Yet  it  might  be  the  oldest story of all human stories. Our ancestors on the plains of Africa lived in collaborative communities: the hunters and the gatherers, the fishers and the cooks, the weavers and the spinners, all working together and sharing a life.

What  are  the  organizers  for  community? For West African cultures, it is the drum. It is from these  cultures  that  drumming  music  has become  an  essential  element  in  the  music  of much of the world: In South America, Central America, and North America, the beat is present.  The  Afro-Cuban  rhythms  sound  through salsa, blues, jazz, rock, and country music. The essential difference in the music of the villages of  West  Africa  is  that  the  beat  is  polyrhythmic-twos, threes, and fours, interacting, intertwining, setting the rhythms for the dance. As West African women pound corn, the children don't mimic the beat, they clap and pat counter rhythms, seeking their voice within the village.

To  be  a  drummer  in  this  culture  is  to  be a  person  of  distinction.  For  the  drummer  not only keeps the rhythm but also knows the history  of  the  people. The  drummer calls people to the dance by naming their ancestors: Bring all  of  who  you  are  to  the  center  and  dance.

The tradespeople are called to the dance with their own signature rhythm-the carpenter, the potter, the weaver, the shepherd. The dancers, too, play off the beat, adding their own rhythm to  the  mix.  The African  dancer  picks  up  and responds to the rhythms of one or more drums, depending on his or her skill. In the best dancing, the dancer, like the drummer, adds another rhythm, one that is not already there. The dancer's ear is tuned to hidden beats, responding to gaps in the music (Chernoff, 1981).

You  don't  have  to  dance  on  the  beat  to be  part  of  the  village,  but  you  are  expected to  honor  the  beat  and  blend  your  movement with the movements of others. In fact, to dance with disregard for the beat is considered to be mentally  disturbed,  because  this  represents  a breakdown of communication, awareness, and community. The goal is to find the beat, honor the beat, add your voice, and dance. Welcome to the dance!
