## Specific Cognitive Operations

Questions invite different levels of complexity of thinking. Embedded in questions are certain syntactical cues that signal and invite behavior or thinking processes. Skillful coaches deliberately use these linguistic tools to engage and challenge complex thinking. (This will be further elaborated in chapter 8; see figure 8.1).

Table 3.1 illustrates this process. In the first column, Input, are the datagathering cognitive operations. In the second column, Process, are the cognitive operations by which meaning is made of the data. The third column, Output, invites speculation, elaboration, and application of concepts in new and hypothetical situations.

Table 3.2 shows some examples of questions intended to engage certain cognitive operations.
