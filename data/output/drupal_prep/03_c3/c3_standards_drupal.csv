The development of compelling and supporting questions is a sophisticated intellectual activity. Students, particularly before middle school, will need considerable guidance and support from adults to construct questions that are suitable for inquiry. Beginning in grade 6, students should be able to take increasing responsibility for their learning so that by grade 12 they are able to construct questions and plan inquiries more independently. Questions are just the starting point for an inquiry. To develop an inquiry, students will also determine the data sources needed to help answer compelling and supporting questions. The five indicators in Dimension 1 describe the questioning and planning skills needed to initiate inquiry.

Participation and Deliberation: Applying Civic Virtues and Democratic Principles Civics teaches the principles—such as adherence to the social contract, consent of the governed, limited government, legitimate authority, federalism, and separation of powers—that are meant to guide official institutions such as legislatures, courts, and government agencies. It also teaches the virtues—such as honesty, mutual respect, cooperation, and attentiveness to multiple perspectives—that citizens should use when they interact with each other on public matters. Principles such as equality, freedom, liberty, respect for individual rights, and deliberation apply to both official institutions and informal interactions among citizens. Learning these virtues and principles requires obtaining factual knowledge of written provisions found in important texts such as the founding documents of the United States. It also means coming to understand the diverse arguments that have been made about these documents and their meanings. Finally, students understand virtues and principles by applying and reflecting on them through actual civic engagement— their own and that of other people from the past and present.

Influences on Thought and Behavior There is no simple answer to the question, “What determines or constrains human behavior?” Psychologists have long considered the extent to which human behavior is malleable and the degree to which it varies between people and populations. Psychologists examine genetic predispositions to behavioral patterns, but human behavior is also influenced by the environment. Research has shown that biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors play important roles in shaping the way we see and react to the world around us.

Brief Overview of Connections between Psychology and the English Language Arts/Literacy Common Core Standards Connections with the College and Career Readiness (CCR) Anchor Standards. Students in psychology develop and use a wide range of skills endorsed through the Common Core Anchor Standards. Students in psychology must develop questions and plan inquiries as they learn about and apply the various psychological theories and findings. Students should be able to propose, plan, and conduct simple research projects and/or read, discuss, and critique research findings in ways that apply their acquired content knowledge and hone the skills discussed in the Anchor Standards in Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Language. Students who complete such projects or assignments successfully demonstrate mastery of the skills in each dimension, thus fulfilling the goals for college and career readiness. More detailed curricular recommendations are found in the National Standards for High School Psychology Curricula (APA, 2011). Although psychological science can be found in science and social studies lessons for students in grades K-8, the first formal introduction to psychological science often occurs during grades 9-12. Learning the theories, methodologies, and practices of psychological science provides students with knowledge and skills they need to think critically about research, address issues using the scientific method, and understand relationships among variables in given circumstances.

Social Structure: Culture, Institutions, and Society Sociology studies the social structure and culture of societies in order to understand how social patterns are created and maintained over time; examples of these might include persistent violence or long-standing disparities in school achievement. Important components of social structures are institutions such as the economy, government and politics, the educational system, the family, religion, and the health care system. Culture includes the language, norms, values, and material goods of a society. Social structure and culture work in tandem to shape societies, but are not completely rigid.

Social Relationships: Self, Groups, and Socialization A fundamental insight of sociology is that individual and group identity is socially constructed through relationships with significant individuals, groups, and society as a whole. Socialization is a life-long process of learning how to function in society. Important socializing agents include family, peers, the media, schools, and religion. Major social and historical events can be a force in socializing entire generational groups. Groups form when individuals share common interests and/ or goals, and often become a point of comparison for individuals as they evaluate themselves and others.

Brief Overview of Connections between Sociology and the English Language Arts/Literacy Common Core Standards Connections with the College and Career Readiness (CCR) Anchor Standards. Students in sociology develop and use skills that are central to the Common Core College and Career Readiness Anchor Standards. Learning the theories, methodologies, and practices of sociology provides students with the knowledge and skills they need to think critically about the world they live in, themselves, and how they are influenced by their social positions. By studying sociology, students learn how to effectively participate in a diverse and multi-cultural society, and develop a sense of personal and social responsibility. Students in sociology integrate and evaluate multiple sources of information presented in diverse formats and media in order to address questions or solve complex problems. They are required to integrate data and information from diverse sources, both primary and secondary, in order to form a coherent and empirically- based understanding of an idea or social event, noting discrepancies among sources. Students learn how to propose, plan, and conduct simple research and action projects as well as read, discuss, and critique research findings in ways that apply their acquired content knowledge and hone the skills discussed in the Anchor Standards in Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Language. More detailed curricular recommendations for sociology can be found on the website of the American Sociological Association (www.asanet.org/highschool). Although concepts from sociology are frequently seen in science and social studies lessons for students in grades K-8, more commonly the first formal introduction to sociology occurs in grades 9-12. Learning the theories, methodologies, and practices of sociology provides students with the knowledge and skills they need to think critically about sources of evidence, address issues using a systematic Arc of Inquiry based on the scientific method, and understand relationships among variables in complex social contexts. In this way, sociology supports students’ successful entry into the world of work or post-secondary education.
