## The Mediator's Skills

The brain's many regions are connected by some 100,000 miles of fibers called white matter-enough to circle the earth four times.

E merging findings in the neurosciences are providing confirmation about why certain Cognitive Coaching linguistic and nonverbal practices foster cognitive development. A skillful coach uses certain well-crafted verbal and nonverbal mediational tools to facilitate others' cognitive growth. All are used without judgment; all are intended to sustain a colleague's access to the highest possible neocortical intellectual functions and body-mind intelligence. These tools can be categorized into four groups: paralanguage, response behaviors, structuring, and mediative questioning. This chapter examines each of these coaching tools and describes their positive effects on intellectual growth.

Rapport refers to vocal qualities, body gestures, and other verbal and nonverbal behaviors that exist alongside the words we speak. It may modify or nuance meaning of the spoken word and can be expressed consciously or unconsciously. (The prefix para means 'alongside.') When confronted with conflicting verbal and nonverbal messages, humans inevitably choose the meaning behind the nonverbal behavior. Glaser (2014) notes that conversations trigger physical and emotional changes in our brains and bodies, releasing either oxytocin, which fosters bonding and

collaboration, or cortisol, a hormone that evokes stress and fear. Knowing about paralanguage is one important element in establishing rapport with a person being coached, as without a degree of psychological comfort, the coachee is unable to access and express her thinking.

Response behaviors refer to verbal responses to another person's communications. These response behaviors are important because they convey nonjudgmental interest in what the coachee is expressing. Five types of verbal responses are helpful in mediating thinking:

- Silence, through wait time and listening
- Acknowledging, both nonverbally and verbally
- Paraphrasing, such as acknowledging, summarizing, organizing, shifting levels, and empathizing
- Clarifying, by seeking meanings and specificity
- Providing data and resources, thus facilitating the acquisition of information through primary and secondary sources

Structuring establishes the parameters of time, space, and purposes. These structuring decisions allow the coachee to predict consequences and thereby offer him the elements of safety that are so important to removing perceived threat according to findings by neuroscientists (Rock 2008; Aguilar 2014).

Mediative questioning helps coaches to construct and pose questions intended to engage thinking. Mediative questions assume and potentially evoke positivity and a growth mind-set in the teacher (Dweck 2006).

If the coach is not yet well acquainted with the coachee, it is important to take time to establish a positive relationship and build a bond of trust between them. (Establishing trust will be explored in greater detail in chapter 6.) Humble inquiry (Schein 2013) is the fine art of drawing someone out, of asking questions the answers to which are not already known by either party, of building a relationship based on curiosity and interest in the other person. The coach will spend time finding out more about a colleague's background, philosophy, and interests as well as share personal information about himself/herself.

Schein asserts that humility refers to granting someone else a higher status than one claims for oneself. Thus the coach assumes that teachers know more about their students, more about the content that they teach, and more about their own skills, styles, preferences, and strengths than does the coach. Thus, the coach, intentionally employing the processes of listening empathically and questioning instead of telling, initiates a

positive and friendly relationship with the new coachee.
