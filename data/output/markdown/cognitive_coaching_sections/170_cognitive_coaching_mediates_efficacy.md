## Cognitive Coaching Mediates Efficacy

These descriptors provide a vision of the desired state toward which coaches can facilitate growth. One value of efficacy and the resulting selfconfidence is that teachers are free to be more flexible. Flexibility is critically important for any creative work in which one wants to see the overall pattern as well as the details.

Studies of Cognitive Coaching consistently find significant improvements in teacher efficacy. Efficacy may be the most catalytic of the five states of mind because a person's sense of efficacy is a prime factor in determining how complex problems are resolved. If a teacher feels little efficacy, then despair, hopelessness, blame, withdrawal, and rigidity are likely to follow. However, research indicates that teachers with robust efficacy are likely to expend more energy in their work, persevere longer, set more challenging goals, and continue in the face of barriers or failure. In sum, efficacy is characterized by the following:

- Efficacy is related to specific areas, such as teaching math or working with middle school kids.
- Efficacy is related to doing certain types of tasks, such as getting things organized, so a person may feel efficacious in one context and not in another.
- Efficacy changes over time with influences from new information and task experiences.
- Personal efficacy stems from self-assessment of teaching skills and influences the effort that teachers expend working with students.
- Personal efficacy also is achieved by professional development: learning about subject matter, pedagogy, students, and self.
- Outcome efficacy stems from self-assessments of teaching results. When teachers (or students) are involved in developing the criteria for performance, there is a greater likelihood that they will become selfmanaging and self-monitoring.
- Outcome efficacy influences teachers to modify instruction.
- Outcome efficacy is enhanced through creating learning communities in which teachers collaborate to improve instruction.
- Highly efficacious persons are frequently optimistic, less stressed, able to persevere through difficulties to achieve results, high achievers, self-actualizing, and self-modifying.

Efficacy is a prerequisite for improved student learning. Fullan (1982) regards teacher efficacy as a vital factor in the successful implementation of change. Rosenholtz (1989) found that teachers' efficacy influenced students' basic skills and mastery. The more certain teachers feel about their technical knowledge (personal efficacy), the greater the students' progress in, for example, reading. The more teachers are uncertain, the less students learn.

One study on the relation between efficacy and curriculum implementation showed that teachers' efficacy and interdependence significantly predicted the implementation of new curriculum guides (Poole and Okeafor 1989). Neither efficacy nor teacher interactions (interdependence) alone produced a significant difference in use of the curriculum, but together they brought about change.

In the Rand Corporation's seminal research on school effectiveness, Berman and McLaughlin (1977) found that collective teacher efficacy was the single most consistent variable related to school success. The efficacy identified by the Rand Corporation study is what Fuller, Wood, Rapoport, and Dornbusch (1982) label 'organizational efficacy,' or the link between

people's perceptions of valued goals and their expectations that those goals can be achieved by participating in the organization (outcome efficacy).

Laborde and Saunders (1986) report that people governed by an internal locus of control (see chapter 8) show initiative in controlling their environment. They control their own impulsivity, gather information, are cognitively active, eagerly learn information that will increase their probability for success, and show a sense of humor. Compared to individuals with an external locus of control, they are more trustful, less anxious, less hostile, less angry, less suspicious of others, less prone to suicide, less depressed, and less prone to psychosis.
