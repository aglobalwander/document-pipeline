## Who Can Be a Mediator?

Skilled in the beliefs, maps, principles, and tools of mediation, anyone can assume the role of mediator for another's self-directed learning. Thus, mediation can occur between two students, two teachers, two

administrators, a leader and a group member, or a teacher and a studentassuming the skills are present.

When a coaching relationship is established between two professionals with similar roles, or peers, it may be referred to as peer coaching. Cognitive Coaching has a more specific meaning; it refers to the identity that mediators assume, the coaching maps and tools with which they work, the desire for enhancing others' self-directedness that they embrace, and the faith in the human capacity for meaning making that they cherish. Peer coaching describes with whom you coach; Cognitive Coaching defines how you coach.

In an increasing number of educational communities, custodians, school secretaries, bus drivers, parents, students, and cafeteria workers are learning the skills of Cognitive Coaching. In one Michigan school district, the director of maintenance coaches an elementary principal, who in turn coaches a teacher. In a California school district, a superintendent receives monthly coaching from a mentor-teacher. In an international school in Malaysia, the head of schools is coached by a special education teacher.
