## Mediator's Questions for Self-Monitoring

After the event, and if conditions are favorable, the mediator will also take advantage of this opportunity to invite reflection and to maximize insightfulness and meaning making from the experience (see table 4.3). Meaning is made by analyzing feelings and data, comparing results with expectations, finding causal factors, and projecting ahead to how these insights may apply to future situations. Self-modifying implies making a commitment to employ those insights and meanings autonomously in future events and situations (Kegan and Lahey 2001; Kegan 1994).

| Analyze                                                      | What might be some factors that contributed to the lesson's success? How does what happened in the lesson compare to what you predicted would happen? |
| Construct meaning from the experience                        | As a result of this lesson, what insights or new learnings are you forming?                                                                           |
| Apply the learning to future activities tasks and challenges | As you anticipate future lessons of this type, what big ideas will you carry forth to those situations?                                               |
