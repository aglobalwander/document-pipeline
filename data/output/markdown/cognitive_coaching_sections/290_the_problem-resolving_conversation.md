## The Problem-Resolving Conversation

Pacing is first in this conversation. By doing so the coach validates the experience of the colleague, acknowledging in a sense, that whatever feelings and conceptions of reality the colleague is experiencing are true for that person. Pacing the experience of another requires dedicated attention to rapport. Humans appear to be hard-wired for social connection and relationship (Lewis, Amini, and Lannon 2000; Rock 2009). Without

this wiring for connectivity, our brains would be unduly influenced by the release of cortisol, a stress hormone, which would inhibit thinking. The value of this synchronicity is that during pacing, the coachee's brain, in a sense, releases defensive barriers leading to relaxation and openness. Oxytocin is released, leading to feeling connected. During this physiological dance, the coach attends to the four verbal phases of the pace: expressing empathy, reflecting content, inferring and stating a goal, and presupposing a search for a way to get started working toward the goal (i.e., a pathway).

Everything we learned about rapport in chapter 6 becomes extremely important in the problem-resolving conversation. Rapport means setting aside our desire to 'report,' the tendency to be consultants rather than coaches, not to be experts and fixers. Instead, a coach enters the world of the coachee with humility, empathy, and compassion. In pacing, the primary verbal tools of the coach are pausing to provide time for reflection and paraphrasing to deepen thought and develop shared understanding, along with the nonverbal tools of physical alignment (Dolcemascolo et al. 2014). When the limbic system perceives threat, incorrect links of thinking increase (Bolte Taylor 2008). Heart rhythm patterns become erratic and block our ability to think clearly. In pacing, these patterns are reversed. The coach's posture, voice qualities, gesture, facial expressions, breathing rates, and other nonverbal manifestations of human experience communicate acceptance of the other's emotional state. Pacing reflects and honors the other person's experience, which fosters the convergence of heart patterns and high levels of trust (Glaser 2014, 82).

As illustrated in the list that follows, the first two verbal steps are embodied in any well-formed paraphrase. The third is another paraphrase about the coach's inference regarding a goal the colleague desires. The fourth element paraphrases what has been unsaid verbally and presumes a readiness to begin exploring options.

The coach also notices deeper breathing or other signals that the statement, worded as a paraphrase, has shifted the body-mind system into the chemistry of resourcefulness. Reducing the statement to a few words reduces overload on the prefrontal cortex. A brief statement, says Rock (2009) , can foster insight. This phase of the conversation deliberately avoids delving into "the problem because focusing on the problem activates emotions and increases activity in the limbic system, blocking prefrontal work. Reframing and relief occurs from focusing onamore global desired state. 'good goal goal |

- 2.  Accurately reflect the speaker's content: ' . . . because you have so many things on your plate you can't keep up . . .'
- 3.  State the goal that you infer the speaker is trying to achieve: 'What you want is to be in control of your time and your work . . .'
- 4.  Presuppose readiness to find a pathway to attain the goal: 'So you're searching for a way to make that happen.'

The above scaffold is simple yet often demanding to learn because it may require unlearning some long-held communication patterns. It is also composed entirely of paraphrases. Any question posed at this stage

interrupts the colleague's focus in the story and is experienced as a distraction. Skillful and empathic pacing is essential to effective leading. Repeated and guided practice in pacing is usually necessary for pacing responses to come easily and naturally. Table 12.1 illustrates the neurological effects of the process of pacing.

One reason we recommend making the pace automatic is that pacing is a complex, multifaceted intellectual task. The coach listens to the feelings and context of what is being expressed, infers an authentic goal, and decides how to begin the lead. The five states of mind serve the coach as a template to initiate a lead statement or question. When verbal and nonverbal messages are congruent and related to both goal and pathway, the coach knows she/he can start the lead.
