## Chapter 13  Capacities for School Change

T developing the underlying capacities for school change. To be adaptive, he essential notion of adaptivity (see chapters 1 and 2) frames the work of schools and school personnel must continually clarify their identities and not  be  attached  to  form.  Earlier  chapters  examined  fundamental  strategies  for carrying out this work. In this chapter we expand on the what of adaptivity-the twelve capacities for school change. The first six capacities are organizational, and the last six are professional. They are as follows:

- 1.  Vision, values, and goal focus;
- 2.  Systems thinking;
- 3.  Initiating and managing adaptation;
- 4.  Interpreting and using data;
- 5.  Developing and maintaining collaborative cultures;
- 6.  Gathering and focusing resources;

is never a case of either-or, but always a case of  both-and.  We  are  persuaded  that  all  the staff  development  in  the  world,  and  all  the knowledge and skill building that we provide to individuals, will have only minimal impact if  districts and schools do not also put energy and resources into altering the deep structure of the organization.

- 7.  Collegial interaction;
- 8.  Cognitive processes of instruction;
- 9.  Knowledge of the structure of the discipline;
- 10.  Self-knowledge, values, beliefs, and standards;
- 11.  A repertoire of teaching skills;
- 12.  Knowledge of students and how they learn.

The  twelve  capacities  for  school  change interact  with  one  another  and  cannot  be  addressed in isolation if schools and professionals are  to  become  increasingly  adaptive  in response to the changing needs of the students they  serve.  These  capacities  are  living  examples of the dynamical principle that everything influences everything else.

The  six  organizational  capacities  and  the six  professional  capacities  form  a  synergistic whole  that  must  be  continually  addressed.  It

At the beginning of this book (see chapter 2) we  introduced  three  focusing  questions: Who are we? Why are we doing this? Why are we doing this this way? The answers to these questions are the short response to the how of adaptivity  in  schools.  The  twelve  capacities make up the long answer.

Steven  Covey  (1989)  reminds  us  of  the need to balance production and production capacities. His retelling of the fable of the farmer who killed the goose that laid the golden egg points to the ongoing need to develop the capabilities to do important work as much as the need to do the work itself. If we are not careful, the  'goose'  of  school  improvement  will  die from a lack of food and water.

This is a perennial problem in schools that are starved for time: to do the important work for  students  and  to  support  continual  adult and organizational learning. We will make the case here that time is just one element in the

puzzle.  Many  factors  organize  time  choices; the clock and the calendar are only two of the elements at work.

Schools are living organisms, and like all healthy living organisms they are characterized by continual flow and changes in their metabolism  that  involve  thousands  of  biochemical reactions.  Stable  systems  are  dying  systems (Capra,  1996).  In  scientific  terms,  chemical and  thermal  equilibrium  leads  to  death.  Vital schools,  like  all  living  organisms,  continually maintain themselves in a state far from equilibrium. This is the state of life. Stability emerges through the average, over time, of the ebb and flow of energy through the system. Attention to the six organizational capacities for adaptivity and the six professional capacities for adaptivity helps this energy flow.

As you read this chapter, please have in mind  some  of  the  persistent  problems  you see  in  the  schools  around  you.  As  with  the languishing  high  school  profiled  earlier  (see chapter  3),  you  may  notice  particular  capacities  that  are  underdeveloped.  We  hope  that you  also  notice  specific  capacities  that  are well-developed in your settings. The essential question, then, is: Where should leaders now focus the system's attention to make a difference in the situation?

## The Organizational Capacities for Adaptivity

Schools  do  not  develop  organizational capacities  as  abstractions.  They  do  so  by  addressing meaningful problems. Skilled leaders use problems as opportunities for learning. This approach  meets  both  production  and  production capacity needs. Working alongside leaders who  understand  this  informs  our  learning  as well. Recently we spent time with a school that addressed the six organizational capacities (figure 13.1) in the manner described below.

A school that we will call Sea View Elementary  tackled  the  issue  of  low  scores  on  a statewide fourth-grade writing assessment. The test was new to both this school and others in

the state. It emphasized expository writing and using evidence from the text to support one's argument. Although  the  fourth-grade  teachers were not happy about the scores, they were not terribly surprised. When they first saw the test, they realized that the school's writing program had some gaps, given the expectations embedded in the examination. As a clearer picture of student writing performance began to emerge, the  principal  organized  a  series  of  meetings. We  were  fortunate  enough  to  participate  in some of them. Chapter 11 offers some practical approaches to engage others in collecting and analyzing data and ways to structure conversations about data.

The  first  two  organizational  capacitiesvision,  values,  and  goal  focus,  and  systems thinking-forge the context for the other four.

## Vision, Values, and Goal Focus

When we learned about the writing problems at Sea View Elementary, our first question was  'In  what  way  is  this  issue  about  raising test  scores,  and  in  what  way  is  it  about  longterm  improvements  in  student  writing  and  in the  writing  program?'  The  principal  assured us  that  the  change  effort  was  aimed  at  long-

term systemic improvements in the teaching of writing. In fact, she was willing to take some political  heat  from  parents  and  central  office administrators, if necessary, to keep the focus long-term and not just fix what was showing.

Several  other  values  contributed  to  the project's  success,  such  as  a  belief  in  the power of  cumulative  effects  for  learners. As we describe  in  the  systems  thinking  section, collective  efforts  matter.  September  of  the fourth  grade  is  much  too  late  to  start  a  concentrated  writing  program.  The  assessment of the system at that point was viewed by the school as an assessment of the whole, not that specific part.

The other operating value and vision was an  image  of  continual  improvement  for  all students.  The  emerging  writing-skills  matrix was seen as a developmental road map, not as a curriculum to be covered by each grade level in turn. If a third grader had difficulty crafting simple  sentences,  that  is  where  the  teacher started.  Paragraphs  could  wait  until  foundational skills were in place.

## Systems Thinking

The writing problem at Sea View Elementary was soon seen by the teachers as a systems problem. A fledging sense of collective responsibility for student learning motivated the work of  vertical  teams.  K-3  staff  members  were openly  supportive  of  their  fourth-  and  fifthgrade colleagues and agreed to work collaboratively on an improvement plan and effort.

One of the vertical teams produced a draftskills  matrix  for  the  teaching  of  expository writing  and  reasoning  with  textual  evidence. This  systems  view  was  developed  through rotating two-hour planning sessions, with each new team adding to and filling in the gaps in the work of previous teams. Several teachers even came back during their lunch breaks to participate with colleagues on other teams.

One byproduct of this work was increased confidence on the part of the lower-grade teachers that their efforts in developing fundamental writing  skills  would  be  appreciated  by  their upper-grade  colleagues.  When  they  could  see the system of which they were a part displayed in matrix form on the wall of the meeting room, they could see where their efforts led and view with ease their part in the whole.

Upper-grade teachers also benefited when they spotted the gaps in the writing instruction on the grid. One glaring example was the lack of  emphasis  on  expository  forms.  The  state assessment first pointed this out, and the skills matrix reinforced it. This also inspired changes in another part of the system, because the district  writing  rubric  did  not  provide  guidance or  standards  in  this  area.  Several  Sea  View Elementary teachers  volunteered  to  be  on  the revision  committee  to  tackle  the  rubric.  With their  draft-skills  matrix  in  hand,  they  greatly influenced  the  process.  In  the  course  of  this work, they shared their efforts informally with several other schools and engineered a resource swap with teachers in other buildings who were working  on  different  parts  of  the  writing  and literacy-development puzzle.

Systems  thinking  is  a  critical  skill  in  a world  of  messy  problems.  In  this  emerging field, practitioners model systems using mathematics, complex diagrams, and rigorous analysis  of  variables.  Ultimately,  such  work  leads to  leverage  points  in  the  system  that  can  be modified or perturbed enough to positively influence systems change. One challenge here is that both thing and energy models apply to the same system. Finding and modifying systems requires ways of both seeing and acting.

## Initiating and Managing Adaptation

The  principal  at  Sea  View  Elementary intuitively  knew  that  shared  dissatisfaction  is the  first  step  in  initiating  change.  This,  along with shared vision and knowledge of practical tools and strategies, must be strong enough to outweigh the cost of any change.

The  following  simple  formula  (adapted from Beckard and Harris, 1997) captures these factors:

- Change = (A × B × C) &gt; X
- X = the cost of change
- A = shared dissatisfaction
- B = shared vision
- C = knowledge of practical tools and strategies

Without  shared  dissatisfaction,  all  the vision and strategies in the world do not promote a desire  to  change. Too  much  dissatisfaction without practical tools will shut down the  system. Vision  that  is  neither  shared  nor connected to the other two resources sputters out  into  inspirational  vagueness.  All  change has a cost for both individuals and organizations. The left side of the change formula must overcome the right side.

The  work  of  William  Bridges  (1991)  is a useful guide in this area. He points out that change in  organizations is not the problem; it is transitions that  are  bewildering. Transitions are the psychological readjustments to change. They have three phases: (1) endings; (2) a neutral zone; and (3) new beginnings. Each phase has special characteristics and special requirements if it is to be navigated successfully.

Endings  must  be  marked  concretely  and symbolically.  Many  change  processes  stall because the people in the organization have not let go of the old. Curriculum changes in schools often meet this difficulty. Teachers cling to the tried-and-true, and in some cases they hope to leap to the new like a trapeze artist high above the  crowd. They are often unwilling to let go and  hang  suspended  in  midair  with  one  hand on each trapeze.

At Sea View Elementary, the writing meetings  that  were  initiated  marked  a  transition from old ways of working to new ones. They were symbols of a new order and at the same time marked the ending of isolation and scapegoating. The principal did not have to explain this.  Freeing  teachers  for  these  meetings  with substitutes  symbolically  and  practically  conveyed this message.

During  an  ending,  a  group  needs  to  ask, 'Who  is  losing  what  in  this  change?'  and 'Who needs what support to work through the transition?' At Sea View Elementary this took the  form  of  a  change  in  curriculum  materials for  the  language  arts  program.  Although  it was widely recognized that the textbooks were outdated and falling apart, some teachers still needed  an  opportunity  to  express  their  concerns about the new materials and the need for greater  planning  and  lesson  preparation  time. Early  meetings  provided  the  opportunity  for these conversations and the emotional support that was needed by these staff members.

The neutral zone is a time of anxiety and discomfort for many participants, but it is also a  time  of  great  creativity.  At  Sea  View  Elementary,  dialogue,  reflection,  and  the  sharing of practical materials and tools organized this phase. The principal was always supportive and nonjudgmental,  allowing  teachers  to  express their feelings and concerns about increased accountability and their work in progress.

Bridges (1991) reminds us that new beginnings  require  an  acknowledgment  of  the  problem, not a solution. At Sea View Elementary, the writing issue was owned by the staff. In fact, as the teachers began this project, they knew much more about the shortfalls in student writing performance than they did about the solutions.

Bridges (1991) also admonishes readers to remember  the  marathon  effect.  Thousands  of runners compete in the Boston Marathon each year. The world-class runners, with their faster qualifying times, line up at the start of the pack. By  the  time  the  runners  in  the  rear  cross  the starting line, these leaders are several miles up the course.

In  school-change  processes,  early  adapters must remember and pay attention to those who follow. To produce cumulative effects in schools,  these  people  must  pace  themselves and support the learning of their reluctant colleagues. The race is not fully under way until everyone crosses the starting line.

## Interpreting and Using Data

The assessment results from the state had merely  confirmed  the  fourth-grade  teachers'

expectations of low performance by their students. Thus, rather than discounting the results or  questioning  the  validity  of  the  test,  these teachers  began  an  informal  dialogue  with  the principal  and  other  teachers.  Part  of  this  dialogue explored comparisons between the state assessment and writing samples collected from the  fifth-grade  students.  This  in  turn  led  to conversations with the third-grade teachers and an  examination of writing samples from their students.  These  explorations  motivated  teachers'  desire  to  learn  and  apply  more  consistent formative assessments with their students.

As this example illustrates, data can be both quantitative and qualitative. The number of Sea View Elementary students in each performance quartile carried some meaning for the teachers. Actual samples of student writing carried other meaning. In these ways, teachers with a variety of mindsets had the opportunity to engage with the problem in the manner that was best suited to  their  preferences.  Numbers  spoke  to  some people,  whereas  artifacts  of  learning  spoke  to others. See chapter 11 for tips about structuring conversations about data and engaging others in collecting and reporting data.

## Developing and Maintaining Collaborative Cultures

A  sense  of  collaboration  governed  this project from the beginning. A leadership team composed of a cross-section of teachers and the principal organized the project and monitored its  progress.  This  team  steeped  itself  in  the norms  of  collaboration  (see  chapter  4).  They kept communication open among grade levels and  provided  a  bird's-eye  view  of  the  school and the project.

Vertical  teams  attended  the  meetings.  In this  way,  each  group  had  information  about K-5 writing approaches and access to knowledgeable practitioners from every grade level.

At  one  point  it  became  obvious  that  all the  teachers  in  the  school  were  not  teaching and using the same proofreading marks. Group members said, 'You know, we all don't need to talk about this.' So we asked them to name three  people  in  the  school  whom  they  all  respected and who had the technical knowledge to handle this task. They quickly named three people, who agreed to develop a simple set of grade-level appropriate proofing marks for faculty approval at the next whole-group meeting.

## Gathering and Focusing Resources

This  project  demonstrates  the  power  of the capacity to gather and focus resources. Our contract with the district and the school emphasized  the  development  of  collaborative  skills and  process  tools.  Schools  need  an  engaging vehicle  to  carry  this  work. At  Sea  View  Elementary, the principal and leadership team used the writing issue as their mode of transport.

Time and money were budgeted for meetings, for some staff members to attend in-depth training  in  expository  writing,  and  for  new curriculum materials. Other issues in the school that could be set aside were set aside. A bulletin board  in  the  hallway  near  the  office  proudly displayed  an  ever-changing  sampling  of  student  work  in  this  area.  The  parent  newsletter provided updates and progress reports.

One of the innovations that most contributed to project success was the use of substitute teachers and a careful scheduling of the vertical-team  meetings  to  best  align  with  teacher preparation  periods.  In  this  way  the  teachers were free, while school was still in session, to participate  in  two-hour  sessions  for  planning and problem-solving purposes. On most project days this  required  the  services  of  six  to  eight substitutes.

The district staff-development director understood  the  nature  of  this  work  and  readily agreed to cover the cost of substitutes. District staff-development practices are moving beyond the notion of course-based training as the only means of professional development. Time with peers  in  focused  work  sessions  contributes  to learning for all participating adults and simultaneously  supports  direct  payoffs  for  student learning.

## The Professional Capacities for Adaptivity

The professional capacities  for  adaptivity (figure 13.2) work in tandem with the organizational  capacities.  In  the  example  from  Sea View Elementary School, improvements in the writing  program  arose  from  attention  to  both areas.  Within  this  arena,  individual  teachers and teams of teachers set out to become smart about both writing and the teaching of writing.

## Collegial Interaction

Cognitive Processes of Instruction

Figure 13.2. The Six Professional Capacities

## Collegial Interaction

Who teachers are to one another matters. In a  sometimes lonely profession, isolation  in  the individual  cells  of  an  'egg-crate'  school  does not  promote  personal  or  professional  growth. Parallel play might socialize youngsters in sandboxes, but it limits learning for adults.

To  be  a  colleague  requires  sharing  one's knowledge and sharing when one does not have knowledge. It means sharing and creating materials together. It means teaching one another about the craft of teaching. We are still somewhat  surprised  when  we  find  out  how  many teachers  in  a  given  school  have  never  seen another teacher teach. Their experiences of the other teachers consist mostly of passing in the hallways, with or without students in tow.

Study  after  study  (e.g.,  Little  and  McLaughlin,  1993)  stresses  the  importance  of collegial  interaction  for  growth  in  teaching and  growth  in  student  achievement.  Adult learning, like all learning, is both an individual  and  a  collective  act.  Where  collegiality is strong,  communities  of  practice  bloom (Brown,  1994).  These  communities  support distributed  cognition,  which  means that people become smarter together.

At  Sea  View  Elementary  School,  it  was safe not  to know  everything  there  was  to know about teaching writing. Several teachers immersed themselves in learning to teach expository writing. As they tried out these ideas in their classrooms, they shared their successes and shortfalls with other teachers and encouraged them to adopt the techniques that seemed to be working.

A  new  kindergarten  teacher  brought  a wealth of experience in language development for  early  childhood  programs.  The  first-  and second-grade  teachers  opened  up  a  dialogue with  her  as  they  eagerly  awaited  the  next school year(s) and the arrival of these youngsters in their classrooms.

The hallway bulletin board, with its rotating display of student work, became a focal point for conversations  about  student  writing  and  teaching students to write. These conversations led to lesson swapping and more conversations.

Collegiality is different from conviviality. The teachers at Sea View Elementary had both, but  they  didn't  confuse  lunch-table  chatting with  professional  dialogue.  Mindfully  talking about one aspect of the instructional program allowed the school as a community to focus its energy  and  use  talk  as  a  vehicle  for  learning and productive change.

## Cognitive Processes of Instruction

Teaching is a cognitively demanding profession. Decisions made in quiet moments and decisions made on the fly influence success and

failure in the classroom. Many variables add to the complexity of the thinking tasks that confront teachers every day. Planning and reflecting skills energize and organize good teaching.

In planning, teachers consider the following (Borko, Livingston, and Shavelson, 1990):

- 1. Information about students-who they are, what they know and can do;
- 2. The nature of the instructional task-subject matter, activities, materials;
- 3. The  context  of  the  school-class  size, scheduling, grouping;
- 4. Their  own  beliefs-their  conception  of learning, of teaching, and of the particular subject or topic.

In reflecting, skilled teachers  consider three areas: the technical, the practical, and the critical  (Calderhead,  1996).  Technical  reflection  focuses  on  whether  the  objectives  were met,  based  on  specified  criteria  for  success. Practical reflection focuses on the effectiveness of  the  actions  and  the  ends  to  which  those actions  led.  Critical  reflection  focuses  on  the purposes of education and the assumptions that underlie practice.

The 'bookends' of planning and reflecting frame lesson execution. It is here that additional cognitive resolving power pays off for students and  teachers  as  learning  comes  into  focus. A teacher's 'with-it-ness' supplies the necessary cognitive  and  emotional  flexibility  for  maintaining concentration on the big picture while modifying  and  adjusting  along  the  way.  One of the early and ongoing challenges for the Sea View  Elementary  writing  project  was  to  not get hung up on a lesson plan during the actual lesson. Learning to write is a messy business. Following the students and their needs is much more important than following the plan.

Sea  View  Elementary  teachers  are  still hard  at  work  learning  to  plan,  teach,  reflect on,  and  apply  new  understanding  from  their writing-skills matrix. Becoming better teachers of writing calls on all their cognitive processes of instruction.

## Knowledge of the Structure of the Discipline

What  teachers  know  and  can  do  greatly influences student learning. A teacher's knowledge  of  the  structure  of  a  given  discipline translates directly into daily instructional decisions, curriculum choices, and lesson designs. Individual  teachers  teach  different  subjects differently  (Shulman,  1987).  An  elementary teacher's  math  lesson  will  be  structured  and conducted in a manner different from the same teacher's literature circle.

Expert teaching calls for an understanding of the subject matter that is thorough enough to organize the topics so that the students can create meaningful cognitive maps (Darling-Hammond,  1997).  Teachers  with  such  a  level  of knowledge can use it flexibly to address ideas as they come up in the course of teaching. Real learning is messy. Students do not always stay within  or  even  fit  within  the  boundaries  of  a lesson  plan.  Teachers'  knowledge  of  content topics and of fields of learning must therefore always be wider and deeper than that of their students.  This  enables  fluid  movement  within subject  matter  and  enables  responsiveness  to student questions and perceived student needs.

Shulman  (1987)  breaks  down  knowledge of the structure of disciplines into several important  subsets.  One  is  content  knowledge  itself. If the teacher does not know a subject, the students will not come to know it. Another area is knowing the structure of the subject matterthe organizing principles and concepts.

A  second  grader  sorted  out  an  important idea in mathematics one day when he observed with excitement, 'Numbers are made up of other numbers-you can take them apart!' Many second graders never reach this conclusion on their own. It is more likely to happen if their teachers understand this big idea themselves.

It  is  also  important to know the habits of mind in a given field. The principles of inquiry are  different  in  literature  than  they  are  in  the physical sciences. How are ideas developed in social  studies? Who is a valid source in liter-

ary  criticism?  How  do  mathematicians  solve problems? These are all examples of this idea applied to different content areas. This supports students  in  understanding  how  new  ideas  are added  to  a  field  and  how  deficient  ones  are dropped  by  those  who  produce  knowledge  in a domain.

Students,  too,  have  habits  of  mind.  Each content  area  is  a  minefield  of  misconceptions and  error  patterns.  Knowing  these  allows  the expert teacher to anticipate, carefully structure lessons  and  units,  and  respond  appropriately to the fragile half constructions of their novice learners.  Shulman  (1987)  calls  these  adaptations pedagogical  content  knowledge.  This blending of content knowledge, learner knowledge, and teaching knowledge binds the subject matter  to  specific  learning  devices.  Expert teachers draw from a rich menu of analogies, models,  and  explanatory  devices  that  support them  and  their  students  in  representing  ideas and understanding in a variety of ways.

The  writing  project  at  Sea  View  Elementary  struggled  with  all  these  issues.  The teachers'  knowledge  of  writing  and  writing processes grew alongside that of their students. A  practical  developmental  continuum  for  the stages  of  student  writing  began  to  emerge, and the teachers forged important connections between  student  writing  and  other  areas  of literacy,  such  as  student  reading  difficulties. This triggered an inquiry into the structure of the reading program as the teachers wondered aloud about the most appropriate balance of fiction and nonfiction books to use with students at all grade levels. They are still exploring the connections between exposing students to quality  nonfiction  through  guided  reading  experiences and translating that into writing lessons.

## Self-Knowledge, Values, Standards, and Beliefs

Little children playing school vividly demonstrate  beliefs  about  teaching  that  shape the  rules  of  this  play  and  the  power  relationships among the players. When some of these children  grow  up  and  become  real  teachers, their  beliefs,  values,  and  personal  standards will implicitly and explicitly guide their decisions about what and how to teach.

Values  and  beliefs  influence  the  perceptions  and  judgments  that  carry  teachers through  their  days.  They  are  not  always consciously understood or named by individuals,  but  their  presence  simmers  beneath  the surface  of  a  teacher's  practice.  Values  shape the standards that teachers hold for their own work and for that of their students. Values are filters  for  what  elements  of  the  vast  subject matter  are  emphasized  and  reinforced.  Ultimately,  they  are  each  teacher's  true  curriculum and true lasting lessons.

One of the central issues at Sea View Elementary was-and is-What is good writing? This standards issue is an interactive construction  forged  by  individual  teachers  and  their collaborative colleagues. The ebb and flow of changes in their students' writing focuses this clarification  process  while  challenging  their beliefs about teaching and learning. This clarification process is the deepest level of inquiry at Sea View Elementary. Teaching writing is a vehicle for exploring the ways and means of learning about learning, both for students and for adults.

## Repertoire of Teaching Skills

Teaching is a craft skill built on actionknowledge honed by trial and error. It begins with the teacher's own understanding of what is to be learned by students and how this learning  is  most  appropriately  orchestrated  for  the population that is being served. Understanding teaching is a lifetime journey. There is always something  new  to  learn  about  oneself,  one's students, the content, the process, and the dynamic interactions of these elements.

Master teachers, like concert artists, consciously expand their performance repertoires. They  develop  and  assemble  microroutines that can be combined and reconstituted to fit a  variety  of  settings.  These  experts  automa-

tize many routines to free cognitive space for more  complex  perceiving  and  more  sophisticated instructional  problem  solving.  This unconscious competence is the hallmark of an expert in the classroom.

One  of  the  tensions  and  energy  drains for  the  novice  writing  teachers  at  Sea  View Elementary was this very lack of automaticity. Daily  writing  tasks  demanded  that  conscious attention be placed on seemingly mundane lesson details. When everything is important, sensory  overload  sets  in.  Peripheral  vision,  both literal  and  metaphorical,  was  not  a  sufficient resource for managing the physical, emotional, and cognitive demands of high-quality writing instruction at this stage of teacher learning.

## Knowledge of Students and How They Learn

Learners  and  teachers  need  each  other. Each  is  incomplete  without  the  other.  Who they  are  in  this  relationship  forms  a  delicate balance of minds, hearts, and souls. The desire for  smaller  class  sizes  and  smaller  schools  is a  response  to  the  need  to  know  each  other. In  an  increasingly  diverse  world,  direct  and personal knowledge is even more necessary as old assumptions and operating rules lose their guiding power.

All  the  teaching  repertoire  in  the  world is wasted  if  it is not  well-matched  to  the needs  of  learners  (Saphier,  Haley-Speca,  and Gower, 2008). The exploding knowledge about learning  styles,  multiple  intelligences,  developmental  differences,  and  cultural  variation supports Shulman's (1987) notion of the need for pedagogical learner knowledge on the part of all teachers.

Developmental  differences  do  not  end  in the  third  grade.  Grade  by  grade,  the  span,  in Piagetian terms, widens. Many learners in middle school and high school operate at a solidly concrete operational level. They often stumble when  they  bump  head-on  into  a  curriculum organized  by  abstraction  and  taught  through symbol  systems.  When  flexible  teachers  start with the concrete and scaffold learning to the abstract,  these  same  students  grasp  complex ideas and perform at high levels.

Developing culturally respectful teaching  approaches  is  an  increasing  need  in  many schools. Methods and materials that work with one population might confuse or offend another. Language  differences  play  an  important  role here.  One  often  unnoticed  variable  is  the  difference  between  students'  social  discourse  and their  knowledge  of  the  structure  and  norms  of academic discourse. Lee and Fradd (1998) refer to  this  sophisticated  matching  as  instructional congruence.  This  means  that  teachers  mediate the  nature  of  academic  content  with  students' language  and  cultural  experiences. This  makes content accessible, meaningful, and relevant.

Learning about student writers at Sea View Elementary  energized  and  at  times  terrorized the teachers. The more they looked, the more differences  they  spotted.  This  led  to  dialogue and  discussions  about  the  best  ways  to  intervene with individuals-when and how do you coach young writers, and when and how do you consult with them in a more directive manner? Other conversations explored alternative ways to group students for instruction. One direction this  took  was  to  experiment  with  cross-grade groupings for targeted mini-lessons.

## A World of Both-And

Neither  the  organizational  nor  the  professional capacities for adaptivity would have sufficed  on  their  own  to  make  a  difference  at Sea View Elementary School. In this world of both-and,  the  twin  goals  reinforced  one  another. Developing each capacity within a spirit of collegiality and inquiry led to a natural flow within and among the areas.

These  twelve  capacities  frame  the  windows through which we can look at schools and districts. Current project successes can usually be located here. Current logjams in the system also have their roots in these areas. This, then, is a diagnostic tool and a curriculum for organizational and professional development.
