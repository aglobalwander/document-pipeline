## Chapter 4 Developing Collaborative Norms

W e once observed a faculty during a September meeting. Eight teachers, new to the school were studiously attentive to the veterans, emulating their patterns of interaction. This was a vivid example of one essential benefit of establishing norms of collaboration: they are normative-that is, they become a model for newcomers, and are especially valuable in schools with high teacher turnover.

In this chapter we reveal the metacognitive skills  of  effective  group  members,  show  why collaborative inquiry is at the heart of improving  student  achievement  and  describe  seven norms  of  collaboration.  Groups  who  employ these  norms  in  conversations  about  student learning consistently develop the social capital that improves  collective  teaching  expertise (Hargreaves and Fullan, 2012).

is  only  one  element  of  group  success.  (See chapter 8 for more on the role and skills of the facilitator  and  chapter  3  for  a  description  of four leadership roles.) Individual group members need consciousness and lenses for shaping personal decisions and behaviors in meetings.

Working  in  groups  is  a  natural  condition of human life. Since the dawn of humanity on the  plains  of Africa,  bands,  clans,  tribes,  and families  have  collaborated  for  defense,  food gathering,  and  ceremonial  purposes.  Work  in groups  is  often  difficult,  filled  with  conflicts and tensions, but it is also absolutely necessary for achieving results in modern organizations.

Each group member must balance personal goals  with  collective  goals,  acquire  resources for  his  or  her  own  work,  and  share  those resources to support the work of others. Navigating the tensions between part and wholebetween  personal  autonomy  and  collaboration-is an ongoing feature of both the surface and the deep structure for any working group.

Many  organizations  try  to  control  these tensions by using facilitators to shape and mold group energy and task focus. Although a person in such a role can often make a difference in  a  group's  performance,  a  skilled  facilitator

All surface behaviors are driven by inner awareness  and  ongoing  calibration  of  deeper values.  Skillful  group  members  monitor  and adjust  their behaviors  to  support  the  other group members and the group as a whole. To operate with sufficient flexibility, group members  need  self-awareness  and  self-monitoring skills  to  guide  their  choice  making.  Skillful facilitators  increase  this  awareness  by  shining the  light  of  reflection  on  group  processes  and by supporting group members in reflecting on the behavioral decisions they are making.

Four capabilities shape the self-monitoring system  of  high  performing  group  members. These in turn organize and drive seven norms of collaboration. The seven norms are the dayto-day  working  tools  for  both  skilled  group members and skilled facilitators.

## The Four GroupMember Capabilities

We  first realized  the  special  power  of focusing  on  capabilities  as  part  of  a  group

that was  developing  'Cognitive  Coaching' with Art Costa and other colleagues from the Institute  for  Intelligent  Behavior. A  capability names what a person is able to do. It is different from capacity, which refers to how much one can  hold.  Capabilities  are  the  metacognitive awarenesses with which people determine how to use, when to use, or when not to use certain skills.  Capabilities  therefore  organize  and  direct the use of skills; they influence the application and effectiveness of knowledge and skills.

The  four  group-member  capabilities  are as follows:

- 1. To know one's intentions and choose congruent behaviors;
- 2. To set  aside  unproductive  patterns  of  listening, responding, and inquiring;
- 3. To know when to self-assert and when to integrate;
- 4. To know and support the group's purposes, topics, processes, and development.

## To Know One's Intentions and Choose Congruent Behaviors

Clarity of intention drives attention, which in  turn  drives  the  what  and  how  of  a  group member's meeting participation. This is true in the moment and over time. This clarity precedes and influences the three other capabilities. It is the source of impulse control, patience, strategic listening, and strategic speaking.

This capability is the foundation for flexible  and  effective  behavior.  If,  for  example, a  person's  intention  is  to  positively  influence the  thinking  of  others,  various  behaviors  can be used congruently with that intention: under some circumstances, a paraphrase will convey an attempt to understand and open the door for reciprocal  understanding;  in  some  situations, direct  advocacy  will  be  persuasive;  in  other cases,  an  inquiry  into  the  thinking  of  another speaker might more effectively influence point of view.

## To Set Aside Unproductive Patterns of Listening, Responding, and Inquiring

For each meeting participant, there are two audiences. One is external, made up of the other group members. The other is internal, made up of the feelings, pictures, and talk going on inside each individual. Group members need to continually decide which audience to serve.

Three  major  set-aside  areas  focus  this choice and allow fuller and more nonjudgmental participation. They are as follows:

- 1. To  set  aside  autobiographical  listening, responding, and inquiring: 'Me too!'
- 2. To set aside inquisitive listening, responding, and inquiring: 'Tell me more!'
- 3. To  set  aside  solution  listening,  responding,  and  inquiring:  'I  know  what  you need to do!'

The  autobiographical  frame  leads  to  several  problems  in  group  work.  The  first  is  the filtering process that goes on when individuals try to hear another's story through the lens of their own experiences. Although this can be a source of empathy, it can also lead to distortion and miscommunication.

This type of listening, responding, and inquiring, while typically the way people listen, is  a  major source of wasted time in meetings. It  often  triggers  endless  storytelling  in  which everyone  around  the  table  shares  a  related anecdote.  This  is  dinner  party  conversation, not  productive meeting talk. Each member of the eighth-grade team does not have to relate a discipline horror story. Instead, the team could more  productively  spend  its  time  developing a collective understanding of the students and their  needs  and  generate  appropriate  response patterns to elicit desired behaviors.

The  inquisitive  frame  is  sometimes  triggered  by  the  autobiographical.  People  inquire to see how others' stories compare to their own. Pure curiosity also motivates inquisitive listening, responding, and inquiring. A critical question at this juncture is 'How much detail do we

need to move this item?' This is an example of what we call a naive question. (See appendix A for other examples of naive questions.) Such questions can be asked by any group member. The  purpose  is  to  focus  attention  on  critical matters and avoid unnecessary specificity.

The  solution  frame  is  deeply  embedded in  the  psyche  of  educators.  Status,  rewards, and identity are all tied up with being a good problem solver. The pressure of time in schools pushes  people  toward  action  and  away  from reflection. The downside of this pattern is that groups and group members get trapped in situations and action plans before they have time to fully understand the perspectives of others.

The solution frame also stifles the generation of new possibilities. It gets in the way of developing alternative ways of framing issues and  problems,  pushing  groups  toward  action before creating and clarifying clear outcomes.

## To Know When to Self-Assert and When to Integrate

In  productive  groups,  each  member  must decide  when  to  self-assert  and  when  to  integrate with the group. In one group, a member confided  to  us  that  she  was  concerned  about the autocratic disposition of the new chairman. Although  she  valued  the  directness  that  he brought to the group's work, she was concerned that  they  would  lose  collective  ownership  if she or other group members did not advocate for their own ideas and perspectives. Her issue, and  the  tension  for  each  group  member,  was when  to  challenge  and  when  to  go  with  the flow.  Self-assertion  and  integration  are  conscious choices only when group members have personal  clarity  about  their  own  intentions  as well  as  a  knowledge  of  and  a  willingness  to support the group's outcomes and methods.

Self-assertion  does  not  necessarily  mean self-focus.  It  can  mean  asserting  oneself  into the  flow  of  group  interactions  to  refocus  the group on a topic or on a process. It can mean reminding others of the purpose of the meeting when the conversation strays off course. It can also  mean  speaking  up  and  advocating  topics and processes.

When individual group members integrate, they  align  their  energy  with  the  content  and processes of the meeting. During dialogue they suspend  judgments  and  counterarguments  in an  attempt  to  understand  viewpoints  different  from  their  own.  During  discussions,  they follow  the  flow  of  logic  and  reasoning  as  it emerges. In this way, solutions satisfying to the group as a whole are more likely to emerge.

Consensus  decision  making  is  the  ultimate test of this capability. This procedure assumes that participants know when and how to self-assert and when and how to integrate, both during and after the decision-making process. The next two chapters describe ways of talking in  groups  as  well  as  principles  and  practices for successful meetings. In these chapters you will find many ideas and examples of places for self-assertion and for integration.

## To Know and Support the Group's Purposes, Topics, Processes, and Development

All ongoing groups need to balance three simultaneous  agendas. The  first  is  task  focus, which is the ultimate expression of the group's purpose.  The  second  agenda  is  process  skills development.  Without  continued  attention  to expanding  repertoire  and  skills,  the  group stagnates and does not increase its capacity for handling more complex work in the future. The third agenda is group development. All groups exist on a continuum from novice to expert performance.  Experience  alone  is  an  insufficient teacher.  Many  longstanding  groups  operate  at novice levels of performance. In chapter 9 we elaborate on concepts of group development.

High-performing groups are adaptive groups.  They  learn  from  experience  and  improve  the  way  they  work.  In  supporting  the group's  purposes,  topics,  processes,  and  development,  individual  group  members  make

a  commitment  to  this  shared  learning  and  to personal learning.

The paradoxes of work in groups establish the  essential  tensions  that  groups  and  their individuals must continually resolve. The four group-member  capabilities  supply  metacognitive and emotional filters for decisions, choices, and  behaviors.  All  this  requires  a  toolkit  for productive group work.

## Promoting a Spirit of Inquiry

High-functioning groups and group members infuse their work with a spirit of inquiry. Inquiry is central to professional communities that  produce  stable  gains  in  student  learning. Learning  at  its  root  is  a  questioning  process, and successful collaboration embraces the patterns and practices of inquiry. Inquiry presumes an openness to and an investment in the ideas of others. Physicist David Bohm has noted that thought is 'largely a collective phenomenon.' These  thoughts,  like  electrons,  are  shaped  by their interactions with others (Senge, 1990).

To inquire is to ask, be curious, invite the transmission  of  thoughts  or  feelings,  confer, consult,  wonder,  request,  examine,  and  investigate  ideas.  David  Hackett  Fischer,  a  Pulitzer prize-winning historian, observed that questions 'are the engines of intellect-cerebral machines that  convert  curiosity  into  controlled  inquiry' (Berger,  2014,  p.  15).  Richard  Elmore  (2000) points out that 'the knowledge we need to solve problems [in schools] often doesn't reside close at hand; it has to be found through active inquiry and analysis' (p. 13). Such interactions are not always the norm in schools. Collaborative work is  fraught  with  the  tensions  and  the  fears  of being judged or of being perceived as one who might be judging others.

Teaching as a private practice has a deep cultural  history.  Breaking  and  reshaping  the patterns within a culture requires both skill and commitment to the ongoing process of building community. Teaching in many ways has traditionally  been  a  'telling'  profession.  Teachers tell students what they need to know and how to do the things they need to learn how to do. This 'telling' behavior often carries over into patterns of adult communication as we tell others our stories, thoughts, and opinions or wait for our turn to do so. This culture of advocacy defines much of the interaction in adult groups. We  are  often  caught  up  in  the  tyranny  of or (Collins  and  Porras,  1997).  The  'or'  in  the statements that things must be right or wrong, true or false, yes or no causes these declarations to be dichotomous.

Dichotomous  thinking  leads  to  dichotomous questions, which in turn polarize group members. The art of asking invitational questions that avoid these dichotomies is the heart of collaborative inquiry. Invitational questions form connections between people and ideas as well as between ideas and other ideas.

All  group  work  is  about  relationships. Relationships shape and define patterns of discourse. These relationships are shaped by who initiates  a  query  and  the  form  of  that  query. Who responds and how he or she responds is a  direct  result  of  the  ways  in  which  a  group member initiates a topic.  Form,  function,  and outcome  are  linked  within  an  emotional  and social  system  that,  when  handled  with  care, opens  and  expands  thought  and  creates  new possibilities.  For  example,  a  person  initiating a  topic  with,  'One  idea  we  might  consider  is .  .  .'  will  result  in  a  totally  different  response from a person initiating a topic with, 'I think we should . . .' The former will elicit responses from more group members, who will treat the idea  as  a  possibility,  not  a  decision.  Those respondents  will  also  be  inclined  to  generate more  ideas,  increasing  the  group's  flexibility. The second response will increase the possibility of defensiveness among group members and discourage the generation of new ideas.

The patterns of inquiry built with the tools of  the  seven  norms  of  collaboration  lead  to deeper  understanding  and  to  better-informed action. This understanding and these actions can be internal for participants and external in their behaviors.  As  we  grapple  with  ideas  and  perspectives we come to know others and ourselves

more deeply. To do so requires us to reflect on our  inner  and  outer  reactions  to  data,  information,  and  events.  Purposeful  inquiry  helps  us to  interpret  personal  and  collective  values  and the implications of these as we live them out in our organizations. Skillful inquiry also helps us to clarify our priorities for a topic on the table. Where does this issue fit within the bigger picture?  In  what  ways  is  this  topic  important  and in what ways might this topic be a distraction?

In the end, what we talk about and how we talk to one another is a way of acting out our beliefs about the world and the way it works, our  beliefs  about  the  group  and  its  purposes, and our beliefs about our personal place in both arenas.  What  we  talk  about  and  how  we  talk also  defines  who  we  are  and  ultimately  who we become. By promoting a spirit  of  inquiry within our groups, we make an investment in our personal and collective futures.

## What the Norms of Collaboration Are Not

Occasionally  groups  establish  working agreements  to  set  standards  within  a  specific meeting  or  series  of  meetings  for  a  group. These  are  different  from  the  seven  norms  in two ways. First, they are group and setting specific. Second, they are developed by a group to guide behaviors when that group is convened. Some common examples are: start and end on time,  come  prepared,  and  listen  respectfully. To arrive at these a facilitator might invite the group to brainstorm agreements they might like to  make  in  order  to  maximize  group  success when they meet. After brainstorming, the group clarifies the posted ideas. Finally the group selects five to seven agreements most important to them. These are posted on the wall or appear on each subsequent meeting agenda.

Another approach to working agreements occurs  when  a  group  is  meeting  only  once and time is limited. In these cases, a facilitator might display, then ask for agreement on a set of agreements.

## Working Agreement Examples

- · Demonstrate  mutual  respect.  Respect  people  and  ideas.  Respecting others  does  not  equate  to  agreeing with them.
- · Employ skillful listening. Seek first to understand, then to be understood.
- · Develop sufficient consensus. Work to  understand all views, distinguish between  dialogue  and  discussion, give each person an equal voice, and reach 75 percent agreement of those present to constitute consensus.

We  offer  two  cautions  about  working agreements.  For  groups  that  already  have  a successful group history they are unnecessary and  establishing  them  runs  the  risk  of  presuming members would not select productive behaviors without this step. This can have an infantilizing  effect  on  members.  Next,  should groups establish them, monitoring is necessary. 'Once  groups  establish  rules,  the  facilitator must make sure that group members follow the working agreements. From time to time, individuals might need to violate a rule by leaving early  or  taking  an  emergency  phone  call;  as long as deviations are outside of the agreement, no one will care. When bad habits become the de facto working agreement, everyone notices' (Garmston  and  Zimmerman,  2013,  p.  54). Since  an  overarching  aim  of  group  work  is self-directedness, self-monitoring is best.

In  contrast  to  working  agreements,  the seven norms are not only a tool kit for inquiry but for developing and sustaining collaborative cultures  capable  of  making  the  best  decisions for students. Such cultures, as we shall describe later,  engage  in  cognitive  conflict,  a  type  of conflict  that  in  its  absence  leads  to  poor  decisions,  limited  follow-through,  and  too  often Balkanizing or apathy.

## The Seven Norms of Collaboration

Several years ago our friend and colleague Bill Baker commented that organizations have been  training  the  wrong  people.  Instead  of spending  time  and  energy  developing  more skilled  facilitators,  he  said,  they  should  develop  group  members'  skills  as  the  way  to improve practice and success. Our experience bears out the wisdom of this approach. When group members are knowledgeable and skilled, anyone  with  simple  knowledge  of  facilitation principles and moves can facilitate constructive group work.

Drawing  from  the  'Cognitive  Coaching' model (Costa and Garmston, 2015); the work of  Peter  Senge  (1990);  the  work  of  Baker, Costa,  and  Shalit  (1997);  and  refinements  by Dolcemascolo and McKanders (2014) we have adapted  and  updated  this  set  of  norms  of collaboration as the tools for productive communication  between  members  of  a  working community. These are as follows:

- 1. Pausing;
- 2. Paraphrasing;
- 3. Posing questions;
- 4. Placing ideas on the table;
- 5. Providing data;
- 6. Paying attention to self and others;
- 7. Presuming positive intentions.

Reflect on your typical behavior in some group  with  which  you  regularly  work.  Before reading  the  following  descriptions  of the  norms  of  collaboration,  do  the  following  self-assessment.  In  the  list  above  put  a checkmark after the norms to which you pay conscious attention in most meetings with the group you have in mind.

There  is  a  marked  difference  between skills  and  norms.  A  skill  is  something  that someone knows how to do. A skill becomes a norm when it is normal behavior in the group.

When this occurs, the  behavior  becomes  normative  for  new  group  members,  who  model their own behavior on the standards tacitly set by group veterans.

When  the  seven  norms  of  collaborative work become an established part of group life and group work, cohesion, energy, and commitment to shared work and to the group increase dramatically. The seven norms serve as guides and benchmarks in groups, in hallway conversations, with parents and students, and in the staff room. As they become established within the working substrate, they teach and remind all members, both veterans and newcomers,  that  this  is  the  way  we  talk  to  each other around here.

In  our  follow-up  work  with  clients,  this phenomenon is reported time and again. An assistant superintendent shared with us that when one  or  two  people  in  a  meeting  practice  the norms,  the  behavior  of  other  group  members becomes more effective.

A  major  tension  is  that  all  groups  have more tasks to accomplish than time in which to  accomplish  them.  Yet  any  group  that  is too  busy  to  reflect  on  process  is  too  busy  to improve. The seven norms become goals for collective  growth.  In  adaptive  schools,  individuals  and  groups  select  goals  from  among the seven norms. They practice, monitor, and reflect  on  the  impact  of  the  norms  for  themselves and for the group.

Each norm is deceptively simple. Most are skills that people regularly apply in one-to-one communications. The irony is that these seemingly simple behaviors are rare in many meetings. Inquiring into the ideas of others increases the  capacity  for  group  members  to  influence each  other.  Pausing  and  paraphrasing  are  often missing, especially when things get tense. Posing  questions  for  specificity  is  forgotten when members presume to understand others' meanings. This can lead to later confusion and complication.  Presuming  positive  intentions prevents  members from judging others.  Interpersonal  judgments  spawn  blocked  thinking

and negative presuppositions. See appendix B through E for self and group assessment inventories. We offer the following explanations of the norms as a rationale for their importance.

## Pausing

There is a vast research base on the positive effects of teacher pausing and silence on student  thinking.  The  'wait  time'  research of  Mary  Budd  Rowe  (1986)  has  been  replicated around the world. Thinking takes time. High-level  thinking  takes  even  longer.  This research  indicates  that  it  takes  from  three  to five seconds for most human brains to process high-level thoughts.

Not  all  brains  work  the  same  way.  This is  especially  evident  in  meetings  and  group work. Some people prefer to think out loud and construct their ideas externally; others prefer to process ideas internally and reflect and analyze before speaking. The external processors often get in the way of the internal processors. This can be an alienating experience for deliberate, internal  thinkers.  The  meeting  topics  move by  before  the  internal  processers  have  had  a chance to contribute.

The  members  of  one  middle  school  team with whom we worked began to laugh at themselves  after  completing  the  Norms  of  Collaboration  Group  Inventory  (appendix  C).  When we  inquired,  they  said  they'd  been  working together for more than two years and had yet to make a decision. In their group, if you stopped to breathe while speaking, you lost the floor. Consequently, they all had tremendous lung power and claimed they could each talk for hours on a single inhalation. What they recognized was that without a norm of pausing, meetings became a competition for air space. They soon learned to monitor pauses at several junctures to increase their productivity and satisfaction.

Groups become skilled at pausing at four places  in  the  flow  of  their  conversations. The first pause occurs after asking a question or offering a paraphrase. This allows initial process- ing time for those responding to the question or reflecting on the paraphrase. The second pause occurs  after  someone  speaks.  Human  beings think  and  speak  in  bursts.  With  additional processing  time,  more  responders  organize thoughts into more coherent speech. The third place  to  pause  is  before  paraphasing  or  questioning. A  group  in  Istanbul  told  us  that  they initiated  a  five-second  pause  rule  after  each speaker. Meetings became less stressful, more respectful, thoughtful, and more productive.

In  the  original  wait-time  research  with students,  when  teachers  paused  after  asking questions  and  after  the  students'  initial  responses, the length of the responses increased from 300 percent to 700 percent, depending on the  socioeconomic  status  (SES)  of  the  child. The lower-SES children had the greatest gains.

The first two pauses require the questioner and  other  group  members  to  monitor  and control  their  own  behavior.  These  are  pauses to  give  other  people  time  to  think.  This  is personal  reflection  time  in  which  that  person waits  before  answering.  Sometimes  one  says, 'Give me a moment to think about that before answering.' At other times one acknowledges the question nonverbally, goes inside oneself to think, and then responds to the question. This is also a nice way to model thoughtfulness for others and can be an important normative behavior in groups.

A fourth place for pausing in meetings is a collective pause. This can be formally structured or can occur spontaneously. These shared pauses allow ideas and questions to settle in and allow time  for  note  taking  and  reflection.  The  intent of these breaks in the action is to create shared cognitive space for the group and its members.

Pausing  gets  blood  and  nutrients  to  the neocortex  and  begins  a  pattern  followed  by paraphrasing  and  questioning.  Groups  give themselves a powerful gift when they establish this pattern as a norm; pause, paraphrase, and pose  questions  for  a  wider  range  of  thoughts or for details; and pause, paraphrase, and pose questions about feelings.

## Principles of Paraphrasing

- · Attend fully.
- · Listen with the intention to understand.
- · Capture the essence of the message.
- · Reflect the essence of voice tone and gestures.
- · Make  the  paraphrase  shorter  than the original statement.
- · Paraphrase  before  asking  a  question. Use the pronoun 'you,' instead of 'I.'

(Costa  and  Garmston  revised  by  Hayes and Ellison, 2014)

## Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing  is  one  of  the  most  valuable and  least  used  communication  tools  in  meetings. It  is  the  key  practice  in  authentic  listening.  Even  people  who  naturally  and  skillfully paraphrase in one-to-one settings often neglect this  vital  behavior  in  group  settings.  Groups that develop consciousness about paraphrasing and give themselves permission to use this reflection tool become clearer and more cohesive about their work.

Try this experiment. Paraphrase, then ask a question. Do this several times. Now ask questions without preceding them with paraphrases. Since a well-crafted paraphrase communicates 'I  am trying to understand you, and therefore I value what you have to say' and establishes a relationship between people and ideas, questions  preceded  by  paraphrases  will  be  perceived similarly. Questions by themselves, no matter how artfully constructed, put a degree of psychological  distance  between  the  asker  and the asked. Paraphrasing aligns the parties and creates a safe environment for thinking (Lipton and Wellman, 1998).

We refer to paraphrases that invite thinking and reflect the speaker's content and the speaker's emotions about the content as mediational paraphrases. These can acknowldge, organize, or frame a level of abstraction for holding the content.  The  paraphrase  reflects  content  back to  the  speaker  for  further  consideration  and connects that response to the flow of discourse emerging within the group. Such paraphrasing creates permission to pose questions for details and elaboration. Without the paraphrase, some group members may perceive posing questions as interrogation.

Knowing when to paraphrase in groups is a gained skill. Acknowledging paraphrases often occur when emotion is detected and in response to initial statements to estalish expectations for listening. Organizing paraphrases are employed to capture contributions of several speakers on a topic or when individuals might have offered a  series  of  ideas. As  can  be  seen  in  table  4.1 abstracting  paraphrases  support  conceptual  or 'things' thinking.

## The Structure and Flow of Effective Paraphrasing

Listen  and  observe  carefully  to  calibrate the  content  and  emotions  of  the  speaker.  Signal your intention to paraphrase. This is done by  modulating  intonation  with  the  use  of  an approachable  voice  and  by  opening  with  a reflective  stem.  Such  stems  put  the  focus  and emphasis  on  the  speaker's  ideas,  not  on  the paraphraser's interpretation of those ideas.

For example, reflective paraphrases should not  use  the  pronoun  'I.'  The  phrase  'What  I think I hear you saying' signals to many speakers that their thoughts no longer matter and that the paraphraser is now going to insert his or her own ideas into the conversation.

The following paraphrase stems signal that a paraphrase is coming:

You're suggesting . . .

You're proposing . . .

So what you're wondering is . . .

So you are thinking that . . .

Hmm, you're pondering the effects of . . .

So your hunch is that . . .

Table 4.1 . Balancing Inquiry and Advocacy

## The Structure of Inquiry

Ask others to make their thinking visible.

Use nonaggressive language and an approachable voice. 'Can you help me understand your thinking here?'

Use a pattern of pause, paraphrase, pause, and probe or inquire.

Use exploratory language. 'What are some of . . . ? How might you . . . ? What are your hunches about . . . ?'

Inquire about values, beliefs, goals, assumptions, examples, or significance. 'How does this relate to your values, beliefs, goals, or assumptions? What are some examples of what you think might happen if we act on your proposal? In what ways does this relate to your other concerns?'

Explain your reasons for inquiring. 'I'm asking about your assumptions here because . . . ' Invite introspection. 'What questions do you have about your own thinking?' Compare your assumptions to theirs.

Investigate other assumptions. 'Would you be willing to have each of us list our assumptions, compare them, and explore if there might be other assumptions about this issue?'

Check your understanding of what is being said by pausing, paraphrasing, and inquiring. 'So your main concern is the way our team is interacting and you'd like to see more cohesion and focused energy. What are some of your thoughts about how this might look and sound in action?' Test what others say by asking for broader contexts and examples. 'How might your proposal affect . . . ? In what ways is this similar to . . . ? Please share a typical example of . . . '

Reveal your listening processes. 'I have been listening for themes. So far I've heard two. Are there others?'

## The Structure of Advocacy

Make your thinking and reasoning visible.

State your assumptions. 'Here is what I assume are the causes of . . . '

Describe your reasoning. 'I came to this conclusion because . . . '

Describe your feelings. 'I feel \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ about this because . . . '

Distinguish data from interpretation. 'These are the data I have. I'll share them as objectively as possible. Now here is what I think the data mean . . . '

Reveal your perspective. 'I'm seeing this from the viewpoint of . . . '

Frame the wider context that surrounds this issue. 'Several groups would be affected by what I propose.'

Give concrete examples. 'To get a clear picture, imagine that you are in a new school and . . . '

## Test your assumptions and conclusions.

Encourage others to explore your model, assumptions, and data. 'What do you think about what I have just said? Do you see any flaws in my reasoning? What might you add?'

Reveal where you are least clear. 'Here's one area that you might help me think through . . . '

Stay open. Encourage others to provide different points of view. 'In what ways do you see it differently?'

Search for generalizations, deletions, and distortions. 'In what I've presented, do any of you believe that I might have overgeneralized, left out data, or reported data incorrectly?'

Choose  a  type  of  paraphrase  with  which to respond. There are three broad categories of paraphase types, each with a specific function. We have refined our thinking about these since the  last  edition.  One  discovery  is  that  sometimes people infer that the three types should be used in sequence. This is not the case, though it is not unusual to begin conversations with the intention of acknowledging the speaker.

- 1. Acknowledging . If  the  paraphrase  is  not completely accurate, the speaker will offer corrections.  'So  you're  concerned  about the  budgeting  process  and  ways  to  get input early.'
- 2. Organizing . Offer themes and 'containers' to organize several statements or separate jumbled  issues.  This  is  an  especially  important  type  of  paraphrase  to  use  when multiple  speakers  contribute  to  a  topic. 'There appear to be two issues here. One is resource  allocation  and  the  other  is the  impact  of  those  decisions  on  student learning.' In video 4.1, the faciliator poses a  question,  listens  to  the  group,  then  responds with an organizing paraphrase.
- 3. Abstracting . Listen  deeply  for  meaning then  shift  to  a  higher  or  lower  level  of abstraction.  This  paraphrase  invites  the speaker to think at levels either more abstract or concrete in an manner congruent with  the Ladder  of  Abstraction (Hayakawa,  1939).  In  video  4.3,  the  facilitator offers an abstracting paraphrase and 'How to work with a person who is threatened.' paraphrase by naming the common ground in  the  four  responses  she  has  heard  from the group.

'So a goal for you is . . .' or, 'An assumption  you  have  is.  .  .  .'  Paraphrasing  within a  flow  of  discourse  often  moves  through  a starting  point  of  acknowledging,  then  using each  of  three  forms  of  paraphrase  depending on intention in the moment. Paraphrases move to a higher level of abstraction when they name concepts, goals, values, and assumptions: 'So a major goal here is to define fairness in the budgeting processes and compare those criteria to the operating values of the school.' 'So you are valuing depth over breadth.' Paraphrases move to  a  lower  level  of  abstraction  when  concepts require  grounding  in  details:  'So  fair  might mean  that  we  construct  a  needs  assessment form for each department to fill out and submit to the site council for public consideration.'

## Learning Styles and Paraphrasing

Paraphrases that summarize or shift the abstraction level of discourse support and stretch the thinking styles of different group members. Global  thinkers  appreciate  paraphrases  that separate  and  organize  'thinking  in  progress.' At  other  times  the  shift  down  in  level  of  abstraction grounds global thinkers in specific examples and concrete details.  Concrete,  highly sequential  thinkers  learn  from  the  shift  up  to higher  levels  of  abstraction.  This  helps  them to explore a bigger picture and creates a wider context for thinking.

## Posing Questions

Thes first two norms are the platform for inquiry.  In  practice,  inquiry  follows  a  pattern of pausing, paraphrasing, and questioning. The tonal and syntactical stucture of questions can

amplify  or  reduce  any  perceived  danger  that the  listener  might  hear  in  the  inquiry.  Deep in our  biological  wiring  we  have  a  finely tuned  threat-detecting  system.  The  molecules of emotion link to the molecules of cognition so  strongly  that  the  emotional  processing  circuits  of  the  brain  are  the  first  centers  to  filter incoming  messages.  Perceived  threats  trigger emotional  responses  that  can  inhibit  or  in some  way  interfere  with  high-level  thought. To reduce threat and to open thinking, persons skilled in posing questions apply the following template (Lipton and Wellman 2013).

Full Attention . The invitation to think begins with  full  attention  to  others  in  the  group.  This makes our complete presence available for this conversation, which also indicates that we intend no  harm.  This  physical  message  meshes  with several verbal elements to form an invitation to think together about the ideas being explored.

Approachable  Voice . Using  an  approachable  voice  is  the  next  element  of  the  invitation to think. This voice tone is well modulated and tends to rise at the end of a statement, summary, or question (Grinder, 1997). This tonal package envelops questions and comments, indicating the intention to invite and explore thinking and not to interrogate or challenge. In video 4.2, listen to the faciliator pose a question in an approachable voice and respond to the group using the concept of hopefulness in an abstraction paraphrase.

Plural  Forms .  Two  important  syntactical choices invite colleagues to think with us. One is  to  use  plural  forms  to  increase  options  and possibilities  for  thinking.  The  use  of  plural forms sets aside the need for evaluation and the sorting of ideas. For instance, to inquire about someone's goals instead of their goal opens the realm  of  multiple  intentions  and  not  just  one course of action. Group members often need to hear their ideas aloud before they know which are most central to the issues before the group.

Tentative  Language . The  other  syntactical  element  is  the  use  of  tentative  phrasing  in statements  and  questions.  Words  like some , might , seems , possible ,  and hunches widen the potential range of responses and reduce the need for the listener to respond with confidence and surety. Words like could and why can decrease the confidence of listeners by seeming to ask for premature commitment or a need to defend ideas and actions that might not be fully developed.

Open-Ended  Forms . In  addition  to  employing the elements noted above, mediational facilitators and  group  members  frame  their questions  by  using  open-ended  forms.  These are  questions  that  cannot  be  answered  yes  or no.  For  example,  instead  of  asking  a  group, 'Does  anyone  have  any  ideas  to  add?'  they ask, 'What are some additional ideas we might add to the mix?' By eliminating dichotomous stems  such  as,  'Can  you,'  'Did  you,'  'Will you,' or 'Have you,' skilled questioners invite more productive thinking that puts inquiry first within the group.

## Posing Questions to Explore Thinking

Using  the  elements  of  invitation,  we  pose questions  to  explore  thinking  by  asking  about perceptions, assumptions and interpretations, and invite others to inquire into their own thinking.

Examples:

What  might  be  some  of  the  assumptions  we have about . . . ?

Given our concern and knowledge of this issue, what  might  be  some  of  the  observations . . . ?

As we are considering the bigger picture, what might be some of the factors and . . . ?

How might  you  describe  your  feelings  about . . . ?

What might be some reasons our four-year-olds ask more questions than our six-year-olds?

## Posing Questions to Specify Thinking

Human brains are not  designed  for  specificity.  In  a  world swimming in details, brains form  quick  generalizations  from  fragments of  information.  Brains  delete  particulars  from streams of data and distort incoming and outgoing messages to fit deeply embedded models of reality (Bandler and Grinder, 1971). These are all natural processes; they do not willfully occur. Generalizations, deletions, and distortions are survival patterns hardwired into the human brain.  They  are  adaptations  to  the  challenges faced by our hunting and gathering ancestors. In  modern  times  these  same  traits  cause  difficulties in human  communication.  Conversations  go  haywire  when  the  various  parties make different assumptions about the meaning of words and concepts and neglect to verify or correct those assumptions. Problem definition, problem  solving,  and  solution  generation  all rely on specificity for success.

Five  categories  of  vagueness  inhabit  human speech; these are described below.

## Vague Nouns and Pronouns

Someone named 'they' makes most of the decisions  in  organizations.  'They'  are  joined by  'the  central  office,'  'the  administrators,' 'the union,' 'the parents,' 'the students,' and a  host  of  others  as  the  source  of  mysterious messages,  concerns,  and  directives.  Unless group members know who 'they' are, communication takes longer, and people do not always know how to treat the information.

When  a  speaker  in  a  meeting  says  our students  can't  write,  someone  in  the  group should paraphrase then pose a question asking for details. It might sound like this: 'So you're concerned about student writing. What's your hunch  about  how  many  of  our  students  have writing difficulties?'

After  the  speaker  answers,  the  logical  follow-up question would be about which areas of writing are of most concern. If the group discovers that a small number of students lacks specific skill,  they  can  develop  a  remediation  plan  for this  targeted  audience.  If  the  group  discovers that a large number of students has fundamental issues as writers, this calls for a more in-depth look at the patterns of curriculum and instruction in the school. Without the details, the group does not know which problem to solve.

## Vague Verbs

Planning  and  problem-solving  sessions require specificity for targeted action. The verb plan itself means very different things to different people. Some think that it means scratching ideas  on  a  napkin;  others  imagine  timelines and flowcharts with names and dates attached. Groups have to define their verbs. Words like improve , enhance , design , modify ,  and understand are  all  examples  of  vague  verbs  used by working groups. Someone should begin by posing questions for specificity in order for the team to agree on concepts, plan for change, and act in concert.

Vague nouns and pronouns and vague verbs often  go  hand  in  hand.  A  statement  like  'We want  our  students  to  be  on  time  and  prepared for class' easily produces surface agreement in most  groups  of  educators.  It  is  only  when  we pose question about which students are not yet meeting these requirements and what the meanings of 'be on time' and 'be prepared' are that the issue can even be discussed rationally.

## Comparators

'This  meeting  was  much  better  than  last month's  session.'  Unless  the  group  discovers the  speaker's  criteria  for  better,  the  members will not know how to repeat the improvement or, for that matter, whether the speaker's 'better' is even desirable. Words like best , larger , slower , more ,  and least leave out the point of comparison and the standard for the comparison.

When  undefined  comparators  are  used, pose  questions  about  criteria.  'So  you've  enjoyed  this  meeting.  What  were  some  of  the ways this was better for you?' The respondent here has been careful to ask the speaker for his or her criteria ('better for you'), which might not be important criteria to other group mem-

bers. The intention is to draw the speaker out and expand the meaning of the statement.

## Rule Words

People  operate  with  conscious  and  unconscious  rules  about  how  the  world  works and  how  they  are  supposed  to  operate  in  it. These  rules  appear  in  language  when  people say things like 'We have to,' 'We must,' 'You shouldn't,' and 'I can't.'

To  clarify  these  rules  and  the  ways  that they  govern  behavior,  other  group  members should pose questions for the rules behind the statements: 'What would happen if we didn't?' 'Who  or  what  says  we  must?'  'Shouldn't? Who made up that rule?' 'What stops you?' Intonation  is  important  here.  The  voice  carrying  the  response  has  to  be  well  modulated, friendly, and nonthreatening.

## Universal Quantifiers

'Everyone  knows  that  this  program  is great.'  Words  and  phrases  like everyone , all , no one , never , and always are examples of universal quantifiers. Linguists use the term 'deity voice' to describe this type of language. It is spoken as if the statement contains a universal truth of which 'everyone' must be aware.

As most parents and middle school teachers  know,  universal  quantifiers  are  the  lingua franca of teenagers. 'I need to go to the mall; all  my  friends  will  be  there.'  The  typical  response  pattern  is  'All  your  friends?  I  can't imagine  that  all  your  friends'  parents  would permit them to go.'

By  qualifying  and  clarifying  a  universal  quantifier,  group  members  ground  their conversations  in  data  and  measurable  details. When someone makes the statement that 'These students never understand the assignments  the  first  time,'  another  participant  can pose questions to learn the meaning of never: 'Has  there  ever  been  a  time  when  students understood the first time around?' This can be followed up with an inquiry into the qualities and conditions of the assignments that are an exception to the initial statement.

## Placing Ideas on the Table

Ideas  are  the  heart  of  group  work.  In  order  to  be  effective,  they  must  be  released  to the  group.  'Here  is  an  idea  for  consideration. One possible  approach  to  this  issue  might  be .  .  .'  When  ideas  are  owned  by  individuals, the other group members tend to interact with the  speaker  out  of  their  feelings  for  and  relationship  to  the  speaker  rather  than  with  the ideas  presented.  This  is  especially  true  when the speakers have role or knowledge authority related to the topic at hand. To have an idea be received in the spirit in which you tell it, label your intentions: 'This is one idea' or 'Here is a thought' or 'This is not an advocacy, I am just thinking out loud.'

Knowing when to pull ideas off the table is equally important. 'I think this idea is blocking us; let's set it aside and move on to other possibilities.' In this case, continued advocacy of the idea is not influencing other group members' thinking. This is a signal to pull back and reconsider approaches.

## Providing Data

Productive group work is driven by data, both  qualitative  and  quantitative.  Data  about student learning, school climate, teacher satisfaction, parent satisfaction, and the like are important to ground ideas being put on the table. Collaborative work in schools requires data as well as impressions. In fact, important learning is  possible  whether or not the data align with the impressions of group members.

Knowing what data are  worth  paying  attention to is important. It is also important to know  what  collaborative  practices  will  help people  to  engage  with  data  in  ways  that  increase  their  ownership  and  willingness  to  act on  conclusions.  Data  can  be  quantitative  or qualitative. Schools are difficult places to motivate and govern with numbers. A 6 percent rise in student reading scores is often not as compelling  as  a  teacher's  tale  of  the  slow  reader who  makes  a  breakthrough.  Reasoning  by anecdote  is  often  more  common  than  reason-

ing  with  data.  Interpreting  and  using  data  are learned skills that take time and practice to develop. Knowledge, meaning, and commitment result from dialogue and discussion about what story  is  told  by  the  data.  Without  organized story  making,  people  in  organizations  make up  their  own  explanations  for  events.  Part  of the reason for this is protection from unwanted truths.

## Paying Attention to Self and Others

For  meaningful  dialogue  and  discussion to occur, each group member needs to be conscious of themself and of others. Skilled group members are aware of what they are saying, how  they  are  saying  it,  and  how  others  are receiving and responding to their ideas. This includes paying attention to both physical and verbal  cues  in  oneself  and  others.  Since  the greatest  part  of  communication  occurs  nonverbally, group members need consciousness about their total communication package (Goleman, 2006). This includes posture, gesture, proximity,  muscle  tension,  facial  expression, and the pitch, pace, volume, and inflection in their voices.

Paying attention  to  self  and  others  draws on emotional and cognitive maturity. It requires mindfulness, sensory acuity, and reflective action. Mindfulness focuses attention on sensory experiences,  thoughts,  and  feelings  without judgment.  With  sensory  acuity,  members  increase the levels of detail of what is happening internally  and  externally  to  themselves.  Reflective action, utilizing the first two resources, capacitates  one  to  act,  observe  reactions,  and sustain action when results align with outcomes or  modify  actions  when  they  do  not  (Prickett and Ravlin, 2015).

One  important  skill  to  develop  is  paying attention  to  and  responding  to  the  learning styles  of  others.  The  earlier  section  on  paraphrasing  offers  some  tips  for  communicating with global and concrete thinkers. In addition to  using  those  ideas,  skilled  group  members match the language forms of others. This oc- curs when the respondent joins in a metaphor offered by another. It also occurs when the respondent matches the representation system of the speaker by using visual, kinesthetic, or auditory words in response to hearing the speaker operate within one or more of those categories (Lankton, 1980). Here's an example:

Speaker: I'd like to see us develop a workable action plan.

Respondent: So you have an image of practical  process that we can apply to our work. What are some of the features you'd like to have on view before us?

## Presuming Positive Intentions

Assuming that others'  intentions  are  positive  shows respect for others and encourages honest  conversations  about  important  matters. Respect, from its Latin origin, respecere , means to look again. 'Where once we saw one aspect  of  a  person,'  explains  William  Isaacs, 'we look again and realize how much of them we had missed' (1999, p. 111). This is an operating  stance  that  group  members  must  take if dialogue and discussion are to flourish; it is also a linguistic act for speakers to frame their paraphrases and inquiries within positive presuppositions.

Positive  presuppositions  reduce  the  possibility  of  the  listener  perceiving  threats  or challenges in a paraphrase or question. Instead of  asking,  'Does  anybody  here  know  why these  kids  aren't  learning?'  the  skilled  group member might say, 'Given our shared concern about student achievement, I'd like to examine our assumptions about what might be causing gaps in learning.'

The first question is likely to trigger defensiveness.  The  second  approach  will  most likely  lead  to  speculation,  exploration,  and collective  understanding.  This  is  especially true when a speaker has strong emotions about a topic and even more important when the respondent initially disagrees with the speaker. Here's an example:

Speaker: I'm really ticked off about the lack of  communication  in  this  school.  We  never find  out  about  the  important  things  until  everyone else knows about them. In fact, I get more district news from the local paper than I do from internal sources.

Respondent: So as a committed professional, you'd like useful information about our organization in a timely fashion and in a means convenient for you. As you think about such a  system,  what  might  be  some  important components?

In the example  above,  the  respondent presumes that the speaker is a committed professional  who  wants  to  solve  a  real  problem. People  tend  to  act  as  if  such  presuppositions are true. The emotional processors in the brain hear the positive intention and open up access to high-level thinking (Ledoux, 1996).

## Working with Grace in a Culture of Advocacy

In working  groups  that  have  not  yet embraced a spirit of inquiry, round-robin, or back-and-forth advocacy are often the prevailing patterns of discourse. People who are not talking  are  not  necessarily  listening;  in  fact, they might just be waiting to talk or internally debating  and  are  composing  their  thoughts and responses as they sit poised to pounce at the  first  opening.  By  applying  the  norms  of collaboration,  skilled  group  members,  individually or collectively, interrupt this nonproductive pattern and establish more thoughtful forms of discourse within their groups. To do so they must first break the pattern of balancing advocacy with their own advocacy. Flexible  group  members  and  skillful  facilitators learn to respond to advocacy with a pattern of pausing, paraphrasing, and inquiring.

We are influenced in this arena by the work of Peter Senge and his colleagues (1994) at the Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology's  Center for  Organizational Learning. We have extended the  concept  and  refined  specific  language  patterns for operating within this framework.

Matching advocacy with inquiry requires both  emotional  and  cognitive  resources. The balance is most necessary at the exact moment when many group members are least likely to want to inquire into the ideas of others. It is at  the  moment  of  greatest  disagreement  and discomfort that this pattern makes the biggest difference. To balance means to spend equal amounts  of  time  and  energy  inquiring  into the  ideas  of  others  before  advocating  one's own  ideas.  The  highest  performing  teams balance both (Losada and Heaphy, 2004). To do  both  equally  well  requires  the  resources of  the  seven  norms  of  collaboration.  Inquiry and  advocacy  are  built  on  the  linguistic  and perceptual foundation described earlier in this chapter. Table 4.2 shows how to balance advocacy and inquiry.

The  power  of  this  pattern  became  apparent to us in an experience related to us by our friend  and  colleague  Diane  Zimmerman,  who was enrolled in a doctoral program in organizational development. At the time, she was also a principal in Davis, California. Diane and her staff had taken on the norms of collaboration as a shared learning goal. As a skilled and congruent leader, Diane knew that she needed to apply the seven norms in her interactions with adults and students. To support her own learning, she continually sought opportunities to master and integrate these communication skills.

At an early stage in her graduate program, the professors organized a small-group learning  experience.  The  students  were  placed  in small groups and given a controversial topic to  discuss.  Most  of  the  groups  were  soon  at one  another's  throats  with  rising  emotions, much heated talk, and little listening. Diane's group  took  a  much  different  course. After  a time,  the  professors  gathered  around  in  surprise,  because  the  activity  normally  evoked the  responses  present  in  the  other  groups. Unable to resist their curiosity, they asked her group  what  was  going  on.  Diane  explained

that  she  had  been  practicing  the  habits  of pausing, paraphrasing, and inquiring into the ideas  of  others  before  advocating  her  own ideas.  Her  behavior  established  this  pattern, solely by example, within her group.

## Skilled Advocacy

The intention of advocacy is to influence the thinking of others. Group members sometimes attempt to influence with volume, repetition,  and  passion.  Advocacy  works  through revealing logic and the chain of reasoning that supports assumptions and conclusions.

The power of advocacy increases when it is  structured  to  influence  multiple  audiences. Global  reasoners  increase  their  impact  when they  learn  to  frame  issues  for  concrete  and sequential  thinkers.  Those  who  are  driven  by logic  and  facts  increase  their  influence  when they learn to frame their ideas within feelings and emotions. This ability to stretch one's own thinking  preferences  often  makes  the  difference in group members being able to hear one another and be persuaded by the positions and stances of others.

## Developing Personal and Group Skills with the Seven Norms of Collaboration

Ballet dancers practice in mirrored studios to  monitor  posture  and  the  subtleties  of  their movements.  Groups  also  improve  by  reflection.  The  inventories  in  appendixes  B,  C,  D, and E serve this purpose. Printable versions of these inventories can be found on the Thinking Collaborative  Website  (www.thinkingcollabo rative.com).

For  personal  skill  development  as  both  a facilitator and as a group member, appendix B serves  as  a  starting  point  for  self-assessment and  goal  setting.  One  useful  approach  is  to select  one  skill  at  a  time  on  which  to  work. Our basic mantra here is isolate, overlearn, and automatize.  By  seeking  opportunities  in  daily communication experiences to  practice  a  particular norm, you will be able to overlearn that

tool so that is available to you when you need it the most in a meeting. The rating scale in the appendix is a useful instrument for self-reflection after running or participating in a meeting.

With groups in the early stages of development, we suggest that individuals assess by filling out the inventory located in appendix B. Once  completed,  the  form  becomes  the  basis for dialogue about skill development and baseline  data  for  goal  setting  for  individuals  and groups. We encourage groups to master one or two of the norms at a time rather than attempt to take them all on at once.

For  intact  groups  with  some  history  of working  together,  the  form  is  best  completed by  subsets  of  the  group.  In  twos  and  threes they  can  work  through  the  form,  rating  the full  group's  use  of  each  norm.  Each  subset then  compares  its  assessments  with  the  other subsets. Most groups discover that all members do not perceive meeting behaviors in the same way. This conversation leads to goal setting for individuals and groups.

The rating scale provides a useful vehicle for ongoing group assessment. Regular mon- itoring  with  reflective  processing  keeps  the norms  alive  and  motivates  steady  improvement.  In  addition,  the  round-robin  reflection pattern  described  in  chapter  8  is  a  powerful tool  for  increasing  personal  and  group  consciousness and skills.

The four group-member capabilities and the  seven  norms  of  collaboration  are  essential  capacities  and  skills  for  high-performing groups. They operate within several practical frameworks that help groups to develop shared meaning and gracefully reach decisions. In the next chapter we describe two ways of talking among adults that make a difference for student  learning.  Both  ways,  dialogue  and  discussion,  draw  on  group-member  capabilities and norms.
