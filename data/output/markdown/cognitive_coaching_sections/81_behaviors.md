## Behaviors

Behaviors are what individuals do. They represent the application of skills and knowledge into actions. For Cognitive Coaches, they can be singular actions like paraphrasing or bundles of skills, like listening that involves being present, paraphrasing, and making meaning. Another coaching skill is constructing and posing questions with the intention of engaging and transforming thought. Cognitive Coaches employ nonjudgmental response behaviors to establish and maintain rapport, trust, and intellectual engagement. Nodding communicates receipt of information, silence infers attentiveness, paraphrasing reflects a speaker's thoughts, common filler words like ah , okay , and right signal attention. None of these are intended as judgmental and in the vast majority of cases are interpreted as interest rather than judgment.
