## A. Mediative Questions

The intent of mediative questions is to cause the coachee to supply the data from her own internal and external observations. Posing mediating questions has the highest potential for developing self-directedness as their intent is to alert the coachee to the data that will serve to provide selffeedback, to process that feedback, to construct meaning from it, and to set goals for himself to self-modify. For example:

- What indicators were you aware of that let you know the group understood your topic?
- What data were you aware of during the presentation that informed your decision to change your delivery?
- What did you hear your students saying that gave you some feedback about their readiness to move to a higher level of complexity?
- What feelings were you experiencing when students exclaimed their fascination with the topic?
- As you reflect on the purposes of your lesson, what are some indicators that those purposes were met?
