## D. Personal Opinions and Preferences

The coach states his/her own opinion or likes/dislikes. Notice again that all the comments are from the coach's perspective and point of view. These types of statements build dependency on the part of the coachee. It signals that success of the event is determined by the effect of the lesson on the likes and dislikes of the coach rather than the achievement of the outcomes of the lesson intended by the coachee. Again, such statements usurp the desired self-directedness of the coachee. For example:

- You really made me laugh with you told that story.
- I like it when you showed the video clip. I was really engaged.
- I think the kids enjoyed the lesson.
- Your story reminded me of when I was in school.
