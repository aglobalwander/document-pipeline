## They Are Intentional

Questions can have a purpose to explore thinking or specify thinking. When listening to the thinking of the coachee, the coach decides which purpose will better serve the thinking of the coachee. If the thinking of the coachee is vague and imprecise, a question for specificity might be posed to invite craftsmanship. For example, a person might say, 'My goal for this year is to have a more collaborative team.' The coach would offer a question inviting clarity about what is meant by collaboration, such as, 'What does collaboration mean for your team?' or 'What are some things you might focus on in becoming more collaborative?'

In another case, a teacher might know what it means to be collaborative and would be served by a question to broaden thinking. The coach could respond to the same teacher goal related to collaboration by asking, 'If you were to become more collaborative as a team, what might be some of the results you would anticipate for your students?'

To view examples of meditational questions, please go to http://www.thinkingcollaborative.com/supporting-audio-videos/3-4. Jane, the coach, asks Shatta, a Planning Central Office director, two meditational questions: 'How do you make decisions? What do you look for in the data?' In addition to identifying elements of a meditation question, notice the invitational tone of Jane's voice.

In video 3-4.2, during a calibrating conversation. Sue, the coach, asks Carolyn a mediating question about values. In video 3-4.3., during a reflecting conversation, Carolee, the coach, poses a mediating question for Ochan, exploring Ochan's expression of fear (internal content) of goals (external content).

A coach is more impactful in mediating thinking when there is consciousness about the intention of the question and what kind of thinking is being invited.

In video 3-4.1 the coach's intention is to invite the coachee to think about his decision-making process. Initially the coachee exercises recall , then with a follow-up question, he analyzes his decision-making process. In video 3-4.2, the coach's question raises the teacher's values to the conscious level and relates those values to his reasons for selecting certain aspects of his teaching to improve. In turn, this permits the teacher to become even more intentional and therefore effective in selecting improvement strategies. In video 3-4.3 the coach helps the teacher access his emotions (fear) and their relationship to personal goals. Fear is located in the amygdala, the emotional center of the brain, and the intention of this question is to shift brain activity to the neocortex, the rational center of the brain.
