Common Core State StandardS for matHematICS overview
The Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for Mathematics are organized by grade level in Grades K–8. At the high
school level, the standards are organized by conceptual category (number and quantity, algebra, functions, geometry,
modeling and probability and statistics), showing the body of knowledge students should learn in each category to
be college and career ready, and to be prepared to study more advanced mathematics. As states consider how to
implement the high school standards, an important consideration is how the high school CCSS might be organized
into courses that provide a strong foundation for post-secondary success. To address this need, Achieve (in partner­
ship with the Common Core writing team) has convened a group of experts, including state mathematics experts,
teachers, mathematics faculty from two and four year institutions, mathematics teacher educators, and workforce
representatives to develop Model Course Pathways in Mathematics based on the Common Core State Standards.
In considering this document, there are four things important to note:
1.    The pathways and courses are models, not mandates. They illustrate possible approaches to organizing the
content of the CCSS into coherent and rigorous courses that lead to college and career readiness. States and
districts are not expected to adopt these courses as is; rather, they are encouraged to use these pathways and
courses as a starting point for developing their own.
2.    All college and career ready standards (those without a +) are found in each pathway. A few (+) standards are
included to increase coherence but are not necessarily expected to be addressed on high stakes assessments.
3.    The course descriptions delineate the mathematics standards to be covered in a course; they are not prescrip­
tions for curriculum or pedagogy. Additional work will be needed to create coherent instructional programs that help students achieve these standards.
4.    Units within each course are intended to suggest a possible grouping of the standards into coherent blocks; in
this way, units may also be considered “critical areas” or “big ideas”, and these terms are used interchangeably
throughout the document. The ordering of the clusters within a unit follows the order of the standards document
in most cases, not the order in which they might be taught. Attention to ordering content within a unit will be needed as instructional programs are developed.
5.    While courses are given names for organizational purposes, states and districts are encouraged to carefully con­
sider the content in each course and use names that they feel are most appropriate. Similarly, unit titles may be adjusted by states and districts.
While the focus of this document is on organizing the Standards for Mathematical Content into model pathways
to college and career readiness, the content standards must also be connected to the Standards for Mathematical
Practice to ensure that the skills needed for later success are developed. In particular, Modeling (defined by a * in the
CCSS) is defined as both a  conceptual category for high school mathematics and a  mathematical practice and is an
important avenue for motivating students to study mathematics, for building their understanding of mathematics,
and for preparing them for future success. Development of the pathways into instructional programs will require
careful attention to modeling and the mathematical practices. Assessments based on these pathways should reflect
both the content and mathematical practices standards.

Common Core State StandardS for matHematICS the Pathways
Four model course pathways are included:
1.    An approach typically seen in the U.S. (Traditional) that consists of two algebra courses and a geometry course,
with some data, probability and statistics included in each course;
2.    An approach typically seen internationally (Integrated) that consists of a sequence of three courses, each of
which includes number, algebra, geometry, probability and statistics;
3.    A “compacted” version of the Traditional pathway where no content is omitted, in which students would complete
the content of 7th grade, 8th grade, and the High School Algebra I course in grades 7 (Compacted 7th Grade) and 8
(8th Grade Algebra I), which will enable them to reach Calculus or other college level courses by their senior year.
While the K-7 CCSS effectively prepare students for algebra in 8th grade, some standards from 8th grade have been
placed in the Accelerated 7th Grade course to make the 8th Grade Algebra I course more manageable;
4.    A “compacted” version of the Integrated pathway where no content is omitted, in which students would com­
plete the content of 7th grade, 8th grade, and the Mathematics I course in grades 7 (Compacted 7th Grade) and 8
(8th Grade Mathematics I), which will enable them to reach Calculus or other college level courses by their senior
year. While the K-7 CCSS effectively prepare students for algebra in 8th grade, some standards from 8th grade have
been placed in the Accelerated 7th Grade course to make the 8th Grade Mathematics I course more manageable;
5.    Ultimately, all of these pathways are intended to significantly increase the coherence of high school mathematics.
The non-compacted, or regular, pathways assume mathematics in each year of high school and lead directly to pre­
paredness for college and career readiness. In addition to the three years of study described in the Traditional and
Integrated pathways, students should continue to take mathematics courses throughout their high school career to
keep their mathematical understanding and skills fresh for use in training or course work after high school. A variety
of courses should be available to students reflecting a range of possible interests; possible options are listed in the
following chart. Based on a variety of inputs and factors, some students may decide at an early age that they want
to take Calculus or other college level courses in high school. These students would need to begin the study of high
school content in the middle school, which would lead to Precalculus or Advanced Statistics as a junior and Calculus,
Advanced Statistics or other college level options as a senior.
Strategic use of technology is expected in all work. This may include employing technological tools to assist students
in forming and testing conjectures, creating graphs and data displays and determining and assessing lines of fit for
data. Geometric constructions may also be performed using geometric software as well as classical tools and technol­
ogy may aid three-dimensional visualization. Testing with and without technological tools is recommended.
As has often occurred in schools and districts across the states, greater resources have been allocated to accelerated
pathways, such as more experienced teachers and newer materials. The Achieve Pathways Group members strongly
believe that each pathway should get the same attention to quality and resources including class sizes, teacher
assignments, professional development, and materials. Indeed, these and other pathways should be avenues for stu­
dents to pursue interests and aspirations. The following flow chart shows how the courses in the two regular path­
ways are sequenced (the * in the chart on the following page means that Calculus follows Precalculus and is a fifth
course, in most cases). More information about the compacted pathways can be found later in this appendix.

Common Core State StandardS for matHematICS Pathways chart
Some teachers and schools are effectively getting students to be college and career ready. We can look to these
teachers and schools to see what kinds of courses are getting results, and to compare pathways courses to the math­ ematics taught in effective classrooms.
A study done by ACT and The Education Trust gives evidence to support these pathways. The study looked at high­
poverty schools where a high percentage of students were reaching and exceeding ACT’s college-readiness bench­
marks. From these schools, the most effective teachers described their courses and opened up their classrooms for
observation. The commonality of mathematics topics in their courses gives a picture of what it takes to get students
to succeed, and also provides a grounding for the pathways. (There were other commonalities. For more detailed
information about this study, search for the report On Course for Success at www.act.org.)1
Implementation considerations:
As states, districts and schools take on the work of implementing the Common Core State Standards, the Model
Course Pathways in Mathematics can be a useful foundation for discussing how best to organize the high school stan­
dards into courses. The Pathways have been designed to be modular in nature, where the modules or critical areas
(units) are identical in nearly every manner between the two pathways, but are arranged in different orders to accom­
modate different organizational offerings. Assessment developers may consider the creation of assessment modules
in a similar fashion. Curriculum designers may create alternative model pathways with altogether different organiza­
tions of the standards. Some of this work is already underway. In short, this document is intended to contribute to
the conversations around assessment and curriculum design, rather than end them. Effectively implementing these
standards will require a long-term commitment to understanding what best supports student learning and attainment
of college and career readiness skills by the end of high school, as well as regular revision of pathways as student learning data becomes available.
supporting students
One of the hallmarks of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics is the specification of content that all
students must study in order to be college and career ready. This “college and career ready line” is a minimum for all
students. However, this does not mean that all students should progress uniformly to that goal. Some students progress
1The study provides evidence that the pathways’ High School Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II sequence is a reasonable and rigorous option for preparing stu­
dents for college and career. Topics aligned almost completely between the CCSS topics and topics taught in the study classrooms. The starting point for the
pathways’ High School Algebra I course is slightly beyond the starting point for the study Algebra I courses due to the existence of many typical Algebra I topics
in the 8th grade CCSS, therefore some of the study Algebra II topics are a part of the pathways’ High School Algebra I course, specifically, using the quadratic
formula; a bit more with exponential functions including comparing and contrasting linear and exponential growth; and the inclusion of the spread of data sets.
The pathways’ Geometry course is very similar to what was done in the study Geometry courses, with the addition of the laws of sines and cosines and the work
with conditional probability, plus applications involving completing the square because that topic was part of the pathways’ High School Algebra I course. The
pathways’ Algebra II course then matches well with what was done in the study Algebra II courses and continues a bit into what was done in the study Precalcu­
lus classrooms, including inverse functions, the behavior of logarithmic and trigonometric functions, and in statistics with the normal distribution, margin of error,
and the differences among sample surveys, experiments, and observational studies. All in all, the topics and the order of topics is very comparable between the
pathways’ High School Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II sequence and the sequence found in the study courses.

more slowly than others. These students will require additional support, and the following strategies, consistent with
Response to Intervention practices, may be helpful:
•
Creating a school-wide community of support for students;
•
Providing students a “math support” class during the school day;
•
After-school tutoring;
•
Extended class time (or blocking of classes) in mathematics; and •
Additional instruction during the summer.
Watered-down courses which leave students uninspired to learn, unable to catch up to their peers and unready for
success in postsecondary courses or for entry into many skilled professions upon graduation from high school are
neither necessary nor desirable. The results of not providing students the necessary supports they need to succeed in
high school are well-documented. Too often, after graduation, such students attempt to continue their education at 2 or 4-year postsecondary institutions only to find they must take remedial courses, spending time and money master­
ing high school level skills that they should have already acquired. This, in turn, has been documented to indicate a
greater chance of these students not meeting their postsecondary goals, whether a certificate program, two- or four­
year degree. As a result, in the workplace, many career pathways and advancement may be denied to them. To ensure
students graduate fully prepared, those who enter high school underprepared for high school mathematics courses
must receive the support they need to get back on course and graduate ready for life after high school.
Furthermore, research shows that allowing low-achieving students to take low-level courses is not a recipe for aca­
demic  success  (Kifer,  1993).  The  research  strongly  suggests  that  the  goal  for  districts  should  not  be  to  stretch  the  high
school mathematics standards over all four years. Rather, the goal should be to provide support so that all students
can reach the college and career ready line by the end of the eleventh grade, ending their high school career with one
of several high-quality mathematical courses that allows students the opportunity to deepen their understanding of the college- and career-ready standards.
With the Common Core State Standards Initiative comes an unprecedented ability for schools, districts, and states to
collaborate. While this is certainly the case with respect to assessments and professional development programs, it is
also true for strategies to support struggling and accelerated students. The Model Course Pathways in Mathematics
are intended to launch the conversation, and give encouragement to all educators to collaborate for the benefit of our states’ children.

How to read the Pathways:
Each pathway consists of two parts. The first is a chart that shows an overview of the pathway. Organized by course
and by conceptual category (algebra, functions, geometry, etc…), these charts show which clusters and standards
appear in which course (see page 5 of the CCSS for definitions of clusters and standards). For example, in the chart
below, the three standards (N.Q.1, 2, 3) associated with the cluster “Reason quantitatively and use units to solve
problems,” are found in Course 1. This cluster is found under the domain “Quantities” in the “Number and Quantity”
conceptual category. All high school standards in the CCSS are located in at least one of the courses in this chart.

The second part of the pathways shows the clusters and standards as they appear in the courses. Each course contains the following components:
•
An introduction to the course and a list of the units in the course •
Unit titles and unit overviews (see below) •
Units that show the cluster titles, associated standards, and instructional notes (below)
It is important to note that the units (or critical areas) are intended to convey coherent groupings of content. The
clusters and standards within units are ordered as they are in the Common Core State Standards, and are not
intended to convey an instructional order. Considerations regarding constraints, extensions, and connections are
found in the instructional notes. The instructional notes are a critical attribute of the courses and should not be
overlooked. For example, one will see that standards such as A.CED.1 and A.CED.2 are repeated in multiple courses,
yet their emphases change from one course to the next. These changes are seen only in the instructional notes,
making the notes an indispensable component of the pathways.

Common Core State StandardS for matHematICS
traditional Pathway: High school algebra I
The fundamental purpose of this course is to formalize and extend the mathematics that students learned in the
middle grades. Because it is built on the middle grades standards, this is a more ambitious version of Algebra I
than has generally been offered. The critical areas, called units, deepen and extend understanding of linear and
exponential relationships by contrasting them with each other and by applying linear models to data that exhibit a
linear trend, and students engage in methods for analyzing, solving, and using quadratic functions. The Mathematical
Practice Standards apply throughout each course and, together with the content standards, prescribe that students
experience mathematics as a coherent, useful, and logical subject that makes use of their ability to make sense of problem situations.
Critical Area 1: By the end of eighth grade, students have learned to solve linear equations in one variable and have
applied graphical and algebraic methods to analyze and solve systems of linear equations in two variables. Now,
students analyze and explain the process of solving an equation. Students develop fluency writing, interpreting, and
translating between various forms of linear equations and inequalities, and using them to solve problems. They master
the solution of linear equations and apply related solution techniques and the laws of exponents to the creation and solution of simple exponential equations.
Critical Area 2: In earlier grades, students define, evaluate, and compare functions, and use them to model
relationships between quantities. In this unit, students will learn function notation and develop the concepts of
domain and range. They explore many examples of functions, including sequences; they interpret functions given
graphically, numerically, symbolically, and verbally, translate between representations, and understand the limitations
of various representations. Students build on and informally extend their understanding of integer exponents
to consider exponential functions. They compare and contrast linear and exponential functions, distinguishing
between additive and multiplicative change. Students explore systems of equations and inequalities, and they find
and interpret their solutions. They interpret arithmetic sequences as linear functions and geometric sequences as exponential functions.
Critical Area 3: This unit builds upon prior students’ prior experiences with data, providing students with more
formal means of assessing how a model fits data. Students use regression techniques to describe approximately
linear relationships between quantities. They use graphical representations and knowledge of the context to make
judgments about the appropriateness of linear models. With linear models, they look at residuals to analyze the goodness of fit.
Critical Area 4: In this unit, students build on their knowledge from unit 2, where they extended the laws of exponents
to rational exponents. Students apply this new understanding of number and strengthen their ability to see structure
in and create quadratic and exponential expressions. They create and solve equations, inequalities, and systems of equations involving quadratic expressions.
Critical Area 5: In this unit, students consider quadratic functions, comparing the key characteristics of quadratic
functions to those of linear and exponential functions. They select from among these functions to model phenomena.
Students learn to anticipate the graph of a quadratic function by interpreting various forms of quadratic expressions.
In particular, they identify the real solutions of a quadratic equation as the zeros of a related quadratic function.
Students expand their experience with functions to include more specialized functions—absolute value, step, and those that are piecewise-defined.

Unit 1: relationships Between Quantities and reasoning with equations
By the end of eighth grade students have learned to solve linear equations in one variable and have applied graphical
and algebraic methods to analyze and solve systems of linear equations in two variables. This unit builds on these ear­
lier experiences by asking students to analyze and explain the process of solving an equation. Students develop flu­
ency writing, interpreting, and translating between various forms of linear equations and inequalities, and using them
to solve problems. They master the solution of linear equations and apply related solution techniques and the laws of
exponents to the creation and solution of simple exponential equations. All of this work is grounded on understand­ ing quantities and on relationships between them.

SKILLS TO MAINTAIN
Reinforce understanding of the properties of integer exponents. The initial experience with exponential expressions, equations, and functions involves integer exponents and builds on this understanding.* •  Reason quantitatively and use units to solve problems.
Working with quantities and the relationships between them provides grounding for work with expressions, equations, and functions.

Limit A.CED.3 to linear equations and inequalities. Limit A.CED.4 to formulas which are linear in the variable of interest.
A.CED.1 Create equations and inequalities in one variable and use them

relationships between quantities; graph equations on coordinate axes with labels and scales.
A.CED.3 Represent constraints by equations or inequalities, and by
systems of equations and/or inequalities, and interpret solutions as

Unit 2: Linear and exponential relationships
In earlier grades, students define, evaluate, and compare functions, and use them to model relationships between
quantities. In this unit, students will learn function notation and develop the concepts of domain and range. They
move beyond viewing functions as processes that take inputs and yield outputs and start viewing functions as objects
in their own right. They explore many examples of functions, including sequences; they interpret functions given
graphically, numerically, symbolically, and verbally, translate between representations, and understand the limitations
of various representations. They work with functions given by graphs and tables, keeping in mind that, depending
upon the context, these representations are likely to be approximate and incomplete. Their work includes functions
that can be described or approximated by formulas as well as those that cannot. When functions describe relation­
ships between quantities arising from a context, students reason with the units in which those quantities are mea­
sured. Students explore systems of equations and inequalities, and they find and interpret their solutions. Students
build on and informally extend their understanding of integer exponents to consider exponential functions. They
compare and contrast linear and exponential functions, distinguishing between additive and multiplicative change.
They interpret arithmetic sequences as linear functions and geometric sequences as exponential functions.

N.RN.1 Explain how the definition of the meaning of rational exponents
follows from extending the properties of integer exponents to
those values, allowing for a notation for radicals in terms of rational
exponents.  For example, we define 51/3 to be the cube root of 5 because

Common Core State Standards •  Understand the concept of a function and use function notation.
Students should experience a variety of types of situations modeled by functions. Detailed analysis of any particular class of functions at this stage is not advised. Students should apply these concepts throughout their future mathematics courses.
Draw examples from linear and exponential functions. In F.IF.3, draw connection to F.BF.2, which requires students to write arithmetic and geometric sequences. Emphasize arithmetic and geometric sequences as examples of linear and exponential functions.
•  Interpret functions that arise in appli­ cations in terms of a context.
For F.IF.4 and 5, focus on linear and exponential functions. For F.IF.6, focus on linear functions and exponential functions whose domain is a subset of the integers. Unit 5 in this course and the Algebra II course address other types of functions.
F.IF.1 Understand that a function from one set (called the domain) to
another set (called the range) assigns to each element of the domain
exactly one element of the range. If  f is a function and  x is an element of
its domain, then  f(x) denotes the output of  f corresponding to the input
x. The graph of  f is the graph of the equation  y = f(x).
F.IF.2 Use function notation, evaluate functions for inputs in their
domains, and interpret statements that use function notation in terms of a context.
F.IF.3 Recognize that sequences are functions, sometimes defined
recursively, whose domain is a subset of the integers.  For example, the
Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively by f(0) = f(1) = 1, f(n+1) = f(n) + f(n-1) for n ≥ 1.
F.IF.4 For a function that models a relationship between two quantities,
interpret key features of graphs and tables in terms of the quantities,
and sketch graphs showing key features given a verbal description
of the relationship.  Key features include: intercepts; intervals where
the function is increasing, decreasing, positive, or negative; relative
maximums and minimums; symmetries; end behavior; and periodicity.★
F.IF.5 Relate the domain of a function to its graph and, where applicable,
to the quantitative relationship it describes.  For example, if the function
h(n) gives the number of person-hours it takes to assemble n engines in
a factory, then the positive integers would be an appropriate domain for the function.★
F.IF.6 Calculate and interpret the average rate of change of a function
(presented symbolically or as a table) over a specified interval. Estimate the rate of change from a graph.★

F.IF.7 Graph functions expressed symbolically and show key features
of the graph, by hand in simple cases and using technology for more complicated cases.★
a.  Graph linear and quadratic functions and show intercepts, maxima, and minima.
e. Graph exponential and logarithmic functions, showing intercepts
and end behavior, and trigonometric functions, showing period, midline, and amplitude.
F.IF.9 Compare properties of two functions each represented in a
different way (algebraically, graphically, numerically in tables, or by
verbal descriptions).  For example, given a graph of one quadratic
function and an algebraic expression for another, say which has the larger maximum.

Focus on vertical translations of graphs of linear and exponential functions. Relate the vertical translation of a linear function to its y-intercept.
While applying other transformations to a linear graph is appropriate at this level, it may be difficult for students to identify or distinguish between the effects of the other transformations included in this standard.
F.BF.3 Identify the effect on the graph of replacing  f(x) by  f(x) + k,
k f(x), f(kx), and  f(x + k) for specific values of  k (both positive and

cases and illustrate an explanation of the effects on the graph using
technology.  Include recognizing even and odd functions from their graphs and algebraic expressions for them.

F.LE.1 Distinguish between situations that can be modeled with linear functions and with exponential functions.
a.  Prove that linear functions grow by equal differences over equal
intervals; and that exponential functions grow by equal factors over equal intervals.
b.  Recognize situations in which one quantity changes at a constant rate per unit interval relative to another.
c.  Recognize situations in which a quantity grows or decays by a
constant percent rate per unit interval relative to another.
F.LE.2 Construct linear and exponential functions, including arithmetic

Unit 3: Descriptive statistics
Experience with descriptive statistics began as early as Grade 6. Students were expected to display numerical data
and summarize it using measures of center and variability. By the end of middle school they were creating scatter­
plots and recognizing linear trends in data. This unit builds upon that prior experience, providing students with more
formal means of assessing how a model fits data. Students use regression techniques to describe approximately linear
relationships between quantities. They use graphical representations and knowledge of the context to make judg­
ments about the appropriateness of linear models. With linear models, they look at residuals to analyze the goodness of fit.

S.ID.1 Represent data with plots on the real number line (dot plots, histograms, and box plots).
S.ID.2 Use statistics appropriate to the shape of the data distribution
to compare center (median, mean) and spread (interquartile range,
standard deviation) of two or more different data sets.
S.ID.3 Interpret differences in shape, center, and spread in the context
of the data sets, accounting for possible effects of extreme data points (outliers).

Students take a more sophisticated look at using a linear function to model the relationship between two numerical variables. In addition to fitting a line to data, students assess how well the model fits by analyzing residuals.
S.ID.6b should be focused on linear models, but may be used to preview quadratic functions in Unit 5 of this course.
S.ID.5 Summarize categorical data for two categories in two-way
frequency tables. Interpret relative frequencies in the context of the
data (including joint, marginal, and conditional relative frequencies).
Recognize possible associations and trends in the data.
S.ID.6 Represent data on two quantitative variables on a scatter plot, and describe how the variables are related.
a.  Fit a function to the data; use functions fitted to data to solve
problems in the context of the data.  Use given functions or
choose a function suggested by the context. Emphasize linear and exponential models.
b.  Informally assess the fit of a function by plotting and analyzing residuals.
c.  Fit a linear function for a scatter plot that suggests a linear as­ sociation.
•  Interpret linear models.
Build on students’ work with linear relationships in eighth grade and introduce the correlation coefficient.
The focus here is on the computation and interpretation of the correlation coefficient as a measure of how well the data fit the relationship. The important distinction between a statistical relationship and a cause­ and-effect relationship arises in S.ID.9.

•  Write expressions in equivalent forms to solve problems.
It is important to balance conceptual understanding and procedural fluency in work with equivalent expressions.
For example, development of skill in factoring and completing the square goes hand-in-hand with understanding what different forms of a quadratic expression reveal.

In preparation for work with quadratic relationships students explore distinctions between rational and irrational num­
bers. They consider quadratic functions, comparing the key characteristics of quadratic functions to those of linear

the graph of a quadratic function by interpreting various forms of quadratic expressions. In particular, they identify
the real solutions of a quadratic equation as the zeros of a related quadratic function. Students learn that when qua­

traditional Pathway: Geometry
TheThe fundamental purpose of the course in Geometry is to formalize and extend students’ geometric experiences
from the middle grades. Students explore more complex geometric situations and deepen their explanations of geo­
metric relationships, moving towards formal mathematical arguments.  Important differences exist between this Ge­
ometry course and the historical approach taken in Geometry classes. For example, transformations are emphasized
early in this course. Close attention should be paid to the introductory content for the Geometry conceptual category
found in the high school CCSS. The Mathematical Practice Standards apply throughout each course and, together
with the content standards, prescribe that students experience mathematics as a coherent, useful, and logical subject
that makes use of their ability to make sense of problem situations. The critical areas, organized into six units are as follows.
Critical Area 1: In previous grades, students were asked to draw triangles based on given measurements. They also
have prior experience with rigid motions: translations, reflections, and rotations and have used these to develop no­
tions  about  what  it  means  for  two  objects  to  be  congruent.  In  this  unit,  students  establish  triangle  congruence  criteria,
based on analyses of rigid motions and formal constructions. They use triangle congruence as a familiar foundation
for the development of formal proof. Students prove theorems—using a variety of formats—and solve problems about
triangles, quadrilaterals, and other polygons. They apply reasoning to complete geometric constructions and explain why they work.
Critical Area 2: Students apply their earlier experience with dilations and proportional reasoning to build a formal
understanding of similarity. They identify criteria for similarity of triangles, use similarity to solve problems, and apply
similarity in right triangles to understand right triangle trigonometry, with particular attention to special right trian­
gles and the Pythagorean theorem. Students develop the Laws of Sines and Cosines in order to find missing mea­
sures of general (not necessarily right) triangles, building on students’ work with quadratic equations done in the first
course. They are able to distinguish whether three given measures (angles or sides) define 0, 1, 2, or infinitely many triangles.
Critical Area 3: Students’ experience with two-dimensional and three-dimensional objects is extended to include
informal explanations of circumference, area and volume formulas. Additionally, students apply their knowledge of
two-dimensional shapes to consider the shapes of cross-sections and the result of rotating a two-dimensional object about a line.
Critical Area 4: Building on their work with the Pythagorean theorem in 8th  grade to find distances, students use a
rectangular coordinate system to verify geometric relationships, including properties of special triangles and quad­
rilaterals and slopes of parallel and perpendicular lines, which relates back to work done in the first course. Students
continue their study of quadratics by connecting the geometric and algebraic definitions of the parabola.
Critical Area 5: In this unit students prove basic theorems about circles, such as a tangent line is perpendicular to a
radius, inscribed angle theorem, and theorems about chords, secants, and tangents dealing with segment lengths
and angle measures. They study relationships among segments on chords, secants, and tangents as an application of
similarity. In the Cartesian coordinate system, students use the distance formula to write the equation of a circle when
given  the  radius  and  the  coordinates  of  its  center.  Given  an  equation  of  a  circle,  they  draw  the  graph  in  the  coordinate
plane, and apply techniques for solving quadratic equations, which relates back to work done in the first course, to
determine intersections between lines and circles or parabolas and between two circles.
Critical Area 6: Building on probability concepts that began in the middle grades, students use the languages of set
theory to expand their ability to compute and interpret theoretical and experimental probabilities for compound
events, attending to mutually exclusive events, independent events, and conditional probability. Students should make
use of geometric probability models wherever possible. They use probability to make informed decisions.

Unit 1: congruence, Proof, and constructions
In previous grades, students were asked to draw triangles based on given measurements. They also have prior experi­
ence with rigid motions: translations, reflections, and rotations and have used these to develop notions about what it
means for two objects to be congruent. In this unit, students establish triangle congruence criteria, based on analyses
of rigid motions and formal constructions. They use triangle congruence as a familiar foundation for the development
of formal proof. Students prove theorems—using a variety of formats—and solve problems about triangles, quadrilat­
erals, and other polygons. They apply reasoning to complete geometric constructions and explain why they work.
Unit 1: Congruence, Proof, and Constructions
Clusters and Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Experiment with transformations in the plane.
Build on student experience with rigid motions from earlier grades. Point out the basis of rigid motions in geometric concepts, e.g., translations move points a specified distance along a line parallel to a specified line; rotations move objects along a circular arc with a specified center through a specified angle.
•  Understand congruence in terms of rigid motions.
Rigid motions are at the foundation of the definition of congruence. Students reason from the basic properties of rigid motions (that they preserve distance and angle), which are assumed without proof. Rigid motions and their assumed properties can be used to establish the usual triangle congruence criteria, which can then be used to prove other theorems.
G.CO.1 Know precise definitions of angle, circle, perpendicular line,
parallel line, and line segment, based on the undefined notions of point,
line, distance along a line, and distance around a circular arc.
G.CO.2 Represent transformations in the plane using, e.g.,
transparencies and geometry software; describe transformations as
functions that take points in the plane as inputs and give other points
as outputs. Compare transformations that preserve distance and angle
to those that do not (e.g., translation versus horizontal stretch).
G.CO.3 Given a rectangle, parallelogram, trapezoid, or regular polygon,
describe the rotations and reflections that carry it onto itself.
G.CO.4 Develop definitions of rotations, reflections, and translations
in terms of angles, circles, perpendicular lines, parallel lines, and line segments.
G.CO.5 Given a geometric figure and a rotation, reflection, or
translation,  draw  the  transformed  figure  using,  e.g.,  graph  paper,  tracing
paper, or geometry software. Specify a sequence of transformations that will carry a given figure onto another.
G.CO.6 Use geometric descriptions of rigid motions to transform
figures and to predict the effect of a given rigid motion on a given
figure; given two figures, use the definition of congruence in terms of rigid motions to decide if they are congruent.
G.CO.7 Use the definition of congruence in terms of rigid motions to
show that two triangles are congruent if and only if corresponding
pairs of sides and corresponding pairs of angles are congruent.
G.CO.8 Explain how the criteria for triangle congruence (ASA, SAS, and
SSS) follow from the definition of congruence in terms of rigid motions.

Encourage multiple ways of writing proofs, such as in narrative paragraphs, using flow diagrams, in two-column format, and using diagrams without words. Students should be encouraged to focus on the validity of the underlying reasoning while exploring a variety of formats for expressing that reasoning. Implementation of G.CO.10 may be extended to include concurrence of perpendicular bisectors and angle bisectors as preparation for G.C.3 in Unit 5.
G.CO.9 Prove theorems about lines and angles.  Theorems include:
vertical angles are congruent; when a transversal crosses parallel lines,
alternate interior angles are congruent and corresponding angles are
congruent; points on a perpendicular bisector of a line segment are
exactly those equidistant from the segment’s endpoints.
G.CO.10 Prove theorems about triangles.  Theorems include: measures
of interior angles of a triangle sum to 180°; base angles of isosceles
triangles are congruent; the segment joining midpoints of two sides of
a triangle is parallel to the third side and half the length; the medians of a triangle meet at a point.
G.CO.11 Prove theorems about parallelograms.  Theorems include:
opposite sides are congruent, opposite angles are congruent, the
diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, and conversely,
rectangles are parallelograms with congruent diagonals.

Unit 2: similarity, Proof, and trigonometry
Students apply their earlier experience with dilations and proportional reasoning to build a formal understanding
of similarity. They identify criteria for similarity of triangles, use similarity to solve problems, and apply similarity in
right triangles to understand right triangle trigonometry, with particular attention to special right triangles and the
Pythagorean theorem. Students develop the Laws of Sines and Cosines in order to find missing measures of general
(not necessarily right) triangles. They are able to distinguish whether three given measures (angles or sides) define 0, 1, 2, or infinitely many triangles.
Unit 2: Similarity, Proof, and Trigonometry

Common Core State Standards •  Understand similarity in terms of simi­ larity transformations.
G.SRT.1 Verify experimentally the properties of dilations given by a center and a scale factor.
a.  A dilation takes a line not passing through the center of the dila­
tion to a parallel line, and leaves a line passing through the center unchanged.
b.  The dilation of a line segment is longer or shorter in the ratio given by the scale factor.
G.SRT.2 Given two figures, use the definition of similarity in terms of
similarity transformations to decide if they are similar; explain using

G.SRT.3 Use the properties of similarity transformations to establish the
AA criterion for two triangles to be similar.
•  Prove theorems involving similarity.
G.SRT.4 Prove theorems about triangles.  Theorems include: a line

Students’ experience with two-dimensional and three-dimensional objects is extended to include informal explana­
tions of circumference, area and volume formulas. Additionally, students apply their knowledge of two-dimensional
shapes to consider the shapes of cross-sections and the result of rotating a two-dimensional object about a line.
Unit 3: Extending to Three Dimensions
Clusters and Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Explain volume formulas and use them to solve problems.
Informal arguments for area and volume formulas can make use of the way in which area and volume scale under similarity transformations:
when one figure in the plane results from another by applying a similarity transformation with scale factor k, its area is k2 times the area of the first.
Similarly, volumes of solid figures scale by k3 under a similarity transformation with scale factor k.

Unit 5: circles With and Without coordinates
In this unit, students prove basic theorems about circles, with particular attention to perpendicularity and inscribed
angles, in order to see symmetry in circles and as an application of triangle congruence criteria. They study relation­
ships among segments on chords, secants, and tangents as an application of similarity. In the Cartesian coordinate
system, students use the distance formula to write the equation of a circle when given the radius and the coordinates
of its center. Given an equation of a circle, they draw the graph in the coordinate plane, and apply techniques for solv­

Building on probability concepts that began in the middle grades, students use the languages of set theory to expand
their ability to compute and interpret theoretical and experimental probabilities for compound events, attending to
mutually exclusive events, independent events, and conditional probability. Students should make use of geometric
probability models wherever possible. They use probability to make informed decisions.

Common Core State Standards •  Understand independence and con­ ditional probability and use them to interpret data.
Build on work with two-way tables from Algebra I Unit 3 (S.ID.5) to develop understanding of conditional probability and independence.
•  Use the rules of probability to compute probabilities of compound events in a uniform probability model.
S.CP.1 Describe events as subsets of a sample space (the set of
outcomes) using characteristics (or categories) of the outcomes, or
as unions, intersections, or complements of other events (“or,” “and,” “not”).
S.CP.2 Understand that two events  A and  B are independent if the
probability of  A and  B occurring together is the product of their
probabilities, and use this characterization to determine if they are independent.
S.CP.3 Understand the conditional probability of  A given  B as  P(A
and  B)/P(B), and interpret independence of  A and  B as saying that
the conditional probability of  A given  B is the same as the probability
of  A, and the conditional probability of  B given  A is the same as the probability of  B.
S.CP.4 Construct and interpret two-way frequency tables of data when
two categories are associated with each object being classified. Use the
two-way table as a sample space to decide if events are independent
and to approximate conditional probabilities.  For example, collect
data from a random sample of students in your school on their favorite
subject among math, science, and English. Estimate the probability that
a randomly selected student from your school will favor science given
that the student is in tenth grade. Do the same for other subjects and compare the results.
S.CP.5 Recognize and explain the concepts of conditional probability
and independence in everyday language and everyday situations.  For
example, compare the chance of having lung cancer if you are a smoker
with the chance of being a smoker if you have lung cancer.
S.CP.6 Find the conditional probability of  A given  B as the fraction of  B’s
outcomes that also belong to  A, and interpret the answer in terms of the model.

traditional Pathway: algebra II
Building on their work with linear, quadratic, and exponential functions, students extend their repertoire of functions
to include polynomial, rational, and radical functions.2  Students work closely with the expressions that define the
functions, and continue to expand and hone their abilities to model situations and to solve equations, including
solving quadratic equations over the set of complex numbers and solving exponential equations using the properties
of logarithms. The Mathematical Practice Standards apply throughout each course and, together with the content
standards, prescribe that students experience mathematics as a coherent, useful, and logical subject that makes use
of their ability to make sense of problem situations. The critical areas for this course, organized into four units, are as
follows:
Critical Area 1: This unit develops the structural similarities between the system of polynomials and the system
of integers. Students draw on analogies between polynomial arithmetic and base-ten computation, focusing on
properties of operations, particularly the distributive property. Students connect multiplication of polynomials with
multiplication of multi-digit integers, and division of polynomials with long division of integers. Students identify
zeros of polynomials, including complex zeros of quadratic polynomials, and make connections between zeros of
polynomials and solutions of polynomial equations. The unit culminates with the fundamental theorem of algebra. A
central theme of this unit is that the arithmetic of rational expressions is governed by the same rules as the arithmetic of rational numbers.
Critical Area 2: Building on their previous work with functions, and on their work with trigonometric ratios and circles
in Geometry, students now use the coordinate plane to extend trigonometry to model periodic phenomena.
Critical Area 3: In this unit students synthesize and generalize what they have learned about a variety of function
families. They extend their work with exponential functions to include solving exponential equations with logarithms.
They explore the effects of transformations on graphs of diverse functions, including functions arising in an
application, in order to abstract the general principle that transformations on a graph always have the same effect
regardless of the type of the underlying function. They identify appropriate types of functions to model a situation,
they adjust parameters to improve the model, and they compare models by analyzing appropriateness of fit and
making judgments about the domain over which a model is a good fit. The description of modeling as “the process
of choosing and using mathematics and statistics to analyze empirical situations, to understand them better, and to
make decisions” is at the heart of this unit. The narrative discussion and diagram of the modeling cycle should be
considered when knowledge of functions, statistics, and geometry is applied in a modeling context.
Critical Area 4: In this unit, students see how the visual displays and summary statistics they learned in earlier grades
relate to different types of data and to probability distributions. They identify different ways of collecting data—
including sample surveys, experiments, and simulations—and the role that randomness and careful design play in the conclusions that can be drawn.

2In this course rational functions are limited to those whose numerators are of degree at most 1 and denominators of degree at most 2;
radical functions are limited to square roots or cube roots of at most quadratic polynomials.

Unit 1: Polynomial, Rational, and Radical Relationships
Clusters and Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Use polynomial identities to solve problems.
This cluster has many possibilities for optional enrichment, such as relating the example in A.APR.4 to the solution of the system u2+v2=1, v = t(u+1), relating the Pascal triangle property of binomial coefficients to (x+y)n+1 = (x+y)(x+y)n, deriving explicit formulas for the coefficients, or proving the binomial theorem by induction.
A.APR.4 Prove polynomial identities and use them to describe
numerical relationships. For example, the polynomial identity  (x2 + y2)2
= (x2 – y2)2 + (2xy)2 can be used to generate Pythagorean triples.
A.APR.5  (+)  Know and apply the Binomial Theorem for the expansion
of  (x + y)n  in powers of  x and  y for a positive integer  n, where  x and  y
are any numbers, with coefficients determined for example by Pascal’s
Triangle.
•  Rewrite rational expressions
The limitations on rational functions apply to the rational expressions in A.APR.6. A.APR.7 requires the general division algorithm for polynomials.
A.APR.6 Rewrite simple rational expressions in different forms; write
a(x)/b(x) in the form  q(x) + r(x)/b(x), where  a(x), b(x), q(x), and  r(x)
are polynomials with the degree of  r(x) less than the degree of  b(x),
using inspection, long division, or, for the more complicated examples, a computer algebra system.
A.APR.7  (+)  Understand that rational expressions form a system
analogous to the rational numbers, closed under addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division by a nonzero rational expression; add,
subtract, multiply, and divide rational expressions.

Unit 3: modeling with Functions
In this unit students synthesize and generalize what they have learned about a variety of function families. They
extend their work with exponential functions to include solving exponential equations with logarithms. They explore
the effects of transformations on graphs of diverse functions, including functions arising in an application, in order to
abstract the general principle that transformations on a graph always have the same effect regardless of the type of
the underlying function. They identify appropriate types of functions to model a situation, they adjust parameters to
improve the model, and they compare models by analyzing appropriateness of fit and making judgments about the
domain over which a model is a good fit.  The description of modeling as “the process of choosing and using math­
ematics and statistics to analyze empirical situations, to understand them better, and to make decisions” is at the
heart of this unit. The narrative discussion and diagram of the modeling cycle should be considered when knowledge
of functions, statistics, and geometry is applied in a modeling context.
Unit 3: Modeling with Functions
Clusters and Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Create equations that describe num­ bers or relationships.
For A.CED.1, use all available types of functions to create such equations, including root functions, but constrain to simple cases. While functions used in A.CED.2, 3, and 4 will often be linear, exponential, or quadratic the types of problems should draw from more complex situations than those addressed in Algebra I. For example, finding the equation of a line through a given point perpendicular to another line allows one to find the distance from a point to a line. Note that the example given for A.CED.4 applies to earlier instances of this standard, not to the current course.
•  Interpret functions that arise in appli­ cations in terms of a context.
Emphasize the selection of a model function based on behavior of data and context.
A.CED.1 Create equations and inequalities in one variable and use them
to solve problems.  Include equations arising from linear and quadratic
functions, and simple rational and exponential functions.
A.CED.2 Create equations in two or more variables to represent
relationships between quantities; graph equations on coordinate axes with labels and scales.
A.CED.3 Represent constraints by equations or inequalities, and by
systems of equations and/or inequalities, and interpret solutions as
viable or non-viable options in a modeling context.  For example,
represent inequalities describing nutritional and cost constraints on combinations of different foods.
A.CED.4 Rearrange formulas to highlight a quantity of interest, using the
same reasoning as in solving equations.  For example, rearrange Ohm’s law V = IR to highlight resistance R.
F.IF.4 For a function that models a relationship between two quantities,
interpret key features of graphs and tables in terms of the quantities,
and sketch graphs showing key features given a verbal description
of the relationship.  Key features include: intercepts; intervals where
the function is increasing, decreasing, positive, or negative; relative
maximums and minimums; symmetries; end behavior; and periodicity.★
F.IF.5 Relate the domain of a function to its graph and, where applicable,
to the quantitative relationship it describes.  For example, if the function
h(n) gives the number of person-hours it takes to assemble n engines in
a factory, then the positive integers would be an appropriate domain for the function.★
F.IF.6 Calculate and interpret the average rate of change of a function
(presented symbolically or as a table) over a specified interval. Estimate the rate of change from a graph.★

equivalent forms to reveal and explain different properties of the function.
F.IF.9 Compare properties of two functions each represented in a
different way (algebraically, graphically, numerically in tables, or by
verbal descriptions). For example, given a graph of one quadratic
function and an algebraic expression for another, say which has the larger maximum.
•  Build a function that models a relation­ ship between two quantities.
Develop models for more complex or sophisticated situations than in previous courses.
F.BF.1 Write a function that describes a relationship between two quantities.*
b. Combine standard function types using arithmetic operations.

appendIx a: deSIgnIng HIgH SCHool matHematICS CourSeS baSed on tHe Common Core State StandardS  | 42 •  Build new functions from existing func­ tions.
Use transformations of functions to find models as students consider increasingly more complex situations.
For F.BF.3, note the effect of multiple transformations on a single graph and the common effect of each transformation across function types.
Extend F.BF.4a to simple rational, simple radical, and simple exponential functions; connect F.BF.4a to F.LE.4.
F.BF.3 Identify the effect on the graph of replacing  f(x) by  f(x) + k,
k f(x), f(kx), and  f(x + k) for specific values of  k (both positive and
negative); find the value of  k given the graphs. Experiment with
cases and illustrate an explanation of the effects on the graph using
technology. Include recognizing even and odd functions from their graphs and algebraic expressions for them.
F.BF.4 Find inverse functions.
a.  Solve an equation of the form  f(x) = c for a simple function  f
that has an inverse and write an expression for the inverse.  For
example, f(x) = 2 x3 or f(x) = (x+1)/(x-1) for x ≠ 1.

evaluate the logarithm using technology.
Consider extending this unit to include the relationship between properties of logarithms and properties of exponents, such as the connection between the properties of exponents and the basic logarithm property that log xy = log x +log y.

Unit 4: Inferences and conclusions from Data
In this unit, students see how the visual displays and summary statistics they learned in earlier grades relate to differ­
ent types of data and to probability distributions. They identify different ways of collecting data—including sample
surveys, experiments, and simulations—and the role that randomness and careful design play in the conclusions that can be drawn.
Unit 4: Inferences and Conclusions from Data
Clusters and Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards
•  Summarize, represent, and interpret data on a single count or measurement variable.
While students may have heard of the normal
distribution, it is unlikely that they will have prior
experience using it to make specific estimates. Build on
students’ understanding of data distributions to help
them see how the normal distribution uses area to make
estimates of frequencies (which can be expressed as
probabilities). Emphasize that only some data are well described by a normal distribution.
S.ID.4 Use the mean and standard deviation of a data
set to fit it to a normal distribution and to estimate
population percentages. Recognize that there are data
sets for which such a procedure is not appropriate. Use
calculators, spreadsheets, and tables to estimate areas under the normal curve.
•  Understand and evaluate random processes underlying statistical experiments.
For S.IC.2, include comparing theoretical and empirical
results to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment.
S.IC.1 Understand statistics as a process for making inferences about population parameters based on a random sample from that population.
S.IC.2 Decide if a specified model is consistent with
results from a given data-generating process, e.g.,
using simulation.  For example, a model says a spinning
coin falls heads up with probability 0.5. Would a result
of 5 tails in a row cause you to question the model?
appendIx a: deSIgnIng HIgH SCHool matHematICS CourSeS baSed on tHe Common Core State StandardS  | 43
•  Make inferences and justify conclusions from sample surveys, experiments, and observational studies.
In earlier grades, students are introduced to different
ways of collecting data and use graphical displays and
summary statistics to make comparisons. These ideas
are revisited with a focus on how the way in which data is collected determines the scope and nature
of the conclusions that can be drawn from that data.
The concept of statistical significance is developed
informally through simulation as meaning a result that
is unlikely to have occurred solely as a result of random selection in sampling or random assignment in an experiment.
For S.IC.4 and 5, focus on the variability of results from
experiments—that is, focus on statistics as a way of
dealing with, not eliminating, inherent randomness.
S.IC.3 Recognize the purposes of and differences
among sample surveys, experiments, and observational
studies; explain how randomization relates to each.
S.IC.4 Use data from a sample survey to estimate a
population mean or proportion; develop a margin of
error through the use of simulation models for random sampling.
S.IC.5 Use data from a randomized experiment to
compare two treatments; use simulations to decide if differences between parameters are significant.
S.IC.6 Evaluate reports based on data.
•  Use probability to evaluate outcomes of decisions.
Extend to more complex probability models. Include
situations such as those involving quality control, or
diagnostic tests that yield both false positive and false negative results.
S.MD.6  (+)  Use  probabilities  to  make  fair  decisions  (e.g.,
drawing by lots, using a random number generator).
S.MD.7 (+) Analyze decisions and strategies using
probability concepts (e.g., product testing, medical
testing, pulling a hockey goalie at the end of a game).

Common Core State StandardS for matHematICS
Integrated Pathway: mathematics I
The fundamental purpose of Mathematics I is to formalize and extend the mathematics that students learned in the
middle grades. The critical areas, organized into units, deepen and extend understanding of linear relationships, in
part by contrasting them with exponential phenomena, and in part by applying linear models to data that exhibit a
linear trend. Mathematics 1 uses properties and theorems involving congruent figures to deepen and extend un­
derstanding of geometric knowledge from prior grades. The final unit in the course ties together the algebraic and
geometric ideas studied. The Mathematical Practice Standards apply throughout each course and, together with the
content standards, prescribe that students experience mathematics as a coherent, useful, and logical subject that
makes use of their ability to make sense of problem situations.
Critical Area 1: By the end of eighth grade students have had a variety of experiences working with expressions and
creating equations. In this first unit, students continue this work by using quantities to model and analyze situations,
to interpret expressions, and by creating equations to describe situations.
Critical Area 2: In earlier grades, students define, evaluate, and compare functions, and use them to model relation­
ships between quantities. In this unit, students will learn function notation and develop the concepts of domain
and range. They move beyond viewing functions as processes that take inputs and yield outputs and start viewing
functions as objects in their own right. They explore many examples of functions, including sequences; they interpret
functions given graphically, numerically, symbolically, and verbally, translate between representations, and understand
the limitations of various representations. They work with functions given by graphs and tables, keeping in mind that,
depending upon the context, these representations are likely to be approximate and incomplete. Their work includes
functions that can be described or approximated by formulas as well as those that cannot. When functions describe
relationships between quantities arising from a context, students reason with the units in which those quantities are
measured. Students build on and informally extend their understanding of integer exponents to consider exponential
functions. They compare and contrast linear and exponential functions, distinguishing between additive and multi­
plicative change. They interpret arithmetic sequences as linear functions and geometric sequences as exponential functions.
Critical Area 3: By the end of eighth grade, students have learned to solve linear equations in one variable and have
applied graphical and algebraic methods to analyze and solve systems of linear equations in two variables. This unit
builds on these earlier experiences by asking students to analyze and explain the process of solving an equation
and to justify the process used in solving a system of equations. Students develop fluency writing, interpreting, and
translating between various forms of linear equations and inequalities, and using them to solve problems. They master
the solution of linear equations and apply related solution techniques and the laws of exponents to the creation and
solution of simple exponential equations. Students explore systems of equations and inequalities, and they find and
interpret their solutions. All of this work is grounded on understanding quantities and on relationships between them.
Critical Area 4: This unit builds upon prior students’ prior experiences with data, providing students with more formal
means of assessing how a model fits data. Students use regression techniques to describe approximately linear rela­

about the appropriateness of linear models. With linear models, they look at residuals to analyze the goodness of fit.
Critical Area 5: In previous grades, students were asked to draw triangles based on given measurements. They also
have prior experience with rigid motions: translations, reflections, and rotations and have used these to develop no­
tions  about  what  it  means  for  two  objects  to  be  congruent.  In  this  unit,  students  establish  triangle  congruence  criteria,
based on analyses of rigid motions and formal constructions. They solve problems about triangles, quadrilaterals, and
other polygons. They apply reasoning to complete geometric constructions and explain why they work.
Critical Area 6: Building on their work with the Pythagorean Theorem in 8th  grade to find distances, students use a
rectangular coordinate system to verify geometric relationships, including properties of special triangles and quadri­
laterals and slopes of parallel and perpendicular lines.

SKILLS TO MAINTAIN
Reinforce understanding of the properties of integer exponents. The initial experience with exponential expressions, equations, and functions involves integer exponents and builds on this understanding.
•  Reason quantitatively and use units to solve problems.
Working with quantities and the relationships between them provides grounding for work with expressions, equations, and functions.

A.SSE.1 Interpret expressions that represent a quantity in terms of its context.★
a.  Interpret parts of an expression, such as terms, factors, and coef­ ficients.
b.  Interpret complicated expressions by viewing one or more of
their parts as a single entity.  For example, interpret P(1+r)n as the product of P and a factor not depending on P.
•   Create equations that describe num­ bers or relationships.
Limit A.CED.1 and A.CED.2 to linear and exponential equations, and, in the case of exponential equations, limit to situations requiring evaluation of exponential functions at integer inputs.
Limit A.CED.3 to linear equations and inequalities. Limit A.CED.4 to formulas with a linear focus.
A.CED.1 Create equations and inequalities in one variable and use them
to solve problems.  Include equations arising from linear and quadratic
functions, and simple rational and exponential functions.
A.CED.2 Create equations in two or more variables to represent
relationships between quantities; graph equations on coordinate axes with labels and scales.
A.CED.3 Represent constraints by equations or inequalities, and by
systems of equations and/or inequalities, and interpret solutions as
viable or non-viable options in a modeling context.  For example,
represent inequalities describing nutritional and cost constraints on combinations of different foods.
A.CED.4 Rearrange formulas to highlight a quantity of interest, using the
same reasoning as in solving equations.  For example, rearrange Ohm’s law V = IR to highlight resistance R.

Unit 2: Linear and exponential relationships
In earlier grades, students define, evaluate, and compare functions, and use them to model relationships between
quantities. In this unit, students will learn function notation and develop the concepts of domain and range. They
move beyond viewing functions as processes that take inputs and yield outputs and start viewing functions as objects
in their own right. They explore many examples of functions, including sequences; they interpret functions given
graphically, numerically, symbolically, and verbally, translate between representations, and understand the limitations
of various representations. They work with functions given by graphs and tables, keeping in mind that, depending
upon the context, these representations are likely to be approximate and incomplete. Their work includes functions
that can be described or approximated by formulas as well as those that cannot. When functions describe relation­
ships between quantities arising from a context, students reason with the units in which those quantities are mea­
sured. Students build on and informally extend their understanding of integer exponents to consider exponential
functions. They compare and contrast linear and exponential functions, distinguishing between additive and multi­
plicative change. They interpret arithmetic sequences as linear functions and geometric sequences as exponential functions.

Common Core State Standards •  Represent and solve equations and inequalities graphically.
For A.REI.10 focus on linear and exponential equations and be able to adapt and apply that learning to other types of equations in future courses.
For A.REI.11, focus on cases where f(x) and g(x) are linear or exponential.
A.REI.10 Understand that the graph of an equation in two variables is
the set of all its solutions plotted in the coordinate plane, often forming a curve (which could be a line).
A.REI.11 Explain why the  x-coordinates of the points where the graphs
of the equations  y = f(x) and  y = g(x) intersect are the solutions of
the equation  f(x) = g(x); find the solutions approximately, e.g., using
technology to graph the functions, make tables of values, or find
successive approximations. Include cases where  f(x) and/or  g(x) are
linear, polynomial, rational, absolute value, exponential, and logarithmic functions.★
A.REI.12 Graph the solutions to a linear inequality in two variables as a
half-plane (excluding the boundary in the case of a strict inequality),
and graph the solution set to a system of linear inequalities in two
variables as the intersection of the corresponding half-planes.
appendIx a: deSIgnIng HIgH SCHool matHematICS CourSeS baSed on tHe Common Core State StandardS  | 54 •  Understand the concept of a function and use function notation.
Students should experience a variety of types of situations modeled by functions. Detailed analysis of any particular class of function at this stage is not advised. Students should apply these concepts throughout their future mathematics courses.
Draw examples from linear and exponential functions. In F.IF.3, draw connection to F.BF.2, which requires students to write arithmetic and geometric sequences. Emphasize arithmetic and geometric sequences as examples of linear and exponential functions.
F.IF.1 Understand that a function from one set (called the domain) to
another set (called the range) assigns to each element of the domain
exactly one element of the range. If  f is a function and  x is an element of
its domain, then  f(x) denotes the output of  f corresponding to the input
x. The graph of  f is the graph of the equation  y = f(x).
F.IF.2 Use function notation, evaluate functions for inputs in their
domains, and interpret statements that use function notation in terms of a context.
F.IF.3 Recognize that sequences are functions, sometimes defined
recursively, whose domain is a subset of the integers.  For example, the
Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively by f(0) = f(1) = 1, f(n+1) = f(n) + f(n-1) for n ≥ 1.

N.RN.1 and N.RN. 2 will need to be referenced here before discussing exponential models with continuous domains.
F.IF.4 For a function that models a relationship between two quantities,
interpret key features of graphs and tables in terms of the quantities,
and sketch graphs showing key features given a verbal description
of the relationship.  Key features include: intercepts; intervals where
the function is increasing, decreasing, positive, or negative; relative
maximums and minimums; symmetries; end behavior; and periodicity.★
F.IF.5 Relate the domain of a function to its graph and, where applicable,
to the quantitative relationship it describes.  For example, if the function
h(n) gives the number of person-hours it takes to assemble n engines in
a factory, then the positive integers would be an appropriate domain for the function.★
F.IF.6 Calculate and interpret the average rate of change of a function
(presented symbolically or as a table) over a specified interval. Estimate the rate of change from a graph.★ •  Analyze functions using different rep­ resentations.
For F.IF.7a, 7e, and 9 focus on linear and exponential functions. Include comparisons of two functions presented algebraically. For example, compare the growth of two linear functions, or two exponential functions such as y=3n and y=100·2n.
F.IF.7 Graph functions expressed symbolically and show key features
of the graph, by hand in simple cases and using technology for more complicated cases.★

e. Graph exponential and logarithmic functions, showing intercepts
and end behavior, and trigonometric functions, showing period, midline, and amplitude.
F.IF.9 Compare properties of two functions each represented in a
different way (algebraically, graphically, numerically in tables, or by
verbal descriptions).  For example, given a graph of one quadratic

F.BF.1 Write a function that describes a relationship between two quantities.★
a.  Determine an explicit expression, a recursive process, or steps for calculation from a context.
b.  Combine standard function types using arithmetic operations.
For example, build a function that models the temperature of a
cooling body by adding a constant function to a decaying expo­ nential, and relate these functions to the model.
F.BF.2 Write arithmetic and geometric sequences both recursively and
with an explicit formula, use them to model situations, and translate between the two forms.★ •  Build new functions from existing func­ tions.
Focus on vertical translations of graphs of linear and exponential functions. Relate the vertical translation of a linear function to its y-intercept.
While applying other transformations to a linear graph is appropriate at this level, it may be difficult for students to identify or distinguish between the effects of the other transformations included in this standard.
F.BF.3 Identify the effect on the graph of replacing  f(x) by  f(x) + k,
k f(x), f(kx), and  f(x + k) for specific values of  k (both positive and
negative); find the value of  k given the graphs. Experiment with

Unit 3: reasoning with equations
By the end of eighth grade, students have learned to solve linear equations in one variable and have applied graphi­
cal and algebraic methods to analyze and solve systems of linear equations in two variables. This unit builds on these
earlier experiences by asking students to analyze and explain the process of solving an equation and to justify the
process  used  in  solving  a  system  of  equations.  Students  develop  fluency  writing,  interpreting,  and  translating  between
various forms of linear equations and inequalities, and using them to solve problems. They master the solution of lin­
ear equations and apply related solution techniques and the laws of exponents to the creation and solution of simple
exponential equations. Students explore systems of equations and inequalities, and they find and interpret their solu­
tions. All of this work is grounded on understanding quantities and on relationships between them.

Unit 4: Descriptive statistics
Experience with descriptive statistics began as early as Grade 6. Students were expected to display numerical
data and summarize it using measures of center and variability. By the end of middle school they were creating
scatterplots and recognizing linear trends in data. This unit builds upon that prior experience, providing students with
more formal means of assessing how a model fits data. Students use regression techniques to describe approximately
linear relationships between quantities. They use graphical representations and knowledge of the context to make
judgments about the appropriateness of linear models. With linear models, they look at residuals to analyze the goodness of fit.

Common Core State Standards •  Summarize, represent, and interpret data on a single count or measurement variable.

S.ID.1 Represent data with plots on the real number line (dot plots, histograms, and box plots).
S.ID.2 Use statistics appropriate to the shape of the data distribution
to compare center (median, mean) and spread (interquartile range,
standard deviation) of two or more different data sets.
S.ID.3 Interpret differences in shape, center, and spread in the context
of the data sets, accounting for possible effects of extreme data points (outliers).

Students take a more sophisticated look at using a linear function to model the relationship between two numerical variables. In addition to fitting a line to data, students assess how well the model fits by analyzing residuals.
S.ID.6b should be focused on situations for which linear models are appropriate.
S.ID.5 Summarize categorical data for two categories in two-way
frequency tables. Interpret relative frequencies in the context of the
data (including joint, marginal, and conditional relative frequencies).
Recognize possible associations and trends in the data.
S.ID.6 Represent data on two quantitative variables on a scatter plot, and describe how the variables are related.
a.  Fit a function to the data; use functions fitted to data to solve
problems in the context of the data.  Use given functions or
choose a function suggested by the context. Emphasize linear and exponential models.
b.  Informally assess the fit of a function by plotting and analyzing residuals.
c.  Fit  a  linear  function  for  scatter  plots  that  suggest  a  linear  associa­ tion.
•  Interpret linear models.
Build on students’ work with linear relationships in eighth grade and introduce the correlation coefficient.
The focus here is on the computation and interpretation of the correlation coefficient as a measure of how well the data fit the relationship. The important distinction between a statistical relationship and a cause­ and-effect relationship arises in S.ID.9.
S.ID.7 Interpret the slope (rate of change) and the intercept (constant
term) of a linear model in the context of the data.

Unit 5: congruence, Proof, and constructions
In previous grades, students were asked to draw triangles based on given measurements. They also have prior experi­
ence with rigid motions: translations, reflections, and rotations and have used these to develop notions about what it
means for two objects to be congruent. In this unit, students establish triangle congruence criteria, based on analyses
of rigid motions and formal constructions. They solve problems about triangles, quadrilaterals, and other polygons.
They apply reasoning to complete geometric constructions and explain why they work.
Unit 5: Congruence, Proof, and Constructions
Clusters and Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Experiment with transformations in the plane.
Build on student experience with rigid motions from earlier grades. Point out the basis of rigid motions in geometric concepts, e.g., translations move points a specified distance along a line parallel to a specified line; rotations move objects along a circular arc with a specified center through a specified angle.
•  Understand congruence in terms of rigid motions.
Rigid motions are at the foundation of the definition of congruence. Students reason from the basic properties of rigid motions (that they preserve distance and angle), which are assumed without proof. Rigid motions and their assumed properties can be used to establish the usual triangle congruence criteria, which can then be used to prove other theorems.
G.CO.1 Know precise definitions of angle, circle, perpendicular line,
parallel line, and line segment, based on the undefined notions of point,
line, distance along a line, and distance around a circular arc.
G.CO.2  Represent  transformations  in  the  plane  using,  e.g.,  transparencies
and geometry software; describe transformations as functions that take
points in the plane as inputs and give other points as outputs. Compare
transformations that preserve distance and angle to those that do not (e.g., translation versus horizontal stretch).
G.CO.3 Given a rectangle, parallelogram, trapezoid, or regular polygon,
describe the rotations and reflections that carry it onto itself.
G.CO.4 Develop definitions of rotations, reflections, and translations
in terms of angles, circles, perpendicular lines, parallel lines, and line segments.
G.CO.5 Given a geometric figure and a rotation, reflection, or translation,
draw the transformed figure using, e.g., graph paper, tracing paper, or
geometry software. Specify a sequence of transformations that will carry a given figure onto another.

G.CO.6 Use geometric descriptions of rigid motions to transform figures
and to predict the effect of a given rigid motion on a given figure; given
two figures, use the definition of congruence in terms of rigid motions to decide if they are congruent.
G.CO.7 Use the definition of congruence in terms of rigid motions to
show that two triangles are congruent if and only if corresponding pairs
of sides and corresponding pairs of angles are congruent.
G.CO.8 Explain how the criteria for triangle congruence (ASA, SAS, and
SSS) follow from the definition of congruence in terms of rigid motions.
•  Make geometric constructions.
Build on prior student experience with simple constructions. Emphasize the ability to formalize and defend how these constructions result in the desired objects.
Some of these constructions are closely related to previous standards and can be introduced in conjunction with them.

and methods (compass and straightedge, string, reflective devices,
paper folding, dynamic geometric software, etc.).  Copying a segment;
copying an angle; bisecting a segment; bisecting an angle; constructing

algebraically.  For example, prove or disprove that a figure defined
by four given points in the coordinate plane is a rectangle; prove or
disprove that the point (1, √3) lies on the circle centered at the origin and containing the point (0, 2).

Integrated Pathway: mathematics II
The focus of Mathematics II is on quadratic expressions, equations, and functions; comparing their characteristics
and behavior to those of linear and exponential relationships from Mathematics I as organized into 6 critical areas,
or units. The need for extending the set of rational numbers arises and real and complex numbers are introduced so
that all quadratic equations can be solved. The link between probability and data is explored through conditional
probability and counting methods, including their use in making and evaluating decisions. The study of similarity
leads to an understanding of right triangle trigonometry and connects to quadratics through Pythagorean
relationships. Circles, with their quadratic algebraic representations, round out the course. The Mathematical
Practice Standards apply throughout each course and, together with the content standards, prescribe that students
experience mathematics as a coherent, useful, and logical subject that makes use of their ability to make sense of problem situations.
Critical Area 1: Students extend the laws of exponents to rational exponents and explore distinctions between rational
and irrational numbers by considering their decimal representations. In Unit 3, students learn that when quadratic
equations do not have real solutions the number system must be extended so that solutions exist, analogous to the
way in which extending the whole numbers to the negative numbers allows x+1 = 0 to have a solution. Students
explore relationships between number systems: whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, real numbers, and
complex numbers. The guiding principle is that equations with no solutions in one number system may have solutions in a larger number system.
Critical Area 2: Students consider quadratic functions, comparing the key characteristics of quadratic functions to
those of linear and exponential functions. They select from among these functions to model phenomena. Students
learn to anticipate the graph of a quadratic function by interpreting various forms of quadratic expressions. In
particular, they identify the real solutions of a quadratic equation as the zeros of a related quadratic function.
When quadratic equations do not have real solutions, students learn that that the graph of the related quadratic
function does not cross the horizontal axis. They expand their experience with functions to include more specialized
functions—absolute value, step, and those that are piecewise-defined.
Critical Area 3: Students begin this unit by focusing on the structure of expressions, rewriting expressions to clarify
and reveal aspects of the relationship they represent. They create and solve equations, inequalities, and systems of
equations involving exponential and quadratic expressions.
Critical Area 4: Building on probability concepts that began in the middle grades, students use the languages of set
theory to expand their ability to compute and interpret theoretical and experimental probabilities for compound
events, attending to mutually exclusive events, independent events, and conditional probability. Students should make
use of geometric probability models wherever possible. They use probability to make informed decisions.
Critical Area 5: Students apply their earlier experience with dilations and proportional reasoning to build a formal
understanding of similarity. They identify criteria for similarity of triangles, use similarity to solve problems, and
apply similarity in right triangles to understand right triangle trigonometry, with particular attention to special right
triangles and the Pythagorean Theorem. It is in this unit that students develop facility with geometric proof. They
use what they know about congruence and similarity to prove theorems involving lines, angles, triangles, and other
polygons. They explore a variety of formats for writing proofs.
Critical Area 6: In this unit students prove basic theorems about circles, such as a tangent line is perpendicular to a
radius, inscribed angle theorem, and theorems about chords, secants, and tangents dealing with segment lengths
and angle measures. In the Cartesian coordinate system, students use the distance formula to write the equation of a
circle when given the radius and the coordinates of its center, and the equation of a parabola with vertical axis when
given an equation of its directrix and the coordinates of its focus. Given an equation of a circle, they draw the graph in
the coordinate plane, and apply techniques for solving quadratic equations to determine intersections between lines
and circles or a parabola and between two circles. Students develop informal arguments justifying common formulas
for circumference, area, and volume of geometric objects, especially those related to circles.

Unit 1: extending the number system
Students extend the laws of exponents to rational exponents and explore distinctions between rational and irrational
numbers by considering their decimal representations. In Unit 2, students learn that when quadratic equations do not
have real solutions the number system must be extended so that solutions exist, analogous to the way in which ex­
tending the whole numbers to the negative numbers allows x+1 = 0 to have a solution. Students explore relationships
between number systems: whole numbers, integers, rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers. The guid­
ing principle is that equations with no solutions in one number system may have solutions in a larger number system.

we want (51/3)3 = 5(1/3)3 to hold, so (51/3)3 must equal 5.

Unit 2: Quadratic Functions and modeling
Students consider quadratic functions, comparing the key characteristics of quadratic functions to those of linear and
exponential functions. They select from among these functions to model phenomena. Students learn to anticipate the
graph of a quadratic function by interpreting various forms of quadratic expressions. In particular, they identify the
real solutions of a quadratic equation as the zeros of a related quadratic function. When quadratic equations do not
have real solutions, students learn that that the graph of the related quadratic function does not cross the horizontal
axis. They expand their experience with functions to include more specialized functions—absolute value, step, and those that are piecewise-defined.

the function is increasing, decreasing, positive, or negative; relative
maximums and minimums; symmetries; end behavior; and periodicity.★
F.IF.5 Relate the domain of a function to its graph and, where applicable,
to the quantitative relationship it describes.  For example, if the function
h(n) gives the number of person-hours it takes to assemble n engines in
a factory, then the positive integers would be an appropriate domain for the function.★

F.BF.4 Find inverse functions.
a.  Solve an equation of the form  f(x) = c for a simple function  f
that has an inverse and write an expression for the inverse.  For
example, f(x) = 2 x3 or f(x) = (x+1)/(x-1) for x ≠ 1.

aspects of the relationship they represent. They create and solve equations, inequalities, and systems of equations involving exponential and quadratic expressions.

Common Core State Standards •  Interpret the structure of expressions.
Focus on quadratic and exponential expressions. For A.SSE.1b, exponents are extended from the integer exponents found in Mathematics I to rational exponents focusing on those that represent square or cube roots.
A.SSE.1 Interpret expressions that represent a quantity in terms of its context.★
a.  Interpret parts of an expression, such as terms, factors, and coef­ ficients.
b.  Interpret complicated expressions by viewing one or more of
their parts as a single entity.  For example, interpret P(1+r)n as the product of P and a factor not depending on P.
A.SSE.2 Use the structure of an expression to identify ways to rewrite
it. For example, see  x4 – y4 as  (x2)2 – (y2)2, thus recognizing it as a
difference of squares that can be factored as  (x2 – y2)(x2 + y2).
•  Write expressions in equivalent forms to solve problems.
It is important to balance conceptual understanding and procedural fluency in work with equivalent expressions.
For example, development of skill in factoring and completing the square goes hand-in-hand with understanding what different forms of a quadratic expression reveal.

Unit 4: applications of Probability
Building on probability concepts that began in the middle grades, students use the languages of set theory to expand
their ability to compute and interpret theoretical and experimental probabilities for compound events, attending to
mutually exclusive events, independent events, and conditional probability. Students should make use of geometric
probability models wherever possible. They use probability to make informed decisions.
Unit 4: Applications of Probability
Clusters and Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Understand independence and con­ ditional probability and use them to interpret data.
Build on work with two-way tables from Mathematics I Unit 4 (S.ID.5) to develop understanding of conditional probability and independence.
•  Use the rules of probability to compute probabilities of compound events in a uniform probability model.
S.CP.1 Describe events as subsets of a sample space (the set of
outcomes) using characteristics (or categories) of the outcomes, or
as unions, intersections, or complements of other events (“or,” “and,” “not”).
S.CP.2 Understand that two events  A and  B are independent if the
probability of  A and  B occurring together is the product of their
probabilities, and use this characterization to determine if they are independent.
S.CP.3 Understand the conditional probability of  A given  B as  P(A
and  B)/P(B), and interpret independence of  A and  B as saying that
the conditional probability of  A given  B is the same as the probability
of  A, and the conditional probability of  B given  A is the same as the probability of  B.
S.CP.4 Construct and interpret two-way frequency tables of data when
two categories are associated with each object being classified. Use the
two-way table as a sample space to decide if events are independent
and to approximate conditional probabilities.  For example, collect
data from a random sample of students in your school on their favorite
subject among math, science, and English. Estimate the probability that
a randomly selected student from your school will favor science given
that the student is in tenth grade. Do the same for other subjects and compare the results.
S.CP.5 Recognize and explain the concepts of conditional probability
and independence in everyday language and everyday situations.  For
example, compare the chance of having lung cancer if you are a smoker
with the chance of being a smoker if you have lung cancer.
S.CP.6 Find the conditional probability of  A given  B as the fraction of  B’s
outcomes that also belong to  A, and interpret the answer in terms of the model.
S.CP.7 Apply the Addition Rule,  P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A and  B), and interpret the answer in terms of the model.
S.CP.8  (+)  Apply the general Multiplication Rule in a uniform probability
model,  P(A and  B) = P(A)P(B|A) = P(B)P(A|B), and interpret the answer in terms of the model.
S.CP.9  (+) Use permutations and combinations to compute probabilities of compound events and solve problems.

This unit sets the stage for work in Mathematics III, where the ideas of statistical inference are introduced.
Evaluating the risks associated with conclusions drawn from sample data (i.e. incomplete information) requires an understanding of probability concepts.

(e.g., product testing, medical testing, pulling a hockey goalie at the end of a game).

sures. They study relationships among segments on chords, secants, and tangents as an application of similarity. In
the Cartesian coordinate system, students use the distance formula to write the equation of a circle when given the
radius and the coordinates of its center, and the equation of a parabola with vertical axis when given an equation
of its directrix and the coordinates of its focus. Given an equation of a circle, they draw the graph in the coordinate
plane, and apply techniques for solving quadratic equations to determine intersections between lines and circles or a
parabola and between two circles. Students develop informal arguments justifying common formulas for circumfer­
ence, area, and volume of geometric objects, especially those related to circles.

Integrated Pathway: mathematics III
It is in Mathematics III that students pull together and apply the accumulation of learning that they have from their
previous courses, with content grouped into four critical areas, organized into units. They apply methods from
probability and statistics to draw inferences and conclusions from data. Students expand their repertoire of functions
to include polynomial, rational, and radical functions.3  They expand their study of right triangle trigonometry to
include general triangles. And, finally, students bring together all of their experience with functions and geometry to
create models and solve contextual problems. The Mathematical Practice Standards apply throughout each course
and, together with the content standards, prescribe that students experience mathematics as a coherent, useful, and
logical subject that makes use of their ability to make sense of problem situations.
Critical Area 1: In this unit, students see how the visual displays and summary statistics they learned in earlier grades
relate to different types of data and to probability distributions. They identify different ways of collecting data—
including sample surveys, experiments, and simulations—and the role that randomness and careful design play in the conclusions that can be drawn.
Critical Area 2: This unit develops the structural similarities between the system of polynomials and the system
of integers. Students draw on analogies between polynomial arithmetic and base-ten computation, focusing on
properties of operations, particularly the distributive property. Students connect multiplication of polynomials with
multiplication of multi-digit integers, and division of polynomials with long division of integers. Students identify
zeros of polynomials and make connections between zeros of polynomials and solutions of polynomial equations.
The unit culminates with the fundamental theorem of algebra. Rational numbers extend the arithmetic of integers
by allowing division by all numbers except 0. Similarly, rational expressions extend the arithmetic of polynomials by
allowing division by all polynomials except the zero polynomial. A central theme of this unit is that the arithmetic of
rational expressions is governed by the same rules as the arithmetic of rational numbers.
Critical Area 3: Students develop the Laws of Sines and Cosines in order to find missing measures of general (not
necessarily right) triangles. They are able to distinguish whether three given measures (angles or sides) define 0, 1, 2,
or infinitely many triangles. This discussion of general triangles open up the idea of trigonometry applied beyond the
right triangle—that is, at least to obtuse angles. Students build on this idea to develop the notion of radian measure
for angles and extend the domain of the trigonometric functions to all real numbers. They apply this knowledge to model simple periodic phenomena.
Critical Area 4: In this unit students synthesize and generalize what they have learned about a variety of function
families. They extend their work with exponential functions to include solving exponential equations with logarithms.
They explore the effects of transformations on graphs of diverse functions, including functions arising in an
application, in order to abstract the general principle that transformations on a graph always have the same effect
regardless of the type of the underlying functions. They identify appropriate types of functions to model a situation,
they adjust parameters to improve the model, and they compare models by analyzing appropriateness of fit and
making judgments about the domain over which a model is a good fit. The description of modeling as “the process
of choosing and using mathematics and statistics to analyze empirical situations, to understand them better, and to
make decisions” is at the heart of this unit. The narrative discussion and diagram of the modeling cycle should be
considered when knowledge of functions, statistics, and geometry is applied in a modeling context.

Unit 1: Inferences and conclusions from Data
In this unit, students see how the visual displays and summary statistics they learned in earlier grades relate to differ­
ent types of data and to probability distributions. They identify different ways of collecting data—including sample
surveys, experiments, and simulations—and the role that randomness and careful design play in the conclusions that can be drawn.
Unit 1: Inferences and Conclusions from Data
Clusters and Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards
•  Summarize, represent, and interpret data on a single count or measurement variable.
While students may have heard of the normal
distribution, it is unlikely that they will have prior
experience using it to make specific estimates. Build on
students’ understanding of data distributions to help
them see how the normal distribution uses area to make
estimates of frequencies (which can be expressed as
probabilities). Emphasize that only some data are well described by a normal distribution.
S.ID.4 Use the mean and standard deviation of a data
set to fit it to a normal distribution and to estimate
population percentages. Recognize that there are data
sets for which such a procedure is not appropriate. Use
calculators, spreadsheets, and tables to estimate areas under the normal curve.
•  Understand and evaluate random processes underlying statistical experiments.
For S.IC.2, include comparing theoretical and empirical
results to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment.
S.IC.1 Understand that statistics allows inferences to be
made about population parameters based on a random sample from that population.
S.IC.2 Decide if a specified model is consistent with
results from a given data-generating process, e.g.,
using simulation.  For example, a model says a spinning
coin falls heads up with probability 0.5. Would a result
of 5 tails in a row cause you to question the model?

•  Make inferences and justify conclusions from sample surveys, experiments, and observational studies.
In earlier grades, students are introduced to different
ways of collecting data and use graphical displays and
summary statistics to make comparisons., These ideas
are revisited with a focus on how the way in which data is collected determines the scope and nature
of the conclusions that can be drawn from that data.
The concept of statistical significance is developed
informally through simulation as meaning a result that
is unlikely to have occurred solely as a result of random selection in sampling or random assignment in an experiment.
For S.IC.4 and 5, focus on the variability of results from
experiments—that is, focus on statistics as a way of
dealing with, not eliminating, inherent randomness.
S.IC.3 Recognize the purposes of and differences
among sample surveys, experiments, and observational
studies; explain how randomization relates to each.
S.IC.4 Use data from a sample survey to estimate a
population mean or proportion; develop a margin of
error through the use of simulation models for random sampling.
S.IC.5 Use data from a randomized experiment to
compare two treatments; use simulations to decide if differences between parameters are significant.
S.IC.6 Evaluate reports based on data.
•  Use probability to evaluate outcomes of decisions.
Extend to more complex probability models. Include
situations such as those involving quality control or
diagnostic tests that yields both false positive and false negative results.
S.MD.6  (+)  Use  probabilities  to  make  fair  decisions  (e.g.,
drawing by lots, using a random number generator).
S.MD.7 (+) Analyze decisions and strategies using
probability concepts (e.g., product testing, medical
testing, pulling a hockey goalie at the end of a game).

Unit 2: Polynomials, rational, and radical relationships
This unit develops the structural similarities between the system of polynomials and the system of integers. Students
draw on analogies between polynomial arithmetic and base-ten computation, focusing on properties of operations,
particularly the distributive property. Students connect multiplication of polynomials with multiplication of multi­
digit integers, and division of polynomials with long division of integers. Students identify zeros of polynomials and
make connections between zeros of polynomials and solutions of polynomial equations. The unit culminates with
the fundamental theorem of algebra. Rational numbers extend the arithmetic of integers by allowing division by all
numbers except 0. Similarly, rational expressions extend the arithmetic of polynomials by allowing division by all
polynomials except the zero polynomial. A central theme of this unit is that the arithmetic of rational expressions is
governed by the same rules as the arithmetic of rational numbers.

Unit 3: trigonometry of General triangles and trigonometric Functions
Students develop the Laws of Sines and Cosines in order to find missing measures of general (not necessarily right)
triangles. They are able to distinguish whether three given measures (angles or sides) define 0, 1, 2, or infinitely many
triangles. This discussion of general triangles open up the idea of trigonometry applied beyond the right triangle—
that is, at least to obtuse angles. Students build on this idea to develop the notion of radian measure for angles and
extend the domain of the trigonometric functions to all real numbers. They apply this knowledge to model simple periodic phenomena.

Unit 4: mathematical modeling
In this unit students synthesize and generalize what they have learned about a variety of function families. They
extend their work with exponential functions to include solving exponential equations with logarithms. They explore
the effects of transformations on graphs of diverse functions, including functions arising in an application, in order to
abstract the general principle that transformations on a graph always have the same effect regardless of the type of
the underlying functions. They identify appropriate types of functions to model a situation, they adjust parameters
to improve the model, and they compare models by analyzing appropriateness of fit and making judgments about
the domain over which a model is a good fit. The description of modeling as “the process of choosing and using
mathematics and statistics to analyze empirical situations, to understand them better, and to make decisions” is at the
heart of this unit. The narrative discussion and diagram of the modeling cycle should be considered when knowledge
of functions, statistics, and geometry is applied in a modeling context.

Clusters and Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Create equations that describe num­ bers or relationships.
For A.CED.1, use all available types of functions to create such equations, including root functions, but constrain to simple cases. While functions used in A.CED.2, 3, and 4 will often be linear, exponential, or quadratic the types of problems should draw from more complex situations than those addressed in Mathematics I. For example, finding the equation of a line through a given point perpendicular to another line allows one to find the distance from a point to a line. Note that the example given for A.CED.4 applies to earlier instances of this standard, not to the current course.
•  Interpret functions that arise in appli­ cations in terms of a context.
Emphasize the selection of a model function based on behavior of data and context.
A.CED.1 Create equations and inequalities in one variable and use them
to solve problems.  Include equations arising from linear and quadratic
functions, and simple rational and exponential functions.
A.CED.2 Create equations in two or more variables to represent
relationships between quantities; graph equations on coordinate axes with labels and scales.
A.CED.3 Represent constraints by equations or inequalities, and by
systems of equations and/or inequalities, and interpret solutions as
viable or non-viable options in a modeling context.  For example,
represent inequalities describing nutritional and cost constraints on combinations of different foods.
A.CED.4 Rearrange formulas to highlight a quantity of interest, using the
same reasoning as in solving equations.  For example, rearrange Ohm’s law V = IR to highlight resistance R.
F.IF.4 For a function that models a relationship between two quantities,
interpret key features of graphs and tables in terms of the quantities,
and sketch graphs showing key features given a verbal description
of the relationship.  Key features include: intercepts; intervals where
the function is increasing, decreasing, positive, or negative; relative
maximums and minimums; symmetries; end behavior; and periodicity.★
F.IF.5 Relate the domain of a function to its graph and, where applicable,
to the quantitative relationship it describes.  For example, if the function
h(n) gives the number of person-hours it takes to assemble n engines in
a factory, then the positive integers would be an appropriate domain for the function.★

High school mathematics in middle school4
There are some students who are able to move through the mathematics quickly. These students may choose to take
high school mathematics beginning in eighth grade5  or earlier so they can take college-level mathematics in high
school.6  Students who are capable of moving more quickly deserve thoughtful attention, both to ensure that they are
challenged and that they are mastering the full range of mathematical content and skills—without omitting critical
concepts and topics. Care must be taken to ensure that students master and fully understand all important topics
in the mathematics curriculum, and that the continuity of the mathematics learning progression is not disrupted. In
particular, the Standards for Mathematical Practice ought to continue to be emphasized in these cases.
The number of students taking high school mathematics in eighth grade has increased steadily for years. Part of this
trend is the result of a concerted effort to get more students to take Calculus and other college-level mathematics
courses in high school. Enrollment in both AP Statistics and AP Calculus, for example, have essentially doubled over
the last decade (College Board, 2009). There is also powerful research showing that among academic factors, the
strongest predictor of whether a student will earn a bachelor’s degree is the highest level of mathematics taken in
high school (Adelman, 1999). A recent study completed by The College Board confirms this. Using data from 65,000
students enrolled in 110 colleges, students’ high school coursework was evaluated to determine which courses
were closely associated with students’ successful performance in college. The study confirmed the importance of
a rigorous curriculum throughout a students’ high school career. Among other conclusions, the study found that
students who took more advanced courses, such as Pre-Calculus in the 11th grade or Calculus in 12th grade, were
more successful in college. Students who took AP Calculus at any time during their high school careers were most
successful (Wyatt & Wiley, 2010). And even as more students are enrolled in more demanding courses, it does not
necessarily follow that there must be a corresponding decrease in engagement and success (Cooney & Bottoms, 2009, p. 2).
At the same time, there are cautionary tales of pushing underprepared students into the first course of high school
mathematics in the eighth grade. The Brookings Institute’s 2009 Brown Center Report on American Education found
that the NAEP scores of students taking Algebra I in the eighth grade varied widely, with the bottom ten percent
scoring far below grade level. And a report from the Southern Regional Education Board, which supports increasing
the number of middle students taking Algebra I, found that among students in the lowest quartile on achievement
tests, those enrolled in higher-level mathematics had a slightly higher failure rate than those enrolled in lower-level
mathematics (Cooney & Bottoms, 2009, p. 2). In all other quartiles, students scoring similarly on achievement tests
were less likely to fail if they were enrolled in more demanding courses. These two reports are reminders that, rather
than skipping or rushing through content, students should have appropriate progressions of foundational content to
maximize their likelihoods of success in high school mathematics.
It is also important to note that notions of what constitutes a course called “Algebra I” or “Mathematics I” vary
widely. In the CCSS, students begin preparing for algebra in Kindergarten, as they start learning about the properties
of operations. Furthermore, much of the content central to typical Algebra I courses—namely linear equations,
inequalities, and functions—is found in the 8th  grade CCSS. The Algebra I course described here (“High School Algebra
I”), however, is the first formal algebra course in the Traditional Pathway (concepts from this Algebra I course are
developed across the first two courses of the integrated pathway). Enrolling an eighth-grade student in a watered
down version of either the Algebra I course or Mathematics I course described here may in fact do students a
disservice, as mastery of algebra including attention to the Standards for Mathematical Practice is fundamental for
success in further mathematics and on college entrance examinations. As mentioned above, skipping material to
get students to a particular point in the curriculum will likely create gaps in the students’ mathematical background,
which may create additional problems later, because students may be denied the opportunity for a rigorous Algebra I
or Mathematics I course and may miss important content from eighth-grade mathematics.
middle school acceleration
Taking the above considerations into account, as well as the recognition that there are other methods for
accomplishing these goals, the Achieve Pathways Group endorses the notion that all students who are ready for
rigorous high school mathematics in eighth grade should take such courses (Algebra I or Mathematics I), and that all
middle schools should offer this opportunity to their students. To prepare students for high school mathematics in
eighth grade, districts are encouraged to have a well-crafted sequence of  compacted courses. The term “compacted”
means to compress content, which requires a faster pace to complete, as opposed to skipping content. The Achieve
Pathways Group has developed two compacted course sequences, one designed for districts using a traditional
Algebra I – Geometry – Algebra II high school sequence, and the other for districts using an integrated sequence,
which is commonly found internationally. Both are based on the idea that content should compact 3 years of content
into 2 years, at most. In other words, compacting content from 2 years into 1 year would be too challenging, and
compacting 4 years of content into 3 years starting in grade 7 runs the risk of compacting across middle and high
schools. As such, grades 7, 8, and 9 were compacted into grades 7 and 8 (a 3:2 compaction). As a result, some 8th
grade content is in the 7th  grade courses, and high school content is in 8th  grade.

Common Core State StandardS for matHematICS
The compacted traditional sequence, or, “Accelerated Traditional,” compacts grades 7, 8, and High School Algebra
I into two years: “Accelerated 7th  Grade” and “8th  Grade Algebra I.” Upon successfully completion of this pathway,
students will be ready for Geometry in high school. The compacted integrated sequence, or, “Accelerated Integrated,”
compacts grades 7, 8, and Mathematics I into two years: “Accelerated 7th  Grade” and “8th  Grade Mathematics I.” At
the end of 8th  grade, these students will be ready for Mathematics II in high school. While the K-7 CCSS effectively
prepare students for algebra in 8th  grade, some standards from 8th  grade have been placed in the Accelerated 7th
Grade course to make the 8th  Grade courses more manageable.
The Achieve Pathways Group has followed a set of guidelines7  for the development of these compacted courses.
1.   Compacted courses should include the same Common Core State Standards as the non-compacted courses.
It is recommended to compact three years of material into two years, rather than compacting two years into
one. The rationale is that mathematical concepts are likely to be omitted when trying to squeeze two years of
material into one. This is to be avoided, as the standards have been carefully developed to define clear learning
progressions through the major mathematical domains. Moreover, the compacted courses should not sacrifice attention to the Mathematical Practices Standard.
2.   Decisions to accelerate students into the Common Core State Standards for high school mathematics before
ninth grade should not be rushed.  Placing students into tracks too early should be avoided at all costs. It is not
recommended to compact the standards before grade seven. In this document, compaction begins in seventh
grade for both the traditional and integrated (international) sequences.
3.   Decisions to accelerate students into high school mathematics before ninth grade should be based on solid
evidence of student learning.  Research has shown discrepancies in the placement of students into “advanced”
classes by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic background. While such decisions to accelerate are almost always
a joint decision between the school and the family, serious efforts must be made to consider solid evidence of
student learning in order to avoid unwittingly disadvantaging the opportunities of particular groups of students.
4.   A menu of challenging options should be available for students after their third year of mathematicsÑan d
all students should be strongly encouraged to take mathematics in all years of high school.  Traditionally,
students taking high school mathematics in the eighth grade are expected to take Precalculus in their junior
years and then Calculus in their senior years. This is a good and worthy goal, but it should not be the only option
for students. Advanced courses could also include Statistics, Discrete Mathematics, or Mathematical Decision
Making. An array of challenging options will keep mathematics relevant for students, and give them a new set of
tools for their futures in college and career (see Fourth Courses section of this paper for further detail).
other Ways to accelerate students
Just as care should be taken not to rush the decision to accelerate students, care should also be taken to provide
more than one opportunity for acceleration. Some students may not have the preparation to enter a “Compacted
Pathway” but may still develop an interest in taking advanced mathematics, such as AP Calculus or AP Statistics in
their senior year. Additional opportunities for acceleration may include:
•
Allowing students to take two mathematics courses simultaneously (such as Geometry and Algebra II, or Precalculus and Statistics).
•
Allowing students in schools with block scheduling to take a mathematics course in both semesters of the same academic year.
•
Offering summer courses that are designed to provide the equivalent experience of a full course in all regards, including attention to the Mathematical Practices.8 •
Creating different compaction ratios, including four years of high school content into three years beginning in 9th grade.
•
Creating a hybrid Algebra II-Precalculus course that allows students to go straight to Calculus.
A combination of these methods and our suggested compacted sequences would allow for the most mathematically-inclined
students to take advanced mathematics courses during their high school career. The compacted sequences begin here:

8As with other methods of accelerating students, enrolling students in summer courses should be handled with care, as the pace of the courses likely be enormously fast.

Common Core State StandardS for matHematICS accelerated traditional Pathway:
accelerated 7th  Grade
This course differs from the non-accelerated 7th  Grade course in that it contains content from 8th  grade. While
coherence is retained, in that it logically builds from the 6th  Grade, the additional content when compared to the non­
accelerated course demands a faster pace for instruction and learning. Content is organized into four critical areas, or
units. The Mathematical Practice Standards apply throughout each course and, together with the content standards,
prescribe that students experience mathematics as a coherent, useful, and logical subject that makes use of their
ability to make sense of problem situations. The critical areas are as follows:
Critical Area 1: Students develop a unified understanding of number, recognizing fractions, decimals (that have a
finite or a repeating decimal representation), and percents as different representations of rational numbers. Students
extend addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to all rational numbers, maintaining the properties of
operations and the relationships between addition and subtraction, and multiplication and division. By applying these
properties, and by viewing negative numbers in terms of everyday contexts (e.g., amounts owed or temperatures
below zero), students explain and interpret the rules for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing with negative
numbers. They use the arithmetic of rational numbers as they formulate expressions and equations in one variable
and use these equations to solve problems. They extend their mastery of the properties of operations to develop an
understanding of integer exponents, and to work with numbers written in scientific notation.
Critical Area 2: Students use linear equations and systems of linear equations to represent, analyze, and solve a
variety of problems. Students recognize equations for proportions (y/x = m or y = mx) as special linear equations (y
= mx + b), understanding that the constant of proportionality (m) is the slope, and the graphs are lines through the
origin. They understand that the slope (m) of a line is a constant rate of change, so that if the input or x-coordinate
changes by an amount A, the output or y-coordinate changes by the amount m×A. Students strategically choose
and efficiently implement procedures to solve linear equations in one variable, understanding that when they use the
properties of equality and the concept of logical equivalence, they maintain the solutions of the original equation.
Critical Area 3: Students build on their previous work with single data distributions to compare two data distributions
and address questions about differences between populations. They begin informal work with random sampling to
generate data sets and learn about the importance of representative samples for drawing inferences.
Critical Area 4: Students continue their work with area from Grade 6, solving problems involving the area and
circumference of a circle and surface area of three-dimensional objects. In preparation for work on congruence
and similarity, they reason about relationships among two-dimensional figures using scale drawings and informal
geometric constructions, and they gain familiarity with the relationships between angles formed by intersecting
lines. Students work with three-dimensional figures, relating them to two-dimensional figures by examining cross­
sections. They solve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, surface area, and volume of two- and
three-dimensional objects composed of triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, cubes and right prisms. Students use ideas
about distance and angles, how they behave under translations, rotations, reflections, and dilations, and ideas about
congruence and similarity to describe and analyze two-dimensional figures and to solve problems. Students show
that the sum of the angles in a triangle is the angle formed by a straight line, and that various configurations of lines
give rise to similar triangles because of the angles created when a transversal cuts parallel lines. Students complete
their work on volume by solving problems involving cones, cylinders, and spheres.

Unit 1: Rational Numbers and Exponents
Clusters with Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Apply and extend previous under­ standings of operations with fractions to add, subtract, multiply, and divide rational numbers.
7.NS.1 Apply and extend previous understandings of addition and
subtraction to add and subtract rational numbers; represent addition
and subtraction on a horizontal or vertical number line diagram.
a.  Describe situations in which opposite quantities combine to
make 0.  For example, a hydrogen atom has 0 charge because its two constituents are oppositely charged.
b.  Understand  p +  q as the number located a distance |q| from  p,
in the positive or negative direction depending on whether  q is
positive or negative. Show that a number and its opposite have a
sum of 0 (are additive inverses). Interpret sums of rational num­ bers by describing real-world contexts.
c.  Understand subtraction of rational numbers as adding the addi­
tive inverse,  p –  q =  p + (–q). Show that the distance between two
rational numbers on the number line is the absolute value of their
difference, and apply this principle in real-world contexts.
d.  Apply properties of operations as strategies to add and subtract rational numbers.
7.NS.2 Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication and
division and of fractions to multiply and divide rational numbers.
a.  Understand that multiplication is extended from fractions to
rational numbers by requiring that operations continue to satisfy
the properties of operations, particularly the distributive prop­
erty, leading to products such as (–1)(–1) = 1 and the rules for mul­
tiplying signed numbers. Interpret products of rational numbers by describing real-world contexts.
b.  Understand that integers can be divided, provided that the divi­
sor is not zero, and every quotient of integers (with non-zero
divisor) is a rational number. If  p and  q are integers, then  –(p/q)
= (–p)/q = p/(–q). Interpret quotients of rational numbers by describing real-world contexts.
c.  Apply properties of operations as strategies to multiply and divide rational numbers.
d.  Convert a rational number to a decimal using long division; know
that the decimal form of a rational number terminates in 0s or eventually repeats.
7.NS.3 Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving the four operations with rational numbers.*
*Computations with rational numbers extend the rules for manipulating fractions to complex fractions.

Unit 1: Rational Numbers and Exponents
Clusters with Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Know that there are numbers that are not rational, and approximate them by rational numbers.
8.NS.1 Know that numbers that are not rational are called irrational.
Understand informally that every number has a decimal expansion; for
rational numbers show that the decimal expansion repeats eventually,
and convert a decimal expansion which repeats eventually into a rational number.
8.NS.2 Use rational approximations of irrational numbers to compare the
size of irrational numbers, locate them approximately on a number line
diagram, and estimate the value of expressions (e.g., p2).  For example,
by truncating the decimal expansion of √2, show that √2 is between 1
and 2, then between 1.4 and 1.5, and explain how to continue on to get better approximations.
•  Work with radicals and integer expo­ nents.
8.EE.1 Know and apply the properties of integer exponents to generate
equivalent numerical expressions.  For example, 32 x 3–5 = 3–3 = 1/33 = 1/27.
8.EE.2 Use square root and cube root symbols to represent solutions
to equations of the form x2 = p and x3  = p, where p is a positive rational
number. Evaluate square roots of small perfect squares and cube roots
of small perfect cubes. Know that  √2 is irrational.
8.EE.3 Use numbers expressed in the form of a single digit times an
integer power of 10 to estimate very large or very small quantities,
and to express how many times as much one is than the other.  For
example, estimate the population of the United States as 3  x 108 and
the population of the world as 7  x 109, and determine that the world population is more than 20 times larger.
8.EE.4 Perform operations with numbers expressed in scientific
notation, including problems where both decimal and scientific notation
are used. Use scientific notation and choose units of appropriate size
for measurements of very large or very small quantities (e.g., use
millimeters per year for seafloor spreading). Interpret scientific notation that has been generated by technology.

Unit 2: Proportionality and Linear relationships
Students use linear equations and systems of linear equations to represent, analyze, and solve a variety of problems.
Students recognize equations for proportions (y/x =  m or  y =  mx) as special linear equations (y =  mx +  b), under­
standing that the constant of proportionality (m) is the slope, and the graphs are lines through the origin. They
understand that the slope (m) of a line is a constant rate of change, so that if the input or  x-coordinate changes by
an amount  A, the output or  y-coordinate changes by the amount  m×A. Students strategically choose and efficiently
implement procedures to solve linear equations in one variable, understanding that when they use the properties of
equality and the concept of logical equivalence, they maintain the solutions of the original equation.
Unit 2: Proportionality and Linear Relationships
Clusters with Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Analyze proportional relationships and use them to solve real-world and math­ ematical problems.
•  Use properties of operations to gener­ ate equivalent expressions.
7.RP.1  Compute unit rates associated with ratios of fractions, including
ratios of lengths, areas and other quantities measured in like or different
units. For example, if a person walks 1/2  mile in each 1/4  hour, compute
the unit rate as the complex fraction 1/2  / 1/4  miles per hour, equivalently 2 miles per hour.
7.RP.2  Recognize and represent proportional relationships between quantities.
a.  Decide whether two quantities are in a proportional relationship,
e.g., by testing for equivalent ratios in a table or graphing on a
coordinate plane and observing whether the graph is a straight line through the origin.
b.  Identify the constant of proportionality (unit rate) in tables,
graphs, equations, diagrams, and verbal descriptions of propor­ tional relationships.
c.  Represent proportional relationships by equations. For example,
if total cost t is proportional to the number n of items purchased
at a constant price p, the relationship between the total cost and the number of items can be expressed as t = pn.
d.  Explain what a point (x, y) on the graph of a proportional rela­
tionship means in terms of the situation, with special attention to
the points (0, 0) and (1, r) where r is the unit rate.
7.RP.3 Use proportional relationships to solve multistep ratio and
percent problems.  Examples: simple interest, tax, markups and mark­
downs, gratuities and commissions, fees, percent increase and decrease, percent error.
7.EE.1 Apply properties of operations as strategies to add, subtract,
factor, and expand linear expressions with rational coefficients.
7.EE.2 Understand that rewriting an expression in different forms in a
problem context can shed light on the problem and how the quantities
in it are related.  For example, a + 0.05a = 1.05a means that “increase by 5%” is the same as “multiply by 1.05.”

Unit 2: Proportionality and Linear Relationships
Clusters with Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Solve real-life and mathematical prob­ lems using numerical and algebraic expressions and equations.
•  Understand the connections between proportional relationships, lines, and linear equations.
7.EE.3 Solve multi-step real-life and mathematical problems posed with
positive and negative rational numbers in any form (whole numbers,
fractions, and decimals), using tools strategically. Apply properties of
operations to calculate with numbers in any form; convert between
forms as appropriate; and assess the reasonableness of answers using
mental computation and estimation strategies.  For example: If a woman
making $25 an hour gets a 10% raise, she will make an additional 1/10
of her salary an hour, or $2.50, for a new salary of $27.50. If you want
to place a towel bar 9 3/4 inches long in the center of a door that is 27
1/2 inches wide, you will need to place the bar about 9 inches from each
edge; this estimate can be used as a check on the exact computation.
7.EE.4 Use variables to represent quantities in a real-world or
mathematical problem, and construct simple equations and inequalities
to solve problems by reasoning about the quantities.
a.  Solve word problems leading to equations of the form  px + q = r
and  p(x + q) = r, where  p,  q, and  r are specific rational numbers.
Solve equations of these forms fluently. Compare an algebraic
solution to an arithmetic solution, identifying the sequence of the
operations used in each approach.  For example, the perimeter of
a rectangle is 54 cm. Its length is 6 cm. What is its width?
b.  Solve word problems leading to inequalities of the form  px + q > r
or  px + q <  r, where  p,  q, and  r are specific rational numbers.
Graph the solution set of the inequality and interpret it in the
context of the problem.  For example: As a salesperson, you are
paid $50 per week plus $3 per sale. This week you want your pay
to be at least $100. Write an inequality for the number of sales you need to make, and describe the solutions.
8.EE.5 Graph proportional relationships, interpreting the unit rate as the
slope of the graph. Compare two different proportional relationships
represented in different ways.  For example, compare a distance-time
graph to a distance-time equation to determine which of two moving objects has greater speed.
8.EE.6 Use similar triangles to explain why the slope  m is the same
between any two distinct points on a non-vertical line in the coordinate
plane; derive the equation  y = mx for a line through the origin and the
equation  y = mx + b for a line intercepting the vertical axis at  b.
appendIx a: deSIgnIng HIgH SCHool matHematICS CourSeS baSed on tHe Common Core State StandardS  | 97 •  Analyze and solve linear equations and pairs of simultaneous linear equations.
8.EE.7 Solve linear equations in one variable.
a.  Give examples of linear equations in one variable with one solu­
tion, infinitely many solutions, or no solutions. Show which of
these possibilities is the case by successively transforming the
given equation into simpler forms, until an equivalent equation of
the form  x =  a,  a =  a, or  a =  b results (where  a and  b are different numbers).
b.  Solve linear equations with rational number coefficients, includ­
ing equations whose solutions require expanding expressions
using the distributive property and collecting like terms.

questions about differences between populations. They begin informal work with random sampling to generate data
sets and learn about the importance of representative samples for drawing inferences.
Unit 3: Introduction to Sampling and Inference
Clusters with Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Use random sampling to draw infer­ ences about a population.
7.SP.1 Understand that statistics can be used to gain information about
a population by examining a sample of the population; generalizations
about a population from a sample are valid only if the sample is
representative of that population. Understand that random sampling
tends to produce representative samples and support valid inferences.
7.SP.2 Use data from a random sample to draw inferences about a
population with an unknown characteristic of interest. Generate multiple
samples (or simulated samples) of the same size to gauge the variation
in estimates or predictions.  For example, estimate the mean word length
in a book by randomly sampling words from the book; predict the
winner of a school election based on randomly sampled survey data.
Gauge how far off the estimate or prediction might be.
•  Draw informal comparative inferences about two populations.
7.SP.3 Informally assess the degree of visual overlap of two numerical
data distributions with similar variabilities, measuring the difference
between the centers by expressing it as a multiple of a measure of
variability.  For example, the mean height of players on the basketball
team is 10 cm greater than the mean height of players on the soccer
team, about twice the variability (mean absolute deviation) on either
team; on a dot plot, the separation between the two distributions of heights is noticeable.
7.SP.4 Use measures of center and measures of variability for numerical
data from random samples to draw informal comparative inferences
about two populations.  For example, decide whether the words in a
chapter of a seventh-grade science book are generally longer than the
words in a chapter of a fourth-grade science book.

Common Core State Standards •  Investigate chance processes and develop, use, and evaluate probability models.
7.SP.5 Understand that the probability of a chance event is a number
between 0 and 1 that expresses the likelihood of the event occurring.
Larger numbers indicate greater likelihood. A probability near 0
indicates an unlikely event, a probability around  1/2  indicates an event
that is neither unlikely nor likely, and a probability near 1 indicates a likely event.
7.SP.6 Approximate the probability of a chance event by collecting
data on the chance process that produces it and observing its long-run
relative frequency, and predict the approximate relative frequency given
the probability.  For example, when rolling a number cube 600 times,
predict that a 3 or 6 would be rolled roughly 200 times, but probably not exactly 200 times.
7.SP.7 Develop a probability model and use it to find probabilities of
events. Compare probabilities from a model to observed frequencies; if
the agreement is not good, explain possible sources of the discrepancy.
a.  Develop a uniform probability model by assigning equal probabil­
ity to all outcomes, and use the model to determine probabilities
of events.  For example, if a student is selected at random from a
class, find the probability that Jane will be selected and the prob­ ability that a girl will be selected.
b.  Develop a probability model (which may not be uniform) by ob­
serving frequencies in data generated from a chance process.  For
example, find the approximate probability that a spinning penny
will land heads up or that a tossed paper cup will land open-end
down. Do the outcomes for the spinning penny appear to be equally likely based on the observed frequencies?
7.SP.8 Find probabilities of compound events using organized lists, tables, tree diagrams, and simulation.
a.  Understand that, just as with simple events, the probability of a
compound event is the fraction of outcomes in the sample space for which the compound event occurs.
b.  Represent sample spaces for compound events using methods
such as organized lists, tables and tree diagrams. For an event
described in everyday language (e.g., “rolling double sixes”),
identify the outcomes in the sample space which compose the event.
c.  Design and use a simulation to generate frequencies for com­
pound events.  For example, use random digits as a simulation
tool to approximate the answer to the question: If 40% of donors
have type A blood, what is the probability that it will take at least 4 donors to find one with type A blood?

Unit 4: creating, comparing, and analyzing Geometric Figures
Students continue their work with area from Grade 6, solving problems involving the area and circumference of a
circle  and  surface  area  of  three-dimensional  objects.  In  preparation  for  work  on  congruence  and  similarity,  they  reason
about relationships among two-dimensional figures using scale drawings and informal geometric constructions, and
they gain familiarity with the relationships between angles formed by intersecting lines. Students work with three­
dimensional figures, relating them to two-dimensional figures by examining cross-sections. They solve real-world and
mathematical problems involving area, surface area, and volume of two- and three-dimensional objects composed of
triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, cubes and right prisms. Students use ideas about distance and angles, how they
behave under translations, rotations, reflections, and dilations, and ideas about congruence and similarity to describe
and analyze two-dimensional figures and to solve problems. Students show that the sum of the angles in a triangle is
the angle formed by a straight line, and that various configurations of lines give rise to similar triangles because of the
angles created when a transversal cuts parallel lines. Students complete their work on volume by solving problems involving cones, cylinders, and spheres.

Common Core State StandardS for matHematICS 8th  Grade algebra I
The fundamental purpose of 8th  Grade Algebra I is to formalize and extend the mathematics that students learned
through the end of seventh grade. The critical areas, called units, deepen and extend understanding of linear and
exponential relationships by contrasting them with each other and by applying linear models to data that exhibit a
linear trend, and students engage in methods for analyzing, solving, and using quadratic functions. In addition, the
units will introduce methods for analyzing and using quadratic functions, including manipulating expressions for
them, and solving quadratic equations. Students understand and apply the Pythagorean theorem, and use quadratic
functions to model and solve problems. The Mathematical Practice Standards apply throughout each course and,
together with the content standards, prescribe that students experience mathematics as a coherent, useful, and
logical subject that makes use of their ability to make sense of problem situations.
This course differs from High School Algebra I in that it contains content from 8th  grade. While coherence is retained,
in that it logically builds from the Accelerated 7th  Grade, the additional content when compared to the high school
course demands a faster pace for instruction and learning.
Critical Area 1: Work with quantities and rates, including simple linear expressions and equations forms the foundation
for this unit. Students use units to represent problems algebraically and graphically, and to guide the solution of
problems. Student experience with quantity provides a foundation for the study of expressions, equations, and
functions. This unit builds on earlier experiences with equations by asking students to analyze and explain the process
of solving an equation. Students develop fluency writing, interpreting, and translating between various forms of linear
equations and inequalities, and using them to solve problems. They master the solution of linear equations and apply
related solution techniques and the laws of exponents to the creation and solution of simple exponential equations.
Critical Area 2: Building on earlier work with linear relationships, students learn function notation and language for
describing characteristics of functions, including the concepts of domain and range. They explore many examples
of functions, including sequences; they interpret functions given graphically, numerically, symbolically, and verbally,
translate between representations, and understand the limitations of various representations. They work with
functions given by graphs and tables, keeping in mind that depending upon the context, these representations
are likely to be approximate and incomplete. Their work includes functions that can be described or approximated
by formulas as well as those that cannot. When functions describe relationships between quantities arising from
a context, students reason with the units in which those quantities are measured. Students explore systems of
equations and inequalities, and they find and interpret their solutions. Students build on and informally extend
their understanding of integral exponents to consider exponential functions. They compare and contrast linear and
exponential functions, distinguishing between additive and multiplicative change. They interpret arithmetic sequences
as linear functions and geometric sequences as exponential functions.
Critical Area 3: Students use regression techniques to describe relationships between quantities. They use graphical
representations and knowledge of the context to make judgments about the appropriateness of linear models. With
linear models, they look at residuals to analyze the goodness of fit.
Critical Area 4: In this unit, students build on their knowledge from unit 2, where they extended the laws of exponents
to rational exponents. Students apply this new understanding of number and strengthen their ability to see structure
in and create quadratic and exponential expressions. They create and solve equations, inequalities, and systems of equations involving quadratic expressions.
Critical Area 5: In preparation for work with quadratic relationships students explore distinctions between rational
and irrational numbers. They consider quadratic functions, comparing the key characteristics of quadratic functions
to those of linear and exponential functions. They select from among these functions to model phenomena. Students
learn to anticipate the graph of a quadratic function by interpreting various forms of quadratic expressions. In
particular, they identify the real solutions of a quadratic equation as the zeros of a related quadratic function.
Students learn that when quadratic equations do not have real solutions the number system must be extended so
that solutions exist, analogous to the way in which extending the whole numbers to the negative numbers allows x+1
= 0 to have a solution. Formal work with complex numbers comes in Algebra II. Students expand their experience
with functions to include more specialized functions—absolute value, step, and those that are piecewise-defined.

8.F.1 Understand that a function is a rule that assigns to each input
exactly one output. The graph of a function is the set of ordered pairs

8.F.3 Interpret the equation  y =  mx +  b as defining a linear function,
whose graph is a straight line; give examples of functions that are not

Students should experience a variety of types of situations modeled by functions Detailed analysis of any particular class of function at this stage is not advised. Students should apply these concepts throughout their future mathematics courses.
Constrain examples to linear functions and exponential functions having integral domains. In F.IF.3, draw connection to F.BF.2, which requires students to write arithmetic and geometric sequences.
F.IF.1 Understand that a function from one set (called the domain) to
another set (called the range) assigns to each element of the domain
exactly one element of the range. If  f is a function and x is an element of
its domain, then  f(x) denotes the output of  f corresponding to the input
x. The graph of  f is the graph of the equation  y = f(x).
F.IF.2 Use function notation, evaluate functions for inputs in their
domains, and interpret statements that use function notation in terms of a context.
F.IF.3 Recognize that sequences are functions, sometimes defined
recursively, whose domain is a subset of the integers.  For example, the
Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively by f(0) = f(1) = 1, f(n+1) = f(n) + f(n-1) for n ≥ 1.
•  Use functions to model relationships between quantities.
While this content is likely subsumed by F.IF.4 and F.BF.1a, it could be used for scaffolding instruction to the more sophisticated content found there.
8.F.4 Construct a function to model a linear relationship between two
quantities. Determine the rate of change and initial value of the function
from a description of a relationship or from two (x,  y) values, including
reading these from a table or from a graph. Interpret the rate of change
and initial value of a linear function in terms of the situation it models, and in terms of its graph or a table of values.
8.F.5 Describe qualitatively the functional relationship between two
quantities by analyzing a graph (e.g., where the function is increasing
or decreasing, linear or nonlinear). Sketch a graph that exhibits the
qualitative features of a function that has been described verbally.

F.IF.4 For a function that models a relationship between two quantities,
interpret key features of graphs and tables in terms of the quantities,
and sketch graphs showing key features given a verbal description

the function is increasing, decreasing, positive, or negative; relative
maximums and minimums; symmetries; end behavior; and periodicity.★
F.IF.5 Relate the domain of a function to its graph and, where applicable,
to the quantitative relationship it describes.  For example, if the function
h(n) gives the number of person-hours it takes to assemble n engines in
a factory, then the positive integers would be an appropriate domain for the function.★
F.IF.6 Calculate and interpret the average rate of change of a function
(presented symbolically or as a table) over a specified interval. Estimate the rate of change from a graph.★ •  Analyze functions using different rep­ resentations.
For F.IF.7a, 7e, and 9 focus on linear and exponentials functions. Include comparisons of two functions presented algebraically. For example, compare the growth of two linear functions, or two exponential functions such as y=3n and y=100·2n.

F.IF.9 Compare properties of two functions each represented in a

F.BF.1 Write a function that describes a relationship between two quantities.★
a.  Determine an explicit expression, a recursive process, or steps for calculation from a context.
b.  Combine standard function types using arithmetic operations.
For example, build a function that models the temperature of a

F.BF.2 Write arithmetic and geometric sequences both recursively and
with an explicit formula, use them to model situations, and translate between the two forms.★ •  Build new functions from existing func­ tions.
Focus on vertical translations of graphs of linear and exponential functions. Relate the vertical translation of a linear function to its y-intercept.
While applying other transformations to a linear graph is appropriate at this level, it may be difficult for students to identify or distinguish between the effects of the other transformations included in this standard.
F.BF.3 Identify the effect on the graph of replacing  f(x) by f(x) + k,
k f(x), f(kx), and  f(x + k) for specific values of k (both positive and
negative); find the value of  k given the graphs. Experiment with
cases and illustrate an explanation of the effects on the graph using
technology.  Include recognizing even and odd functions from their graphs and algebraic expressions for them.

Unit 2: Linear and Exponential Functions
Clusters with Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Construct and compare linear, quadrat­ ic, and exponential models and solve problems.
For F.LE.3, limit to comparisons between linear and exponential models.
F.LE.1 Distinguish between situations that can be modeled with linear functions and with exponential functions.
a.  Prove that linear functions grow by equal differences over equal
intervals; and that exponential functions grow by equal factors over equal intervals.
b.  Recognize situations in which one quantity changes at a constant rate per unit interval relative to another.
c.  Recognize situations in which a quantity grows or decays by a
constant percent rate per unit interval relative to another.
F.LE.2 Construct linear and exponential functions, including arithmetic
and geometric sequences, given a graph, a description of a relationship,
or two input-output pairs (include reading these from a table).

Unit 3: Descriptive statistics
Students use regression techniques to describe relationships between quantities. They use graphical representations
and knowledge of the context to make judgments about the appropriateness of linear models. With linear models,
they look at residuals to analyze the goodness of fit.
Unit 3: Descriptive Statistics
Clusters with Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Summarize, represent, and interpret data on a single count or measurement variable.
In grades 6 – 7, students describe center and spread in a data distribution. Here they choose a summary statistic appropriate to the characteristics of the data distribution, such as the shape of the distribution or the existence of extreme data points.
S.ID.1 Represent data with plots on the real number line (dot plots, histograms, and box plots).
S.ID.2 Use statistics appropriate to the shape of the data distribution
to compare center (median, mean) and spread (interquartile range,
standard deviation) of two or more different data sets.
S.ID.3 Interpret differences in shape, center, and spread in the context
of the data sets, accounting for possible effects of extreme data points (outliers).
•  Investigate patterns of association in bivariate data.
While this content is likely subsumed by S.ID.6-9, it could be used for scaffolding instruction to the more sophisticated content found there.
8.SP.1 Construct and interpret scatter plots for bivariate measurement
data to investigate patterns of association between two quantities.
Describe patterns such as clustering, outliers, positive or negative
association, linear association, and nonlinear association.
8.SP.2 Know that straight lines are widely used to model relationships
between two quantitative variables. For scatter plots that suggest a
linear association, informally fit a straight line, and informally assess the
model fit by judging the closeness of the data points to the line.
8.SP.3 Use the equation of a linear model to solve problems in the
context of bivariate measurement data, interpreting the slope and
intercept.  For example, in a linear model for a biology experiment,
interpret a slope of 1.5 cm/hr as meaning that an additional hour of
sunlight each day is associated with an additional 1.5 cm in mature plant height.
8.SP.4 Understand that patterns of association can also be seen in
bivariate categorical data by displaying frequencies and relative
frequencies in a two-way table. Construct and interpret a two-way table
summarizing data on two categorical variables collected from the same
subjects. Use relative frequencies calculated for rows or columns to
describe possible association between the two variables.  For example,
collect data from students in your class on whether or not they have a
curfew on school nights and whether or not they have assigned chores
at home. Is there evidence that those who have a curfew also tend to have chores?
appendIx a: deSIgnIng HIgH SCHool matHematICS CourSeS baSed on tHe Common Core State StandardS  | 111 •  Summarize, represent, and interpret data on two categorical and quantita­ tive variables.
Students take a more sophisticated look at using a linear function to model the relationship between two numerical variables. In addition to fitting a line to data, students assess how well the model fits by analyzing residuals.
S.ID.6b should be focused on linear models, but may be used to preface quadratic functions in the Unit 6 of this course.
S.ID.5 Summarize categorical data for two categories in two-way
frequency tables. Interpret relative frequencies in the context of the
data (including joint, marginal, and conditional relative frequencies).
Recognize possible associations and trends in the data.
S.ID.6 Represent data on two quantitative variables on a scatter plot, and describe how the variables are related.
a.  Fit a function to the data; use functions fitted to data to solve
problems in the context of the data.  Use given functions or
choose a function suggested by the context. Emphasize linear and exponential models.
b.  Informally assess the fit of a function by plotting and analyzing residuals.
c.  Fit a linear function for a scatter plot that suggests a linear as­ sociation.

Build on students’ work with linear relationship and; introduce the correlation coefficient. The focus here is on the computation and interpretation of the correlation coefficient as a measure how well the data fit the relationship. The important distinction between a statistical relationship and a cause-and-effect relationship arises in S.ID.9.
S.ID.7 Interpret the slope (rate of change) and the intercept (constant
term) of a linear model in the context of the data.

Unit 4: expressions and equations
In this unit, students build on their knowledge from unit 2, where they extended the laws of exponents to rational
exponents. Students apply this new understanding of number and strengthen their ability to see structure in and cre­
ate quadratic and exponential expressions. They create and solve equations, inequalities, and systems of equations involving quadratic expressions.
Unit 4: Expressions and Equations
Clusters with Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Interpret the structure of expressions.
Focus on quadratic and exponential expressions. For A.SSE.1b, exponents are extended from integer found in Unit 1 to rational exponents focusing on those that represent square roots and cube roots.
A.SSE.1 Interpret expressions that represent a quantity in terms of its context.★
a.  Interpret parts of an expression, such as terms, factors, and coef­ ficients.
b.  Interpret complicated expressions by viewing one or more of
their parts as a single entity.  For example, interpret P(1+r)n as the product of P and a factor not depending on P.
A.SSE.2 Use the structure of an expression to identify ways to rewrite
it.  For example, see x4 – y4 as (x2)2 – (y2)2, thus recognizing it as a
difference of squares that can be factored as (x2 – y2)(x2 + y2).
•  Write expressions in equivalent forms to solve problems.
Consider extending this unit to include the relationship between properties of logarithms and properties of exponents.
A.SSE.3 Choose and produce an equivalent form of an expression
to reveal and explain properties of the quantity represented by the expression.★
a.  Factor a quadratic expression to reveal the zeros of the function it defines.
b.  Complete  the  square  in  a  quadratic  expression  to  reveal  the  maxi­ mum or minimum value of the function it defines.
c.  Use the properties of exponents to transform expressions for
exponential functions.  For example the expression 1.15t can be re­
written as (1.151/12)12t ≈ 1.01212t to reveal the approximate equivalent monthly interest rate if the annual rate is 15%.

A.APR.1 Understand that polynomials form a system analogous to the polynomials.
integers, namely, they are closed under the operations of addition,
subtraction, and multiplication; add, subtract, and multiply polynomials.
Focus on polynomial expressions that simplify to forms that are linear or quadratic in a positive integer power of x.
•  Create equations that describe num­ bers or relationships.
Extend work on linear and exponential equations in Unit 1 to include quadratic equations. Extend A.CED.4 to formulas involving squared variables.
A.CED.1 Create equations and inequalities in one variable and use them
to solve problems.  Include equations arising from linear and quadratic
functions, and simple rational and exponential functions.
A.CED.2 Create equations in two or more variables to represent
relationships between quantities; graph equations on coordinate axes with labels and scales.
A.CED.4 Rearrange formulas to highlight a quantity of interest, using the
same reasoning as in solving equations.  For example, rearrange Ohm’s law V = IR to highlight resistance R.

Unit 4: Expressions and Equations
Clusters with Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Solve equations and inequalities in one variable.
Students should learn of the existence of the complex number system, but will not solve quadratics with complex solutions until Algebra II.
A.REI.4 Solve quadratic equations in one variable.
a.  Use the method of completing the square to transform any qua­
dratic equation in  x into an equation of the form  (x – p)2 = q that
has the same solutions. Derive the quadratic formula from this form.
b.  Solve quadratic equations by inspection (e.g., for  x2 = 49), taking
square roots, completing the square, the quadratic formula and
factoring, as appropriate to the initial form of the equation. Rec­
ognize when the quadratic formula gives complex solutions and write them as  a ± bi for real numbers  a and  b.
•  Solve systems of equations.
Include systems consisting of one linear and one quadratic equation.
Include systems that lead to work with fractions. For example, finding the intersections between x2+y2=1 and y = (x+1)/2 leads to the point (3/5, 4/5) on the unit circle, corresponding to the
Pythagorean triple 32 + 42 = 52.
A.REI.7 Solve a simple system consisting of a linear equation and a
quadratic equation in two variables algebraically and graphically.  For
example, find the points of intersection between the line y = –3x and the circle x2 + y2 = 3.

Unit 5: Quadratic Functions and modeling
In preparation for work with quadratic relationships students explore distinctions between rational and irrational num­
bers. They consider quadratic functions, comparing the key characteristics of quadratic functions to those of linear
and  exponential  functions.  They  select  from  among  these  functions  to  model  phenomena.  Students  learn  to  anticipate
the graph of a quadratic function by interpreting various forms of quadratic expressions. In particular, they identify
the real solutions of a quadratic equation as the zeros of a related quadratic function. Students learn that when qua­
dratic equations do not have real solutions the number system must be extended so that solutions exist, analogous
to the way in which extending the whole numbers to the negative numbers allows x+1 = 0 to have a solution. Formal
work with complex numbers comes in Algebra II. Students expand their experience with functions to include more
specialized functions—absolute value, step, and those that are piecewise-defined.

Focus on quadratic functions; compare with linear and exponential functions studied in Unit 2.
F.IF.4 For a function that models a relationship between two quantities,
interpret key features of graphs and tables in terms of the quantities,
and sketch graphs showing key features given a verbal description
of the relationship.  Key features include: intercepts; intervals where
the function is increasing, decreasing, positive, or negative; relative
maximums and minimums; symmetries; end behavior; and periodicity.★
F.IF.5 Relate the domain of a function to its graph and, where applicable,
to the quantitative relationship it describes.  For example, if the function
h(n) gives the number of person-hours it takes to assemble n engines in
a factory, then the positive integers would be an appropriate domain for the function.★
F.IF.6 Calculate and interpret the average rate of change of a function
(presented symbolically or as a table) over a specified interval. Estimate the rate of change from a graph.★

Common Core State Standards •  Analyze functions using different rep­ resentations.
For F.IF.7b, compare and contrast absolute value, step and piecewise defined functions with linear, quadratic, and exponential functions.
Highlight issues of domain, range, and usefulness when examining piecewise defined functions. Note that this unit, and in particular in F.IF.8b, extends the work begun in Unit 2 on exponential functions with integral exponents. For F.IF.9, focus on expanding the types of functions considered to include, linear, exponential, and quadratic.
Extend work with quadratics to include the relationship between coefficients and roots, and that once roots are known, a quadratic equation can be factored.
F.IF.7 Graph functions expressed symbolically and show key features
of the graph, by hand in simple cases and using technology for more complicated cases.★
a.  Graph linear and quadratic functions and show intercepts, maxima, and minima.
b.  Graph square root, cube root, and piecewise-defined functions,
including step functions and absolute value functions.
F.IF.8 Write a function defined by an expression in different but
equivalent forms to reveal and explain different properties of the function.
a.  Use the process of factoring and completing the square in a qua­
dratic function to show zeros, extreme values, and symmetry of
the graph, and interpret these in terms of a context.
b.  Use the properties of exponents to interpret expressions for ex­
ponential functions.  For example, identify percent rate of change
in functions such as y = (1.02)t, y = (0.97)t, y = (1.01)12t, y = (1.2)t/10,
and classify them as representing exponential growth or decay.
F.IF.9 Compare properties of two functions each represented in a
different way (algebraically, graphically, numerically in tables, or by
verbal descriptions).  For example, given a graph of one quadratic
function and an algebraic expression for another, say which has the larger maximum.

For example, build a function that models the temperature of a
cooling body by adding a constant function to a decaying expo­ nential, and relate these functions to the model.
•  Build new functions from existing func­ tions.
For F.BF.3, focus on quadratic functions, and consider including absolute value functions. For F.BF.4a, focus on linear functions but consider simple situations where the domain of the function must be restricted in order for the inverse to exist, such as f(x) = x2, x>0
F.BF.3 Identify the effect on the graph of replacing  f(x) by  f(x) + k,
k f(x), f(kx), and  f(x + k) for specific values of  k (both positive and
negative); find the value of  k given the graphs. Experiment with
cases and illustrate an explanation of the effects on the graph using
technology.  Include recognizing even and odd functions from their graphs and algebraic expressions for them.

Common Core State StandardS for matHematICS accelerated Integrated Pathway:
accelerated 7th  Grade
This course differs from the non-accelerated 7th  Grade course in that it contains content from 8th  grade. While
coherence is retained, in that it logically builds from the 6th  Grade, the additional content when compared to the non­
accelerated course demands a faster pace for instruction and learning. Content is organized into four critical areas, or
units. The Mathematical Practice Standards apply throughout each course and, together with the content standards,
prescribe that students experience mathematics as a coherent, useful, and logical subject that makes use of their
ability to make sense of problem situations. The critical areas are as follows:
Critical Area 1: Students develop a unified understanding of number, recognizing fractions, decimals (that have a
finite or a repeating decimal representation), and percents as different representations of rational numbers. Students
extend addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to all rational numbers, maintaining the properties of
operations and the relationships between addition and subtraction, and multiplication and division. By applying these
properties, and by viewing negative numbers in terms of everyday contexts (e.g., amounts owed or temperatures
below zero), students explain and interpret the rules for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing with negative
numbers. They use the arithmetic of rational numbers as they formulate expressions and equations in one variable
and use these equations to solve problems. They extend their mastery of the properties of operations to develop an
understanding of integer exponents, and to work with numbers written in scientific notation.
Critical Area 2: Students use linear equations and systems of linear equations to represent, analyze, and solve a
variety of problems. Students recognize equations for proportions (y/x = m or y = mx) as special linear equations (y
= mx + b), understanding that the constant of proportionality (m) is the slope, and the graphs are lines through the
origin. They understand that the slope (m) of a line is a constant rate of change, so that if the input or x-coordinate
changes by an amount A, the output or y-coordinate changes by the amount m×A. Students strategically choose
and efficiently implement procedures to solve linear equations in one variable, understanding that when they use the
properties of equality and the concept of logical equivalence, they maintain the solutions of the original equation.
Critical Area 3: Students build on their previous work with single data distributions to compare two data distributions
and address questions about differences between populations. They begin informal work with random sampling to
generate data sets and learn about the importance of representative samples for drawing inferences.
Critical Area 4: Students continue their work with area from Grade 6, solving problems involving the area and
circumference of a circle and surface area of three-dimensional objects. In preparation for work on congruence
and similarity, they reason about relationships among two-dimensional figures using scale drawings and informal
geometric constructions, and they gain familiarity with the relationships between angles formed by intersecting
lines. Students work with three-dimensional figures, relating them to two-dimensional figures by examining cross­
sections. They solve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, surface area, and volume of two- and
three-dimensional objects composed of triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, cubes and right prisms. Students use ideas
about distance and angles, how they behave under translations, rotations, reflections, and dilations, and ideas about
congruence and similarity to describe and analyze two-dimensional figures and to solve problems. Students show
that the sum of the angles in a triangle is the angle formed by a straight line, and that various configurations of lines
give rise to similar triangles because of the angles created when a transversal cuts parallel lines. Students complete
their work on volume by solving problems involving cones, cylinders, and spheres.

Unit 1: rational numbers and exponents
Students develop a unified understanding of number, recognizing fractions, decimals (that have a finite or a repeating
decimal representation), and percents as different representations of rational numbers. They convert between a frac­
tion and decimal form of an irrational number. Students extend addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to all
rational numbers, maintaining the properties of operations and the relationships between addition and subtraction,
and multiplication and division. By applying these properties, and by viewing negative numbers in terms of every­
day contexts (e.g., amounts owed or temperatures below zero), students explain and interpret the rules for adding,
subtracting, multiplying, and dividing with negative numbers. They use the arithmetic of rational numbers as they
formulate expressions and equations in one variable and use these equations to solve problems. They extend their
mastery of the properties of operations to develop an understanding of integer exponents, and to work with numbers written in scientific notation.
Unit 1: Rational Numbers and Exponents
Clusters with Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Apply and extend previous under­ standings of operations with fractions to add, subtract, multiply, and divide rational numbers.
7.NS.1 Apply and extend previous understandings of addition and
subtraction to add and subtract rational numbers; represent addition
and subtraction on a horizontal or vertical number line diagram.
a.  Describe situations in which opposite quantities combine to
make 0.  For example, a hydrogen atom has 0 charge because its two constituents are oppositely charged.
b.  Understand  p +  q as the number located a distance |q| from  p,
in the positive or negative direction depending on whether  q is
positive or negative. Show that a number and its opposite have a
sum of 0 (are additive inverses). Interpret sums of rational num­ bers by describing real-world contexts.
c.  Understand subtraction of rational numbers as adding the addi­
tive inverse,  p –  q =  p + (–q). Show that the distance between two
rational numbers on the number line is the absolute value of their
difference, and apply this principle in real-world contexts.
d.  Apply properties of operations as strategies to add and subtract rational numbers.
7.NS.2 Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication and
division and of fractions to multiply and divide rational numbers.
a.  Understand that multiplication is extended from fractions to
rational numbers by requiring that operations continue to satisfy
the properties of operations, particularly the distributive prop­
erty, leading to products such as (–1)(–1) = 1 and the rules for mul­
tiplying signed numbers. Interpret products of rational numbers by describing real-world contexts.
b.  Understand that integers can be divided, provided that the divi­
sor is not zero, and every quotient of integers (with non-zero
divisor) is a rational number. If  p and  q are integers, then  –(p/q)
= (–p)/q = p/(–q). Interpret quotients of rational numbers by describing real-world contexts.
c.  Apply properties of operations as strategies to multiply and divide rational numbers.
d.  Convert a rational number to a decimal using long division; know
that the decimal form of a rational number terminates in 0s or eventually repeats.
7.NS.3 Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving the four operations with rational numbers.*
*Computations with rational numbers extend the rules for manipulating fractions to complex fractions.

Unit 1: Rational Numbers and Exponents
Clusters with Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Know that there are numbers that are not rational, and approximate them by rational numbers.
8.NS.1 Know that numbers that are not rational are called irrational.
Understand informally that every number has a decimal expansion; for
rational numbers show that the decimal expansion repeats eventually,
and convert a decimal expansion which repeats eventually into a rational number.
8.NS.2 Use rational approximations of irrational numbers to compare the
size of irrational numbers, locate them approximately on a number line
diagram, and estimate the value of expressions (e.g.,  p2).  For example,
by truncating the decimal expansion of √2, show that √2 is between 1and
2, then between 1.4 and 1.5, and explain how to continue on to get better approximations.
•  Work with radicals and integer expo­ nents.
8.EE.1 Know and apply the properties of integer exponents to generate
equivalent numerical expressions.  For example, 32 x 3–5 = 3–3 = 1/33 = 1/27.
8.EE.2 Use square root and cube root symbols to represent solutions
to equations of the form x2 = p and x3  = p, where  p is a positive rational
number. Evaluate square roots of small perfect squares and cube roots
of small perfect cubes. Know that  √2 is irrational.
8.EE.3 Use numbers expressed in the form of a single digit times an
integer power of 10 to estimate very large or very small quantities,
and to express how many times as much one is than the other.  For
example, estimate the population of the United States as 3 x 108 and
the population of the world as 7 x 109, and determine that the world population is more than 20 times larger.
8.EE.4 Perform operations with numbers expressed in scientific
notation, including problems where both decimal and scientific notation
are used. Use scientific notation and choose units of appropriate size
for measurements of very large or very small quantities (e.g., use
millimeters per year for seafloor spreading). Interpret scientific notation that has been generated by technology.

Unit 2: Proportionality and Linear relationships
Students use linear equations and systems of linear equations to represent, analyze, and solve a variety of problems.
Students recognize equations for proportions (y/x =  m or  y =  mx) as special linear equations (y =  mx +  b), under­
standing that the constant of proportionality (m) is the slope, and the graphs are lines through the origin. They
understand that the slope (m) of a line is a constant rate of change, so that if the input or  x-coordinate changes by
an amount  A, the output or  y-coordinate changes by the amount  m×A. Students strategically choose and efficiently
implement procedures to solve linear equations in one variable, understanding that when they use the properties of
equality and the concept of logical equivalence, they maintain the solutions of the original equation.
Unit 2: Proportionality and Linear Relationships
Clusters with Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Analyze proportional relationships and use them to solve real-world and math­ ematical problems.
•  Use properties of operations to gener­ ate equivalent expressions.
7.RP.1  Compute unit rates associated with ratios of fractions, including
ratios of lengths, areas and other quantities measured in like or different
units. For example, if a person walks 1/2 mile in each 1/4 hour, compute
the unit rate as the complex fraction 1/2/1/4 miles per hour, equivalently 2 miles per hour.
7.RP.2  Recognize and represent proportional relationships between quantities.
a.  Decide whether two quantities are in a proportional relationship,
e.g., by testing for equivalent ratios in a table or graphing on a
coordinate plane and observing whether the graph is a straight line through the origin.
b.  Identify the constant of proportionality (unit rate) in tables,
graphs, equations, diagrams, and verbal descriptions of propor­ tional relationships.
c.  Represent proportional relationships by equations. For example,
if total cost t is proportional to the number n of items purchased
at a constant price p, the relationship between the total cost and the number of items can be expressed as t = pn.
d.  Explain what a point (x, y) on the graph of a proportional rela­
tionship means in terms of the situation, with special attention to
the points (0, 0) and (1, r) where r is the unit rate.
7.RP.3  Use proportional relationships to solve multi-step ratio and
percent problems. Examples: simple interest, tax, markups and
markdowns, gratuities and commissions, fees, percent increase and decrease, percent error.
7.EE.1 Apply properties of operations as strategies to add, subtract,
factor, and expand linear expressions with rational coefficients.
7.EE.2 Understand that rewriting an expression in different forms in a
problem context can shed light on the problem and how the quantities
in it are related.  For example, a + 0.05a = 1.05a means that “increase by 5%” is the same as “multiply by 1.05.”

Unit 2: Proportionality and Linear Relationships
Clusters with Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Solve real-life and mathematical prob­ lems using numerical and algebraic expressions and equations.
•  Understand the connections between proportional relationships, lines, and linear equations.
7.EE.3 Solve multi-step real-life and mathematical problems posed with
positive and negative rational numbers in any form (whole numbers,
fractions, and decimals), using tools strategically. Apply properties of
operations to calculate with numbers in any form; convert between
forms as appropriate; and assess the reasonableness of answers using
mental computation and estimation strategies.  For example: If a woman
making $25 an hour gets a 10% raise, she will make an additional 1/10
of her salary an hour, or $2.50, for a new salary of $27.50. If you want
to place a towel bar 9 3/4 inches long in the center of a door that is 27
1/2 inches wide, you will need to place the bar about 9 inches from each
edge; this estimate can be used as a check on the exact computation.
7.EE.4 Use variables to represent quantities in a real-world or
mathematical problem, and construct simple equations and inequalities
to solve problems by reasoning about the quantities.
a.  Solve word problems leading to equations of the form  px + q = r
and  p(x + q) = r, where  p,  q, and  r are specific rational numbers.
Solve equations of these forms fluently. Compare an algebraic
solution to an arithmetic solution, identifying the sequence of the
operations used in each approach.  For example, the perimeter of
a rectangle is 54 cm. Its length is 6 cm. What is its width?
b.  Solve word problems leading to inequalities of the form  px + q > r
or  px + q <  r, where  p,  q, and  r are specific rational numbers.
Graph the solution set of the inequality and interpret it in the
context of the problem.  For example: As a salesperson, you are
paid $50 per week plus $3 per sale. This week you want your pay
to be at least $100. Write an inequality for the number of sales you need to make, and describe the solutions.
8.EE.5 Graph proportional relationships, interpreting the unit rate as the
slope of the graph. Compare two different proportional relationships
represented in different ways.  For example, compare a distance-time
graph to a distance-time equation to determine which of two moving objects has greater speed.
8.EE.6 Use similar triangles to explain why the slope  m is the same
between any two distinct points on a non-vertical line in the coordinate
plane; derive the equation  y = mx for a line through the origin and the
equation  y = mx + b for a line intercepting the vertical axis at  b.
appendIx a: deSIgnIng HIgH SCHool matHematICS CourSeS baSed on tHe Common Core State StandardS  | 131 •  Analyze and solve linear equations and pairs of simultaneous linear equations.
8.EE.7 Solve linear equations in one variable.
a.  Give examples of linear equations in one variable with one solu­
tion, infinitely many solutions, or no solutions. Show which of
these possibilities is the case by successively transforming the
given equation into simpler forms, until an equivalent equation of
the form  x =  a,  a =  a, or  a =  b results (where  a and  b are different numbers).
b.  Solve linear equations with rational number coefficients, includ­
ing equations whose solutions require expanding expressions
using the distributive property and collecting like terms.

Unit 3: Introduction to sampling and Inference
Students build on their previous work with single data distributions to compare two data distributions and address
questions about differences between populations. They begin informal work with random sampling to generate data
sets and learn about the importance of representative samples for drawing inferences.
Unit 3: Introduction to Sampling and Inference
Clusters with Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Use random sampling to draw infer­ ences about a population.
7.SP.1 Understand that statistics can be used to gain information about
a population by examining a sample of the population; generalizations
about a population from a sample are valid only if the sample is
representative of that population. Understand that random sampling
tends to produce representative samples and support valid inferences.
7.SP.2 Use data from a random sample to draw inferences about a
population with an unknown characteristic of interest. Generate multiple
samples (or simulated samples) of the same size to gauge the variation
in estimates or predictions.  For example, estimate the mean word length
in a book by randomly sampling words from the book; predict the
winner of a school election based on randomly sampled survey data.
Gauge how far off the estimate or prediction might be.
•  Draw informal comparative inferences about two populations.
7.SP.3 Informally assess the degree of visual overlap of two numerical
data distributions with similar variabilities, measuring the difference
between the centers by expressing it as a multiple of a measure of
variability.  For example, the mean height of players on the basketball
team is 10 cm greater than the mean height of players on the soccer
team, about twice the variability (mean absolute deviation) on either
team; on a dot plot, the separation between the two distributions of heights is noticeable.
7.SP.4 Use measures of center and measures of variability for numerical
data from random samples to draw informal comparative inferences
about two populations.  For example, decide whether the words in a
chapter of a seventh-grade science book are generally longer than the
words in a chapter of a fourth-grade science book.

Unit 3: Introduction to Sampling and Inference
Clusters with Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Investigate chance processes and develop, use, and evaluate probability models.
7.SP.5 Understand that the probability of a chance event is a number
between 0 and 1 that expresses the likelihood of the event occurring.
Larger numbers indicate greater likelihood. A probability near 0
indicates an unlikely event, a probability around  1/2  indicates an event
that is neither unlikely nor likely, and a probability near 1 indicates a likely event.
7.SP.6 Approximate the probability of a chance event by collecting
data on the chance process that produces it and observing its long-run
relative frequency, and predict the approximate relative frequency given
the probability.  For example, when rolling a number cube 600 times,
predict that a 3 or 6 would be rolled roughly 200 times, but probably not exactly 200 times.
7.SP.7 Develop a probability model and use it to find probabilities of
events. Compare probabilities from a model to observed frequencies; if
the agreement is not good, explain possible sources of the discrepancy.
a.  Develop a uniform probability model by assigning equal probabil­
ity to all outcomes, and use the model to determine probabilities
of events.  For example, if a student is selected at random from a
class, find the probability that Jane will be selected and the prob­ ability that a girl will be selected.
b.  Develop a probability model (which may not be uniform) by ob­
serving frequencies in data generated from a chance process.  For
example, find the approximate probability that a spinning penny
will land heads up or that a tossed paper cup will land open-end
down. Do the outcomes for the spinning penny appear to be equally likely based on the observed frequencies?
7.SP.8 Find probabilities of compound events using organized lists, tables, tree diagrams, and simulation.
a.  Understand that, just as with simple events, the probability of a
compound event is the fraction of outcomes in the sample space for which the compound event occurs.
b.  Represent sample spaces for compound events using methods
such as organized lists, tables and tree diagrams. For an event
described in everyday language (e.g., “rolling double sixes”),
identify the outcomes in the sample space which compose the event.
c.  Design and use a simulation to generate frequencies for com­
pound events.  For example, use random digits as a simulation
tool to approximate the answer to the question: If 40% of donors
have type A blood, what is the probability that it will take at least 4 donors to find one with type A blood?

Students continue their work with area from Grade 6, solving problems involving the area and circumference of a
circle  and  surface  area  of  three-dimensional  objects.  In  preparation  for  work  on  congruence  and  similarity,  they  reason
about relationships among two-dimensional figures using scale drawings and informal geometric constructions, and
they gain familiarity with the relationships between angles formed by intersecting lines. Students work with three­
dimensional figures, relating them to two-dimensional figures by examining cross-sections. They solve real-world and
mathematical problems involving area, surface area, and volume of two- and three-dimensional objects composed of
triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, cubes and right prisms. Students use ideas about distance and angles, how they
behave under translations, rotations, reflections, and dilations, and ideas about congruence and similarity to describe
and analyze two-dimensional figures and to solve problems. Students show that the sum of the angles in a triangle is
the angle formed by a straight line, and that various configurations of lines give rise to similar triangles because of the
angles created when a transversal cuts parallel lines. Students complete their work on volume by solving problems involving cones, cylinders, and spheres.

Common Core State StandardS for matHematICS 8th  Grade mathematics I
The fundamental purpose of 8th  Grade Mathematics I is to formalize and extend the mathematics that students
learned through the end of seventh grade. Content in this course is grouped into six critical areas, or units. The
units of study deepen and extend understanding of linear and exponential relationships by contrasting them with
each other and by applying linear models to data that exhibit a linear trend. 8th  Grade Mathematics 1 includes an
exploration of the role of rigid motions in congruence and similarity. The Pythagorean theorem is introduced, and
students examine volume relationships of cones, cylinders, and spheres. 8th  Grade Mathematics 1 uses properties
and theorems involving congruent figures to deepen and extend understanding of geometric knowledge from
prior grades. The final unit in the course ties together the algebraic and geometric ideas studied. The Mathematical
Practice Standards apply throughout each course and, together with the content standards, prescribe that students
experience mathematics as a coherent, useful, and logical subject that makes use of their ability to make sense of problem situations.
This course differs from Mathematics I in that it contains content from 8th  grade. While coherence is retained, in
that it logically builds from Accelerated 7th  Grade, the additional content when compared to the high school course
demands a faster pace for instruction and learning.
Critical Area 1: Work with quantities and rates, including simple linear expressions and equations forms the foundation
for this unit. Students use units to represent problems algebraically and graphically, and to guide the solution of
problems. Student experience with quantity provides a foundation for the study of expressions, equations, and functions.
Critical Area 2: Building on earlier work with linear relationships, students learn function notation and language for
describing characteristics of functions, including the concepts of domain and range. They explore many examples
of functions, including sequences; they interpret functions given graphically, numerically, symbolically, and verbally,
translate between representations, and understand the limitations of various representations. They work with
functions given by graphs and tables, keeping in mind that depending upon the context, these representations are
likely to be approximate and incomplete. Their work includes functions that can be described or approximated by
formulas as well as those that cannot. When functions describe relationships between quantities arising from a
context, students reason with the units in which those quantities are measured. Students build on and informally
extend their understanding of integral exponents to consider exponential functions. They compare and contrast
linear and exponential functions, distinguishing between additive and multiplicative change. They interpret arithmetic
sequences as linear functions and geometric sequences as exponential functions.
Critical Area 3: This unit builds on earlier experiences by asking students to analyze and explain the process of
solving an equation and to justify the process used in solving a system of equations. Students develop fluency
writing, interpreting, and translating between various forms of linear equations and inequalities, and using them to
solve problems. They master the solution of linear equations and apply related solution techniques and the laws of
exponents to the creation and solution of simple exponential equations. Students explore systems of equations and
inequalities, and they find and interpret their solutions.
Critical Area 4: This unit builds upon prior students’ prior experiences with data, providing students with more
formal means of assessing how a model fits data. Students use regression techniques to describe approximately
linear relationships between quantities. They use graphical representations and knowledge of the context to make
judgments about the appropriateness of linear models. With linear models, they look at residuals to analyze the goodness of fit.
Critical Area 5: In previous grades, students were asked to draw triangles based on given measurements. They also
have prior experience with rigid motions: translations, reflections, and rotations and have used these to develop
notions about what it means for two objects to be congruent. In this unit, students establish triangle congruence
criteria, based on analyses of rigid motions and formal constructions. They solve problems about triangles,
quadrilaterals, and other polygons. They apply reasoning to complete geometric constructions and explain why they work.
Critical Area 6: Building on their work with the Pythagorean Theorem to find distances, students use a rectangular
coordinate system to verify geometric relationships, including properties of special triangles and quadrilaterals and slopes of parallel and perpendicular lines.

For A.REI.10 focus on linear and exponential equations and be able to adapt and apply that learning to other types of equations in future courses.
For A.REI.11, focus on cases where f(x) and g(x) are linear or exponential.
A.REI.10 Understand that the graph of an equation in two variables is
the set of all its solutions plotted in the coordinate plane, often forming a curve (which could be a line).
A.REI.11 Explain why the x-coordinates of the points where the graphs
of the equations  y = f(x) and  y = g(x) intersect are the solutions of
the equation  f(x) = g(x); find the solutions approximately, e.g., using
technology to graph the functions, make tables of values, or find
successive approximations. Include cases where  f(x) and/or  g(x) are
linear, polynomial, rational, absolute value, exponential, and logarithmic functions.★
A.REI.12 Graph the solutions to a linear inequality in two variables as a
half-plane (excluding the boundary in the case of a strict inequality),
and graph the solution set to a system of linear inequalities in two
variables as the intersection of the corresponding half-planes.
•  Define, evaluate, and compare func­ tions.
While this content is likely subsumed by F.IF.1-3 and F.IF.7a, it could be used for scaffolding instruction to the more sophisticated content found there.
8.F.1 Understand that a function is a rule that assigns to each input
exactly one output. The graph of a function is the set of ordered pairs
consisting of an input and the corresponding output.
8.F.2 Compare properties of two functions each represented in a
different way (algebraically, graphically, numerically in tables, or by
verbal descriptions).  For example, given a linear function represented
by a table of values and a linear function represented by an algebraic
expression, determine which function has the greater rate of change.
8.F.3 Interpret the equation  y =  mx +  b as defining a linear function,
whose graph is a straight line; give examples of functions that are not
linear.  For example, the function A = s2 giving the area of a square as a
function of its side length is not linear because its graph contains the
points (1,1), (2,4) and (3,9), which are not on a straight line.
appendIx a: deSIgnIng HIgH SCHool matHematICS CourSeS baSed on tHe Common Core State StandardS  | 139 •  Understand the concept of a function and use function notation.
Students should experience a variety of types of situations modeled by functions. Detailed analysis of any particular class of function at this stage is not advised. Students should apply these concepts throughout their future mathematics courses.
Constrain examples to linear functions and exponential functions having integral domains. In F.IF.3, draw connection to F.BF.2, which requires students to write arithmetic and geometric sequences.
F.IF.1 Understand that a function from one set (called the domain) to
another set (called the range) assigns to each element of the domain
exactly one element of the range. If  f is a function and  x is an element of
its domain, then  f(x) denotes the output of  f corresponding to the input
x. The graph of  f is the graph of the equation  y = f(x).
F.IF.2 Use function notation, evaluate functions for inputs in their
domains, and interpret statements that use function notation in terms of a context.
F.IF.3 Recognize that sequences are functions, sometimes defined
recursively, whose domain is a subset of the integers.  For example, the
Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively by f(0) = f(1) = 1, f(n+1) = f(n) + f(n-1) for n ≥ 1.

While this content is likely subsumed by F.IF.4 and F.BF.1a, it could be used for scaffolding instruction to the more sophisticated content found there.
8.F.4 Construct a function to model a linear relationship between two
quantities. Determine the rate of change and initial value of the function
from a description of a relationship or from two (x,  y) values, including
reading these from a table or from a graph. Interpret the rate of change
and initial value of a linear function in terms of the situation it models, and in terms of its graph or a table of values.
8.F.5 Describe qualitatively the functional relationship between two
quantities by analyzing a graph (e.g., where the function is increasing
or decreasing, linear or nonlinear). Sketch a graph that exhibits the
qualitative features of a function that has been described verbally.
•  Interpret functions that arise in appli­ cations in terms of a context.
For F.IF.4 and 5, focus on linear and exponential functions. For F.IF.6, focus on linear functions and exponential functions whose domain is a subset of the integers. Mathematics II and III will address other types of functions.
N.RN.1 and N.RN. 2 will need to be referenced here before discussing exponential functions with continuous domains.
F.IF.4 For a function that models a relationship between two quantities,
interpret key features of graphs and tables in terms of the quantities,
and sketch graphs showing key features given a verbal description
of the relationship.  Key features include: intercepts; intervals where
the function is increasing, decreasing, positive, or negative; relative
maximums and minimums; symmetries; end behavior; and periodicity.★
F.IF.5 Relate the domain of a function to its graph and, where applicable,
to the quantitative relationship it describes.  For example, if the function
h(n) gives the number of person-hours it takes to assemble n engines in
a factory, then the positive integers would be an appropriate domain for the function.★
F.IF.6 Calculate and interpret the average rate of change of a function
(presented symbolically or as a table) over a specified interval. Estimate the rate of change from a graph.★ •  Analyze functions using different rep­ resentations.
For F.IF.7a, 7e, and 9 focus on linear and exponential functions. Include comparisons of two functions presented algebraically. For example, compare the growth of two linear functions, or two exponential functions such as y = 3n and y = 100 x 2n.
F.IF.7 Graph functions expressed symbolically and show key features
of the graph, by hand in simple cases and using technology for more complicated cases.★
a.  Graph linear and quadratic functions and show intercepts, maxima, and minima.
e. Graph exponential and logarithmic functions, showing intercepts
and end behavior, and trigonometric functions, showing period, midline, and amplitude.
F.IF.9 Compare properties of two functions each represented in a
different way (algebraically, graphically, numerically in tables, or by
verbal descriptions).  For example, given a graph of one quadratic
function and an algebraic expression for another, say which has the larger maximum.

Limit F.BF.1a, 1b, and 2 to linear and exponential functions. In F.BF.2, connect arithmetic sequences to linear functions and connect geometric sequences to exponential functions in
F.BF.2.
F.BF.1 Write a function that describes a relationship between two quantities.★
a.  Determine an explicit expression, a recursive process, or steps for calculation from a context.
b.  Combine standard function types using arithmetic operations.
For example, build a function that models the temperature of a

While applying other transformations to a linear graph is appropriate at this level, it may be difficult for students to identify or distinguish between the effects of the other transformations included in this standard.
F.BF.3 Identify the effect on the graph of replacing  f(x) by  f(x) + k,
k f(x), f(kx), and  f(x + k) for specific values of  k (both positive and

This unit builds on earlier experiences by asking students to analyze and explain the process of solving an equation
and to justify the process used in solving a system of equations. Students develop fluency writing, interpreting, and
translating between various forms of linear equations and inequalities, and using them to solve problems. They master
the solution of linear equations and apply related solution techniques and the laws of exponents to the creation and

Extend earlier work with solving linear equations to solving linear inequalities in one variable and to solving literal equations that are linear in the variable being solved for. Include simple exponential equations that rely only on application of the laws of exponents, such as 5x = 125 or 2x =1/16 .

While this content is likely subsumed by A.REI.3, 5, and 6, it could be used for scaffolding instruction to the more sophisticated content found there.
8.EE.8 Analyze and solve pairs of simultaneous linear equations.
a.  Understand that solutions to a system of two linear equations in
two  variables  correspond  to  points  of  intersection  of  their  graphs,
because points of intersection satisfy both equations simultane­ ously.
b.  Solve systems of two linear equations in two variables algebra ically, and estimate solutions by graphing the equations. Solve
simple cases by inspection.  For example, 3x + 2y = 5 and 3x + 2y
= 6 have no solution because 3x + 2y cannot simultaneously be 5 and 6.
c.  Solve real-world and mathematical problems leading to two lin­
ear equations in two variables.  For example, given coordinates for
two pairs of points, determine whether the line through the first
pair of points intersects the line through the second pair.

Include cases where two equations describe the same line (yielding infinitely many solutions) and cases where two equations describe parallel lines (yielding no solution).
A.REI.5 Prove that, given a system of two equations in two variables,
replacing one equation by the sum of that equation and a multiple of
the other produces a system with the same solutions.
A.REI.6 Solve systems of linear equations exactly and approximately

they look at residuals to analyze the goodness of fit.
Unit 4: Descriptive Statistics
Clusters with Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Summarize, represent, and interpret data on a single count or measurement variable.
In grades 6 – 7, students describe center and spread in a data distribution. Here they choose a summary statistic appropriate to the characteristics of the data distribution, such as the shape of the distribution or the existence of extreme data points.
S.ID.1 Represent data with plots on the real number line (dot plots, histograms, and box plots).
S.ID.2 Use statistics appropriate to the shape of the data distribution
to compare center (median, mean) and spread (interquartile range,
standard deviation) of two or more different data sets.
S.ID.3 Interpret differences in shape, center, and spread in the context
of the data sets, accounting for possible effects of extreme data points (outliers).
•  Investigate patterns of association in bivariate data.
While this content is likely subsumed by S.ID.6-9, it could be used for scaffolding instruction to the more sophisticated content found there.
8.SP.1 Construct and interpret scatter plots for bivariate measurement
data to investigate patterns of association between two quantities.
Describe patterns such as clustering, outliers, positive or negative
association, linear association, and nonlinear association.
8.SP.2 Know that straight lines are widely used to model relationships
between two quantitative variables. For scatter plots that suggest a
linear association, informally fit a straight line, and informally assess the
model fit by judging the closeness of the data points to the line.
8.SP.3 Use the equation of a linear model to solve problems in the
context of bivariate measurement data, interpreting the slope and
intercept.  For example, in a linear model for a biology experiment,
interpret a slope of 1.5 cm/hr as meaning that an additional hour of
sunlight each day is associated with an additional 1.5 cm in mature plant height.
8.SP.4 Understand that patterns of association can also be seen in
bivariate categorical data by displaying frequencies and relative
frequencies in a two-way table. Construct and interpret a two-way table
summarizing data on two categorical variables collected from the same
subjects. Use relative frequencies calculated for rows or columns to
describe possible association between the two variables.  For example,
collect data from students in your class on whether or not they have a
curfew on school nights and whether or not they have assigned chores
at home. Is there evidence that those who have a curfew also tend to have chores?

Students take a more sophisticated look at using a linear function to model the relationship between two numerical variables. In addition to fitting a line to data, students assess how well the model fits by analyzing residuals.
S.ID.6b should be focused on situations for which linear models are appropriate.
S.ID.5 Summarize categorical data for two categories in two-way
frequency tables. Interpret relative frequencies in the context of the

Recognize possible associations and trends in the data.
S.ID.6 Represent data on two quantitative variables on a scatter plot, and describe how the variables are related.
a.  Fit a function to the data; use functions fitted to data to solve
problems in the context of the data.  Use given functions or

Unit 5: congruence, Proof, and constructions
In previous grades, students were asked to draw triangles based on given measurements. They also have prior experi­
ence with rigid motions: translations, reflections, and rotations and have used these to develop notions about what it
means for two objects to be congruent. In this unit, students establish triangle congruence criteria, based on analyses
of rigid motions and formal constructions. They solve problems about triangles, quadrilaterals, and other polygons.
They apply reasoning to complete geometric constructions and explain why they work.
Unit 5:  Congruence, Proof, and Constructions
Clusters with Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Experiment with transformations in the plane.
Build on student experience with rigid motions from earlier grades. Point out the basis of rigid motions in geometric concepts, e.g., translations move points a specified distance along a line parallel to a specified line; rotations move objects along a circular arc with a specified center through a specified angle.
G.CO.1 Know precise definitions of angle, circle, perpendicular line,
parallel line, and line segment, based on the undefined notions of point,
line, distance along a line, and distance around a circular arc.
G.CO.2 Represent transformations in the plane using, e.g.,
transparencies and geometry software; describe transformations as
functions that take points in the plane as inputs and give other points
as outputs. Compare transformations that preserve distance and angle
to those that do not (e.g., translation versus horizontal stretch).
G.CO.3 Given a rectangle, parallelogram, trapezoid, or regular polygon,
describe the rotations and reflections that carry it onto itself.
G.CO.4 Develop definitions of rotations, reflections, and translations
in terms of angles, circles, perpendicular lines, parallel lines, and line segments.
G.CO.5 Given a geometric figure and a rotation, reflection, or
translation, draw the transformed figure using, e.g., graph paper, tracing
paper, or geometry software. Specify a sequence of transformations that will carry a given figure onto another.
•  Understand congruence in terms of rigid motions.
Rigid motions are at the foundation of the definition of congruence. Students reason from the basic properties of rigid motions (that they preserve distance and angle), which are assumed without proof. Rigid motions and their assumed properties can be used to establish the usual triangle congruence criteria, which can then be used to prove other theorems.
G.CO.6 Use geometric descriptions of rigid motions to transform
figures and to predict the effect of a given rigid motion on a given
figure; given two figures, use the definition of congruence in terms of rigid motions to decide if they are congruent.
G.CO.7 Use the definition of congruence in terms of rigid motions to
show  that  two  triangles  are  congruent  if  and  only  if  corresponding  pairs
of sides and corresponding pairs of angles are congruent.
G.CO.8 Explain how the criteria for triangle congruence (ASA, SAS, and
SSS) follow from the definition of congruence in terms of rigid motions.

Build on prior student experience with simple constructions. Emphasize the ability to formalize and defend how these constructions result in the desired objects.
Some of these constructions are closely related to previous standards and can be introduced in conjunction with them.
G.CO.12 Make formal geometric constructions with a variety of tools
and methods (compass and straightedge, string, reflective devices,
paper folding, dynamic geometric software, etc.).  Copying a segment;
copying an angle; bisecting a segment; bisecting an angle; constructing
perpendicular lines, including the perpendicular bisector of a line
segment; and constructing a line parallel to a given line through a point not on the line.
G.CO.13 Construct an equilateral triangle, a square, and a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle.
•  Understand and apply the Pythagorean theorem.
Discuss applications of the
Pythagorean theorem and its connections to radicals, rational exponents, and irrational numbers.
8.G.6 Explain a proof of the Pythagorean theorem and its converse.
8.G.7 Apply the Pythagorean theorem to determine unknown side
lengths in right triangles in real-world and mathematical problems in two and three dimensions.

to verify geometric relationships, including properties of special triangles and quadrilaterals and slopes of parallel and perpendicular lines.
Unit 6:  Connecting Algebra and Geometry Through Coordinates
Clusters with Instructional Notes
Common Core State Standards •  Use coordinates to prove simple geo­ metric theorems algebraically.
Reasoning with triangles in this unit is limited to right triangles; e.g., derive the equation for a line through two points using similar right triangles.
Relate work on parallel lines in G.GPE.5 to work on A.REI.5 in Mathematics I involving systems of equations having no solution or infinitely many solutions.
G.GPE.7 provides practice with the distance formula and its connection with the Pythagorean theorem.
G.GPE.4 Use coordinates to prove simple geometric theorems
algebraically. For example, prove or disprove that a figure defined
by four given points in the coordinate plane is a rectangle; prove or
disprove that the point (1,  √3) lies on the circle centered at the origin and containing the point (0, 2).
G.GPE.5 Prove the slope criteria for parallel and perpendicular lines;
use them to solve geometric problems (e.g., find the equation of a line
parallel or perpendicular to a given line that passes through a given point).
G.GPE.7 Use coordinates to compute perimeters of polygons and areas
of triangles and rectangles, e.g., using the distance formula.★

Common Core State StandardS for matHematICS additional mathematics courses
The “college and career ready” line has been based on evidence from a number of sources, including international
benchmarking, surveys of postsecondary faculty and employers, review of state standards, and expert opinion.
Students meeting these standards should be well-prepared for introductory mathematics courses in 2- and 4- year
colleges. Still, there are persuasive reasons for students to continue on to take a fourth mathematics course in high school.
Research consistently finds that taking mathematics above the Algebra II level highly corresponds to many measures
of student success. In his groundbreaking report Answers in the Toolbox, Clifford Adelman found that the strongest
predictor of postsecondary success is the highest level of mathematics completed (Executive Summary). ACT has
found that taking more mathematics courses correlates with greater success on their college entrance examination.
Of students taking (Algebra I, Geometry and Algebra II and no other mathematics courses), only thirteen percent of
those students met the benchmark for readiness for college algebra. One additional mathematics course greatly in­
creased the likelihood that a student would reach that benchmark, and three-fourths of students taking Calculus met the benchmark (ACTb 13).
Students going through the pathways should be encouraged to select from a range of high quality mathematics
options. STEM-intending students should be strongly encouraged to take Precalculus and Calculus (and perhaps a
computer science course). A student interested in psychology may benefit greatly from a course in discrete math­
ematics, followed by AP Statistics. A student interested in starting a business after high school could use knowledge
and skills gleaned from a course on mathematical decision-making. Mathematically-inclined students can, at this level,
double up on courses—a student taking college calculus and college statistics would be well-prepared for almost any postsecondary career.
Taken together, there is compelling rationale for urging students to continue their mathematical education through­
out high school, allowing students several rich options once they have demonstrated mastery of core content. The
Pathways describe possible courses for the first three years of high school. Other arrangements of the Common Core
State Standards for high school are possible. Standards marked with a (+) may appear either in courses required for
all students, or in later courses. In particular, the (+) standards can form the starting point for fourth year courses in
Precalculus and in Probability and Statistics. Other fourth year courses, for example Calculus, Modeling, or Discrete
Mathematics are possible.
