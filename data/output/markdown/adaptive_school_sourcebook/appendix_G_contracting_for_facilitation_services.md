There  is  never  a  guarantee  that  consulting  or facilitation  services  will  successfully  lead  to school  improvement.  However,  the  odds  for success  are  enhanced  when  the  principal  and the teacher-leader form a trusting, candid, and shared-responsibility  partnership.  In  effective projects, the individuals in these two roles develop clarity about the following.
