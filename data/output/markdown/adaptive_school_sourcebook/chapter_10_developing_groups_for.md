## Chapter 10  Developing Groups for

## Sustainable Change

D on't fix it until it shows. Disappointing test scores, airline arrival records, or accidents due to improper seat belt use spur policymakers to action. Action too often involves applying fixes to surface events to stimulate changes in the data. Such approaches rarely do much but modify data points, and fail to address the root problems that led to the undesirable results. Also, it is rare that such changes are sustainable. The American saying, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it,' in practice is really, 'If it doesn't show, don't fix it.'

Efforts  at  change  often  focus  more  on things than energy. Modifying schedules, making  curriculum  changes,  and  adding  new  instructional materials lead the list. While energy, too,  is  addressed,  it  may  be  in  the  form  of inservice  training  programs  directed  at  teachers who are seen as workers needing to be told what and how to teach rather than professionals  who  make  decisions  about  teaching  and learning.  Thankfully,  we  see  an  increase  in professional  development  programs  that  treat teachers as professionals. These long-term approaches focus on creating collaborative work cultures  with  attention  to  follow-up,  practice, and coaching.

This  chapter  examines  group  development through the lenses  of  intervening  not  at the  surface  practices  of  groups,  but  rather  at their source. Policymakers, novice groups, and leaders of silo organizations value individuality over  interdependence  and  analyze  data  in  a vacuum.  Experts  seek  patterns  and  look  beneath the surface, seeking driving forces. Natural systems such as schools, departments, and family units cannot be directed, only disturbed. After decades of absence, the reintroduction of disturbances, like the meteorologist's butterfly metaphor or the reintroduction of the grey wolf to Yellowstone National Park, affect everything else  in  their  systems  (Yellowstone Wolf  Project, 2013). Maturana and Varela (1987) write, 'Systems choose what to notice and how to pay attention.' Leaders disturb systems by bringing attention to what's being overlooked.

In this chapter we explore a way of inquiring  beneath  visible  behaviors  and  detectable patterns to search for potential sources of what groups do. Readers will find first, a description of  an  'iceberg'  model  (figure  10.1),  second, a  defintion  of  terms  in  the  lower  parts  of  the model,  and  finally,  ideas  for  intervening  at sources  of  behaviors,  rather  than  on  what  is seen and heard.

Later,  we  examine  another  model  for  influencing  change  below  the  surface,  bringing forward a version of Robert Dilt's conceptual treatment  of  nested  levels  of  learning.  Dilts organized his thinking in vertical form, like the deep to surface model, and positioned identity as  the  variable  responsible  for  the  greatest change  in  beliefs,  values,  and  behaviors.  We have  modified  this  in  keeping  with  our  sense that  humans,  too,  are  complex  dynamic  systems  and  their  developmental  processes  are subject to the same system principles described in chapter 2.

## Deep to Surface Structure

Figure  10.1  has  its  genesis  in  the  work of  Noam  Chomsky.  In  the  1950s  Chomsky created  a  transformational  linguistics  model that was  later  elaborated  on  for  work  in therapy  (Bandler  and  Grinder,  1975).  Since then,  applications  of  this  'iceberg'  model have been developed in such diverse fields as cognitive-behavioral therapy and architecture. In  the  1990s,  Costa  and  Garmston  adapted it to their work  in  'Cognitive  Coaching' (Garmston and Von Frank, 2012). It is broadly accepted that humans (and groups) act on internal maps, models, beliefs, and perceptions of the world, rather than what could be considered real. The iceberg figure illustrates how inquiries into the sources of surface behaviors reveal, and can stimulate, changes to core aspects of deep structure.

Figure  10.1  depicts  the  relationship  between the surface structure of what is seen and

Figure 10.1 . Moving from Deep to Surface Structure

heard from groups and their members (words, behaviors, norms, policies) and the underlying factors that inform and shape them-the deep structure  elements  of  beliefs,  values,  identity, and mental models. Below that, reference structure refers to emotionally laden events-like a tornado-ravaged school, or a teacher strike. In this model, anything in surface structure could theoretically be traced to origins below.

By  shining  the  light  of  consciousness  on essential  inner  structures,  skillful  leaders  help groups identify the underlying mental models that might be limiting perspectives and possibilities.  When  facilitators  or  group  members pose questions like ' Who are we?' 'Why are we doing this?' or 'Why are we doing it this way?' as described in chapter 2, mental models held  in  deep  structure  are  revealed. Additionally, the practice of dialogue and certain facilitation strategies can illuminate mental models, identities, beliefs, and values. Groups may pose questions to themselves referencing manifestations of the five energy sources:

- · 'What is it we do not know, that if knowing  it, would  increase  our  chances  of success?'
- · 'What might need to happen for us to increase our collective consciousness?'
- · 'What appear to be our assumptions about this matter?'
- · 'Whose thinking has not yet been tapped?'
- · 'What ideas might help us stay the course even through frustration and ambiguity?'

Some groups get stuck in limiting beliefs such as 'The administration is unresponsive to our needs,' 'These kids can't learn because of their  home  environments,'  or  'We  value  our autonomy  and  don't  need  to  coordinate  our efforts  with  others.'  Leaders  who  listen  below the surface, pausing, paraphrasing, posing questions,  and  presuming  positive  intentions, structure dialogues that permit group members to inquire about their own assumptions, beliefs, and  values.  These  dialogues  explore  driving behaviors and choices appearing in the surface struture. One cannot influence what is invisible.

## Reference Stucture Content

The  word  'reference'  is  derived  from the Latin referre , 'to carry back.' It means to link  back,  and  in  the  iceberg  model  denotes that this is the source for what lies above. The reference  structure  houses  emotionally  vivid experiences. A divisive teacher strike and its aftermath affect emotional responses for many years-long  after  the  school  board  members and the administrative teams have left or retired. Other reference structures might include the closing of a cherished program or school, feelings  of betrayal  related  to continuing misunderstandings  in  decision  making,  or  a sudden  influx  of  a  different  type  of  student. Individuals  also  carry  reference  structures that  inform  meaning  making.  Some  of  these storage  and  interpretive  processes  begin  before speech develops. The reference structure informs  collective  mental  models,  beliefs, values,  and  identities.  Of  course  individual reference structures also exist, making leadership messy enough to be interesting.

## Deep Structure Content

It  is  here  that  the  'rules'  for  how  the world  works  or  is  supposed  to  work  are encoded.  Some  of  these  meanings  are  held consciously,  and  some  are  outside  conscious awareness,  yet  all  inform  and  direct  choices and  behaviors.  Responses  to  change  initiatives, problem-solving models, and the criteria for  effective  solutions  are  all  rooted  in  the deep structure of the group.

The  actual  workings  and  influences  of the deep-structure  elements  are  not  always apparent  to  group  members.  Like  an  iceberg, seven-eighths of which lies hidden below water, special tools are necessary to illuminate and mediate what is there. Remarkably, the simple paraphrase is such a tool, and all forms of in-

quiry will disclose portions of this underworld. Examining  discrepancies  between  espoused beliefs  and  actions  often  reveals  unconscious sources  of  tension  and  inconsistent  choices. Schools  that  champion  inclusive  cultures  can undermine their efforts with awards programs that recognize only a few high achievers.

## Five Sources of Energy as Places to Intervene

sciousness, and interdependence influence states  of  performance  and  are  modifiable  by mediated experience. They are related to stages of cognitive,  moral,  and  ego  development. Skilled  leaders  take  a  developmental  view  in working with individuals and groups.

## Consciousness

Our premise is that the five energy sources of efficacy, flexibility, craftsmanship,  con-

Consciousness is depicted in figure 10.1 as giving access to what lies below a group's behavior. Language is the medium for revealing deep structure content. To be conscious is to be

Figure 10.2. Group Performance and Energy Sources

<!-- image -->

aware  of  one's  thoughts,  feelings,  intentions, behaviors, and the effects they have on others. Consciousness is a prerequisite to self-control and  self-direction  for  both  individuals  and groups.  Although  all  groups  are  capable  of reflective consciousness, many do not practice this. Stevens and Campion (1994) refer to this energy  source  as  a  group's  'executive  consciousness,' required to self-organize and manage its work. Groups that use this energy source maintain an awareness of their values, norms, and  identity;  monitor  the  congruence  of  their espoused  beliefs  and  their  manifest  beliefs; and stand outside themselves to reflect on their processes  and  products.  Such  groups  are  also aware of their criteria for decision making and of how their own assumptions and knowledge might interfere with their learning.

## Efficacy

Perceived  collective  efficacy  refers  to the  judgment  of  teachers  in  a  team  that  the group as a whole can organize and execute the courses of action required to have a positive effect  on  students. The  choices  groups  make are influenced by the strength of their efficacy beliefs. Goddard,  Hoy,  and  Woolfolk-Hoy (2004)  find  that  to  have  a  high  degree  of collective  efficacy  group  members  must  believe  that  they  and  others,  individually  and together,  are  capable  of  producing  increased student  success  and  of  overcoming  obstacles to that goal. Participating in decision-making contributes strongly to teachers' beliefs in the capabilities of their peers, fosters commitment to school goals, and promotes gains in student achievement. The RAND change-agent study (McLaughlin, 1990) found a staff's collective efficacy  to  be  the  most  consistent  variable related  to school  success.  Bandura  (1986, 1997)  proposes  three  sources  of  efficacyshaping  information  relevant  to  groups:  accomplishments in which the group attributes its  achievements to its  own  decisions,  skills, and hard work, rather than fate or luck; vicarious experiences; and social persuasion.

Efficacy  is  particularly  catalytic  because it is  a  determining  factor  in  the  resolution of  complex  problems.  If  groups  feel  little efficacy,  blame,  withdrawal,  and  rigidity  are likely  to  follow.  Teams  with  robust  efficacy, however,  are  likely  to  expend  more  energy in their work,  persevere  longer,  set  more challenging  goals,  and  continue  in  the  face of  failure.  Efficacious  groups  regard  events as  opportunities  for  learning,  are  motivated by and committed to achieving shared goals, learn from experiences, focus resources where they will make the greatest difference, know what they know and do not know, and develop strategies  to  learn  what  is  needed  (Goddard, Hoy, and Woolfolk-Hoy, 2004).

## Flexibility

As groups develop cognitively, they value and  more  consistently  view  situations  from multiple  perspectives.  Piaget  called  this  overcoming egocentrism.  Cultivating  group  member flexibility helps them to see others as more than their roles and not be trapped by constantly checking for agreement with personal views. In this way they form broader perspectives by seeing themselves and others as players in a larger drama  in  which  they  all  simultaneously  play central and secondary parts.

The peak performers Garfield (1986) studied  displayed  an  ability  for  flexible  attention that  he  called  microattention  and  macroattention. Microattention involves logical analytical computation  and  seeing  cause  and  effect  in methodical  steps.  It  is  important  in  problem analysis  or  curriculum  planning.  It  encompasses attention to detail, precision, and orderly progressions. Macroattention is useful for discerning  themes  and  patterns  from  an  assortment of information. It is intuitive, holistic, and conceptual. Macrothinking is good for bridging gaps, and it enables one to perceive a pattern even when some of the pieces are missing.

Groups  that  develop  this  energy  source honor  and  value  diversity  within  and  outside the group, attend to both rational and intuitive

ways  of  thinking,  can  collectively  shift  perspective,  and  utilize  a  wide  array  of  thinking and process skills. Such groups can also navigate  the  internal  tensions  of  confusion  and ambiguity and become unstuck by generating multiple actions for moving ahead.

Flexibility is a prerequisite to demonstrating  respect  for  diverse  perspectives.  Flexible teachers are empathetic. Flexible groups listen with their ears, eyes, heart, and mind. They are cognitively  empathetic  with  students,  which enables them to predict misunderstandings and anticipate the most useful learning experiences. Flexibility, like efficacy, is related to risk taking.  Creative  groups  live  close  to  the  edge, pushing  frontiers,  generating  new  knowledge, experimenting with new ways, and constantly growing into new abilities.

## Craftsmanship

Data  from  the  League  of  Professional Schools (Glickman, 1991) found that in schools where  teachers  are  the  most  successful,  they have  the  highest  dissatisfaction  with  the  results of their work. Success, for craftsmanlike groups,  produces  self-imposed  higher  standards in an ongoing cycle of improvement. In a study using cognitive coaching with university professors, Garmston and Hyerle (1988) found that as craftsmanship increased, the professors grew in their ability to be critically self-reflective  and  effective  in  producing  self-analysis and evaluation.

To appreciate this energy source, consider the mindset of expert performers such as musicians, artists, teachers, craftspeople, race car pit  crews, and athletic teams. They take pride in their work and consistently strive to improve current performance. Craftsmanship-the drive for  elaboration,  clarity,  refinement,  and  precision-is  the  energy  source  from  groups  who ceaselessly learn and deepen their knowledge, skills,  and  effectiveness.  Groups  that  access this  resource  invest  energy  in  honing  and  inventing  better  ways  to  do  their  work,  honor in  themselves  and  others  the  arduous  journey from novice to expert, manage time effectively, and continually improve inter- and intra-group communications. They  create,  hold,  calibrate, and refine performance and product standards for their work.

## Interdependence

Interdependence  is  a  recognition  of  the interconnections among  individuals, other groups, the school, distrct, the community and all  aspects  of  cultures  in  their  setting.  Interdependence is a key value in communities of practice;  groups that share a common interest and  meet  to  extend  their  learning  together  to refine  their  crafts.  Teams  that  have  grown  in interdependence manage individual differences and trust the group enough to voice dissimilarities (Kolb and Kolb 2009). Sergiovanni (1994) tells us that the German sociologist Ferdinand Tonnies called this way of being gemeinschaft . Gemeinschaft is  a  community  of  mental  life. Gemeinschaft contrasts  with gesellschaft , in which  community  values  have  been  replaced by contractual ones. The more policies a group has,  the  less  the  sense  of  community.  This  is the  case  in  most  modern  organizations.  Interdependent  peoples'  sense  of  self  is  enlarged from a conception of me to a sense of us . They understand that individuality is not lost as they connect with the group; only egocentricity is.

Interdependent  groups  value  and  trust the  process  of  dialogue,  have  an  awareness of  their  multiple  relationships  and  identities with other groups, and regard disagreement as a source of learning and transformation. They regard  knowledge  as  fluid,  provisional,  and subject  to  new  interpretation  with  additional experience. Perhaps most important, interdependent groups see the group not just as it is but also for its potential.

## Surface Structure Content

Behaviors,  placed  at  the  surface  structure in  the  iceberg  model,  are  what  individuals  or groups  do.  They  represent  what  is  visible,  yet

offer  few  cues  as  to  the  sources  of  actions. Language is used to describe behaviors, and the paraphrase  is  supremely  qualified  as  the  first move in intervention. First, it is not as intrusive as an initial question might be, it generates elaboration and clarification, and is a natural bridge to futher understanding through questions. One cannot  intervene  with  the  invisible.  Opening  a window to deep structure content permits even further understanding and mediation.

Kegan  and  Lahey  (2001)  propose  that work  settings  are  language  communities  and that  group  leaders  are  leading  language  communities:  '[Al]though  every  person,  in  any setting,  has  some opportunity to influence the nature of language, leaders have exponentially greater access and opportunity to shape, alter, or  ratify  the  existing  language  rules'  (p.  8). By attending to the verbal and nonverbal communication  cues  of  group  members,  skilled group leaders frame their own communication patterns to positively influence the perceptions, choices, and decisions of their groups.

## Deep Structure Content

Mostly unarticulated in deep structure are five influential entities: identity, beliefs, values, mental  models,  and  energy  sources.  Others, too, reside there and will be described later.

Identity .  This  is  a  group's  sense  of  itself; it  is  related  to  beliefs  and  values. Albert  and Whetten  (1985)  characterized  organizational identity  as  a  self-reflective  question: Who  are we  as  an  organization?  They  concluded  that organizational  identity  could  be  summarized in three major dimensions: (a) what is taken by the  organization  to  be  central  to  its  work;  (b) what  insiders  believe  makes  the  organization distinct from other organizations; and (c) what is  perceived  by  members  to  be  an  enduring quality of the organization.

Melucci (1995) describes collective identity as a shared definition generated by a number  of  individuals.  This  collective  perception shapes communication models and interactions with outside groups. More recently Polletta and

Jasper (2001) defined collective identity as the cognitive,  moral,  and  emotional  connections individuals have with the practices of a broader community or institution.

Groups  interpret  experiences  and  choose behaviors  that  are  intended  to  maintain  the continuity of self-generated self-concepts over time.  Self-concepts  are  also  maintained  by comparisons  with  others.  Groups  seek  positive differences between themselves and other groups as a way of enhancing their own self-esteem. Like individuals, they see themselves as distinct and act as if they are unique.

Beliefs .  Beliefs  are  what  a  group  is  emotionally invested  in  based  on  assumptions and convictions regarding people, concepts, or things.  Groups  that  believe  they  are  effective (efficacy) act that way and actually are. Groups that feel powerless to influence decisions within the school  act  that  way.  Behaviors  driven by  beliefs  reinforce  beliefs  which  reinforce behaviors in an endless cycle. School communities who share a sense of collective efficacy provide students with instructional experiences that  contribute  to  higher  learning  than  school groups who do not share this belief. They are more effective and likely to be more effective (Hoy, Tarter, and Woolfolk-Hoy, 2006).

Values. Values are about right and wrong, professional or unprofessional, good or bad and most often have a strong emotional component. 'We are all in this together,' 'Cultural differences are to be valued,' or 'Critical thinking is the most essential disposition for students,' are examples  of  values.  They  are  often  grounded in universal 'truths' like dignity, compassion, or independence.

Mental  Models. Mental  models  can  be conceived  as  'small-scale  models'  of  reality used  to  explain  how  things  work,  anticipate events, and to reason. Mental models are generally  founded  on  unquantifiable,  obscure,  or incomplete facts. As a result, all mental models  are  incomplete;  they  contain  distortions, deletions,  and  generalizations.  They  serve  as perception  filters,  interpreting  the  behavior  of all  people to 'see' what they want to. People

make decisions based on their mental models, not on objective reality.

## Intervening at Deep Structures

All  linguistic  expressions  are  incomplete from  their  total  meaning.  'Atyaf  is  a  bright student' is incomplete in many ways. The word bright is  undefined. Also  undefined  is student . ' Is ,' might also bear elaboration as Mr. Clinton once  observed.  The  speaker,  often  below  conscious levels, has elaborate and detailed models for what is meant by the five words in the sentence. It is only in deep listening that the speaker can articulate meanings, beliefs, or values internally held. The greater the simplicity of a mental model, the less it represents things as they actually are. To become more effective, groups must refine and add the unstated complexity.

Resources for making explicit deep structure content largely rely on the skill sets related to the seven norms of collaboration. These are employed in dialogue posed around penetrating questions-'What might be some evidence we are growing in collective efficacy?'-and strategies like 'Card Sort' and 'Shuffle' or 'First Turn  Last  Turn'  found  under  the  discourse heading in appendix A.

## Identity Interventions

Identity is not fixed, but rather it is a moving target according to neuroscientist Damasio (2010).  Group  development  approaches  that refine  collective  identity  include  constructing metaphors that expand senses of identity, and questions  designed  to  stimulate  reflection  at this  level  ('In  what  ways  are  we  a  teaching school and in what ways a learning school?'), and  meeting  practices  that  shift  the  spotlight from group members as information receivers to group members as constructors of meaning.

## Beliefs and Values Interventions

Ask groups to compare their espoused behavior to acted behaviors. They gain clarity and sharpen practice to more clearly align with their values.  Conduct  a  dialogue  on  group  values, then make a criteria matrix with group values on one side and program choices on the other. Conduct the 'Assumptions Wall' strategy described in  appendix A. In this activity, group members nonjudgmentally  illuminate  and  examine  their assumptions  about  sources,  rationale,  values, and consequences. This develops a greater understanding of the  presenting  issue  and  of  one another. Another way to challenge mental models  is  to  hold  a  values  challenge  seminar.  Best done in a retreat  setting,  this  is  a  conversation in  which  the  group's  core  values  are  identified and then tested against a variety of increasingly complex scenarios. Other options are the' Card Sort  and  Shuffle'  strategy,  'In  and  Out  of  the Frame,'  'Issues  Agenda,'  and  'Causal-Loop Diagram' (see appendix A).

## Capabilities Interventions

Capabilities are not described in the iceberg model,  but  inferred  in  mental  models,  and  are the metacognitive activities related to behaviors. To know one's intention and choose congruent behaviors is an example of a capability. Engage members in a study of the four group-member capabilities from chapter 4. To start, invite conscious  application  of  one  capability  at  a  time with periodic reflection and reports.

## Improving Collective Effectiveness

Groups cannot improve behaviors of which they are unaware. In this section we offer several  lenses  and  approaches  for  helping  group members to see themselves as a group. Group development  is  a  responsibility  shared  with each group member. Ultimately it is the group's group,  and  leaders  support  groups  in  owning the intentions and processes of improvement.

At least five intervention strategies can be used to illuminate and enhance the five energy sources: mediating, structuring, teaching, modeling, and monitoring.

## Mediating

Mediating any of the five energy sources brings  them  into  view  for  groups  and  offers platforms for improvement. The intent of mediating is self-directed learning. To mediate is to shine  a  judgment-free  'flashlight'  on  internal or external data in order to lead to self-directed learning. While  invitational  questions  may  be the  initial  entry  into  an  energy  source,  other tools of mediation include many of the norms of collaboration. Mediation most often occurs in  relation  to  reflecting  on  prior  experiences, planning, or problem solving. Costa and Garmston  (2015)  offer  detailed  maps  for  how  to coach in these three dimensions.

Figure  10.2  describes  behaviors  of  effective groups as they relate to each energy source. You  might  hear  members  posing  these  questions  to  themselves,  or  as  a  group  developer, you might ask similiar questions of groups.

## Efficacy

'How  might  we  focus  our  resources  to make the biggest difference?'

'When are some times when our perseverance led to great success?'

## Consciousness

'Who are we?'

'Why are we doing this?'

## Flexibility

'How might  we  incorporate  some  of  the diverse ideas on the table?'

'What  other  perspectives  might  we  take on this?'

## Craftsmanship

'What parts  of  our  values  should  inform our criteria for deciding X?'

'So  the  first  draft  is  good.  How  can  we make it better?'

## Interdependence

'Who might be some of our allies on this topic?'

'What could we be doing to align our energies with team 6?'

## Structuring

To  structure  is  to  manage  the  physical environment,  the  agenda,  the  tasks,  and  the grouping  of  participants  in  ways  designed  to promote certain levels of learning. This intervention acts on the level of environment in the Dilts model below. Stategically modifying the environment can increase the likelihood of extending capacities, perspectives, and behaviors related to any one of the energy sources. Some examples follow:

- · Arrange the room so that the visual focus of members is on a chart, not one another, during problem-solving conversations. This  helps  to  put  problems  'out  there' and not in the participants (flexibility and interdependence).
- · Use  the  Learning  Partners  strategy  (see appendix A) to break up cliques (flexibility and interdependence).
- · Use role diversity as a criterion for forming  subgroups.  On  a  school  site  council, for  example,  place  a  parent  within  each small cluster of teachers to list experiences on  a  topic.  One  typical  byproduct  is  a respect for one another's experiences that leads  to  universal  perceptions  of  being  a valued  member  of  the  group  and  being able  to  contribute  (flexibility,  interdependence, and efficacy).
- · Organize  the  agenda  so  that  subgroups work on specific tasks during the meeting (craftsmanship, efficacy).

## Teaching

The intervention of teaching is best suited to behaviors and capabilities. When combined with  mediated  experiences,  exposition  and story  can  influence  learning  at  the  levels  of belief  system  and  identity.  Ultimately,  this form of intervention includes the entire repertoire  of  good  instruction:  assessing,  explaining, giving examples, scaffolding, practicing, reading, and so on.

Self-assessments  provide  a  starting  point for an adult learning experience. This notion is very much in line with the growing literature on  the  influence  of  formative  assessments  as guides  to  student  learning  (Stiggins,  2007). To  focus  on  specific  energy  sources,  group developers might share descriptions of the five energy sources and ask group members to share their  impressions  of  which  ones  are  strength areas and which ones are stretch areas for this group. These impressions are starting points for planning group growth goals.

A group inventory has been developed by our colleagues Carolee Hayes and Jane Ellison. (See www.thinkingcollaborative.com/tc-apps/.)

## Modeling

Leaders and group members practice modeling when they display exemplars of specific skills (like paraphrasing)  or  complexes  of skills (like balancing inquiry and advocacy) in work settings with colleagues. Two refinements add  to  the  potency  of  modeling  as  a  learning device.  First  is  to  talk  out  loud  about  one's rationale in order to have metacognition about the particular behavior being modeled. Second is to practice public modeling, in which for example you announce to a group that in today's meeting you are going to work on improving your use of pausing. Reveal your reasons and ask the group members to be prepared to share their  perceptions  on  the  effectiveness  of  your application of the behavior.

## Monitoring

Monitoring  involves  collecting  data  on  a dynamic of interest to the group and reflecting on  how  this  informs  the  group  of  its  working patterns  and  how  the  group  might  improve  its effectiveness. A critical mindset is that the group is gathering and examining data to improve, not prove or judge, a level of performance. Groups may gather information on their use of the norms of collaboration, the degree of congruence with meeting standards, an assessment of the operating  energy  sources,  the  inclusion  of  members, the  value  placed  on  diverse  perspectives,  and other subjects that interest them.

We have learned that the use of a process observer, a member who gathers data on participant behaviors while the group is working, might  generate  more  negative  effects  than positive ones. A pattern of externally provided data will often lead a group toward a greater dependence  on  outside  assessment,  reduce the capacity for accurate self-assessment, and diminish the capacity for self-directed learning.  Work  with  both  students  and  adults  has confirmed this (Sanford, 1995). Observers can effectively support learning when they follow a pattern in which the data are displayed without interpretation and the group is invited to interpret it.

A  strategy  that  employs  both  monitoring and  mediation  involves  asking  two  questions of  group members for their private reflection: 'What  are  some  of  the  decisions  you  made about when and how to participate in the preceding conversation?' and 'What are some of the influences of your decisions on yourself and others?'/  'How  did  your  decisions  influence yourselves and others?' After silent reflection, the  members  might  write  a  response,  share and interact with a neighbor, or practice a full round-robin reflection.

Expert groups are more likely than novice groups  to  be  reflective.  The  more  reflection, the greater the learning from experience. Nonreflection  dooms  a  group  to  repeat  the  same behaviors over and over, regardless of whether they are producing desired results.

Every  working  group  has  far  more  task than time. This contributes to a natural reluctance  to  use  any  precious  time  to  monitor  or reflect on the group's working processes. Some groups  resolve  this  tension  by  committing themselves to  a  task-process  ratio. They  budget  a  certain  portion  of  each  meeting  to  their own learning, exploring how well the group is working and what it might do to improve.

## A Second Intervention Model

In  a  quantum  world,  everything  influences  everything  else.  Anthropologist  and cyberneticist  Gregory  Bateson  was  fond  of saying that all beings exist within holonomous systems. That is, each person is part of several greater systems (e.g., families, teams, schools) yet maintains a unique identity and palette of choices, both as an independent agent and as the  member  of  a  group.  Each  system  influences the individual, and, to a lesser degree, the  individual  influences  the  system.  Based on work by Bateson and conceived by Robert Dilts (1994, 1996), this model shows identity as  influencing  all  other  aspects  of  learning. Dilts  describes  four  operating  principles  in this model:

- 1. Any  system  (of  activity)  is  a  subsystem embedded  inside  another  system.  Each system is also embedded in an even larger system.
- 2. Learning  occurs  in  each  subsystem  in  a manner  specifically  related  to  that  subsystem.
- 3. Learning at each level organizies and controls the information on levels below.
- 4. Learning something on an upper level will change things on lower levels, but learning something on a lower level might or might not influence the levels above it.

Dilts borrowed the 'levels' metaphor from Bateston's  work  on  learning  to  learn  and  assumed learning as cascading from one level to the ones below. He identified the levels as follows: identity; beliefs and values, capabilities; behaviors; and environment. We have applied this model to our work with groups for over a decade and found great value in using it as an intervention  model,  not  only  with  groups  but with  individuals.  Today  our  agreement  with Dilts  is  that  identity  influences  all  the  other elements.  However,  based  on  our  continuing learning  about  complex  systems,  our  examination  of  Bateson's  work,  and  critiques  of the  Dilts  model  we  are  replacing  the  'levels'

metaphor in our thinking with something more congruent  with  our  knowledge  of  complex systems and holons, refering to the Dilt's levels, instead, as domains (Armour 2015; Tosey 2006; and Dilts 1994, 2003, 2014).

In  Garmston's  view  (figure  2.3)  of  the  elements  of  learning,  we  see  the  elements  as dynamical in which everything affects everything else. Yet there are two dominant players within this system. Identity, we believe, is the major  influence  on  all  the  elements  within the  system,  informing  beliefs,  values,  capabilities, and behavior. Next, environment can modify the expressions of  identity.  To  show this idea, we have placed environment as the surround  and  note  that  one's  environment has  a  modifying  effect  on  the  expression  of beliefs,  values,  capabilities,  and  behaviors. Changing the environment-say, from one in which mediation is a primary leadership activity to one in which command and control is more common-modifies not only behaviors but also the potential for learning. (Costa and Garmston, 2015)

Our thinking is influenced by Arthur Koestler's  (1972)  introduction  of  holons.  A  holon is a system in which everything is at the same time  a  part  of  something  else  and  a  whole  in and of itself. In this view a school is a whole and  simultaneously  part  of  a  district.  The district  also  is  part  of  a  larger  system. Wilber (2001)  extended  this  idea  by  introducing  the concept of 'holorchies,'  which  are  hierachies of holons.

Dilts held that the levels are embedded in one  another  and  called  them  nested  levels  of learning. In his view each level is more abstract than the next and has a greater degree of impact on the individual or group. We agree with Dilts that  identity  is  the  most  influential  of  all  the domains in this model.

From  the  psychological  point  of  view  there seem  to  be  five  levels  that  you  work  with most  often.  (1)  The  basic  domain  is  your environment,  your  external  constraints.  (2) You  operate  on  that  environment  through

your behavior. (3) Your behavior is guided by your mental maps and strategies, which define your  capabilities.  (4)  These  capabilities  are organized by belief systems. . . . (5) Beliefs are organized by identity. (Dilts, 1994, p. 1)

Instead of levels, our view is that each domain interacts with each of the others.

In  our  current  practices,  we  are  finding  it useful  to  regard  Dilts's  model  not  as  a  hierarchical,  linear  map  that  assumes  clocklike operation in which the same inputs will consistently produce the same result. Rather, we are seeing it as describing a complex system made of many moving parts operating within environmental  systems  that  are  constantly changing.  Complex  systems  are  those  in which everything affects everything else, tiny inputs  cause  major  disturbances,  more  data are  not  a  greater  predicator  of  results,  and both things and energy matter. (Costa, Garmston, Ellison, and Hayes, 2015a, p. 31)

Figure  10.3  below  shows  the  Dilts  elements  as  conceptualized  by  Garmston  as operating  within  a  dynamical  system  (Costa, Garmston, Ellison, and Hayes, 2015b p. 33).

Two factors in figure 10.3 have the greatest influence  on  group  development:  identity  and environment.  Identity,  as  in  the  Dilts  model,

influences all elements within a system except environment.  Equally  important,  environment can  modify  the expressions of  identity.  We have  witnessed  work  cultures  transitioning from  authoritarian  structures  to  collaborative settings modifying not only behaviors, but also potentials for learning.

Collective  shifts  in  identity,  we  believe, primarily occur through experiences rich enough to rattle mental models if opportunities are  provided  for  extensive  reflection. A  community coming together to support one another in response to a tragedy comes to mind. Disruptive events like labor conflicts can also create profound  identity  shifts  for  several  parts  of  a school community. More hopefully, processes that challenge or examine assumptions, beliefs, or  values-processes  similar  to  the  two-hour identity intervention described on page 146can also be effective.

## How to Work with Dilts

Here we offer a few perhaps overly simple ideas  for  seeking  change  through  elements  of the  Dilts  model-identity,  beliefs/values,  capabilities,  behaviors,  and  environment.  Keep in  mind  that  these  elements  interact  with  one another  and  additional  elements  in  complex systems.  The  image  opposite  shows  the  front office  'environment'  of  the  Creative  Science K-8 School  in  Portland,  Oregon. As  one  can imagine, this  open  office  environment  evokes reactions  of  openness  rather  than  barriers, friendliness  rather  than  distance,  and  partnership rather than authority.

Kate  Bennett,  the  CSS  Principal's  Secretary,  noticed  that  the  original  layout  of  the front office created  confusion  and  tension. The  solid  U-shaped  counter  was  a  barrier  to communication. Adults were uncertain how to communicate with staff, with some waiting behind the counter to interact while others walked around  it.  In  addition,  students  were  required to  record  tardiness  on  a  sheet  that  resided  on this high counter. Approaching it with the staff on the other side, left students feeling scolded.

In the spirit of leadership is function, not role, the secretary shared her observations with the principal  and  vice  principal.  Collaboratively, the three worked to redesign the environment, creating a child-friendly sign-in/out area in an alcove in the process.

## Identity

Recently we worked with an international school  struggling  with  a  persistent  problem of too many initiatives. Using a concept from Kristine Quade (2015), we met with the Head

of  School's  cabinet  in  a  small  room  with  lots of  wall  space  on  which  to  write.  Here  is  the process we used.

- 1. Individuals listed myths people have about their group; this is the container in which they work and in some ways contributes to the identity they work from.
- 2. Pairs  worked  on  four  flip  charts  about their responsibilities, purposes,  culture, and resources .
- 3. The  full  group  made  refinements  and achieved agreement.
- 4. The group was asked, 'Given all this, who are  you?'  and  a  list  of  ideas  was  brainstormed,  then  summarized  into  one  tight statement.
- 5. The  group  was  asked,  'What  needs  to happen  next?'  Following  the  admonition in  chapter  8,  we  asked  who  will  do  what by  when  and  four  specific  action  steps were  identified.  The  group's  identity  was reshaped into that of a proactive leadership team.

## Beliefs/Values

The  'Card  Stack  and  Shuffle'  and  'Assumptions Wall' strategies in appendix A both require participants to examine beliefs and assumptions. Groups must articulate beliefs and values  in  order  to  examine  them.  These  two strategies  and  asking  groups  to  compare  their espoused and actual beliefs take members into this territory.

## Capabilities

Have  members  read  about  group  member  capabilities  described  in  chapter  4.  With others,  ask  them  to  identify  which  are  most important  and  how  they  will  remember  to employ  them.  Periodically  pose  the  self-reflective question, 'What decisions did I make about how and when to participate in that conversation and what effect did those decisions have on me and others?'

## Behaviors

Consistent with the Dilts model engaging persons in examining capabilities improves the related  behaviors.  The  'What  decisions  did  I make?'  question  above  is  one  form. Another is  to  invite  members  to  describe  the  mental processes  involved  in  a  behavior.  Participants that identify metacognitive processes refine the behaviors driven by those processes.

## Environment

William  Isaacs  (1999)  tells  a  story  of presenting to a group of Silicon Valley executives. After the presentation, instead of having a  question  and  answer  period,  he  suggested the  twenty-five  people  put  their  chairs  in  a circle  and  say  whatever  thoughts  or  feelings were present at the time, a common activity in dialogue. The first few made some comments and then one man said this reminded him of a camping trip  with  his  two  sons  when  he  was not sure how they were experiencing the event. From  that  point  forward,  each  person  told  a story of heart and meaning. Educators too, influence behaviors and emotions through similar environmental  changes.  As  another  example, the  third  point  strategy  in  appendix A  directs disagreements  to  topics  rather  than  persons. Most  importantly,  however  is  affecting  the emotional environment by the form of leadership one employs.

The  next  chapter  describes  ways  teams proactively  seek  and  explore  potential  challenges to student learning.
