## Interdependence as an Innate Drive

The brain's function is to regulate life. Somewhere in human evolution this emerged as managing well-being in relationship to others, in social systems (Damasio 2010). Humans desire reciprocity, belonging, and connectedness. We are inclined to become one with the larger system and community of which we are a part.

In human evolution, successful hunters and gatherers had a better chance of survival if they worked together with others. Humans are relatively weak, with no fur or natural armor with which to protect themselves. Being a weak, lone individual competing for scarce resources would certainly be a disadvantage. Establishing cooperative agreements with others would make survival more likely when resources were limited.

Eventually our ancestors' brains began to change from purely survival brains into social brains. Most scientists now agree that our social brains have been shaped by natural selection because being social enhances survival (Cozolino 2006).

Further evidence to support the concept of the social brain comes from studies of very young children. Tomasello (2009) makes a strong case for an innate capacity that children have for empathy and cooperation. At an astonishingly early age, children begin to help one another and to share information. It appears that we are born ready to cooperate. (See also Costa and O'Leary 2013; Lieberman 2013; Goleman 2006.)
