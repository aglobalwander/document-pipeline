Today is about meetings-Can plan meeting so others look forward to attending.

Who has been in meeting since last time?

Did that meeting run well?

Did you run that meeting?

Who has been in meeting not so productive?

Did you run THAT meeting? :)

Remember 3 focus areas: Facilitating groups, developing groups, becoming more skillful group member

- · Facilitators develop when pay attention to micro-skills (frozen gesture, visual paragraph, attention first, etc.)
- · Groups develop when group leaders see them as they could be, not as are.
- · Skillful members develop high consciousness for interacting-using norms, skills, capabilities

## WELCOME AND AUDIENCE CONNECT

THE TRAINERS NOTES ARE IN REGULAR TYPE. SUGGESTED LANGUAGE THE TRAINER MAY SAY TO THE GROUP IS PROVIDED IN ITALICS.

TRAINERS NOTE:

THE IMAGES USED IN THESE POWERPOINTS HAVE BEEN PURCHASED BY THINKING COLLABORATIVE TO PROVIDE AUTHORIZED TRAINERS THE RIGHT TO USE THESE IMAGES ROYALTY FREE. IF TRAINERS WISH TO USE THESE IMAGES FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES, TRAINERS WILL NEED TO PURCHASE THE IMAGES PERSONALLY TO PROVIDE THE TRAINERS' RIGHT TO USE THEM OUTSIDE THINKING COLLABORATIVE.

## WHAT?

Audience Connect allows the presenter to develop rapport and relationship, as well as establishing credibility.

## WHY?

The trainer needs to make a connection to the world of the audience and share a purpose for the work.

## HOW?

Our work today is largely about meetings. We think that you can plan a meeting so that others will look forward to attending. We know that groups develop when the group leaders see them as they could be, not as they are. Today we are going to focus on meetings in which the maximum amount of work is accomplished, in the minimum amount of time, with maximum group member satisfaction.

## TRAINERS NOTE:

Establish the above points about meetings by using a Visual Paragraph.

bringing everyone present acknowledge challenges, joys, aspirations

## Examples:

What…

Gave you joy?

Funniest event?

Best student comment?

Challenged your thinking?

Was a good idea?

Was a real world application?

Question you still have?

One thing you learned?

Pushed your comfort zone?

Applied what you learned?

Bravest thing?

Best that could happen?

What are you great at?

What did you accomplish?

What are you grateful for?

Day 1-adaptivity, dialogue and discussion. Elements of professional community Day 2-2 norms, identity, Dilts levels of influence in learning

Today-successful meetings

Skills/tools to work at high focus-&gt;get work done-&gt;impact learning for kids

Today YOU WILL gain tools to facilitate productive, satisfying meetings Four Day Overview:

Suggested Language:

Day 1 - Entering the Territory-Research base on effective professional communities learning; focus areas of the Adaptive Schools work

Day 2 - Developing Identity and Capacity-The how-to, nuts and bolts of building effective collaborative groups

Day 3 - Transforming Meetings-The best practices of meetings

Day 4 -Sustaining Community-Continuing the work with effective meetings with a focus on engaging cognitive conflict, then planning to transfer learning from the workshop to the workplace

Why are we here?

## Reminder of goal that ties work together

a call to become a productive group, will need to examine identity Not focusing only on traditional, linear challenges AS approach focuses on complex, non-linear, human challenges, and invites organizations to clarify identities as collaborators, inquirers, leaders while changing form to congruently align with that identity.

## WHAT?

Reconnect with the goal

WHY?

It has been some time since participants have seen the goal.

## HOW?

Put slide up and have participants share with a partner how they have been internalizing the goal.

## 1-collaborative learning space

Outcome for dialogue-&gt;understanding / about perspective swapping

Outcome for discussion-&gt;decisions that stay made

2-How adults talk and how that talk influences kids' learning / kids lives

Trust enough to talk in deep ways

3-reminder to teach, use, assess, etc.

4-3rd norm, essential as inquirers

## OUTCOMES

Suggested Language:

Please read these outcomes as they appear on the screen. Then share with a partner and share which outcome has the most significance for you today.

Public agenda-shared

Provides visual mental memory, even when meeting 20 minutes.

Focused, connections between ideas, sequence, organized-&gt;Advanced organizer

2-adult AND classroom purposes:  better meeting-more done, shortest time, greatest satisfaction.

- 1-task (what)
- 2-process (how)
- 3-growing adult group and skills-every time meet, need to be better off as group members

5-principles that guide those practices underpinnings-&gt;how make choices

## CHARTED AGENDA

Sculptor -also created 'make way for ducklings' statue in Boston Public Garden Pronounced 'Shoon' SELECT A NORM FOR TODAY'S FOCUS WHAT? Set a Norm focus

## WHY?

An opportunity to select one of the Seven Norms of Collaboration as a personal focus for today's work.

## HOW?

Suggested Language:

The background of this slide is a sculpture that's entitled, 'Dialogue.'

Use Norms to do deepest work

'Given agenda for next 30 minutes, which norm support us in getting most work done?'

Classrooms:  chart outcomes-&gt; 'Given these outcomes, which norms will support you today in getting most work done?'  Develop life-long skills, civility, human-ness!!

Studied 2 last time.  Will go in depth with remaining.

Using the list of Norms on the banner (or in your Learning Guide), select one as your personal focus for today's work.

Use this slide as reference for participants.

## What

A strategy for grouping

## Why

Give participants an opportunity to connect with others in the room

Create energy through movement Like to buy space in own condos. Keep same perspective.

By moving from one side of room to other, gives new vision, new thinking.

Trying to learning something new, buddy can hold you back. Trying on new behaviors and ways of being, harder with old friends Easier with new learning partners

SET UP LEARNING PARTNERS

LG, p. 14 (also p. 129)

WHAT?

A new set of learning partners - clock partners - a strategy for grouping.

## WHY?

Give participants an opportunity to connect with others in the room and create energy through movement

## HOW?

## Suggested Language:

In just a moment, you will stand and make appointments with 4 people, not currently at your table. When you write their name at one of the times (12, 3, 6, 9) be sure they write your name at the same time on the clock.

After most have their partners, visit each time on the screen with the large group and check to be sure each person has a partner. If anyone does not have a partner, remind about the 'land of the temporarily disconnected' (area near agenda chart, for example) and choosing a pair to become a trio.

In a moment you will be packing and stacking to work with one your clock partners. When you sit with him/her, share your Norms Goal and rationale for choosing it.

Speak aloud norm you chose-declaration to community are trying on new behavior. Expect it and support you.

Please move to a table with your 12 o'clock partner and share your goal.

## TEE UP PRODUCTIVE MEETINGS

HOW?

Use 'Hold a Meeting' Slide, or cartoon, or story, etc., to begin.

Challenges to meeting success!

## Introduce PRODUCTIVE MEETINGS-&gt;SORT CARDS

opportunity to practice Putting Ideas on Table

Put aside!

Will come back

HOW?

Use slide for brainstorm.

## What

Principles / practices -&gt; correlate highly with productive meetings

## Why- are principles (not rules)

- · Principles more powerful and flexible than rules
- · Principles help understand why things work way they do and how to improve them
- · Principles increase effectiveness of work groups
- · Principles include strategies and moves that can use when running meeting AND when group member

Reminder-group members more influential in keeping meetings on track, on topic, and focused than skillful facilitator.

Examples of principles:

Develop a growth mindset

Work to understand others' culture, interests, needs and perspectives.

Create a base of rigorous learning opportunities for ALL students.

Understand that students have varied points

Accept that human differences are not only normal, but also desirable

## PRODUCTIVE MEETINGS SORT CARDS

Reframe from negative view of meetings to viewing meetings as productive learning experiences.

WHAT?

Sort Card strategy

WHY?

Principles (not rules).

More powerful and flexible than rules.

Help understand why meetings work the way they do and how to improve them.

Increase effectiveness of work groups.

Have strategies and moves that can be used both as a facilitator AND as a group member.

Suggested Language:

Productive groups conduct the day-to-day work of effective school systems

They use certain practices that less effective groups do not. This strategy is designed to identify as many of these good practices as possible within a short period of time.

## PRODUCTIVE MEETINGS SORT CARDS

WHAT?

strategy designed to identify good practices in short time

## WHY?

- · expertise / human resource in room.
- · sharing ideas / experiences.
- · strategy to use with your groups.
- · practice putting ideas on table

## HOW?

proceed in stages-individually-&gt;table group-&gt;entire room-&gt;table groups.

## 4 post-it notes.

## HOW?

Describe the Sort Card strategy.

Suggested Language:

Sort Cards will proceed in stages.  Here are your first directions.

Use the slides to present Sort Cards and Museum Tour directions incrementally.

Docent-doesn't go

Help others understand your exhibit / thinking

Fickle finger of fate to determine docent

Strategically assign group members to go around to other exhibits and harvest ideas

Museum Tour WHAT? Visual display of group work products

WHY?

Share small group work with the larger group

HOW?

Offer directions on slide.

Suggested Language:

The Docent remains to help others understand the exhibit/thinking of the group.

As you visit the museum exhibits, consider what is similar to the one your group created, and what might be unique.

Read directions on slide.

Not be mad at them-&gt; instead be proactive so they stay productive. Plan for moments when people aren't productive

Be prepared for things that might happen.

I anticipate/predict that _______ could happen in meeting, I will use __________ as a strategy.

Compare unproductive behaviors to what you generated Match up unproductive behaviors with strategies.

If time-Share one unproductive behavior and how you might address it

## SORT CARDS REFLECTION ON CONTENT:

HOW?

Have individuals return to original brainstorms of unproductive meeting experiences.

## Suggested Language:

The pattern for our debriefs is reflection on content-what are we learning? - and on process-how did the strategy help us to learn?

Content first: Considering your list of unproductive experiences in meetings, please review it and indicate which might be resolved by using some of the strategies you generated?

Intention: be meeting investor instead of meeting bystander

1-what can I give to make sure the meeting is success?

2-what do I need from meeting to support our work?

## Debrief:

Meetings are facilitated

Good meetings require skillful group members

Most powerful influence in meeting is group member

Don't have them? Develop them every meeting

Principles of complex systems

Tiny events-major disturbances

Everything influences everything else

Don't have to touch everyone to make difference

## Develop good facilitators

rotate facilitation. Need opportunity to learn to lead

Design meetings-don't start with behaviors and expect to change practices Start with principle. Principle becomes practice.

As leader, develop identity as collaborator, inquirer, leader, then add strategies.

Using strategies with wrong identity -&gt; can be torture for participants

## SORT CARDS REFLECTION ON PROCESS:

Suggested Language:

So you are the facilitator and you are designing a meeting, what might be some reasons you would utilize this strategy? Why this strategy? Why this time?

## TRAINERS NOTE

You may need to elaborate on what we mean by design principles by adding the words, 'reasons or why these strategies were effective.' If these points are not offered by participants in the debrief, add:

Suggested Language:

Everyone involved

Collaboration

Movement

Honoring expertise in the room

The Sort Card and Museum Tour strategies serve several purposes - your ideas and experiences are available to others and you get new ideas. Collectively you level the playing

field of information in the room, you start to identify human resources within the room and you learn a strategy to use with your groups. Finally, as trainers, we get to learn what you

CLOCK PARTNERS LG, p. 14 WHAT? New Clock Partner

WHY?

Offer fresh perspective and mark transition to new material.

HOW?

Suggested Language:

Find your partner, and...share your responses to this question: What are some of the purposes of meetings?

## THREE MEETING PURPOSES

LG, p. 38

WHAT?

Station Naming on the Agenda Chart

## WHY?

Station Naming re-acclimates participants to agenda for the day. (Like a train conductor naming the next stop, a trainer uses the agenda chart to update participants on where we are and where are going next in the training.)

Provides a model of how to utilize a public agenda

## HOW?

Move to agenda and reference current topic placement

without outcomes becomes fuzzy -start making it up

Create a compelling purpose

## What you want to be different or what you want to create because this group met?

## WHAT?

Three meeting purposes:  Task, process, group development. Tee up 3 Meeting Purposes by introducing the metaphor of the spinning plates

All ongoing groups need to balance three simultaneous agendas: Task, Process, and Group Development.

## WHY?

This strategy transitions from the Card Sort and frames the facilitator's work on Successful Meeting Structures.

In selecting processes or strategies facilitators may choose to give more support to one of three 'plates': task, process or group development.

## HOW?

- 1.  Tee up using spinning plates slide.

## Suggested Language:

Leading a meeting can often feel overwhelming because we are paying attention to so many things at once. Wellman and Lipton (2004) offer a metaphor of a street entertainer spinning plates. As in a vaudevillian act, all plates require constant attention. The facilitator notices which one is wobbling and gives that one a little more spin.

- 2.  Before introducing 3 purposes/agendas emphasize the importance of outcomes, by telling group:

## Suggested Language:

Before we talk about meeting purposes, I'm going to share with you the three most important things about a meeting:

#1 Outcomes

#2 Outcomes

## #3 Outcomes

## Metaphor

- · variety show / street show vaudeville style
- · facilitating meeting feels like trying to keep plates spinning!

## What

3 Plates are purposes for meetings and offers Focus

## Why

frames facilitator's work-&gt;successful meeting structures All plates require constant attention Facilitator notices which one is wobbling-&gt; gives more spin May need more support to 'plate'

## How

- 1-'WHAT' gets done (TASK)
- -novice focuses here
- -work worth doing
- -learn something new / challenge
- 2-'HOW' it gets done-both efficiently AND effectively (PROCESS) STRATEGIES
- 3-'WHO'-&gt; participants + their development over time
- -Growing as group and skills-&gt; to be better off as group members

-often forgotten

Group Member Capability #4, Day 2-To Know and Support the Group's Purposes, Topics, Processes, and Development

- 3. Reference Group Member Capability #4 in the LG, from Day 2, 'To Know and Support the Group's Purposes, Topics, Processes and Development. Use the slide images to accompany trainer input.

## Suggested Language:

Novice groups may pay attention almost exclusively to the first agenda, Task Focus. This is the 'what' of the meeting, the checklist of items to be covered. As groups mature, attention is also paid to the second agenda, Process. This is the 'how' of the meeting, the strategies that ensure effectiveness along with efficiency as tasks are accomplished. The third agenda, Group Development, focuses on the 'who' of the meeting, the group members, and their development of collective identity and capacity as collaborators, inquirers, and leaders. 4. Use slide prompt to have partners reflect on an upcoming meeting and what 'plates'

might need the most attention.

## What

Education is Steeped in principles-&gt;look at organizing principles

CONDUCTING SUCCESSFUL MEETINGS: ORGANIZING PRINCIPLES

LG, p. 64

WHAT?

These principles are the 'big ideas' of successful meetings.

## WHY?

Principles help us understand why things work the way they do and how to improve them. Principles are more powerful and flexible than rules.

## HOW?

Use slide and LG page to introduce the principles by verbally highlighting key ideas of the Organizing Principles.

## Suggested Language:

The intention of this next piece is to provide you with a set of principles to increase the effectiveness of work groups when they meet.

Use slides and Learning Guide and have pairs Read &amp; Respond to the first two Principles one at a time. Stop after each to make comments and answer questions, as appropriate.

## Suggested Language after Read &amp; Respond to 1 st Principle:

A recent discovery is that group members are more influential in keeping meetings on track, on topic, and focused than a skillful facilitator.

## HUGE principle

CAN predict quality of instruction / learning by quality of adult relationships-directly effects learning

•Vulnerable to learn from each other

Suggested Language after Read &amp; Respond to 2 nd Principle:

Productive groups are made, not born. There is an implication of shared objectives, mutual trust and respect, and a disciplined skill set rooted in listening. Researchers Bryk and Schneider in their work in successful Chicago schools observed that the behavioral manifestation of respect was the ability to listen to another person, particularly when you disagree.

Cross stitch to Intention, Attention, Action from Day 2 and norms of Presuming Positive Intentions and Paying Attention to Self and Others.

## Suggested Language:

We come to this demanding work in a whole state. Set aside old hurts, slights, and personality conflicts. 'See the way she was looking at me?' Stop projecting old hurts onto new situations. Heal yourself. Your first relationship is with yourself.

## Organizing Principles, p. 64

Pairs: With your organization in mind, pick one question. Respond to the question.

Pick a second question if time.

- · What might be some of the things about which people are feeling very successful?
- · What are your hunches about your organization's issues to which people are paying close attention?
- · Given your knowledge of staff, whose perspectives/points of view are particularly helpful?
- · As you consider your organization's mission, what skills do people seem to be continuously trying to improve in themselves?

## Debrief

What are some words you might use to describe conversation just had with your partner? Get examples of words.

FIVE ENERGY SOURCES

LG, p. 64-65

Suggested Language:

You are going to experience principle #3 in a different way. Using the prompts on the screen, select 2 or 3 to talk to your partner about your organization. Your partner will do the same. What questions might you have about these directions? Here are your options…

Reveal 5 prompts one at a time and read aloud.

## Debrief

Suggested Language:

What might be some one-or two-word descriptors about the conversation you just had?

## WHAT?

Suggested Language:

The 3 rd organizing principle for conducting successful meetings is that effective groups draw upon five energy sources:

Group efficacy

Group flexibility

Group craftsmanship

Group consciousness

Group interdependence

## WHY?

In adaptive, complex, non-linear systems, paying attention to the flow and interchange of energy as much as to things is the key to successful school leadership. It is necessary to look below surface behaviors to analyze the sources of successes and challenges.

## WHAT?

Suggested Language:

Group interdependence

## WHY?

In adaptive, complex, non-linear systems, paying attention to the flow and interchange of energy as much as to things is the key to successful school leadership. It is necessary to look below surface behaviors to analyze the sources of successes and challenges.

## HOW?

Offer the directions on the slide.

## Resource for trainer:

- ·Efficacy-believes in capacity to produce results; stamina / energy
- •Consciousness-awareness of self and group; impact of actions
- •Flexibility-multiple perspectives, creative with uncertainty / ambiguity
- •Craftsmanship-clarity in values, goals, standards; refines communication
- •Interdependence-values relationships; conflict as opportunities to improve / learn

## HOW?

After the paired reading, offer the prompts with the Energy Sources labeled.

## Suggested Language:

Once again, here are the prompts from your earlier conversation. Notice how each prompt connects to one of the five Energy Sources. Recall the one-word descriptors you offered about the positive energy in the conversation that you had.

After lunch, you will have the opportunity to use these Energy Sources to intervene with struggling groups.

WHAT:  Synthesis -- 3 organizing principles

WHY:  closure -- big ideas about successful meetings

## HOW:

WHAT?

Synthesis of the 3 organizing principles

WHY?

Bring closure to the big ideas about successful meetings

## Suggested Language:

As we get ready for lunch, take a moment… (pairs, pairs square, table groups) to have this dialogue.

## HOW?

Complete the sentence stem.

## Suggested Language:

We've been focusing on 3 big ideas about successful meetings, before moving to specific strategies, which we will look at this afternoon. Take a few minutes at your table to complete this sentence with the colleagues at your table.

## TRAINERS NOTE:

Trainer discretion for the processing of the closing dialogue: pairs, pair square, table groups.

The following is language to describe each of the Energy Sources: Efficacy-believes in capacity to produce results; stamina/energy Consciousness-awareness of self and group; impact of actions Flexibility-multiple perspectives, creative with uncertainty/ambiguity Craftsmanship-clarity in values, goals, standards; refines communication Interdependence-values relationships; conflict as opportunities to improve/learn

## WHAT?  norm--posing questions

WHAT?

Suggested Language:

'Promoting a Spirit of Inquiry' is the large conceptual frame for this work, distinguishing a culture of inquiry from one of advocacy. The operational 'how to' of

promoting this spirit lives in the Seven Norms of Collaboration. Pausing and Paraphrasing gives us 'permission' to Pose Questions.

## WHY?

We pose questions to explore assumptions, to invite others to inquire into their own thinking, to first seek understanding of others' ideas prior to advocating for our own.

POSING QUESTIONS LG p. 56-57 WHAT? Clock Partner

## WHY?

Construct meaning from reading Gain another perspective

HOW?

Use page 14 and directions on slide.

## HOW?

Suggested Language:

With a partner, revisit the question prompts from this morning.

Read the question on the slide.

Debrief and gather responses.

## Choose voice:

Have dogs?  Dogs know voice?  Know when to come / hide? Listening to loudness, softness, intonation.

Say this to dog (approachable):  There you are. You think you're pretty cute lying on my bed. You chewed my slipper, you crazy dog.  Come/run?  Why?  What listening to?  Up / down / up / down / upswing-approachable voice.  Humans same. Like good animals.

Say (credible): There you are. You think you're pretty cute lying on my bed. You chewed my slipper, you crazy dog.

Meaning from nonverbals.  Not what you say, but how you say it.  Detects threat.  65-85% nonverbal.

Angry?  Not what said, but how said it.  Misunderstanding you? check nonverbals.  Not trying to be that way.  Hard-wired to detect threat-Made that way.

## HOW?

Offer 10-2 with demonstration/rehearsal/examples, referencing LG page.

- 1.  Input/model attending fully.

## HOW?

Important: Culture supersedes all!
