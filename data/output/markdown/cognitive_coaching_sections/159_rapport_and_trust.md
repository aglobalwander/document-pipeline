## Rapport and Trust

Trust is about the whole of a relationship; rapport is about the moment.

Trust is belief in and reliance on another person developed over time. Rapport is comfort with and confidence in someone during a specific

interaction. Rapport may be naturally present or you may consciously seek it, even when you are meeting a parent, student, or colleague for the first time. You cannot manipulate someone into a relationship of trust and rapport, but you can draw on specific verbal and nonverbal behaviors to nurture the relationship.

The research reviewed in chapter 3 revealed that the coach's matching of gestures, postures, or voice qualities contributes to rapport. These behaviors have an enormous impact on feelings of connectedness and rapport. Such an alignment permits a non-verbal form of communication that the other person is being 'understood' and, in the deepest sense, is 'feeling felt' by another person (Damasio 2010; Caine and Caine 2015). Under these conditions, permission is being tacitly given for coaching. The coach recognizes this permission by observing full, rather than shallow, breathing patterns (Zoller and Landry 2010).
