Reflection
Intercultural Communication

Introduction
Cultures Goal:  Interact with cultural competence and understanding.
Standard: Learners use the language to investigate, explain and reflect on the relationship
between Practices and Perspectives of the cultures studied.
Standard: Learners use the language to investigate, explain and reflect on the relationship
between Products and Perspectives of the cultures studied.

Using the Can-Do Statements for Intercultural Communication for self-assessment, goal
setting, and planning for learning is only a first step on the journey to developing Intercultural
Communicative Competence (ICC).  Another crucial step is reflection.
Learners’ awareness and understanding of their own and others’ cultures grow with each new
intercultural encounter. They begin to experience how language proficiency can limit or
enhance their comfort level or success in these encounters. It takes reflection, however, to
process a depth of understanding that develops openness and promotes an examination of
values and attitudes, which Byram (1997, 2002), Deardorff (2006) and Fantini (2006) state, that
along with knowledge and skills, are the foundation of intercultural competence. Learning to
examine and understand behaviors provides a factual base from which stereotypes and
misconceptions can be explained and dispelled. To help develop a habit of self-reflection, it is
important for learners to pause and withhold judgment when learning about, analyzing, and
interpreting cultural products, practices and perspectives.
The primary focus of language education is to develop language proficiency, however, deep
reflection normally occurs in one’s native language. For this reason, the reflective activities are
designed with maximum use of the target language during instructional time and an option for
use of English at home for deeper reflection. The framework for reflective activities involves:
• an introductory in-class component in the target language;
• a deeper reflection outside of class in English, or, if the learner’s proficiency level allows, in the target language; and • a follow-up in-class target language component.
It is worth noting that the lack of sufficient language proficiency does not prevent the
internalization of cultural perspectives, it only hinders the ability to communicate them in the
target language. Learners internalize perspectives by reflecting on them and expressing them in
their native language, before they express those perspectives in the target language. In the
early stages of learning a language, learners develop an understanding of products and
practices, while internalizing the perspectives associated with them. Later, as their language

proficiency grows, learners are able to express and apply their knowledge of perspectives in intercultural contexts.
The development of cognitive and affective skills is a factor in intercultural reflection and
growth. Young learners need guided experience and can benefit from parental or caregiver
involvement at home. Observing, noticing, discovering, comparing, considering, thinking, and
higher level skills such as recommending, planning, hypothesizing and creating, are among the
cognitive acts associated with reflection and are vital to the evolution of attitudes. Affective
components such as receiving, feeling, imagining, valuing, appreciating, and preferring need
to be taken into account, as they, too, play an important role in the reflective process.
The accumulation of individual experiences and the quality of reflection on those experiences
pave the path to growth in Intercultural Communicative Competence. The world language
classroom provides a prime environment for nurturing these dispositions and skills, crucial to
whole child development. However, it should not be the sole responsibility of language
teachers to develop a learner’s ICC. Educators across content areas can collaborate and partner
with outside organizations to build a more extensive and integrated schoolwide ICC program.

Learning Target for Intercultural
Communication

• Investigate:
In my own and other cultures I can identify social practices such as greetings, introductions, leave-taking and thanking people.

• Interact:
I can greet and take leave from someone using polite rehearsed behaviors.

Intercultural Activities  (in class, in the target language)

• Learners watch video clips of various people meeting one another in different contexts – family members, friends, business associates.

- Ask learners to repeat what was said in the various interactions.
- Make a chart on the board, with columns for family members, friends, and business associates.
- Review the videos and ask the learners to guess which interactions were among family members, friends, and business associates.
- Point out that in some interactions, the people kiss the cheek of the person they are meeting (“Faire la bise”).
- Have learners take note that some people do 2 kisses, whereas some do 3 and some do 4.
Show a map of France and show Paris. State that in Provence it is 3 kisses and that in
southern France it is 4 kisses. The rest of France uses 2 kisses. State that in Paris people do 2 or 4 kisses.
- Give situations and ask learners what would they say. Would they “faire la bise?”

• Ask for  volunteers to use puppets or stuffed animals to demonstrate how people in the  target
culture greet/say good-bye to friends, family and teachers, based on what they saw in the videos.

• Learners think about how comfortable they would feel using the appropriate greeting in the target
culture.  As the teacher points to /says each line of the chart, learners give Thumbs UP, Thumbs
SIDEWAYS, or Thumbs DOWN.

Reflections  (at home, in English or the target language)

Learning Target for Intercultural
Communication

• Investigate:
In my own and other cultures I can identify locations to buy something and how cultures affect where people shop.

• Interact:
I can use rehearsed behaviors when shopping in a familiar type of store.

Intercultural Activities (in class, in the target language)

Following a lesson on where people shop in the target culture, learners are taken on a field trip to a local
Mexican tienda. Learners greet and interact with the owner and/or sales clerk(s) and in groups of 3 or 4
participate in a scavenger hunt to find certain items.  When learners locate the specific items,  they
photograph them and write down their names for a later presentation.

Reflections (at home, in English or the target language)

1. Write down in English what you noticed in the store beyond the products on the scavenger list:
e.g., what people wore, what language customers were speaking, if there was a TV and what
program was on, if hot food was sold, what products other than food were available, etc.

2. How was this store similar to or different from grocery stores where your family shops?

3. POLL: For each set of statements below, choose the one that best describes your reaction and say why you chose that statement.

A.      I felt very comfortable in the store and would like to go back.
I felt relatively comfortable in the store.
I felt uncomfortable in the store.

B.      I thought it was fun to discover new foods in the store and might like to try one.
I learned about some new foods that other people use. This will help me in class.
I like field trips, but I’m not really interested in learning about new foods.

C.      I felt very comfortable trying to talk with the owner/clerk(s).
I felt okay talking with the owner/clerk(s),
I felt uncomfortable talking with the owner/clerk(s).
I didn’t talk with the owner/clerk(s).
4.  What have you learned about yourself and others from thinking about this?

Closing Activity (in class, in the target language)

The next day, groups share their findings.  Teacher asks yes/no, either/or, and short answer questions in
the target language to help learners to think more deeply about the shared information.

• Did you see calendars for sale? Did they have photos of movies or religion on them? Why?
(Because religion is important to them? etc.)
• Was there a TV on in the store? What was playing: sporting event, singers, the news?
(If sports, which one? Why? Do they play ___ in ___?) etc.

Teacher and students chart the responses to the homework poll to show students the cross section of
reactions. Teacher brings in a food from the store for students to try.

|  |  |  |  |  | United States |  |  | Target Country/Culture |  |  | |  |  | With friends |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |  |  | With family |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | |  |  | With teachers |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| - Ask for volunteers to demonstrate how they greet/say good-bye to their friends; to their family |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| members; to their teachers. The teacher will fill out the USA column, with simple language or |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| images, using the target language to summarize what the learners did (e.g., high five, fist |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | bump, hug). |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| - Ask for volunteers to demonstrate how they think people in the target culture greet/say good- |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| bye to friends, family and teachers. The teacher fills out the second column, with simple target |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| language or images, summarizing what the learners did. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| • Show snippets of videos with native speakers greeting or saying good-bye to friends, family |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| and teachers. The teacher and learners then edit the second column together, based on the |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | videos. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| • Ask learners to think about how comfortable they would feel using the appropriate greeting in |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| the target culture. As the teacher points to /says each line of the chart, have learners give |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Thumbs Up, Thumbs Down, Thumbs Sideways, to indicate their comfort level. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
