## LEADING THE AGILE ORGANIZATION

Gone are the days of the heroic leader who bears the responsibility for solving the problems and directing the instruction in the daily life of the classroom. Top-down directives reinforce an environment of fear, distrust, and internal competitiveness that reduces collaboration and cooperation. They foster compliance instead of commitment, yet only genuine commitment can bring about the courage, imagination, patience, and persistence necessary in the agile organization. For those reasons, leadership must be distributed among diverse individuals and teams who share responsibility for creating the organization's future. The new work of instructional leaders in agile organizations is to design, construct, and

maintain the conditions for teachers to become highly capable in organizing, activating, and assessing learning in the classroom. This requires finding and seeking time for teachers to network and to meet together to plan, to share information about individual students, and to learn with and from each other. Agile administrators create and protect reasonable workloads and provide opportunities and time for teacher growth and learning.

Following are several suggested actions that agile leaders can take to create an agile organization:

- Develop a vision with your school staff and community-a vision that inspires the staff toward an important aim . The full attainment of an aim, like going east or becoming a culture of inquiry, is illusive. There is always more distance to travel. For example, the vision of a company called Menlo Innovations (Sheridan 2013) is 'Putting an end to suffering in the world.' The vision of the Institute for Habits of Mind is 'Educating for a more thought-full world.' Kiva, a nonprofit lending company, has as its mission statement: 'To connect people through lending for the sake of alleviating poverty.' The school's vision is the future into which teachers, students, and parents gaze.
- Hire great team members . They should not be a collection of individuals, hired only because of their knowledge of their content or discipline. Rather, include those who surprise you with their divergent thinking, who understand how to come together and function as a team, who are passionate about teaching and learning, who are great problem solvers, who know how to think creatively and flexibly, who are open to continuous learning, and who have a sense of humor (Sheridan 2013).
- Encourage autonomy, self-direction, and risk-taking . Then stand back and let the staff do their jobs. Give teachers more leeway to do things on their own-designing curriculum, gathering assessment data, resolving parent complaints, and handling student discipline.
- Expect the best from your faculty . Expectations, as shown in the 1992 Pygmalion study (Rosenthal and Jacobson), influence performance. Dopamine may have been at work, report Bill and Ochan Powell (2014), as the teacher's pleasure with a student's performance inspires even more effort and attainment. What we expect, we get, becoming a form of prediction influencing the efforts of others.
- Ask the 'why' of education (Sinek 2011). Teachers' goals are tightly connected with their perception of the purpose of education. When

teachers are evaluated and schools are judged based on student achievement test scores, it sets up a signal about what is valued as the main purpose: Today, in most schools, outcomes of education test scores are the most important outcome of a child's education. From a neuroscience perspective, the system couldn't be better designed to bring out the worst in everybody.

The practice of focusing on test scores reinforces an external locus of control. Teachers are inclined to blame parents, students, the administration, inadequate, materials, or the miserable system, so it wasn't their fault that their scores were low. If the goal is to raise test scores, the teacher might try to convince parents and administrators that he/she is already doing everything possible. This fight-or-flight reaction leads to low levels of effectiveness and high turnover rates.

However, when school policies demonstrate and assess why this school exists, that what is important to be achieved are the larger, long-range goals (e.g., maximizing students' potentials, developing such lifelong dispositions as loving learning, persisting, curiosity, thinking interdependently, and resilience), teachers feel inspired, challenged, and dedicated to the larger outcomes of schooling.

David Chojnacki, executive director of the Near East South Asia Schools, initiated a book study based on Costa and Kallick's (2014) book using social networking among leaders of several schools in the area. The group began exploring the development of mechanisms to measure the attainment of school missions, thus lifting the message of what is important above test scores to the harder to measure, and more important, aspects of schooling (Chojnacki 2014).

Helping teachers and parents understand the larger 'why' of education builds altruism; by helping students learn, teachers' intrinsic motivation rapidly expands. 'Our goals become my goals' (Lipton and Wellman 2013a, 63).

- Enlist the principal's support and modeling of Cognitive Coaching . Modeling behaviors has a transfer effect, especially when leaders do the modeling and leaders take time to describe their intentions and how they are using certain behaviors to support that intention. See Recommendation #2 in chapter 14.
- Create a climate of trust and pride (see chapter 6). Trust and pride spiral throughout the ecosystem of the agile school. That's because humans in social settings tend to pick up the mood and attitudes of others nearby. Hatfield, Cacioppo, and Rapson (1994) refer to this phenomenon as 'emotional contagion.' One person's emotions can

rapidly influence those of a group. When people see others act in a certain way, their mirror neurons are activated as if they had taken the actions themselves, even if they don't directly imitate that behavior.

Watching someone else in a situation can have an impact on the brain similar to that of experiencing it directly. The staff room, department meetings, and faculty meetings are perfect locations for viral behavior, transmitted through observation. As long as people see the difference it makes, a change in a few individuals' neural patterns can move rapidly through the school culture.

- Deliberately structure the organization for collaboration and interdependence . When the board of education of Crystal Lake school district in Illinois decided to build a new high school, thensuperintendent Joe Saban gathered the architects and staff together to dialogue about plans. They wanted to 'build in' the principles of Cognitive Coaching. Interdependence was a high priority. As a result, the teachers' and departments' separate offices were abandoned. Instead, one large room containing all the teachers' desks was designed. Teachers from all departments could observe, work, hear, plan with each other, and think trans-disciplinary. Lipton and Wellman (2013b) state, 'the most interesting mysteries lie at the intersection of minds' (62). For example, at Menlo Innovations, computers are purposely shared by two employees, causing them to collaborate and build capacity of flexibility. Furthermore, computers are not standardized. Rather there is intentionally a mix of operating systems, speed, memory configuration, and so on. Furthermore, each week the pairs switch (Sheridan 2013)!
- Support the use of Cognitive Coaching skills in informal settings, parent conferences, with students, and in meetings . This is in line with Recommendation #10 in chapter 14 and is a significant indication of culture change.
- Develop an atmosphere of continuous learning and knowledge growth . Bob Garmston, in 'Developing Smart Groups' (Costa and O'Leary 2013, 78-80), identifies five actions leaders can take to develop smarter groups:
- 1.  Construct diverse groups. When members of a group have diverse sets of mental tools, the process of group decision making is less likely to get stuck on less-than-optimal solutions and is more likely to result in superior ways of doing things.
- 2.  Include members with higher social sensitivity. Groups are more productive when they include members who not only listen well

- but also are alert and respond to other members' body language, facial expressions, and voice intonations.
- 3.  Develop skills in the ways groups talk. The group's ability to create a connectedness among its members and be open to creativity, to respect and honor the individual parts while expecting a higher outcome from the whole, is essential to the ability of the group to work well. Groups whose members align their efforts rather than pursue their own agendas for individual status are able to create higher collective intelligence and produce better outcomes.
- 4.  Promote positivity in the workplace. In groups, the amount of positivity influences the amount of inquiry and the ratio at which people talk about others rather than themselves. The more positivity in a group, the higher the achievement on measurable goals.
- 5.  Reflect on experience. Smart groups see encounters as learning opportunities. They use both formal and informal means of assessing what is working and what needs refinement. Reflection is the key to growth. Effective teams are conscious of what makes them effective. They possess knowledge about being a productive group or the persons in charge of districts, schools, grade-level teams, or departments are well advised to invest in the kinds of group development activities in which groups are encouraged to self-reflect, learn from their experiences, and modify their practices. Reflection, not repetition, is the key to growth.

Autonomy makes such a difference because micromanagement, the opposite of autonomy, puts people in a threatened state. A reduction in autonomy is experienced by the brain in much the same way as a physical attack. This fight-or-flight reaction is triggered when a perceived threat activates the amygdala, the release of hormones, and other autonomic activity that makes people reactive. They are now primed to respond quickly and emotionally. When this fight-or-flight reaction kicks in, even if there is no visible response, productivity falls and the quality of decisions is diminished. When the neural circuits for being reactive drive behavior, some other neural circuits associated with executive thinking, (e.g., controlling oneself, paying attention, innovating, planning, and problem solving) become less active.

By giving staff members genuine autonomy, and groups collective autonomy, a school can reduce the frequency, duration, and intensity of this threat state. The perception of increased choice in itself activates reward-related circuits in the brain, making people feel more at ease. Over time, sustained lack of autonomy is an ongoing source of stress, which by itself can habitually lead the brain to be more reactive than reflective. Sustained stress can also decrease the performance of important learning and memory brain circuits, as well as the performance

of the prefrontal cortex, which is so important for reflection.

If school leaders try to enforce strict rules that make teachers feel micromanaged, the physiological state associated with the fight-or-flight reaction would probably lead to the opposite outcome (Newton and Davis 2014).

Schools are intended to produce learning-that goes not only for students but also for teachers and administrators. Leaders, therefore, are intent on developing teachers' craftsmanship-deepening teacher knowledge not only about the disciplines being taught but also developing expertise in their work, using knowledge about effective teaching, learning about how students learn, differences in learning styles, and so on (see chapters 8 and 9).

Much is being written about learning for careers, for college, and for success in life (Wagner 2008; Conley 2010; U. S. Department of Education, Office of Educational Technology 2013; Mansilla and Jackson 2011; Costa and Kallick 2015). These authors identify needed skills, knowledge, and dispositions for the uncertain future that students face today. Such learnings include:

Problem solving and critical thinking

Collaboration across networks and leading by influence

Agility and adaptability

Initiative and entrepreneurship

Effective written and oral communication

Accessing and analyzing information

Curiosity and imagination

Open-mindedness

Inquisitiveness

Analyzing the credibility and relevance of sources

Reasoning, argumentation, and explaining proof and point of view

Comparing, contrasting ideas, analyzing, and interpreting competing or conflicting evidence

Knowing how to arrive at an accurate answer

Finding many ways to solve problems

Persistence

Cultivating these dispositions may require reframing teaching and learning (Costa and Kallick 2014). Teachers and leaders, therefore, must find ways of organizing the curriculum, assessment, and the workplace to better understand and incorporate these new educational outcomes for

tomorrow's citizens. This will require deepening teacher knowledge, developing expertise to do the work, using knowledge about effective teaching, teacher thinking, and school organization to make high-quality decisions.

In the typical high school, there are towers of knowledge. These silos create territories, deter transdisciplinary learning, and isolate teachers. Certain disciplines are perceived to have more worth than others. Through credit requirements; time allotments; allocation of resources; national, state, and local mandates; standards; testing; and so forth, schools send covert messages to students and the community concerning which subjects are of greater worth. This fractionalization across departments results in incongruent goals among the different people involved. We need, therefore, to put together teams of teachers who have been artificially separated by departments and to redefine their task from teaching their isolated content to instead develop multiple intellectual capacities of students. Peter Senge (2006) contends that we are all natural systems thinkers and the findings in cognitive research are compatible and supportive of the need to move from individual to collective intelligence, from disciplines to themes, from independence to relationships.

One Michigan school superintendent stated:

I wouldn't jump into this if I didn't what to change in our district. Don't take coaching as your model if you're not willing to change, because it is going to happen. I think that an important piece too is that we had PLCs [professional learning communities]-some were functioning better than others, and some people had more training than others, but that's where we started. We had that in place, and we had Habits of Mind being implemented in our classrooms. Then we started the Adaptive Schools work. These are all the concepts, skills, and strategies we need to run the PLCs that we started with. It's very much a cycle with so many connections.
