## Appendix K Polarity Management: Using Conflict as a Resource

## Carolyn McKanders

Polarities  are  chronic,  ongoing  tensions that  are  inherent  in  individual  and  organizational  systems. They are unavoidable and unsolvable, they have two or more right answers that are interdependent, and they must be managed with both-and thinking.

Examples of polarities are the following:

- · Individual rubrics and schoolwide rubrics
- · Tight and loose structures
- · Autonomy and collaboration
- · Team and individual
- · Home and work

Polarity  Management™  is  a  model  that  involves a set of principles and tools for dealing with all polarities in life.

Betty  Achinstein  (2002),  writing  about conflict among school teachers, notes that collaboration and consensus-critical elements in building  community-actually  generate  conflict. She found that by airing diverse perspectives  in  a  collective  setting  and  encouraging teachers to debate what and how to do schooling,  schools  generate  new  conflicts  because of  their  commitment  to  creating  collaborative communities.

In  what  ways  might  conflict  represent  a polarity?

Conflict  is  a  manifestation  of  interdependence,  and  tensions  between  independence and  interdependence  are  ever  present.  This inherent tension can be a source of productive energy for groups, or it can lead to unproductive  interactions  and  create  an  energy  drain. Groups  that  use  tension  productively  distinguish between affective and cognitive conflict.

Affective  conflict  is  personalized  conflict  and is detrimental to group energy and productivity. Cognitive conflict is conflict over ideas and approaches, and it is a hallmark of high-performing  groups.  Groups  that  engage  in  cognitive conflict critically examine ideas to sort out the best  practices  for  student  learning.  Thus  conflict becomes a resource (Amason, Thompson, Hochwarter, &amp; Harrison, 1995).

Achinstein  (2002)  quotes  John  Gardner's explanation of conflict, diversity, and community.  Gardner  states  that  diversity  is  not  good simply because it implies breadth of tolerance and  sympathy.  A  community  of  diverse  elements has a greater capacity to adapt and renew itself  in  a  swiftly  changing  world.  To  keep a  balance  between  diversity  and  wholeness, com- munities must apply structures to reduce polarization,  to  foster  communication  among diverse  groups,  and  to  create  mechanisms  for conflict mediation.

Barry Johnson (1996) offers a set of principles, tools, and structures for identifying and utilizing  the  natural  tensions  that  are  created as individuals and organizations attempt to engage in cognitive conflict. These tensions often manifest as polarities: ongoing, chronic issues that  are  unavoidable  and  unsolvable.  Johnson asserts  that  when  groups  can  distinguish  between a problem to solve and a polarity to manage and can effectively deal with both, they are able to celebrate and capitalize on diversity and convert resistance to change to a resource for sustainable strength and adaptivity.

Leaders,  teams,  and  organizations  must ask  this  fundamental  question  when  they  are faced  with  a  challenge:  Is  this  a  problem  to

solve, or is it an ongoing polarity that we must manage well? Problems to solve are those that have one right answer or two or more right answers that are independent. For example: 'How do you spell?' or 'What should we include in our parent survey?'

In  contrast,  polarities  to  be  managed  are sets  of  opposites  that  can't  function  well  independently;  they  require  both-and  thinking. Because the two sides of a polarity are interdependent, you cannot choose one as a solution and neglect the other. The objective of managing polarities is to get the best of both opposites while avoiding the limits or downside of each. Johnson  (1996)  uses  breathing  as  a  metaphor for all polarities. You cannot solve the inhaleexhale polarity by choosing to either inhale or exhale. You manage it by getting the benefits of each while appreciating the limits of each. It's not a static situation. It's a process, an ongoing flow of shifting emphasis from one to the other and back again. Managing this polarity requires choosing both inhaling and exhaling.

Some examples of polarities to manage are work and home, individual and team, stability and  change,  independence  and  interdependence, and planning and action.

A central premise of the adaptive school work  is  that  leaders  must  recognize  that schools are living paradoxes (i.e., polarities), operating simultaneously as 'thing' and 'energy'  models-dynamic  systems  of  energy and information.

The principles and tools of Polarity Management  TM  support  collaborative  communities  in  accessing  the  richness  of  capitalizing on diversity and engaging cognitive conflict to liberate group energy and productivity.

## The Polarity Map

The  polarity  map  is  a  tool  for  mapping paradoxes  or  dilemmas,  which  we  refer  to  as polarities.  The  map  provides  a  structure  for making  invisible  tensions  visible  and  for  addressing  the  whole  polarity  picture.  Once  the map  is  completed  through  collaborative  con- versation, it provides a focus for dialogue from diverse perspectives.

The polarity map is a square divided into four  quadrants.  The  right  and  left  halves  are called poles. The upper part of each pole contains  the  positive  results  of  focusing  on  that pole, referred to as its upside. The lower part of  each  pole  contains  the  negative  results  of focusing on that pole to the neglect of the other pole and is called the downside. Creating and discovering the content of all four quadrants is essential for maximum effectiveness in managing a polarity.

## Guidelines for Creating a Polarity Map

Define the challenge. Identify an ongoing, chronic issue (a) within your sphere of influence (b) that has eluded problem-solving and (c) that has to be addressed in the next 2 months.

Identify  a  key  polarity. A  polarity  differs from a problem in the following ways: (a) The issue  continues  over  time,  (b)  there  are  two interdependent  alternatives,  (c)  you  need  to have the positive aspects of each of the alternatives, and (d) developing one alternative to the neglect of the other will eventually undermine your  productivity.  Ask  the  following  probing questions:

- 1. In  what  ways  do  you  continue  to  experience this issue over time?
- 2. In  what  ways  are  there  two  alternatives that  are  interdependent?  This  means  that you can focus on only one pole for so long be- fore you are required to focus on the other pole.
- 3. What is the necessity of having the upsides of both poles over time?
- 4. To what extent will focusing on one upside to  the  neglect  of  the  other  eventually  undermine your productivity?

Explore  the  issues,  opportunities,  and  polarities.  Facilitate  a  conversation  that  is  designed to create an objective description of the issues,

opportunities,  and  polarities  that  are  present. The  skills  of  dialogue  (chapter  5)  and  the norms of collaboration (chapter 4) are essential to this goal. Presume that all ideas are respected and  important.  Paraphrasing  (chapter  4)  is  a primary tool in these conversations.

Well-crafted  paraphrases  communicate  I am  trying  to  understand  you,  and  therefore  I value  what  you  have  to  say'  and  establish  a relation- ship between people and ideas.

Here  is  an  example. A  high  school  leadership  team  that  was  conversing  about  staff resistance  to  interdepartmental  collaboration concluded that there were merits to some staff members' advocacy of autonomy. During this conversation the facilitator offered the following paraphrases:

- · 'Sam,  you  believe  the  complaints  we're getting are data worth examining.'
- · 'A  value  that  we  all  hold  is  that  all  departments  working  together  will  produce better results for all students.'
- · 'On the one hand, we want teaming, and on the other hand, we see the necessity for individual action.'
- · 'It sounds as if we want to honor autonomy in two ways, individuals and departments.'

The  facilitator provided  a  'abstracting paraphrase'  (chapter  4)  to  paraphrase  the  polarity: 'Let me see if I can sum this up. We're wondering  how  we  might  collaborate  while also honoring individual autonomy.'

In this example the high school leadership team  decided  to  create  a  collaboration-autonomy  polarity  map.  Later  they  repeated  this mapping process with the staff.

Agree on names for the poles. The names should  be  value-neutral  and  be  agreed  on  by the group.

Write  the  pole  names  on  the  map.  The polarity map is created on chart paper so that group members can see the map as it unfolds.

Brainstorm the content for each quadrant. Aim to write four to eight entries in each quad-

rant.  Collect  all  ideas  from  the  participants with-  out  judgment,  criticism,  or  questions. Identify both upsides, asking, 'What are some positives  results  or  upsides  of  focusing  on?' Then  identify  both  downsides,  asking,  'What are the negatives of focusing on to the neglect of the other pole?' This order can be modified to meet individual and group needs. For example,  a  group  that  values  stability  over  change might need to brainstorm the upside of stability and the downside of change before being ready to move to mapping the upside of change. Oppositional values and fears should be identified and respected as important.

Agree  on  a  higher  purpose  and  a  deeper fear. Agreeing on a higher purpose and a deeper fear integrates  oppositional  views  and  provides a reason to manage the tension between them. The higher purpose is the major benefit of managing the polarity well, and the deeper fear is the major negative result of not managing the polarity well. Again, use dialogue and the norms of collaboration.

The 'abstracting paraphrase' is invaluable for integrating seemingly competing values and views,  elevating  conversations  to  a  common higher purpose. For example, a middle school staff dialogue about student discipline became quite emotional, with members giving example after  example  of  student  misbehavior.  Some staff  members  insisted  that  more  suspensions and  rules  were  necessary;  others  challenged this  idea,  stating  that  the  students  would  just become resentful, passive-aggressive, and less willing to behave. They argued that their role was  to  support  students  in  learning  life  skills for controlling themselves.

The chairman of the committee, who was acting as the facilitator, offered a 'abstracting paraphrase':  'Some  of  us  feel  strongly  about tightening the rules to get order, whereas some believe  that  students  might  need  to  be  taught how to use their freedom to self- regulate. It is apparent that a goal we all hold is how to support the students in exhibiting more productive behavior.'

After  additional  conversation,  the  group agreed  to  map  the  structure-freedom  polarity,  coming  to  the  conclusion  that  both  were necessary  to  encourage  students'  productive behavior.

Dialogue  about  the  completed  polarity map and explore ways to maximize the upside of  each  pole  and  minimize  the  downside  of each pole.

## Understanding How Polarities Work

A polarity map appears as a static set of ideas in four labeled quadrants: positives and values in the upside of each pole, and negatives  and  concerns  in  the  downside  of  each pole. In fact, there is a predictable movement through  a  polarity  situation,  and  we  can  envision it with the polarity map. As polarities work,  we  can  predict  people's  movement from one pole to the other as they (a) anticipate or experience the downside of one pole, from which they want to move away, and (b) are  attracted  to  the  up-  sides  of  the  opposite pole,  which  they  want  to  move  toward.  The downside of the pole they want to leave often becomes identified as the problem.

The upside of the opposite pole be- comes identified  as  the  solution.  However,  for  a  polarity  to  be  well  managed,  one  must  remain in the upside of both poles while avoiding the limitations of the downsides of both poles. The natural energy flow of a well-managed polarity is  an  infinity  loop,  with  only  a  slight  dip  into the lower quadrants.

## Facilitating Polarity Mapping

Facilitation  provides  the  focusing,  directing, and organizing features that are necessary for  adult  conversations  to  produce  results  for students.  Facilitators  manage  group  energy through  attention  to  three  areas:  (a)  helping members in active participation, and (c) focusing group attention.

Well-facilitated  conversations  around  polarities  and  other  diverse  viewpoints  produce the cognitive conflict and psychological safety that  is  necessary  for  highly  productive  dialogues that foster shared meanings, values and goals, and collective agreements.

The  following  are  some  principles  and strategies  that  facilitators  may  use  to  support these conversations:

- · Grounding. This is an opening inclusion activity  that  is  used  when  groups  come together  for  important  or  difficult  work. Grounding (a) sets a norm for respectful listening, (b) brings people to the present, (c) brings everyone's voice into the room in  a  nonconfrontational way, (d) encourages people to connect with one another, (e)  allows  for  expression  of  hopes  and apprehensions,  (f)  values  thinking  and feeling, and (g) brings hidden agendas to the surface.
- · Greeting  Circle.  This  is  another  grounding  activity  in  which  each  person  greets and is greeted by another. In this process, everyone  confronts  the  natural  tension about  greeting  others.  When  participants are  asked  how  they  felt  and  what  they learned, productive energy is released into the room.
- · Address One Topic at a Time. There is a limit to what individuals and groups can attend to in the moment. When more than one  topic  is  being  discussed,  the  group lacks focus, and confusion reigns. Natural  tensions  are  present  when  discussing polarities. Keeping the group focused on one topic and/or polarity at a time honors both the  ideas  and  those  who  are  generating them.

Group processes are vehicles for collective thinking. To brainstorm, to clarify, to analyze, and to evaluate require different mental operations. In order to use one process at a time, the facilitator must make sure that all group mem- bers know what the process is, how it works, and why it is being used.

## Facilitating Conversation About a Completed Polarity Map

Once  a  group  has  completed  mapping  a polarity on chart paper, a facilitated conversation offers  group  members  the  opportunity  to  view and explore the dilemma as a whole and from multiple  perspectives.  Furthermore,  the  group can  now  generate  strategies  for  staying  in  the upsides of both poles while avoiding the downsides. The norm of putting inquiry first supports the facilitator and the group members' resourcefulness and success in these conversations.

Here are some sample questions:

- · As you reflect  on  our  collective  wisdom, what new learning and insights are emerging for you?
- · Given  our  expanded  perspective,  what might be some benefits for managing this polarity well?
- · What might be some higher purposes that will benefit all of our students?
- · What might be some of our deepest fears if we fail to manage this polarity well?
- · As we reflect on phrases in each quadrant, what might be some assumptions, values, or beliefs that are present?
- · Given our desire to stay in the upsides of both poles, what are some strategies?
- · What are some indicators that will tell us we are moving to the downside of a pole? Who will remind us, and how?
- · What  seems  most  important  to  all  of  us here?
- · What might be some impacts of collaboratively mapping a polarity?
- · What are your hunches about other polarities that might exist in this situation?
- · How might we apply this to other areas of our work?

## Tips for Using Polarity Maps

- · Remember  that  to  pursue  the  benefits  of one pole, you must also pursue the benefits of the other pole. The solution is not static.
- · One possibility is to identify the indicators for  each  pole,  which  will  let  you  know when you are  experiencing  its  downside.
- Putting feedback mechanisms in place aids in managing the polarity. (Example: Using conversation maps and tools)
- · Listen deeply and facilitate dialogue, especially with naysayers.
- · Brainstorm  strategies  for  staying  in  the upsides of both poles.
