Holographic-take 1 part of picture, have whole.\n\nFractal geometry is used to mathematically model the tracks and marks left by the passage of activity. The fracture marks left in the earth by an earthquake or a winding coastline scored by the turbulence of ocean wind and waves are examples of fractals in the natural world. When a dynamic thunderstorm self-organizes into a tornado, it leaves behind a fractal shape of its destruction.\n\nfocuses on broken, wrinkled and uneven shapes.\n\nused to mathematically model the tracks and marks left by the passage of activity.\n\nClassrooms, schools and districts display fractal scaling in their values, patterns of interaction and dispositions.\n\nOur intention is to have collaboration as a fractal in the system. So what's happening in the classroom is reflected in what's happening in the school, in the district, and even the boardroom.\n\nTrainers might include examples, such as:\n\nA teacher provides an alternative to fluorescent lighting in her classroom. Other teacher began the same practice noting positive impact on student energy.\n\nTwo teachers determined to speak to each other with obvious courtesy in the hallway as students are passing. Students began to imitate the two teachers and these language patterns began to spread throughout the school.\n\nMODEL with PAG/PAU with visual paragraph\n\nFractal theme --&gt; similar details on many different scales --&gt; gain new perspectives metaphor -&gt; collaboration looks like in systems\n\nsit with friends.  invest in condos. nest.\n\nmove --&gt; bigger perspective / greater sense of whole group 'we'ness move + choice (why did they put me with this group?)

If anyone does not have a partner, explain the 'land of the temporarily disconnected' (or 'land of the lost' or 'singles bar') and choosing a pair to become a trio.\n\ntake what you will need until break\n\n## soft move\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nJoin nautilus partner and share personal learning goal.\n\n## What?\n\nStation-Naming\n\n## Why?\n\nRemind participants where we are on the agenda.\n\nComes from tradition of conductors on trains announcing the next stops\n\n## How?\n\nUse charted agenda, or slide.\n\nWhat: what mean by adaptive\n\nWhy: central concept / organizing principle of the AS work.\n\nTo use tools, must understand whole.\n\nfoundation for all that follows\n\nHow:  balance of 4 days:  how become adaptive\n\nBeing adaptive -- 3 elements\n\nWhat is an adaptive school?\n\nWhy does that matter?\n\nHow are you adaptive--moment to moment and over time?\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nWHAT?\n\nWe'll describe what we mean by adaptive and explore what it is, why it is so important to your schools and how-in a reader's digest form--you can achieve it. The balance of the workshop is more about how to become adaptive.\n\n## WHY?\n\nAdaptivity is the organizing principle of the Adaptive Schools work. To effectively use the tools, one must understand the whole. This is the foundation for all that follows.\n\n## HOW?\n\n## Inductive process\n\n10-2 Trainer Input using the slides, followed by Pairs Process.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nWe will be start by exploring the 'What?' and looking at a variety of examples that demonstrate the significance of identity changes.\n\ninductive process of constructing your understanding of adaptive\n\nexamples:  significance of identity changes\n\nWe'll begin by looking at librarians who have transitioned from being the providers of resources to becoming the developers of others' resources.\n\nFollow this language pattern for all the examples.\n\nTrainers may wish to add pertinent local examples. In doing so, follow the To/From pattern.\n\n## Car Makers\n\nFrom\n\nPassenger Driven\n\nGasoline Powered\n\nTo\n\nSelf-Driving Electric Powered\n\n\u00a92025Adaptive Schools Seminars\n\nmarketing. \"Our vision is to be earth's most customer centric company; to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online.'\n\n1995 Amazon.com sold first book For your own dinner party trivia, Douglas Hofstadter's Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought don't know first customer wondered if Amazon could make any money No profit until the fourth quarter of 2001: $5 million, on revenues of trillions?

Monarch butterflies are good examples of an adapted species. They lay their eggs only on milkweed plants. When the larvae hatch they feed on milkweed leaves, growing until it is time to spin a chrysalis that is attached to the milkweed plant. The larvae metamorphose into adult butterflies and the cycle repeats. Without milkweed, the monarchs are in danger.\n\nShow Adapted definition slide.\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nAdapted means to have evolved through specialization to fit specific conditions within tightly defined boundaries.\n\nThe Monarch butterfly is a premiere example.\n\nAdaptive / nonlinear:  A + B could give R+M+O or P+I+J\n\n## 'ive'  tending to\n\nExamples:  Deer, coyote, raccoon, bobcat etc. are counter-examples of species thriving even with loss of habitat\n\n2 nd order, relational approaches --&gt; messy!!\n\ntransformative change (changes hearts / minds) of organization--&gt;active inquiry and collaboration\n\nShow slide of deer in backyard for an example.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nDeer, coyote, and raccoons serve as familiar counter-examples of species thriving even with loss of habitat. In many parts of the country housing development spreads, yet animals such as these survive, becoming adaptive to their environments.\n\nWHAT:  Definition of adaptive.\n\n## Form\n\n1 -ways structure our organizations 2 -ways do our work B's-bells, buses, beans, behinds, books\n\nTo change form-&gt;need to clarify identity\n\nShow slide with definition of Adaptive\n\n***not strongest of species that survive, nor most intelligent, but one most responsive to change\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nWhen we use the word 'form,' we mean the ways we structure our organizations and how, where, and when we do our work. Examples include schedules, processes, and sequences that have become habitual.\n\nWhen we clarify our identity-from a hospital healing the sick to a hospital promoting health-we break habits and behave differently.\n\nKeep doing what always done, keep getting what already got definition of insanity-knowing don't like results, but keep doing things-same expecting different things\n\nNew challenges require new / increasingly flexible forms\n\n***not strongest of species that survive, nor most intelligent, but one most responsive to change\n\nPause and have partners process understanding of adapted vs. adaptive.\n\nShow Evolution of the Desk video clip\n\nTHE WHY OF ADAPTIVITY: DRIVING FORCES WHAT?\n\nAcknowledging the forces in our environment driving schools to be adaptive\n\nSupport organizations in being proactive, rather than reactive\n\nWHY?

These questions support clarity in identity and the breaking of patterns, leading to greater adaptivity.\n\n## HOW?\n\nTrainer gives short input on each question with examples; trainer may add other appropriate examples.\n\nWhy identity important?  Holds everything.\n\nIdentity is biggest container-inside are beliefs, values, assumptions, perceptions, capabilities, behaviors\n\n## Who believe are dictates actions\n\nLecturer / Guide-practices will be different\n\nWhat believe about us?
