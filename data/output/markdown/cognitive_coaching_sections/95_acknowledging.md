## Acknowledging

Acknowledging without making judgments is a response that simply receives and recognizes what the speaker says without making any value judgments. It communicates that the other person's ideas have been heard. The following are examples of this type of response:

- Verbal: 'Um-hmm,' 'That's one possibility,' 'Could be'
- Nonverbal: Nodding the head
