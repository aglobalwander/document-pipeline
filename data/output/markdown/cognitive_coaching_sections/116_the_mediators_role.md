## THE MEDIATOR'S ROLE

Mediators influence the intensity, flow, directionality, importance, excitement, and impact of information coming to the person being coached. According to Feuerstein, the mediated learning experience transforms the information that impinges on a learner and enters his repertoire in a totally different way. Rather than give advice to or solve problems for another person, a mediator helps the colleague to analyze a problem and develop his/her own problem-solving strategies.

A mediator helps a colleague to set up strategies for self-monitoring during the problem-solving process. Acting as a sounding board, a skilled mediator helps another person become more self-directed with learning. A mediator also:

- Is alert to the mediational moment-usually when a colleague is faced with a complex task, dilemma, discrepancy, or conflict. Often, the colleague exhibits tension and anxiety, the resolution of which is not immediately apparent.

- Facilitates mental processes for others as they solve their own problems, make their own decisions, and generate their own creative capacities.
- Invites the colleague to reflect on and learn from the problem-solving process to find applications in future problem situations.
- Helps others to become continuous learners and self-mediators
- Maintains faith in the human capacity for continued intellectual, social, and emotional growth.
- Possesses a belief in his or her own capacity to serve as an empowering catalyst for others' growth.
