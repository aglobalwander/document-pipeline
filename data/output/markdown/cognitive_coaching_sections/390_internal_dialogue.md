| What are my feelings toward this teacher? What are histher strengths and talents? How well is helshe titted for this assignment?                    | Michael is a recent hire  Although he's successfully taught sixth in an elementary school for several years, this is his first year at a middle school. He changed because he wanted to try teaching in his subject area (social studies) rather than responsible for all the subjects at the elementary level. He is enthusiastic and learner centered. It is yet to be seen if this is the best grade-level fit for him . grade being                                            |

Because my role as an administrator is also to evaluate Michael, must be clear about my intentions with him at this time. This is not an evaluative observation; it is a and learning opportunity. Vm not sure he distinguishes betwveen the two must be sure to let him knowv the difference and that his evaluation will be at a later date. Come to think of it, should not even use the word "evaluation in our conversalion growth vet |
