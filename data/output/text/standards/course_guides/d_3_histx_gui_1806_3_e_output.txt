The Diploma Programme
The Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous pre-university programme designed for students in the 16 to 19
age range. It is a broad-based two-year programme that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable
and inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to
develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
Programme model
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core (see figure 1). It encourages the
concurrent study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study two modern languages (or a modern
language and a classical language), a humanities or social science subject, a science subject, mathematics
and one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the DP a demanding course
of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance. In each of the academic areas
students have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can choose subjects that particularly
interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.

History guide 3
Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they can, instead
of an arts subject, choose two subjects from another area. Normally, three subjects (and not more than
four) are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends
240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than at SL.
At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of
the course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some element of coursework assessed by teachers.
The core of the Diploma Programme model
All DP students participate in the three course elements that make up the core of the model.
Theory of knowledge (TOK) is a course that is fundamentally about critical thinking and inquiry into the
process of knowing rather than about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines the
nature of knowledge and how we know what we claim to know. It does this by encouraging students to
analyse knowledge claims and explore questions about the construction of knowledge. The task of TOK is to
emphasize connections between areas of shared knowledge and link them to personal knowledge in such a
way that an individual becomes more aware of his or her own perspectives and how they might differ from others.
Creativity, activity, service (CAS) is at the heart of the DP. CAS enables students to live out the IB learner
profile in real and practical ways, to grow as unique individuals and to recognize their role in relation
to others. Students develop skills, attitudes and dispositions through a variety of individual and group
experiences that provides students with opportunities to explore their interests and express their passions,
personalities and perspectives. CAS complements a challenging academic programme in a holistic way,
providing opportunities for self-determination, collaboration, accomplishment and enjoyment. The three strands of CAS are given below.
Creativity—exploring and extending ideas leading to an original or interpretive product or performance
Activity—physical exertion contributing to a healthy lifestyle
Service—collaborative and reciprocal engagement with the community in response to an authentic need
The extended essay, including the world studies extended essay, offers the opportunity for IB students to
investigate a topic of special interest, in the form of a 4,000-word piece of independent research. The area of
research undertaken is chosen from one of the students’ six DP subjects, or in the case of the interdisciplinary
world studies essay, two subjects, and acquaints them with the independent research and writing skills
expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally presented, structured writing, in which ideas
and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent manner, appropriate to the subject or subjects
chosen. It is intended to promote high-level research and writing skills, intellectual discovery and creativity.
An authentic learning experience, it provides students with an opportunity to engage in personal research
on a topic of choice, under the guidance of a supervisor.

Approaches to teaching and learning
Approaches to teaching and learning across the DP refers to deliberate strategies, skills and attitudes that
permeate the teaching and learning environment. These approaches and tools, intrinsically linked with the
learner profile attributes, enhance student learning and assist student preparation for the DP assessment
and beyond. The aims of approaches to teaching and learning in the DP are to:
•
empower teachers as teachers of learners as well as teachers of content •
empower teachers to create clearer strategies for facilitating learning experiences in which students
are more meaningfully engaged in structured inquiry and greater critical and creative thinking •
promote both the aims of individual subjects (making them more than course aspirations) and linking
previously isolated knowledge (concurrency of learning) •
encourage students to develop an explicit variety of skills that will equip them to continue to be
actively engaged in learning after they leave school, and to help them not only obtain university
admission through better grades but also prepare for success during tertiary education and beyond •
enhance further the coherence and relevance of the students’ DP experience •
allow schools to identify the distinctive nature of a DP education, with its blend of idealism and practicality.
The five approaches to learning (developing thinking skills, social skills, communication skills, self management skills and research skills) along with the six approaches to teaching (teaching that is inquiry based, conceptually focused, contextualized, collaborative, differentiated and informed by assessment)
encompass the key values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy.
Academic honesty
Academic honesty in the DP is a set of values and behaviours informed by the attributes of the learner
profile. In teaching, learning and assessment, academic honesty serves to promote personal integrity,
engender respect for the integrity of others and their work, and ensure that all students have an equal
opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquire during their studies.
All coursework—including work submitted for assessment—is to be authentic, based on the student’s
individual and original ideas with the ideas and work of others fully acknowledged. Assessment tasks that
require teachers to provide guidance to students or that require students to work collaboratively must be
completed in full compliance with the detailed guidelines provided by the IB for the relevant subjects.
For further information on academic honesty in the IB and the DP, please consult the IB publications
Academic honesty in the IB educational context, The Diploma Programme: From principles into practice and
General regulations: Diploma Programme. Specific information regarding academic honesty as it pertains to
external and internal assessment components of the DP history course can be found in this guide.
Learning diversity and learning support requirements
Schools must ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided to
candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Candidates with
assessment access requirements and Learning diversity in the International Baccalaureate programmes:
Special educational needs within the International Baccalaureate programmes.

History guide 5
Nature of the subject
History is a dynamic, contested, evidence-based discipline that involves an exciting engagement with the
past. It is a rigorous intellectual discipline, focused around key historical concepts such as change, causation and significance.
History is an exploratory subject that fosters a sense of inquiry. It is also an interpretive discipline, allowing
opportunity for engagement with multiple perspectives and a plurality of opinions. Studying history
develops an understanding of the past, which leads to a deeper understanding of the nature of humans and of the world today.
The IB Diploma Programme (DP) history course is a world history course based on a comparative and multi perspective approach to history. It involves the study of a variety of types of history, including political,
economic, social and cultural, and provides a balance of structure and flexibility. The course emphasizes the
importance of encouraging students to think historically and to develop historical skills as well as gaining
factual knowledge. It puts a premium on developing the skills of critical thinking, and on developing an
understanding of multiple interpretations of history. In this way, the course involves a challenging and demanding critical exploration of the past.
There are six key concepts that have particular prominence throughout the DP history course.
Change
Perspectives
Consequence
Significance
Causation
Continuity
Key concepts

More information and guidance on these six concepts can be found in the “Key concepts for DP history
unpacked” section of this guide, and also in the History teacher support material.
Introduction

Nature of the subject
History guide 6
History and international-mindedness
... an education for international-mindedness; an education designed to break
down the barriers of race, religion and class; an education that extolled the
benefits of cultural diversity; above all else, an education for peace.
(George Walker 2011: 19)
International-mindedness is an umbrella term through which the IB defines the goal of international
education, and which is exemplified by the emphasis in all IB programmes on promoting global
engagement, multilingualism and intercultural understanding.
The DP history course is designed in such a way as to explicitly reinforce the emphasis on the development
of international-mindedness. For example, one of the key concepts that weaves throughout the course
is perspectives, and, more specifically, an emphasis on encouraging students to appreciate multiple
perspectives. In addition, all students are required to study case studies and examples from different regions
of the world, with comparison of such examples helping to ensure that the course adopts a transnational
perspective. Teachers also have a great deal of freedom to choose relevant examples to explore with
their students, helping to ensure that the course appropriately meets their students’ needs and interests regardless of their location or context.
Throughout the DP history course, students have the opportunity to explore historical events that
have played a key role in shaping the world today, deepening their understanding of the complex and
interconnected nature of past and present events. For example, students explore historical examples of
many of the global challenges facing the world today, such as conflict, rights and governance. This helps
to meet one of the central aims of the course—to increase students’ understanding of themselves and of
contemporary society by encouraging reflection on the past.
Distinction between SL and HL
Students at standard level (SL) and higher level (HL) are presented with a syllabus that has a common core
consisting of prescribed subjects and topics in world history. In addition, students at HL are also required to
undertake an in-depth study of three sections from one of the HL regional options. While many of the skills
of studying history are common to both SL and HL, the difference in recommended teaching hours at SL
and HL signals a clear distinction between the demands made on students, with the greater depth of study required for HL.
The difference between the history course at SL and the course at HL can be summarized as follows.

History and the core
As with all DP courses, the history course should both support, and be supported by, the three elements of the DP core.
History and the extended essay
History is one of the most popular subject choices for DP students’ extended essays. The research skills
developed by completing an extended essay in history benefit students not only in their history course
and other DP subjects, but are also excellent preparation for study beyond the DP. Examples of topics for
extended essays recently submitted in history include the following.
•
To what extent was the American Phoenix Programme a failure in Vietnam between 1965 and 1972?
•
How important a factor was topography in the Northern victory at the Battle of Gettysburg?
•
How significant was the contribution of urban resistance to the success of the Cuban Revolution?
More information for teachers who are acting as supervisors for students completing extended essays in history can be found in the Extended essay guide.
History and CAS
CAS plays a crucial role in the DP in areas such as the development of personal and interpersonal skills. It
also provides an important counterbalance to the academic pressures of the rest of the DP.
Examples of CAS experiences that have links to history include the following.
•
A creativity experience creating artwork to accompany a school magazine article commemorating a historical event or figure.
•
A service experience volunteering at a care home for elderly patients and talking to the residents
about their experiences of living through historical events.
•
A combined activity and service experience organizing and participating in a fun run to raise funds for a veterans charity.
More information on CAS can be found in the Creativity, activity, service guide.

History and TOK
History is one of the eight areas of knowledge that are at the centre of the TOK course. It is an interesting
area of knowledge because it raises questions such as how far we can speak with certainty about anything
in the past, and whether historians’ accounts are necessarily subjective. All of the elements of the history
course provide excellent scope for making links to TOK. However, the most explicit link to TOK comes in
the internal assessment task (see the “Internal assessment” section of this guide). Students are required to
reflect on what completing their historical investigation taught them about the role of methods used by,
and challenges facing, the historian. This provides excellent links to TOK, where students will, for example,
compare the methods used to gain knowledge in history with the methods used to gain knowledge in other areas of knowledge.
Examples of discussion questions that can be used to make links to TOK include the following.
•
What is the role of the historian?
•
What methods do historians use to gain knowledge?
•
Is it possible to describe historical events in an unbiased way?
•
Do we learn from history?
•
What is the difference between bias and selection?
•
Who decides which events are historically significant?
•
To what extent does studying history help us to better understand ourselves in the present?
•
What is the role of individuals in history?
•
How does the context within which historians live affect historical knowledge?
More information on TOK can be found in the Theory of knowledge guide.
Prior learning
Students need not have studied history prior to starting the DP history course. In particular, it is neither
expected nor required that specific subjects have been studied for national or international qualifications
in preparation for this course. The specific skills and knowledge required are developed throughout the course itself.
Links to the Middle Years Programme
History is often offered explicitly as one of the disciplines within the individuals and societies subject group
of the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP). Regardless of whether it is history or another discipline from the
subject group that is offered, the fundamental concepts of MYP individuals and societies provide a very
useful foundation for students who go on to study the DP history course.
MYP individuals and societies is a concept-driven curriculum aimed at helping the learner construct meaning
through improved critical thinking and the transfer of knowledge. At the top level are key concepts, which
are broad, organizing, powerful ideas that have relevance within the subject but also transcend it, having
relevance in other subject groups. These key concepts facilitate both disciplinary and interdisciplinary
learning as well as making connections with other subjects.

Aims
Group 3 aims
The aims of all subjects in group 3, individuals and societies, are to:
1.
encourage the systematic and critical study of: human experience and behaviour; physical, economic
and social environments; the history and development of social and cultural institutions 2.
develop in the student the capacity to identify, to analyse critically and to evaluate theories, concepts
and arguments about the nature and activities of the individual and society 3.
enable the student to collect, describe and analyse data used in studies of society, to test hypotheses and interpret complex data and source material 4.
promote the appreciation of the way in which learning is relevant to both the culture in which the student lives and the culture of other societies 5.
develop an awareness in the student that human attitudes and opinions are widely diverse and that a
study of society requires an appreciation of such diversity 6.
enable the student to recognize that the content and methodologies of the subjects in group 3 are
contestable and that their study requires the toleration of uncertainty.
History aims
The aims of the history course at SL and HL are to:
7.
develop an understanding of, and continuing interest in, the past 8.
encourage students to engage with multiple perspectives and to appreciate the complex nature of
historical concepts, issues, events and developments 9.
promote international-mindedness through the study of history from more than one region of the world 10.

Designing your DP history course
The DP history course offers teachers a great deal of flexibility over the topics they select to teach, allowing
teachers to adapt the course to best meet the particular needs and interests of their students. The following
pages are intended to help teachers in designing their history course. Additional guidance on putting a
DP history course together can also be found in the History teacher support material.
Step 1: Select one prescribed subject
Select one prescribed subject from the list of five (see the “Syllabus outline” section).
Each prescribed subject consists of two case studies, each taken from a different region of the world.
Both of the case studies specified for the chosen prescribed subject must be studied.
Step 2: Select two world history topics
Select two topics in world history from the list of twelve (see the “Syllabus outline” section).
Each topic provides teachers with a great deal of flexibility in choosing their own examples.
However, it should be noted that for each one, topic examples must be studied from more than one region of the world.
Step 3: For HL only, select one HL regional option
For HL only, select one HL regional option from the list of four (see the “Syllabus outline” section).
Three sections must be studied for the chosen regional option, from a choice of eighteen sections per regional option.
Internal assessment
For both SL and HL, students must complete a historical investigation for their internal assessment
task. Students can investigate any historical topic of their choice (see the “Internal assessment” section).

Syllabus content
Prescribed subjects
One prescribed subject must be chosen for study from the following list.
1.
Military leaders 2.
Conquest and its impact 3.
The move to global war 4.
Rights and protest 5.
Conflict and intervention
The following pages detail the content that must be studied for each prescribed subject. For each prescribed
subject two case studies, from different regions of the world, are identified. Both of the case studies for
the prescribed subject selected must be studied. Each of the case studies has quite a narrow focus, so it
is therefore important that teachers also help students to understand the wider context in which the case study takes place.
The prescribed subjects are assessed on paper 1, which is a source-based examination paper (see the
“External assessment” section for more details). It is therefore important that the content for the chosen
prescribed subject be explored using a range of original evidence and secondary works, so that students develop the skills required for this component.

and they subsequently looked to the United States for help to combat the Japanese threat. The defeat of
Japan altered strategic thinking in Australia and New Zealand, both joining in alliances with the United
States and both following a strongly anti-communist line. Both countries became more multicultural as a
result of immigration, not just from Britain and Europe, but also, by the 1960s, from Asia. Both were active in
international organizations and played more independent roles in world affairs, particularly in Asia and the
Pacific. Ties with Britain weakened and economic links were forged with Japan and, later, with the emerging
economies of China, South-East Asia and the Pacific Islands.

Assessment
Assessment in the Diploma Programme
General
Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most important aims of assessment in the Diploma
Programme (DP) are that it should support curricular goals and encourage appropriate student learning. Both
external and internal assessments are used in the DP. IB examiners mark work produced for external assessment,
while work produced for internal assessment is marked by teachers and externally moderated by the IB.
There are two types of assessment identified by the IB.
•
Formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is concerned with providing accurate
and helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of learning taking place, and the
nature of students’ strengths and weaknesses, in order to help develop students’ understanding
and capabilities. Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide
information to monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives.
•
Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring student achievement.
The DP primarily focuses on summative assessment designed to record student achievement at, or towards
the end of, the course of study. However, many of the assessment instruments can also be used formatively
during the course of teaching and learning, and teachers are encouraged to do this. A comprehensive
assessment plan is viewed as being integral with teaching, learning and course organization. For further
information, see the IB Programme standards and practices document.
The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not norm-referenced. This approach to
assessment judges students’ work by their performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, and
not in relation to the work of other students. For further information on assessment within the DP, please
refer to the publication Diploma Programme assessment: Principles and practice.
To support teachers in the planning, delivery and assessment of the DP courses, a variety of resources can
be found on the programme resource centre or purchased from the IB store (store.ibo.org). Additional
publications such as specimen papers and markschemes, teacher support materials, subject reports and
grade descriptors can also be found on the programme resource centre. Past examination papers as well as markschemes can be purchased from the IB store.
Methods of assessment
The IB uses several methods to assess work produced by students.
Assessment criteria
Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended. Each criterion concentrates on
a particular skill that students are expected to demonstrate. An assessment objective describes what
students should be able to do, and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do it. Using
assessment criteria allows discrimination between different answers and encourages a variety of responses.
Each criterion comprises a set of hierarchically ordered level descriptors. Each level descriptor is worth one

=== Page 83 ===
Assessment in the Diploma Programme
History guide 73
or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The maximum marks for each
criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are added
together to give the total mark for the piece of work.
Markbands
Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance against which responses are judged.
They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds
to a range of marks to differentiate student performance. A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which
particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.
Markschemes
Markschemes are prepared for those examination questions that expect a particular kind of response and/
or a given final answer from students. They give detailed instructions to examiners on how to break down
the total mark for each question for different parts of the response.
Marking notes
Marking notes are provided for some assessment components marked using assessment criteria. Marking
notes give guidance on how to apply assessment criteria to the particular requirements of a question.
Inclusive assessment arrangements
Inclusive assessment arrangements are available for candidates with assessment access requirements.
These arrangements enable candidates with diverse needs to access the examinations and demonstrate
their knowledge and understanding of the constructs being assessed.
The IB document Candidates with assessment access requirements provides details on all the inclusive
assessment arrangements available to candidates with learning support requirements. The IB document
Learning diversity in the International Baccalaureate programmes: Special educational needs within the
International Baccalaureate programmes outlines the position of the IB with regard to candidates with diverse
learning needs in the IB programmes. For candidates affected by adverse circumstances, the IB documents
General regulations: Diploma Programme and the Diploma Programme Assessment procedures provide details on access consideration.
The school is required to ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided
to candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Candidates with
assessment access requirements and Learning diversity in the International Baccalaureate programmes: Special
educational needs within the International Baccalaureate programmes.
Acknowledging the ideas or work of another person
Coordinators and teachers are reminded that candidates must acknowledge all sources used in work
submitted for assessment. The following is intended as a clarification of this requirement.
DP candidates submit work for assessment in a variety of media that may include audio-visual material, text,
graphs, images and/or data published in print or electronic sources. If a candidate uses the work or ideas
of another person, the candidate must acknowledge the source using a standard style of referencing in a
consistent manner. A candidate’s failure to acknowledge a source will be investigated by the IB as a potential
breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.

=== Page 84 ===
Assessment in the Diploma Programme
History guide 74
The IB does not prescribe which style(s) of referencing or in-text citation should be used by candidates; this
is left to the discretion of appropriate faculty/staff in the candidate’s school. The wide range of subjects,
three response languages and the diversity of referencing styles make it impractical and restrictive to insist
on particular styles. In practice, certain styles may prove most commonly used, but schools are free to
choose a style that is appropriate for the subject concerned and the language in which candidates’ work is
written. Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a given subject, it is expected that the
minimum information given includes: name of author, date of publication, title of source and page numbers, as applicable.
Candidates are expected to use a standard style and use it consistently so that credit is given to all sources
used, including sources that have been paraphrased or summarized. When writing text, a candidate must
clearly distinguish between their words and those of others by the use of quotation marks (or other method,
such as indentation) followed by an appropriate citation that denotes an entry in the bibliography. If an
electronic source is cited, the date of access must be indicated. Candidates are not expected to show faultless
expertise in referencing, but are expected to demonstrate that all sources have been acknowledged.
Candidates must be advised that for audio-visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in
print or in electronic sources that is not their own, they must also attribute the source. Again, an appropriate style of referencing/citation must be used.

Internal assessment
Purpose of internal assessment
Internal assessment is an integral part of the course and is compulsory for both SL and HL students. It
enables students to demonstrate the application of skills and knowledge, and to pursue their personal
interests, without the time limitations and other constraints that are associated with written examinations.
The internal assessment should, as far as possible, be woven into normal classroom teaching and not be a
separate activity conducted after a course has been taught.
The internal assessment requirements at SL and at HL for history are the same. All students complete a
historical investigation into a historical topic of their choice. The internal assessment allows flexibility for
students to select a topic of personal interest. The topic need not be related to the syllabus and students
should be encouraged to use their own initiative when deciding on a topic. The free choice of topic means
that the historical investigation provides a particularly good opportunity for students to engage with topics
that are of personal interest, or topics related to their own local or national history.
Please note: Each individual student must complete an individual historical investigation—group work may not be undertaken.
Time allocation
Internal assessment contributes 25% to the final assessment in the SL course and 20% in the HL course. This
weighting should be reflected in the time that is allocated to teaching the skills and understanding required
to undertake the work, as well as the total time allocated to carry out the work.
It is recommended that a total of approximately 20 hours (SL and HL) of teaching time should be allocated to the work. This should include:
•
time for the teacher to explain to students the requirements of the internal assessment •
class time for students to work on the internal assessment component and ask questions •
time for consultation between the teacher and each student individually •
time to review and monitor progress, and to check authenticity.
Guidance and authenticity
The historical investigation submitted for internal assessment must be the student’s own work. However,
it is not the intention that students should decide upon a title or topic and be left to work on the internal
assessment component without any further support from the teacher. The teacher should play an important
role during both the planning stage and the period when the student is working on the internally assessed
work. It is the responsibility of the teacher to ensure that students are familiar with:
•
the requirements of the type of work to be internally assessed •
the assessment criteria; students must understand that the work submitted for assessment must address these criteria effectively.
Assessment

=== Page 94 ===
Internal assessment
History guide 84
Teachers and students must discuss the internally assessed work. Students should be encouraged to initiate
discussions with the teacher to obtain advice and information, and students must not be penalized for
seeking guidance. As part of the learning process, teachers should read and give advice to students on one
draft of the work. The teacher should provide oral or written advice on how the work could be improved, but
should not edit the draft. The next version handed to the teacher must be the final version for submission.
It is the responsibility of teachers to ensure that all students understand the basic meaning and significance
of concepts that relate to academic honesty, especially authenticity and intellectual property. Teachers must
ensure that all student work for assessment is prepared according to the requirements and must explain
clearly to students that the internally assessed work must be entirely their own. All work submitted to the
IB for moderation or assessment must be authenticated by a teacher, and must not include any known
instances of suspected or confirmed academic misconduct. Each student must confirm that the work is his
or her authentic work and constitutes the final version of that work. Once a student has officially submitted
the final version of the work it cannot be retracted. The requirement to confirm the authenticity of work
applies to the work of all students, not just the sample work that will be submitted to the IB for the purpose
of moderation. For further details, refer to the IB publication Academic honesty in the IB educational context,
The Diploma Programme: From principles into practice and the relevant articles in General regulations: Diploma
Programme.
Authenticity may be checked by discussion with the student on the content of the work, and scrutiny of one or more of the following.
•
The student’s initial proposal •
The first draft of the written work •
The references cited •
The style of writing compared with work known to be that of the student •
The analysis of the work by a web-based plagiarism-detection service
Please note: The same piece of work cannot be submitted to meet the requirements of both the internal assessment and the extended essay.
Internal assessment details—SL and HL
Historical investigation
Duration: 20 hours
Weighting: 25% SL, 20% HL
Students at both SL and HL are required to complete a historical investigation into a topic of their choice.
The historical investigation is made of up three sections.

1. Identification and evaluation of sources
2. Investigation
3. Reflection
Figure 8
Historical investigation

=== Page 95 ===
Internal assessment
History guide 85
Students have a free choice of topic for their historical investigation—the topic need not be related to the
syllabus, and students should be encouraged to use their own initiative when deciding on a topic. However,
the topic must be historical, and therefore cannot be on an event that has happened in the last 10 years.
Students should choose their own topic, with their teacher’s guidance and approval. Teachers must approve
the topic and question for investigation before work is started. It is crucial that there are sufficient sources to
support the investigation, and that the investigation can be assessed by the criteria for internal assessment.
Teachers must also make students aware of any relevant ethical considerations when undertaking their
investigation, for example, the need to show sensitivity or to respect confidentiality.
The investigation is an opportunity for students to demonstrate the application of their skills and knowledge
to a historical topic of their choice. The emphasis must be on a specific historical inquiry that enables the
student to develop and apply the skills of a historian by selecting and analysing a range of source material
and considering diverse perspectives. The activity demands that students search for, select, evaluate and
use evidence to reach a relevant conclusion consistent with the evidence and arguments that have been put forward.
Section 1: Identification and evaluation of sources
This section requires students to analyse in detail two of the sources that they will use in their investigation.
The sources can be either primary or secondary sources. In this section students must:
•
clearly state the question they have chosen to investigate (this must be stated as a question) •
include a brief explanation of the nature of the two sources they have selected for detailed analysis,
including an explanation of their relevance to the investigation •
analyse two sources in detail. With reference to the origins, purpose and content, the student should
analyse the value and limitations of the two sources in relation to the investigation.
A crucial element of this section of the internal assessment task is formulating an appropriate question to
investigate. The six key concepts for the history course (causation, consequence, continuity, change,
significance and perspectives) can be a very useful starting point in helping students to formulate a question.
The following are examples of historical investigations recently submitted by students.
•
How systematic were the deportations of the Jewish population of Dusseldorf to Minsk between 1941 and 1942?
•
How significant were economic problems as a cause of the Bamberg Witch Trials (1623–1633)?
•
What were the most important reasons for the failure of Operation Market Garden?
•
To what extent was weak leadership responsible for the collapse of the Egyptian Old Kingdom in
2125 BC?
Section 2: Investigation
This section of the internal assessment task consists of the actual investigation. The internal assessment task
provides scope for a wide variety of different types of historical investigation, for example:
•
a historical topic or theme using a variety of written sources or a variety of written and non-written sources •
a historical topic based on fieldwork, for example, a museum, archeological site, battlefields, places of
worship such as mosques or churches, historic buildings • a local history study.
The investigation must be clearly and effectively organized. While there is no prescribed format for how
this section must be structured, it must contain critical analysis that is focused clearly on the question being
investigated, and must also include the conclusion that the student draws from their analysis.

=== Page 96 ===
Internal assessment
History guide 86
In this section, students must use a range of evidence to support their argument. Please note that students
can use primary sources, secondary sources, or a mixture of the two.
Section 3: Reflection
This section of the internal assessment task requires students to reflect on what undertaking their
investigation highlighted to them about the methods used by, and the challenges facing, the historian.
Examples of discussion questions that may help to encourage reflection include the following.
•
What methods used by historians did you use in your investigation?
•
What did your investigation highlight to you about the limitations of those methods?
•
What are the challenges facing the historian? How do they differ from the challenges facing a scientist or a mathematician?
•
What challenges in particular does archive-based history present?
•
How can the reliability of sources be evaluated?
•
What is the difference between bias and selection?
•
What constitutes a historical event?
•
Who decides which events are historically significant?
•
Is it possible to describe historical events in an unbiased way?
•
What is the role of the historian?
•
Should terms such as “atrocity” be used when writing about history, or should value judgments be avoided?
•
If it is difficult to establish proof in history, does that mean that all versions are equally acceptable?

Using assessment criteria for internal assessment
A number of assessment criteria have been identified for the internal assessment task. Each assessment
criterion has level descriptors describing specific achievement levels, together with an appropriate range
of marks. The level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure to achieve may be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL against the criteria using the level descriptors.
•
The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.
•
The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained
by the student, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be
made when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark
awarded should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is
not necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.
•
When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors for each criterion until
they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a
piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the
one that more appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.
•
Where there are two or more marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper marks
if the student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent; the work may be close
to achieving marks in the level above. Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work
demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in the level below.
•
Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.
•
Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying
the appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.
•
The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by a
student. Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of the work being assessed.
•
A student who attains a high achievement level in relation to one criterion will not necessarily
attain high achievement levels in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a student who attains a low
achievement level for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the other
criteria. Teachers should not assume that the overall assessment of the students will produce any particular distribution of marks.
•
It is recommended that the assessment criteria be made available to students.

Approaches to teaching and learning in the
Diploma Programme history course
Approaches to teaching and learning
Approaches to teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme (DP) refer to deliberate strategies, skills and
attitudes that permeate the teaching and learning environment. These approaches and tools are intrinsically
linked with the learner profile attributes, enhance student learning and assist student preparation for the
DP assessment and beyond.
The five approaches to learning (developing thinking skills, social skills, communication skills, self management skills and research skills) along with the six approaches to teaching (teaching that is inquiry based, conceptually focused, contextualized, collaborative, differentiated and informed by assessment)
encompass the key values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy. More advice and support on these
approaches to teaching and learning can be found in the following pages of this subject guide and also in the History teacher support material.
The DP history course is based on three key elements: content, concepts and skills. These three elements are seen as being inextricably linked.
Concepts
Content
Skills
Figure 9
Three key elements
“Three-dimensional” models, such as this, “value a solid base of critical factual knowledge across
the disciplines, but they raise the bar for curriculum and instruction by shifting the design focus to the
conceptual level of understanding” (Erickson 2012).

=== Page 102 ===
Approaches to teaching and learning in the
Diploma Programme history course
History guide 92
Concepts
Concepts are big powerful ideas that have relevance both within and
across subject areas. Concepts help to move students from knowledge
to understanding as “knowledge is integrated with existing schemas and
cognitive frameworks” (Anderson and Krathwohl 2001). Concepts also
help to provide bridges between old knowledge and new knowledge,
and facilitate transfer of knowledge across subject areas/contexts.
Understanding the “big ideas” behind a topic can also help students get
to the heart of why they are learning a particular topic. (See, for example,
Perkins 2010.)
Content
Content also plays a crucial role in the DP history course, as there needs
to be a solid base of factual knowledge to underpin the development of
conceptual understanding. Specific examples and case studies also help to
ground abstract concepts, allowing students to see a concept represented in a particular context.
Skills
Throughout the DP history course, students should be encouraged to
develop their understanding of the methodology and practice of the
discipline of history. Teaching historical skills enriches the student’s
understanding of the subject and encourages the student to apply them
to the future study of history or related areas. It is essential that these
skills are covered throughout the syllabus, are introduced appropriately,
depending on the context, and are not treated in isolation.
Key concepts for DP history unpacked
The DP history course is focused on six key concepts: causation, consequence, change, continuity,
significance and perspectives. In their efforts to place thinking at the centre of historical understanding,
researchers in history education have highlighted the role that concepts such as these play in helping
to shape our thinking about history (Seixas and Morton 2013). These concepts help students to think
critically about historical issues; helping students to identify and solve problems, make decisions, and
form judgments about past claims, actors and issues. These concepts are also extremely useful to history
teachers as a tool for helping to craft creative lessons and assessment activities that avoid passive content
delivery, and that provide opportunities for students to build on their prior knowledge and to think deeply about historical issues and events.
Change
The study of history involves investigation of the extent to which people
and events bring about change. Discussion of the concept of change
can encourage sophisticated discussions such as encouraging students
to think about, and look for, change where some claim none exists, or
using evidence to challenge orthodox theories and assumptions about
people and events that it is claimed led to significant change. Students’
questions and judgments about historical change should be based on deep
understanding of content and on comparison of the situation before and after the events under examination.

=== Page 103 ===
Approaches to teaching and learning in the
Diploma Programme history course
History guide 93
Continuity
While historical study often focuses on moments of significant change,
students should also be aware that some change is slow, and that
throughout history there is also significant continuity. Students can
demonstrate deep historical knowledge and understanding by, for
example, showing awareness that there are times when there has
been considerable continuity in the midst of great historical change.
Alternatively, students may question and assess whether a change in
political leadership, for example, brought about a change in foreign
policy, or whether it was more accurately mirroring policies of previous governments.
Causation
Effective historical thinkers recognize that many claims made about the
past seek to more thoroughly explain and understand how a certain set of
circumstances originated. Deep historical understanding is demonstrated
where students recognize that most historical events are caused by an
interplay of diverse and multiple causes that require students to make
evidence-based judgments about which causes were more important or
significant, or which causes were within the scope of individuals to direct and which were not.
Consequence
History is the understanding of how forces in the past have shaped future
people and societies. Students demonstrate competency as historical
thinkers where they understand and can explain how significant events
and people have had both short-term and long-lasting effects. Students
use evidence and interpretations of those people and events to make
comparisons between different points in time, and to make judgments
about the extent to which those forces produced long-lasting and important consequences.
Significance
History is not simply the record of all events that have happened in the
past. Instead, history is the record that has been preserved through
evidence or traces of the past, and/or the aspects that someone has
consciously decided to record and communicate. Students should be
encouraged to ask questions about why something may have been
recorded or included in a historical narrative. Similarly, they should be
encouraged to think about who or what has been excluded from historical
narratives, and for what reasons. Additionally, students’ questions should
encourage them to think about, and assess, the relative importance of
events, people, groups or developments, and whether the evidence
supports the claims that others make about their significance.
Perspectives
IB students should be aware of how history is sometimes used or abused
to retell and promote a grand narrative of history, a narrowly focused
national mythology that ignores other perspectives, or to elevate a single
perspective to a position of predominance. Students are encouraged to
challenge and critique multiple perspectives of the past, and to compare
them and corroborate them with historical evidence. Students should
recognize that for every event recorded in the past, there may be multiple
contrasting or differing perspectives. Using primary-source accounts and
historians’ interpretations, students may also investigate and compare how
people, including specific groups such as minorities or women, may have
experienced events differently in the past. In this way there are particularly
strong links between exploring multiple perspectives and the development of international-mindedness.

Approaches to teaching and learning in the
Diploma Programme history course
History guide 94
Skills
The DP history course, as with all DP courses, provides rich opportunities to develop students’ thinking,
research, communication, social and self-management skills. More advice on developing these five
categories of skills in the history course can be found in the History teacher support material. Four examples
of the types of skills developed throughout the history course are outlined below.
Example 1: The gathering and sorting of historical evidence
Many of the skills developed in the history course relate to the gathering and sorting of historical
evidence. This area includes research skills such as locating and selecting relevant and appropriate evidence from books, articles, websites and audio-visual resources; and recognizing the distinctions between different kinds of evidence.
The course provides the opportunity for students to increase their confidence and independence in
locating and using a variety of historical sources.
Example 2: The evaluation of historical evidence
A key element of the course relates to the development of thinking and research skills
relating to the evaluation of historical evidence.
These skills include recognizing the subjective nature of the historical evidence; examining sources for information and interpretations, and for cases where they corroborate, complement or contradict each other; recognizing the value and uses of sources, and reasons to use them cautiously; and recognizing and appreciating why and how opinions and interpretations differ. The course provides the opportunity for students to
increase their awareness of multiple perspectives, historical opinions and interpretations.
Example 3: Recognizing and understanding historical processes and their relationships to human experience, activity and motivation
The history course allows students to develop their appreciation of the nature of human experience
in a range of contexts. It achieves this through a
focus on skills such as recognizing, explaining and analysing causes and consequences; recognizing, explaining and analysing continuity, change and development over time; recognizing, explaining and analysing similarity and difference; relating human activities, experiences and motivations in history to a range of cultural and social dimensions; and synthesizing material studied across time and space.
Example 4: Organizing and expressing historical ideas and information
The history course places a strong emphasis on developing the communication skills needed to organize and express ideas and information with clarity. These skills include: posing questions and hypotheses, and answering or testing them;
handling and synthesizing several sources for one inquiry; selecting and deploying information and
ideas; constructing narratives, with ideas, analysis and relevant substantiation; and summarizing and arriving at conclusions. The development of these skills helps increase students’ confidence and sophistication in both oral and written communication.
