## THE REFLECTING CONVERSATION

After the colleague participates in an event, resolves a challenge, or completes some task, the Cognitive Coach may seize this opportunity to mediate the cognitive processes of reflection. Reflection is a process of self-discovery, pattern finding, and analysis. It is an exercise in comparative thinking, recalling what was planned and finding similarities and differences with what actually occurred. The coach's intent is to habituate the process of reflection. It reaches the colleague on both an

affective level and a cognitive level and is designed around a set of questions that the person thinks through and reacts to with concrete responses (York-Barr, Sommers, Ghere, and Montie 2001; Sanford 1995a, 1995b; Feuerstein, Falik, and Feuerstein 2015).

Sometimes, only the opportunity of engaging in reflection is available, even though the coach was not present during the event. Holding the reflecting conversation map in mind, the coach engages the colleague's cognitive processes of reflection so as to maximize the construction of significant meanings from the experience and to apply those insights to other settings and events.

There are five regions in the reflecting conversation. The coach and the colleague visit each of the regions of the map with specific intentions. The coach begins to mediate by inviting the reflector to summarize his or her impressions of the event and recall data that support those assessments.

- Summarize impressions and recall supporting information . In summarizing impressions and recalling supporting information, the intent is to elicit the overall thoughts and feelings of the coachee about the event and to ground those in specific data. Because sensitive coaches realize that there is a tremendous emotional investment in any event for which a person has had the responsibility

of planning and conducting, the summarize and recall region provides an opportunity to summon those feelings and to recollect the events, conditions, or actions that produced them.

After eliciting impressions, the coach always prompts the reflector's memory of events (data) before providing data she/he may have collected in observing the event. It is important to understand and hear the internal data (what the reflector knows and is aware of) before providing external data. The coach offers external data and puts this information into the hands of the reflector, pausing to allow the person time to scan and examine the data. Providing this time allows the coachee an opportunity to reflect. The coachee analyzes and generates insights by comparing internal and external data. The intent of this is to heighten consciousness about possible congruencies and discrepancies.

- Analyze causal factors; compare, analyze, infer, and determine cause-and-effect relationships . To analyze involves deconstructing an event into its parts and considering the relationship between the parts. The intent of the 'analyze' region is to compare the planned event with what actually happened, to identify and interpret causal factors that produced the results, to explain and give reasons for the 'in action' decisions that were made, and to make inferences from the information that has been recalled.
- Construct new learning and applications . The intent of the 'construct' region is to make meaning from the analysis, to draw insights and patterns, and to synthesize the personal learnings that were described in the planning conversation.
- Commit to applications . Because Cognitive Coaches value selfdirected learning, the purpose of the 'commit' region is to transcend this event and to make applications of the learnings to future events, to bridge to other life situations, to transfer such learnings, to selfprescribe, and to take actions to modify personal behaviors. This helps to override what Feuerstein terms episodic thinking (Feuerstein and Feuerstein 1991).
- Reflect on the coaching process and explore refinements . Upon completion of the learning journey, the coach invites the partner to reflect on the entire conversation, to explore its effects on thinking and decision making, and to recommend modifications that could enhance future reflecting conversations. This is important as it reinforces the intent to communicate that this is a collaborative relationship, addressing an ever-present subconscious concern about

status (Rock 2009). Additionally, reflecting on the process brings it to the awareness level so that the process is more likely to be performed autonomously by the coachee.

Although the steps in the reflecting process may be visited in any order, exploring the 'summarize impressions' region is usually a first destination and committing to action is often the last before reflecting on the coaching process.
