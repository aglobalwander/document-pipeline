Introduction
The Diploma Programme
The Diploma Programme is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19
age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and
inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to
develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The Diploma Programme model
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core (see figure 1). It encourages the
concurrent study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study two modern languages (or a modern
language and a classical language), a humanities or social science subject, an experimental science,
mathematics and one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma
Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance.
In each of the academic areas students have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can
choose subjects that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.

Sports, exercise and health science guide 3
Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they can, instead
of an arts subject, choose two subjects from another area. Normally, three subjects (and not more than
four) are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends
240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than at SL.
At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of
the course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some element of coursework assessed by teachers.
The core of the Diploma Programme model
All Diploma Programme students participate in the three course elements that make up the core of the model.
Theory of knowledge (TOK) is a course that is fundamentally about critical thinking and inquiry into the
process of knowing rather than about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines the
nature of knowledge and how we know what we claim to know. It does this by encouraging students to
analyse knowledge claims and explore questions about the construction of knowledge. The task of TOK is to
emphasize connections between areas of shared knowledge and link them to personal knowledge in such a
way that an individual becomes more aware of his or her own perspectives and how they might differ from others.
Creativity, activity, service (CAS) is at the heart of the Diploma Programme. CAS enables students to live
out the IB learner profile in real and practical ways, to grow as unique individuals and to recognize their
role in relation to others. Students develop skills, attitudes and dispositions through a variety of individual
and group experiences that provides students with opportunities to explore their interests and express
their passions, personalities and perspectives. CAS complements a challenging academic programme in a
holistic way, providing opportunities for self-determination, collaboration, accomplishment and enjoyment.
The three strands of CAS are:
•
creativity—exploring and extending ideas leading to an original or interpretive product or performance •
activity—physical exertion contributing to a healthy lifestyle •
service—collaborative and reciprocal engagement with the community in response to an authentic need.
The extended essay, including the world studies extended essay, offers the opportunity for IB students to
investigate a topic of special interest, in the form of a 4,000-word piece of independent research. The area of
research undertaken is chosen from one of the students’ six Diploma Programme subjects or, in the case of
the interdisciplinary world studies essay, two subjects, and acquaints them with the independent research
and writing skills expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally presented, structured writing
in which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent manner, appropriate to the
subject or subjects chosen. It is intended to promote high-level research and writing skills, intellectual
discovery and creativity. An authentic learning experience, it provides students with an opportunity to
engage in personal research on a topic of choice, under the guidance of a supervisor.

Approaches to teaching and learning
Approaches to teaching and learning across the Diploma Programme refers to deliberate strategies, skills and
attitudes that permeate the teaching and learning environment. These approaches and tools, intrinsically
linked with the learner profile attributes, enhance student learning and assist student preparation for the
Diploma Programme assessment and beyond. The aims of approaches to teaching and learning in the Diploma
Programme are to:
•
empower teachers as teachers of learners as well as teachers of content •
empower teachers to create clearer strategies for facilitating learning experiences in which students
are more meaningfully engaged in structured inquiry and greater critical and creative thinking •
promote both the aims of individual subjects (making them more than course aspirations) and linking
previously isolated knowledge (concurrency of learning) •
encourage students to develop an explicit variety of skills that will equip them to continue to be
actively engaged in learning after they leave school, and to help them not only obtain university
admission through better grades but also prepare for success during tertiary education and beyond •
enhance further the coherence and relevance of the students’ Diploma Programme experience •
allow schools to identify the distinctive nature of an IB Diploma Programme education, with its blend of idealism and practicality.
The five approaches to learning (developing thinking skills, social skills, communication skills, self management skills and research skills) along with the six approaches to teaching (teaching that is inquiry based, conceptually focused, contextualized, collaborative, differentiated and informed by assessment)
encompass the key values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy.
Academic honesty
Academic honesty in the Diploma Programme is a set of values and behaviours informed by the attributes
of the learner profile. In teaching, learning and assessment, academic honesty serves to promote personal
integrity, engender respect for the integrity of others and their work, and ensure that all students have an
equal opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquire during their studies.
All coursework—including work submitted for assessment—is to be authentic, based on the student’s
individual and original ideas with the ideas and work of others fully acknowledged. Assessment tasks that
require teachers to provide guidance to students or that require students to work collaboratively must be
completed in full compliance with the detailed guidelines provided by the IB for the relevant subjects.
For further information on academic honesty in the IB and the Diploma Programme, please consult
the IB publications Academic honesty, The Diploma Programme: From principles into practice and General
regulations: Diploma Programme. Specific information regarding academic honesty as it pertains to external
and internal assessment components of this Diploma Programme subject can be found in this guide.
Learning diversity and learning support requirements
Schools must ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided to
candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Candidates with
assessment access requirements and Learning diversity in the International Baccalaureate programmes: Special
educational needs within the International Baccalaureate programmes.

Introduction
Nature of the subject
Sports, exercise and health science
Sports, exercise and health science (SEHS) is an experimental science that combines academic study with
the acquisition of practical and investigative skills. It is an applied science course within group 4, with
aspects of biological and physical science being studied in the specific context of sports, exercise and health.
Moreover, the subject matter goes beyond the traditional science subjects to offer a deeper understanding
of the issues related to sports, exercise and health in the 21st century. Apart from being worthy of study in
its own right, SEHS is a good preparation for courses in higher or further education related to sports fitness
and health, and serves as useful preparation for employment in sports and leisure industries.
The attainment of excellence in sports is the result of innate ability or skill and the dedicated pursuit of a
programme of physical and mental training accompanied by appropriate nutrition. Training programme
design should not be left to chance. Rather, it should be designed thoughtfully and analytically after careful
consideration of the physiological, biomechanical and psychological demands of the activity. This is the
role of the sports and exercise scientist who, regardless of the athletic event, should be equipped with the
necessary knowledge to be able to perform this task competently. Furthermore, in a world where many
millions of people are physically inactive and afflicted by chronic disease and ill health, the sports and
exercise scientist should be equally proficient when prescribing exercise for the promotion of health and well-being.
Scientific inquiry, conducted over many decades, has accumulated a vast amount of information across a
range of sub-disciplines that contribute to our understanding of health and human performance in relation
to sports and exercise. The Diploma Programme course in sports, exercise and health science involves the
study of the science that underpins physical performance and provides the opportunity to apply these principles.
The course incorporates the traditional disciplines of anatomy and physiology, biomechanics, psychology
and nutrition, which are studied in the context of sports, exercise and health. Students will cover a range
of core and option topics, and carry out practical (experimental) investigations in both laboratory and
field settings. This will provide an opportunity to acquire the knowledge and understanding necessary
to apply scientific principles and critically analyse human performance. Where relevant, the course will
address issues of international dimension and ethics by considering sports, exercise and health relative to the individual and in a global context.
At the school level, both theory and practical work should be undertaken by all students. They should
complement one another naturally, as they do in wider scientific study. The Diploma Programme SEHS
course allows students to develop practical skills and techniques, and to increase facility in the use of
mathematics, which is the language of science. It also allows students to develop interpersonal skills and
digital technology skills, which are essential in 21st-century scientific endeavour and are important life enhancing, transferable skills in their own right. The course is available at both standard level (SL) and higher
level (HL), and therefore accommodates students who wish to study SEHS as their major subject in higher education and those who do not.

Distinction between SL and HL
Group 4 students at standard level (SL) and higher level (HL) undertake a common core syllabus, a common
internal assessment (IA) scheme and have some overlapping elements in the options studied. They are
presented with a syllabus that encourages the development of certain skills, attributes and attitudes, as
described in the “Assessment objectives” section of this guide.
While the skills and activities of group 4 science subjects are common to students at both SL and HL,
students at HL are required to study additional higher level (AHL) material as well as HL topics within the
options. The distinction between SL and HL is one of breadth and depth.

Introduction
SEHS and the core
SEHS and theory of knowledge
The theory of knowledge (TOK) course (first assessment 2015) engages students in reflection on the nature
of knowledge and on how we know what we claim to know. The course identifies eight ways of knowing:
reason, emotion, language, sense perception, intuition, imagination, faith and memory. Students explore
these means of producing knowledge within the context of various areas of knowledge: the natural sciences,
the social sciences, the arts, ethics, history, mathematics, religious knowledge systems and indigenous
knowledge systems. The course also requires students to make comparisons between the different areas of
knowledge, reflecting on how knowledge is arrived at in the various disciplines, what the disciplines have in common, and the differences between them.
TOK lessons can support students in their study of science, just as the study of science can support
students in their TOK course. TOK provides a space for students to engage in stimulating wider discussions
about questions such as what it means for a discipline to be a science, or whether there should be ethical
constraints on the pursuit of scientific knowledge. It also provides an opportunity for students to reflect on
the methodologies of science, and how these compare to the methodologies of other areas of knowledge.
It is now widely accepted that there is no one scientific method, in the strict Popperian sense. Instead, the
sciences utilize a variety of approaches in order to produce explanations for the behaviour of the natural
world. The different scientific disciplines share a common focus on utilizing inductive and deductive
reasoning, on the importance of evidence, and so on. Students are encouraged to compare and contrast
these methods with the methods found in, for example, the arts or in history.
In this way there are rich opportunities for students to make links between their science and TOK courses.
One way in which science teachers can help students to make these links to TOK is by drawing students’
attention to knowledge questions that arise from their subject content. Knowledge questions are open ended questions about knowledge, and include questions such as the following.
•
How do we distinguish science from pseudoscience?
•
When performing experiments, what is the relationship between a scientist’s expectation and their perception?
•
How does scientific knowledge progress?
•
What is the role of imagination and intuition in the sciences?
•
What are the similarities and differences in methods in the natural sciences and the human sciences?
Examples of relevant knowledge questions are provided throughout this guide within the sub-topics in the
syllabus content. Teachers can also find suggestions of interesting knowledge questions for discussion in
the “Areas of knowledge” and “Knowledge framework” sections of the Theory of knowledge guide. Students
should be encouraged to raise and discuss such knowledge questions in both their science and TOK classes.

SEHS and the core
Sports, exercise and health science guide 8
SEHS and CAS
There are strong links between SEHS and CAS that both teachers and students can explore. In SEHS students
actively engage with issues related to exercise and health that can naturally lead into CAS experiences. All
three strands of CAS can be incorporated into experiences that relate to SEHS within local, national and global communities.
Examples of these strands include:
•
creating a campaign to encourage healthy eating in the school canteen •
regularly taking part in sports, either as a competitive athlete/team member, or participating regularly
in a fitness activity working towards a given health or fitness objective •
working alongside a community organization as a coach, mentor or facilitator to provide sporting
opportunities for children in the local community.
Science and international-mindedness
Science itself is an international endeavour—the exchange of information and ideas across national
boundaries has been essential to the progress of science. This exchange is not a new phenomenon but it
has accelerated in recent times with the development of information and communication technologies.
Indeed, the idea that science is a Western invention is a myth—many of the foundations of modern-day
science were laid many centuries before by Arabic, Indian and Chinese civilizations, among others. Teachers
are encouraged to emphasize this contribution in their teaching of various topics, perhaps through the
use of timeline websites. The scientific method in its widest sense, with its emphasis on peer review,
open-mindedness and freedom of thought, transcends politics, religion, gender and nationality. Where
appropriate within certain topics, the syllabus details sections in the group 4 guides contain links illustrating the international aspects of science.
At an organizational level, many international bodies now exist to promote science. United Nations bodies
such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), where science plays a
prominent part, are well known. In addition, there are hundreds of international bodies representing every
branch of science. In the area of sports, organizations such as the International Olympic Committee (IOC),
the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), the International Council of Sport Science and Physical
Education (ICSSPE) and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) specifically promote global understanding
of issues relating to sports and health. The resources required for large-scale research in, for example, the
Human Genome Project or the abuse of performance-enhancing substances are expensive, and only joint
ventures involving funding from many countries allow this to take place. The data from such research is
shared by scientists worldwide. Group 4 teachers and students are encouraged to access the extensive
websites and databases of these international scientific organizations to enhance their appreciation of the international dimension.
Increasingly there is a recognition that many scientific problems are international in nature and this has
led to a global approach to research in many areas. The work of the World Health Organization (WHO) in
eradicating smallpox is a prime example of this. On a practical level, the group 4 project (which all science
students must undertake) mirrors the work of real scientists by encouraging collaboration between schools across the regions.
The power of scientific knowledge to transform societies is unparalleled. It has the potential to produce
great universal benefits, or to reinforce inequalities and cause harm to people and the environment. In line

=== Page 19 ===
SEHS and the core
Sports, exercise and health science guide 9
with the IB mission statement, group 4 students need to be aware of the moral responsibility of scientists to
ensure that scientific knowledge and data are available to all countries on an equitable basis and that they
have the scientific capacity to use this for developing sustainable societies.
Students’ attention should be drawn to sections of the syllabus with links to international-mindedness.
Examples of issues relating to international-mindedness are given within sub-topics in the syllabus content.
Teachers could also use resources found on the teacher resource exchange.

Introduction
Aims
Through studying any of the group 4 subjects, students should become aware of how scientists work and
communicate with each other. While the “scientific method” may take on a wide variety of forms, it is the
emphasis on a practical approach through experimental work that distinguishes the group 4 subjects from
other disciplines and characterizes each of the subjects within group 4.
It is in this context that the Diploma Programme sports, exercise and health science course should aim to:
1.
appreciate scientific study and creativity within a global context through stimulating and challenging opportunities 2.
acquire a body of knowledge, methods and techniques that characterize science and technology 3.
apply and use a body of knowledge, methods and techniques that characterize science and technology 4.
develop an ability to analyse, evaluate and synthesize scientific information 5.
develop a critical awareness of the need for, and the value of, effective collaboration and communication during scientific activities 6.
develop experimental and investigative scientific skills including the use of current technologies 7.
develop and apply 21st-century communication skills in the study of science 8.
become critically aware, as global citizens, of the ethical implications of using science and technology 9.
develop an appreciation of the possibilities and limitations of science and technology 10.
develop an understanding of the relationships between scientific disciplines and their influence on other areas of knowledge.

Classification of command terms
Key command terms are used in the syllabus content under the “Assessment statement” column, as
described in the “Structure of the syllabus” section, to indicate the depth of understanding that is required
of students. These are classified below according to the assessment objectives (AOs).
•
AO1 Demonstrate knowledge and understanding •
AO2 Apply •
AO3 Formulate, analyse and evaluate
There is a progression in demand from AO1 to AO3. Students must also be familiar with the command terms
to understand the depth of treatment required in examination questions. A command term used in an
examination question will either be from the same classification as specified in the “Assessment statement”
column or a less demanding command term. For example, if the command term in the assessment statement
is “outline”, and is classified as AO2, an examination question could contain the command term “outline”.
Alternatively, another command term such as “describe”, which is also classified as AO2, could be used, or
one associated with AO1, such as “state”. The allocation of marks in examination questions also reflects this classification of the assessment objectives.

Syllabus
Approaches to the teaching of SEHS
There are a variety of approaches to the teaching of SEHS. By its very nature, SEHS lends itself to a practical
approach, and it is expected that this will be reflected throughout the course.
The order in which the syllabus is arranged is not the order in which it should be taught, and it is up to
individual teachers to decide on an arrangement that suits their circumstances. Sections of the option
material may be taught within the core or the additional higher level (AHL) material if desired, or the option material can be taught as separate units.
Engaging with sensitive topics
As part of the SEHS course, students will be required to think about, and evaluate, their own lifestyle choices,
and to engage with those of others. There are frequent opportunities for debate of ethical issues relating to
sports, ranging from the healthy eating choices of individuals to inclusive sports policies in elite competitions.
Students and teachers may therefore encounter conflict between their own values and beliefs in relation to
health, and those of others. There may well be situations where social and cultural pressures impact on an
individual’s understanding of health issues, and discussing such pressures could even influence their lifestyle
choices in a positive or negative way. Teachers are advised to respond to these issues in a sensitive way.
Prior learning
Past experience shows that students will be able to study a group 4 science subject at SL successfully with
no background in, or previous knowledge of, science. Their approach to learning, characterized by the IB
learner profile attributes, will be significant here.
However, for most students considering the study of a group 4 subject at HL, while there is no intention to
restrict access to group 4 subjects, some previous exposure to formal science education would be necessary.
Specific topic details are not specified but students who have undertaken the IB Middle Years Programme
(MYP) or studied an equivalent national science qualification or a school-based science course would be well prepared for an HL subject.
Links to the Middle Years Programme
Students who have undertaken the MYP science, design and mathematics courses will be well prepared
for group 4 subjects. The alignment between MYP science and DP group 4 courses allows for a smooth transition for students between programmes.
Scientific inquiry is central to teaching and learning science in the MYP. It enables students to develop a
way of thinking and a set of skills and processes that, while allowing them to acquire and use knowledge,
equip them with the capabilities to tackle, with confidence, the internal assessment component of group 4
subjects. The vision of MYP sciences is to contribute to the development of students as 21st-century learners.

=== Page 26 ===
Approaches to the teaching of SEHS
Sports, exercise and health science guide 16
A holistic sciences programme allows students to develop and utilize a mixture of cognitive abilities, social
skills, personal motivation, conceptual knowledge and problem-solving competencies within an inquiry based learning environment (Rhoton 2010). Inquiry aims to support students’ understanding by providing
them with opportunities to independently and collaboratively investigate relevant issues through both
research and experimentation. This forms a firm base of scientific understanding with deep conceptual roots for students entering group 4 courses.
In the MYP, teachers make decisions about student achievement using their professional judgment, guided
by criteria that are public, precise and known in advance, ensuring that assessment is transparent. The IB
describes this approach as “criterion-related”—a philosophy of assessment that is neither “norm-referenced”
(where students must be compared to each other and to an expected distribution of achievement) nor
“criterion-referenced” (where students must master all strands of specific criteria at lower achievement
levels before they can be considered to have achieved the next level). It is important to emphasize that
the single most important aim of MYP assessment (consistent with the Primary Years Programme and DP)
is to support curricular goals and encourage appropriate student learning. Assessments are based upon
evaluating course aims and objectives and, therefore, effective teaching to the course requirements also
ensures effective teaching for formal assessment requirements. Students need to understand what the
assessment expectations, standards and practices are, and these should all be introduced early and naturally
in teaching, as well as in class and homework activities. Experience with criterion-related assessment greatly
assists students entering group 4 courses with understanding internal assessment requirements.
MYP science is a concept-driven curriculum, aimed at helping the learner construct meaning through improved
critical thinking and the transfer of knowledge. At the top level are key concepts, which are broad, organizing,
powerful ideas that have relevance within the science course but also transcend it, having relevance in other
subject groups. These key concepts facilitate both disciplinary and interdisciplinary learning as well as making
connections with other subjects. While the key concepts provide breadth, the related concepts in MYP science
add depth to the programme. The related concept can be considered to be the big idea of the unit that brings
focus and depth, and leads students towards the conceptual understanding.
Across the MYP, there are 16 key concepts, with the three highlighted below as the focus for MYP science.
The key concepts across the MYP curriculum
Aesthetics
Change
Communication
Communities
Connections
Creativity
Culture
Development
Form
Global interactions
Identity
Logic
Perspective
Relationships
Systems
Time, place and space
MYP students may in addition undertake an optional on-screen concept-based assessment as further preparation for DP science courses.
Curriculum model
A common curriculum model applies to all the DP group 4 subjects. (There are some differences in this

Structure of the syllabus
Note: The order in which the syllabus content is presented is not intended to represent the order in which it should be taught.
The structure is as follows.
Topics or options
Topics are numbered and options are indicated by a letter (for example, “Topic 5: Skill in sports” or “Option D:
Nutrition for sports, exercise and health”).

=== Page 28 ===
Approaches to the teaching of SEHS
Sports, exercise and health science guide 18
Sub-topics
Sub-topics are numbered and the estimated teaching time required to cover the material is indicated (for
example, “3.1 Nutrition (4 hours)”). These times are for guidance only and do not include time for practical/ investigative work.
Assessment statements
Assessment statements (AS), which are numbered, are expressed in terms of the outcomes that are expected
of students at the end of the course (for example, “2.1.2 Outline the functions of the conducting airways”).
These are intended to prescribe to examiners what can be assessed by means of the written examinations.
Each one is classified as assessment objective 1, 2 or 3 according to the command terms used (see the
“Glossary of command terms” section). The assessment objective levels are relevant for the examinations
and for balance within the syllabus, while the command terms indicate the depth of treatment required
for a given assessment statement. It is important that students are made aware of the meanings of the
command terms because these will be used in examination questions. (When the command term “define”
is used, the word(s) or phrase to be defined is in italics. When the command term “distinguish” is used, the
terms or concepts to be distinguished are also in italics.)
Teacher’s notes
Teacher’s notes, which are included alongside some assessment statements, provide further guidance to teachers.
They may also suggest ideas for the promotion of aim 7, aim 8, aim 9, TOK and the international dimension (Int).

Further guidance
Use of information and communication technology
In accordance with aim 7, the use of information and communication technology (ICT) is strongly encouraged
throughout the course in both practical and theory work.
Practical work
An essential aspect of the course is hands-on work in the laboratory and/or out in the field. The syllabus not
only directly requires the use of field techniques, but many components can only be covered effectively
through this approach. Practical work in this subject is an opportunity to gain and develop skills and
techniques beyond the requirements of the assessment model and should be fully integrated with the teaching of the course.
Mathematical requirements
All DP sports, exercise and health science students should be able to:
•
perform the basic arithmetic functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division •
carry out simple calculations involving means, decimals, fractions, percentages, ratios, approximations, reciprocals and scaling • use scientific notation (for example, 3.6 × 106) • use direct and inverse proportion •
represent and interpret frequency data in the form of bar charts, column graphs and histograms, and interpret pie charts •
determine the mode and median of a set of data, calculate and analyse standard deviation •
select statistical tests appropriate for the analysis of particular data and interpret the results •
plot and interpret graphs (with suitable scales and axes) involving two variables that show linear or non-linear relationships •
plot and interpret scattergrams to identify a correlation between two variables, and appreciate that
the existence of a correlation does not establish a causal relationship •
recognize and use the relationships between length, surface area and volume.
Teacher support materials
A variety of teacher support materials will accompany this guide. These materials will include guidance for
teachers on the introduction, planning and marking of the internal assessment, and specimen examination papers and markschemes.
The online curriculum centre
All teachers of the SEHS course are strongly encouraged to access the online curriculum centre (OCC) at
regular intervals. The OCC is a website on which all teachers can post inquiries, present examples of good
practice, ask for advice and access exemplar materials. The content of the “Sports, exercise and health
science forum” on the OCC is provided by SEHS teachers for SEHS teachers.

4.3.12
Outline the Bernoulli principle with respect to projectile motion in sporting activities.
2
The relationship between airflow velocity and
air pressure is an inverse one, and is expressed in Bernoulli’s principle.
The pressure difference causes the spinning golf ball to experience a force directed from the
region of high air pressure to the region of low air
pressure. A golf ball with backspin will experience higher air pressure on the bottom of the ball and
lower air pressure on the top of the ball, causing a lift force (from high air pressure to low air pressure).
Consider how airflow affects the golf ball and one other example. When an object is moving through the air it is important to consider the relative
airflow on different sides of the object. The airflow difference between opposite sides (for example,
the bottom and top of a spinning golf ball) of the object moving through the air causes a pressure
difference between the two sides. The lift force is perpendicular to the direction of the airflow.
Aim 7: Still photography and video can be used to record and analyse movement.
A visit to a university may be possible to see the use of high-speed photography, photoelectric cells and motion-analysis software.

5.1.5
Outline ability.
2
Ability refers to a general trait or capacity of the individual that is related to the performance and
performance potential of a variety of skills or tasks.
TOK: Abilities have been thought of as stable traits but a more modern perspective understands that people have a genetic potential for each ability and that their level of performance in a
particular ability can be influenced by a number of factors such as life experience or coaching.
TOK: Current research considers that abilities will change with time.
5.1.6
Distinguish between
Fleishman’s physical proficiency abilities (physical factors) and perceptual motor abilities (psychomotor factors).

Fleishman (1972) distinguishes between physical
proficiency and perceptual motor ability. Recall of the individual abilities is not required.
5.1.7
Define the term technique.
1
In general terms, technique is a “way of doing”.
In the performance of a specific sports skill it is defined as the “way in which that sports skill is performed”.

Obj
Teacher’s notes 5.2.6
Discuss the relationship between selective attention and memory.
3
Selective attention (SA) operates in the short term sensory store (STSS). Only the relevant information is passed to the short-term memory (STM) where it is held for several seconds. SA ensures that information overload does not occur and prevents confusion, as the brain would not be able to cope with streams of information. A filtering mechanism operates, which separates the relevant information from the irrelevant (noise) information so that athletes concentrate on one cue or stimulus (for example, the ball, position
of player in a game of tennis) to the exclusion of
others. SA is very important when accuracy or fast responses are required and can be improved by learning through past experience and interaction with long-term memory.
5.2.7
Compare different methods of memory improvement.

Only standard deviation needs to be considered.
6.1.2
Calculate the mean and standard deviation of a set of values.
2
Students should specify the sample standard deviation, not the population standard deviation.
Students will not be expected to know the
formulas for calculating these statistics. They will be expected to use the statistics function of a graphic display or scientific calculator.
Aim 7: Students could also be taught how to calculate standard deviation using a spreadsheet computer program.
6.1.3
State that the statistic standard deviation is used to summarize the spread of values around the mean, and that within a normal distribution approximately 68% and 95% of the values fall within plus or minus one or two standard deviations respectively.
1
For normally distributed data, about 68% of all values lie within ±1 standard deviation of the mean. This rises to about 95% for ±2 standard deviations.
6.1.4
Explain how the standard deviation is useful for comparing the means and the spread of data between two or more samples.
3
A small standard deviation indicates that the data is clustered closely around the mean value.
Conversely, a large standard deviation indicates a wider spread around the mean.

8.1.2
Describe the role of circulating (blood) and local hormones.
2
Hormones are secreted by endocrine glands to regulate and coordinate a range of bodily functions.
Release of most hormones occurs in short bursts, although some are secreted over longer periods of time in order to stimulate permanent changes to the body.
Hormones affect only specific target cells by (chemically) binding to specific receptors.
Circulating hormones travel around the body in the blood. Examples include adrenaline and testosterone.
Local hormones act on neighbouring cells without entering the bloodstream and are usually inactivated quickly. Examples include glucagon and serotonin.
8.1.3
Explain how circulating hormone levels are regulated.
3
They are regulated by complex feedback loops that may be influenced by:
• signals from the nervous system, such as adrenaline • chemical changes in the blood, such as insulin • other hormones, such as growth hormone.

Teacher’s notes 8.1.4
Explain the relationship between the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland.
3
The hypothalamus and the pituitary gland are together responsible for homeostasis.
•
The hypothalamus is the part of the brain that controls the pituitary gland.
•
The pituitary gland is an endocrine gland located in the brain below the hypothalamus.
•
Neurohormones, such as GHRH and somatostatin from the hypothalamus, directly influence the pituitary gland.
•
Nerve impulses from the hypothalamus also stimulate the pituitary gland.
The pituitary gland secretes hormones, such as
Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and growth hormone (GH), that help regulate a wide range of bodily functions including growth, and water and temperature regulation.

Teacher’s notes 9.1.1
Define fatigue in sports.
1
A reversible, exercise-induced decline in performance.
9.1.2
Outline the different types of fatigue.
2
Limit to:
• peripheral fatigue—develops rapidly and is caused by reduced muscle cell force • central (or mental) fatigue—develops during prolonged exercise and is caused by impaired function of the central nervous system.
9.1.3
Distinguish between high intensity and endurance activities.
2
High-intensity exercise involves a vigorous bout of intense activity that may last for less than a second, or as long as 1–2 minutes, for example, some types of interval training, plyometrics. The major sources of energy for this are derived from anaerobic processes.
Endurance activities involve prolonged sessions
of low-intensity activity that may last from several minutes to several hours, for example, leisure cycling or jogging. The major sources of energy for endurance activities are aerobic processes.
9.1.4
Discuss causes of fatigue in different types of activity or exercise.
3
Fatigue is perceived differently by individual athletes and may depend on multiple factors such as age, level of fitness and the specific type of activity or exercise carried out.
On a physiological level, the development of peripheral fatigue in high-intensity activities depends on the rate of:
• depletion of energy sources (creatine phosphate and ATP) • increase in levels of the products of exercise such as lactate and hydrogen ions.
The physiological causes of peripheral fatigue in endurance activities include:
• depletion of muscle and liver glycogen reserves • reduction in Ca2+ release • depletion of acetylcholine • dehydration • electrolyte loss • overheating.
Central (mental) fatigue is a significant factor in many endurance sports caused by failure of neural transmission.

Topic 10: Friction and drag (8 hours)
Assessment statement
Obj
Teacher’s notes 10.1.1
Describe friction.
2
A force that acts parallel to the interface of two surfaces that are in contact, and opposes their relative motion.
The value of the force of friction, Ff is calculated
using:
Ff = μR
Where μ is the coefficient of friction and R is the normal reaction force.
10.1.2
Describe the coefficient of friction.
2
The coefficient of friction (COF, μ) is a
dimensionless scalar quantity which is the ratio of the force of friction, Ff between two bodies and the normal reaction force, R.
The magnitude of the coefficient of friction depends on the materials in contact: steel on ice
(in ice skating) has a low coefficient of friction;
rubber sole on the ground (running) has a high coefficient of friction.
The greater the interaction between the
molecules of the interfacing surfaces, the greater the size of the coefficient of friction.
Coefficients of friction range in value between zero and one, but can sometimes be higher.
10.1.3
Distinguish between the coefficient of static friction and dynamic friction.
2
When a force is applied to attempt to move a stationary object over another surface, we
consider the coefficient of static friction. At some
point, the force applied is sufficient to overcome the static friction and the object will begin to move. Once the object is in motion, we consider
the coefficient of dynamic friction. The coefficient of dynamic friction is usually lower than the coefficient of static friction.

10.1.5
Define drag.
1
Drag is the force or forces acting to oppose the motion of an object through a fluid medium such as air or water.
10.1.6
Outline different types of drag that can be found in a variety of sporting environments.
2
Limit to:
•
surface drag: As a body moves through a fluid, its outer surface catches a layer of the fluid nearby, slowing it down compared to the fluid further away and so causing drag.
This can be minimized by changing the surface to reduce the interaction between surface and fluid. Example: The use of shark-skin suits in swimming or shaving the swimmer’s body to make it smooth.
•
form drag: As a body pushes against a fluid, the fluid pushes back (action and reaction).
By streamlining the body and minimizing the surface area facing the direction of the motion, this type of drag is reduced.
Example: Cyclists adopting a low profile position.
•
wave drag: When a body moves along the surface of a fluid (usually water) some fluid is displaced to form a wave. These waves cause additional forces that oppose motion. Wave drag can be reduced by avoiding motion at the interface between air and water.
Example: Swimming underwater for as long as is allowed at the start of a race.

Environmental constraints include:
• physical factors such as gravity, altitude, light, music or noise as well as floor space, court surface and net or lines on the area of play • social factors, such as peer pressure, social and cultural expectations.
Task constraints include:
• the goal of the specific task • rules on actions or conditions on tasks • rules on the equipment used.
Examples of ways that coaches can manipulate
constraints include:
• modifying equipment available • modifying the size of playing areas • setting relevant task goals in games • choosing beat/tempo in dance • suggesting imagery ideas • enforcing specific rules/conditions for performance.

Teacher’s notes 11.1.3
Suggest how a constraints led approach to learning a given sport can influence motivation.
3
The impact of a constraints-led approach may be different for individual athletes.
Examples of how it can be used include the following.
•
Athlete: Minimize the number of rules. For example, in touch rugby, allow forward passes.
•
Environment: Limit the space available to participants. For example, in netball, have attackers and defenders in specific zones so that players focus on their own tasks.
•
Task: Modify the equipment so that the activity allows for more success. For example, increase the size of the golf ball (use a tennis ball) and the size of the golf club.
Such approaches might influence the motivation of the athlete in the short term and can have longer-term consequences for the evolution of talent.

Topic 12: Genetics and athletic performance (7 hours)
Assessment statement
Obj
Teacher’s notes 12.1.1
Outline the role of genes in the inheritance of human characteristics.
2
Limit to the following.
•
Chromosomes are mainly made of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), sections of which are referred to as genes.
•
DNA undergoes replication as part of cell division to pass on the genes to new cells.
•
Children inherit genes from their parents via the sex cells (gametes), with 50% from the mother and 50% from the father. Many millions of different combinations of these genes from the same parents are possible.
•
Human characteristics (or phenotype) are determined by their genes (the genotype).
•
Some characteristics are expressed developmentally by genes (for example, eye colour, gender), others also require an environmental switch (for example, height,
VO2max).
Note: Students are not expected to know the
structure of DNA, the mechanism of replication, or the details of meiosis.
12.1.2
Outline how genes can influence human characteristics.
2
Limit to the following.
•
Genes code for the production of proteins, which are responsible for the development of an individual.
•
Genes can be switched on or switched off depending on internal or external factors, so that characteristics influencing athletic performance can change during a person’s lifetime.
•
Multiple genes determine the measurable heritable characteristics for each individual so it is highly unlikely that a single or even a few genetic elements are associated with superior athletic performance.
Note: Students are not expected to know the mechanisms of transcription or regulation of gene expression.

Teacher’s notes 12.1.3
Discuss the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors on performance in different sports.
3
Characteristics that are influenced by genetics include height, muscle fibre type, anaerobic threshold, lung capacity and flexibility.
Environmental factors that also influence performance include physical training, nutrition, technological aids and climate.
Training maximizes the likelihood of obtaining a performance level with a genetically controlled ceiling.
Elite athletes can be distinguished from less well performing athletes with respect to both inherited (genetic) characteristics and training histories.
It is presently not possible to ascertain the relative contribution of genetics or training to elite sporting performance, and this contribution is likely to differ for different sports.
TOK: Both environmental and genetic factors influence sporting performance. When two areas of knowledge are linked, how can we decide which has more relevance?
Aim 8: Studies on twins have provided much scientific knowledge about the “nature versus nurture” debate, but are such studies morally acceptable?
12.1.4
Discuss the implications of genetic screening for sports, exercise and health.
3
Consider:
• the identification of life-threatening conditions such as risk of sudden cardiac death, connective tissue disorder • the potential to predict susceptibility to injury and so reduce risk/improve safety for an individual athlete • ethical implications of involuntary exclusion from, or discrimination in, one or more sports • ethical implications of discrimination beyond sport, for example, in employment • the possibility of gene doping in the future to improve athletic performance.
Link to option B: Psychology of sports: Talent identification and development

State the function of the immune system.
1
The immune system protects the body from
infectious disease. It is involved in tissue repair and protection against potential pathogens.
13.1.2
Outline the mechanisms the body uses in response to damage or an infectious agent.
2
Limit to the following.
•
Physical: skin, epithelial linings, mucosal secretions •
Chemical: pH of bodily fluids, hormones and other soluble factors •
Leucocytes: white blood cells that fight disease •
Inflammation •
Clotting •
Lymphocyte and antibody production 13.1.3
Describe the effects of intense and long-term training on the immune system.
2
An intense bout of exercise can cause tissue damage and so is accompanied by responses that are similar to those of an infection, such as:
• increase in leucocytes (dependent on the duration and intensity of exercise) • inflammation.
When training loads are high and prolonged, there tends to be a decrease in innate and adaptive immune function.
•
Sustained increases in levels of cortisol and adrenaline over long periods suppress the immune system.
Leucocyte numbers drop compared to sedentary people.

Syllabus content—AHL
Sports, exercise and health science guide 64
Assessment statement
Obj
Teacher’s notes 13.1.4
Discuss the relationship between exercise and susceptibility to infection.
3
Athletes are more susceptible to infections than their sedentary peers because of:
• lower leucocyte numbers caused by the stress of the exercise • inflammation caused by muscle damage • greater exposure to airborne bacteria and viruses because of an increased rate and depth of breathing.
The relationship between exercise intensity and susceptibility to disease can be seen as a
J curve because an elite athlete has not only to be physically fit but also have an immune system able to withstand infections, even during severe physiological and psychological stress.
Moderate exercise, however, is associated with reduced susceptibility to infection.
13.1.5
Describe strategies for minimizing risk from infection among athletes.
2 •
Incorporation of sufficient recovery time into training programmes.
•
Avoid close contact with people with infections.
•
Maintain oral hygiene.
•
Maintain hydration status.
•
Ensure water is pathogen-free.
•
Maintain good personal hygiene (for example, washing hands, avoiding hand-to mouth contact).
•
Maintain a suitable and varied diet.

A.2.9
Describe how an athlete should acclimatize to heat stress.
2
Performing training sessions in similar environmental conditions (heat and humidity) for 5 to 10 days results in almost total heat
acclimatization. Initially, the intensity of training should be reduced to avoid heat-related problems in these conditions.
National representative teams/sportspeople
choosing to acclimatize to the conditions of a host country during a major international sporting competition could be considered.
Aim 8: The cost associated with the acclimatization of athletes using environmental chambers and/or expensive overseas training facilities (science and technology drives demand) could be explored. This also raises an ethical implication that poorer nations are unable to afford such support mechanisms and so their athletes are disadvantaged in comparison to athletes from wealthier nations.
A.2.10
Discuss the physiological and metabolic adaptations that occur with heat acclimatization.
3
Include increased plasma volume, increased sweat response and reduced rate of muscle glycogen utilization.
A.2.11
Outline the principal means by which the body maintains core temperature in cold environments.
2
Consider shivering, non-shivering thermogenesis and peripheral vasoconstriction.
A.2.12
Explain why the body surface area to body mass ratio is important for heat preservation.
3
For example, tall, heavy individuals have a small body surface area to body mass ratio, which makes them less susceptible to hypothermia.
Small children tend to have a large body surface area to body mass ratio compared to adults.
This makes it more difficult for them to maintain normal body temperature in the cold.
A.2.13

3
Consider the thermal conductivity of water and air.
During cold-water immersion, humans generally lose body heat and become hypothermic at a rate proportional to the thermal gradient and the duration of exposure. During swimming, the
effect of cold water on body heat loss is increased because of greater convective heat loss. However, at high swimming speeds, the metabolic rate of the swimmer may compensate for the increased heat loss.

Outline the use of compression garments for sports recovery.
2
Compression garments (CGs) provide a means of applying mechanical pressure at the body surface, thereby compressing and supporting underlying tissue. They are relatively low cost, easy to use and are non-invasive. Although widely used across many different sports, evidence of any enhancement of recovery is inconclusive.

Discuss the use of different types of cryotherapy for elite and recreational athletes.
3
Consider:
• analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects for soft tissue • perception of enhanced recovery rates and improved performance • risks associated with exposure to prolonged or extreme cold • costs of the different therapies.
There is pressure to maximize sporting performance, meaning that athletes often experiment with extreme interventions even if
their safety and efficacy has not been established.

A.5.2
Define hypoxia.
1
This is the condition in which the oxygen supply to cells is insufficient.
A.5.3
Outline the physiological effects of altitude.
2
Decreased air density and so decreased oxygen partial pressure cause hypoxia, resulting in:
• respiratory responses (such as hyperventilation) • cardiovascular responses (such as elevated submaximal heart rate) • metabolic responses (for example.
production of energy and lactic acid via glycolysis may be limited).
A.5.4
Outline the effects of altitude on fluid balance.
2
Ambient air at elevated altitude is cool but humidity is low, enhancing fluid loss and leading to dehydration.
Fluid loss is exacerbated as a result of physical activity at altitude.
Altitude-induced diuresis (increased urine production) also occurs.
A.5.5
Outline altitude training.
2
This is training for endurance athletes at altitudes above 2,000 m for several weeks or months in order to gain a competitive advantage in low altitude competitions.
Training at moderate or high altitude, where the oxygen partial pressure is low, can trigger the release of the hormone erythropoietin (EPO), which stimulates increased red blood cell production.

A.5.7
Evaluate the impact of altitude on sports performance.
3
Performance in different sports (for example, endurance events such as cross-country skiing compared to high-velocity events such as cycling) may be enhanced or impaired by the following effects.
•
Lower air density means drag is lower at high altitude.
•
Lower partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) causes reduced maximum aerobic capacity.
•
Projectile motion (for example, ball sports, throwing, shooting and ski jumping) is also altered by reduced air density.
TOK: High-altitude training camps are routinely used by endurance athletes. How do we decide if a training method is ethically justified?
A.5.8
Explain the adaptations resulting from altitude hypoxia.
3

Teacher’s notes
Multidimensional talent identification and development (TID) recognizes that talent also evolves as a result of an athlete actively interacting with the environment and having the resilience to cope with the challenges and setbacks they encounter. The evolution of talent can be facilitated through the application of psychological behaviours that include:
• mental imagery • realistic goal setting • effective evaluation of performance/self evaluation • self-reinforcement • training to a high intensity (outside comfort zone) • handling failure • performance arousal and control.
Multidimensional TID incorporates the following.
•
Monitoring an individual’s progress and behaviour during a development programme over time. The ability to adapt is a key feature of true elite athletes and is unlikely to be identified by snapshot observations.
•
Balancing weaknesses in one area and strengths in other areas (for example, height and speed as well as dedication and commitment when faced with adversity in basketball).
•
Providing athletes with opportunities to develop psychological behaviours along with sport-specific skills over long periods of time that facilitate progress from one stage of development to another. (See the stages of development in B.5.3 below.)
Aim 8: Discuss how the effect of maturation makes prediction of adult performance from adolescent data difficult.
TOK: There is a significant disagreement in TID research owing to the complexity of talent: many key performance determinants in sports are not fixed and are not easily measurable. How can we decide which ways of knowing are most reliable when seeking to answer questions?

B.5.3
Explain the evolution of talent for athlete development.
3
Bloom (1985) and Cote (1999) suggest that the four stages of development that an elite performer is likely to progress through are as follows.
1.
Initiation stage 2.
Development stage 3.
Mastery stage 4.
Maintenance (perfection) stage
Different psychological behaviours (such as coach or parent-led versus self-determined motivation)
and sports participation goals (such as enjoyment, skill development or performance mastery) will vary according to the athlete’s stage.
The existence of stages suggests that as athletes encounter opportunities (such as the opportunity
to train with a specialist coach, increase in hours of
deliberate practice), obstacles (such as an injury) and
progressions (such as transition to the next stage of development), many aspects of their performance may become unstable.
The developing athlete uses psychological behaviours to cope with these unstable periods.
These behaviours are key to continued development
of the individual and consistent production of world class performances by elite athletes.
B.5.4
Outline talent transfer for elite athletes changing to a second sport.
2
Talent transfer is a reduction or cessation of participation in one sport in order to pursue another sport that involves similar skills or physiological requirements.
•
It may be prompted by injury, a plateau in performance, loss of motivation or retirement.
•
It may be initiated by the athlete or co ordinated by a sporting organization.
•
It commonly prolongs an athlete’s sporting career and can lead to greater success than that in the first sport.
Progress through the stages of development in
the new sport is usually rapid because the athlete:
• has the capacity to use psychological behaviours to respond to challenges • can exploit existing physiological traits and motor skills • has improved motivation.
Examples include changes from sprinting or cycling to winter sports such as skeleton luge or bobsleigh, and changes from gymnastics to diving or pole vaulting.

B.6 Self-determination theory and self-regulated learning (HL only) 5 hours
Assessment statement
Obj
Teacher’s notes
B.6.1
Describe self-determination theory (SDT).
2
Self-determination theory (SDT) describes how the level and the amount of energy that
athletes devote to learning activities is a dynamic continuum characterized by a balance between:
• autonomy—making one’s own decisions about what we do and being in control of ourselves and our behaviours (for example, training because you want to, not because someone says you should) • competence—feeling able to accomplish a task (for example, completing a cross country run without having to stop for a rest) • relatedness—the feeling of a shared experience with others, of belonging to and being accepted by a group (for example, being part of a basketball team).
B.6.2
Describe self-regulated learning (SRL).
2
Self-regulated learning (SRL) refers to the processes that assist learners in managing their own thoughts, behaviours and emotions in order to control their own learning experiences.
SRL encourages athletes to become more independent in their learning and so enhances learning outcomes.
Athletes exert this control by planning and regulating their own actions towards their learning goals.
There are four interdependent cyclical phases (Pintrich 2000) through which an athlete manages their progression.
1.
Forethought phase (goal-setting and planning) 2.
Monitoring phase (tracking progress and awareness of current performance in relation to goals) 3.
Control phase (adapting learning strategies to better complete the task) 4.
Reflection phase (evaluating performance with respect to goals and the effectiveness of the chosen strategy)
Self-reflections influence athletes’ future planning/goals, prompting the cycle to begin again.

Teacher’s notes
B.6.3
Discuss the relationship between self-regulated learning and motivation in sports.
3
Motivation is a critical factor in the self-regulated learning framework.
Forethought (planning) phase •
Athletes who do not see value in tasks are less likely to spend much time setting goals and planning strategies.
•
Higher self-efficacy beliefs increase the use of self-regulation strategies.
Monitoring phase •
Intrinsic motivation affects level of effort in completing tasks and use of self-regulation strategies.
Reflection phase •
An athlete’s causal attributions (factors athletes attribute to their success or failure) affect whether or not they choose to engage in an activity and utilize self-regulation strategies for similar future activities.
Athletes who are motivated to learn are more likely to invest the time and energy needed to
learn and apply SRL skills. Similarly, athletes who are able to successfully employ self-regulation strategies often become more motivated to complete learning tasks.

3
Int: Consider how various populations have
changed their lifestyles from one of high physical
activity (traditional, agricultural-based living) to
one of low physical activity (“westernized” living).
C.1.5

C.2.4
Explain the concept of risk factors in cardiovascular disease.
3
Consider the individual and accumulative effects (that is, the effects of having one risk factor versus a cluster) of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
TOK: The distinction between correlation and cause could be made here, and the need for carefully controlled experiments to test whether a correlation is the result of a causal link. An interesting discussion is whether physical inactivity is causal or correlative.
Aim 8: An interesting topic for consideration is the validity of animal experimentation as a part of the process of uncovering the causes of disease in humans and in the development of new pharmacological treatments.
Int: This is clearly a good opportunity to consider differences in cardiovascular disease risk in different populations. There are many examples where different ethnic groups appear to vary in
their susceptibility to cardiovascular disease and this could be considered from the perspective of genes (nature) versus lifestyle (nurture).
Aim 7: Use of sophisticated imaging techniques and technologies could be mentioned here. For example, use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and gamma cameras for capturing information about the extent and anatomical positioning of atherosclerotic plaque.

Discussion of the physiological mechanisms is
not required (for example, why inactivity “causes” high blood pressure). Emphasis should be on the concept that people who are physically inactive are more likely to have risk factors for cardiovascular disease. High blood pressure, obesity, type 2 diabetes and low HDL-cholesterol should be considered.
C.3 Physical activity and obesity 2 hours
Assessment statement
Obj
Teacher’s notes
C.3.1
Describe how obesity is determined.
2
Obesity is, by definition, an excess of body fat but, in reality, obesity is determined using indirect measurements of body fat, for example, body mass index (BMI) and waist girth. The description should be restricted to these two techniques. The
BMI values that define normal weight, overweight and obesity are widely accepted. Waist girth values that define abdominal obesity are gender and ethnicity- specific and reflect different levels of disease risk in obesity.
Int: BMI is the most widely used method of
measuring obesity, yet its limitations as a measure of “fatness” are well known.
The World Health Organization (WHO) cut-off points for underweight, overweight, obesity and fat distribution may need revision because the relationship between body mass index and body composition, and between indices of fat
distribution and the actual amount of visceral fat, differ across ethnic groups.
Aim 8: Obesity, particularly childhood obesity, is
associated with social stigmatization and bullying.
This raises an ethical issue around the routine, large-scale screening for obesity.
Aim 7/Aim 8: Sophisticated imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT), MRI and dual energy X-ray (DXA) provide state-of-the-art methods for measuring body fat. However, they
are costly, not widely available and, in the case of CT and DXA, expose the individual to radiation.

Consideration of the effects of age, gender and ethnicity is not required.
C.3.3
Discuss the concept of energy balance.
3
Energy balance is affected mainly by food intake, resting metabolic rate and physical activity.
Consider the effects of positive and negative energy balance on body weight and composition.
C.3.4
Outline how chemical signals arising from the gut and from the adipose tissue affect appetite regulation.
2
Only a simple account is expected.
Hormones are produced by the stomach and small
intestine after eating, and by adipose tissue (leptin).
These pass to an appetite control centre in the brain that regulates feelings of hunger and satiety.
TOK: Leptin was first discovered in mice and led to
the expectation that obesity could be “cured”. Later
discoveries in humans have shown that this initial expectation was misplaced. This is a good example of how scientific discoveries can sometimes be
taken out of context by the media and lead to false
hope by individuals affected by certain conditions.
C.4 Physical activity and type 2 diabetes 2 hours
Assessment statement
Obj
Teacher’s notes
C.4.1
Compare type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
3
Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder resulting in the destruction of the insulin producing cells of the pancreas. It usually manifests in young people.
Type 2 diabetes is a disease of insulin resistance,
particularly in skeletal muscle, and is highly related to obesity and older age.
Past terms for these disorders include insulin dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM and NIDDM); these terms are no longer used.
Consider also the way in which diabetes is treated:
type 1 with insulin; type 2 with diet and exercise, oral medication and/or insulin. Other less common forms of diabetes do not need to be discussed.

TOK: The nature of risk factors and the difficulties
of making decisions about the relative influence of nature and nurture could be discussed.
Int: There are clear differences in susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, with some populations having higher rates of incidence. For example, the experience of the Pima Indians is well documented. This could lead to a wider consideration of the diversity in human societies combined with the need for parity of esteem.
Aim 8: Ethical and economic decisions as to who should be treated, that is, the blood glucose level at which diabetes is diagnosed, could be considered.

C.5.5
Discuss the relationship between physical activity and bone health.
3
Weight-bearing physical activity is essential for
bone health but, in some cases, intense training in weight-conscious athletes gives rise to low body weight/body fat and eating disorders, leading to menstrual dysfunction and bone demineralization (osteoporosis). Changes in bone density are site specific and resistance training results in greater changes than endurance training. Consideration of the importance of weight-bearing exercise in children should be given.

C.8 Public health (HL only) 4 hours
Assessment statement
Obj
Teacher’s notes
C.8.1
Distinguish between non-communicable and communicable diseases.
2
Non-communicable diseases are not passed from person to person. They are usually of long duration and slow progression. Examples include
cardiovascular diseases, skin cancer, some chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes.
Communicable diseases are caused by an infectious agent or its toxins, which pass by direct or indirect transmission from person to person or via an animal, vector or the inanimate environment. Examples include pneumonia, malaria and influenza.
Int: The relative importance of communicable and non-communicable diseases varies in different parts of the world.
C.8.2
Outline population attributable risk (PAR).
2
Population attributable risk (PAR) is a calculation of the percentage or proportion of public health
burden that is caused by a particular risk factor, for example, smoking or physical inactivity.
PAR indicates the proportion of deaths or illnesses that would not occur if the risk factor was removed. For example, a PAR for lung cancer deaths associated with moderate smoking calculated as 52% means that 52% of lung cancer deaths would not occur if people in the population did not smoke.
The usefulness of the calculation is based on the
assumption of a causal link between the risk factor and health problems.

Int: Walking has been a feature of the lifestyle in many cultures for many years.
C.8.5
Outline the causes of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in athletes.
2
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is related to:
• underlying medical history (for example, genetic disorders such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)) • intensity of exercise • habitual weekly exercise.
TOK: Electrocardiogram screening has been used

Distinguish between compression, tension and shearing injuries.
2
Compression: Compact injury to a specific body part that causes bleeding, superficial or deep tissue bruising, broken bones or joint injuries (for example, colliding with another player or equipment).
Tension: Injury that occurs when a tissue is stretched beyond its normal limits (for example, when landing from a jump).
Shearing: Friction injury caused by two surfaces rubbing together (for example, contact between the skin and the ground), which can also affect other connective tissues, such as cartilage.
C.9.3
Distinguish between acute and chronic injuries.
2
Acute injuries: These occur suddenly as a result of a specific injury mechanism (for example, fractured wrist, anterior cruciate ligament tear, concussion).
Chronic injuries: These develop over a period of several weeks and are often caused by repetitive
activity (for example, tennis elbow, shin splints).

C.9.6
Explain how risks and hazards of exercise can be reduced.
3
Risk and hazard prevention strategies are sports specific and may differ according to the individual athlete. They include:
• regular moderate exercise • protective equipment • regular health and wellness evaluations with a medical professional • injury prevention strategies (for example, correct warm-up and cool-down, and stretching routines) • injury prevention education for coaches, referees and athletes.
C.9.7
Evaluate the benefits and hazards of exercise with regard to health.
3
Consider the following.
•
The risk associated by strenuous exercise may be outweighed by the benefits of physical activity.
•
There is evidence that habitual, moderate to vigorous exercise protects against CHD.
•
Some forms of moderate exercise, such as jogging, walking and cycling, also pose a risk of injury through collisions with vehicles and falls.

D.5 Glucose uptake (HL only) 4 hours
Assessment statement
Obj
Teacher’s notes
D.5.1
State the normal levels of blood glucose at rest.
1
The human body normally keeps blood glucose level very stable (between 4.0 mmol/L–4.5 mmol/L).
Consider:
• pre- and post-exercise levels • pre- and post-ingestion levels.
D.5.2
Outline the causes of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.
2
Hypoglycemia •
Insufficient food intake •
Excessive exercise •
High insulin levels among diabetics
Hyperglycemia •
Infections (such as a cold or flu) •
Low insulin levels in diabetics
Note: Hyperglycemia usually develops slowly, over several hours or days.
D.5.3
Explain the transportation of glucose across the cell membrane when at rest and during physical activity.
3
Include the following points.
•
Glucose uptake into a cell is facilitated by the glucose transport proteins GLUT4 and GLUT1.
•
Muscle fibres also contain glucose transport proteins GLUT1 and GLUT4.
•
During rest, most glucose enters cells via the
GLUT1 transporters.
•
GLUT4 transporters are stored inside intracellular vesicles that are translocated to the cell membrane, when needed, to allow for greater glucose movement into the cell.
•
GLUT4 transporters can be stimulated during rest by raised levels of insulin after eating.
•
GLUT4 transporters can also be stimulated, without insulin, during physical exercise.
This is the result of other stimuli such as calcium ions.
•
Glucose taken into the muscle cells is quickly converted to glucose-6-phosphate; this ensures that the concentration gradient for glucose movement is maintained.
D.5.4
Outline the effect of training on an athlete’s ability to take in glucose at the cellular level.
2
Exercise increases the amount of GLUT4 transport protein in cells which, in turn, enables a higher rate of glucose uptake into the cell for use as a fuel.

D.6 The effects of alcohol on performance and health (HL only) 3 hours
Int: Many countries have guidelines or recommendations for the intake of alcohol in relation to health, but
there is considerable variation from one country to another. There are also different cultural viewpoints on
positive and negative impacts of alcohol consumption.
Assessment statement
Obj
Teacher’s notes
D.6.1
Describe the acute effects of excess alcohol on the body.
2
Limit to:
• hydration and kidney function • cardiovascular system • thermoregulation • neurologic systems.
D.6.2
Outline the possible effects of excessive chronic alcohol intake on body systems.
2
Limit to liver, kidney, heart and brain.
D.6.3
Discuss the effects of alcohol on athletic performance.
3
Consider ergogenic and ergolytic effects from alcohol, for example:
• anti-tremor • balance • power and strength • endurance • speed • coordination • reaction time (RT) and cognitive processing • cardiac function • inhibition of gluconeogenesis.
Low amounts of alcohol (0.02–0.05 g/dL) might assist in sports such as shooting and archery by reducing hand tremors, but levels above this will have a negative impact. Any amount of alcohol is
likely to impair performance in activities such as running and power sports.

D.7 Antioxidants (HL only) 3 hours
Assessment statement
Obj
Teacher’s notes
D.7.1
Outline the role of antioxidants in the body.
2
Antioxidants are molecules that can prevent or limit the damaging effects of free radicals by turning them into substances that are far less reactive.
Free radicals are produced in the body as a by product of normal cellular function.
Nutrients such as vitamins A, C, and E are antioxidants. Several minerals such as selenium, copper and manganese are components of enzymes also involved in defence against free radicals.
Berries, red grapes, kale, broccoli and tea are examples of foods that contain antioxidants.
D.7.2
Explain the harmful effects of free radicals at the cellular level.
3
A free radical (or a reactive oxygen species (ROS))
is a particle that possesses at least one unpaired electron. Free radicals in the body include:
• superoxide • hydroxyl • nitric oxide.
These cause damage by removing electrons from
parts of the cell in order to create paired electrons in their own structures.
Free radicals can:
• remove electrons from cell and mitochondrial membranes, thereby affecting their permeability • remove electrons from molecules such as enzymes and DNA, thereby impairing their function.
D.7.3
Describe free radical production during exercise.
2
Free radicals are produced as a by-product of normal cell function, and cells produce natural antioxidants to counteract them.
Exhaustive exercise generates high levels of free radicals that cannot be controlled by natural antioxidants so that damage to cells may occur.
This is known as oxidative stress.
Training partially reduces the build-up of free radicals as a result of exhaustive exercise.

Teacher’s notes
D.7.4
Evaluate the role of antioxidants for combating the effects of free radicals.
3
Antioxidants are found in many foods, especially fruits and vegetables, and so are consumed as part of a healthy, well-balanced diet.
Many athletes consume antioxidants in dietary supplements as an extra defence against free radical damage.
There is no consistent evidence that these supplements reduce oxidative stress or have a positive impact on training or performance unless a pre-existing dietary deficiency exists.
Excess intake (above the recommended daily allowance (RDA)) may have detrimental effects on the body.
A lack of adequate regulation of the supplement industry means that some products are poorly formulated and may even contain banned substances.
TOK: Consuming supplements of vitamins C or E is widely believed to protect from damage by free radicals in sports, even though there is no consistent evidence that this is true. Under what circumstances do we allow our beliefs to dictate our behaviour?

Assessment
Assessment in the Diploma Programme
General
Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most important aims of assessment in the
Diploma Programme are that it should support curricular goals and encourage appropriate student
learning. Both external and internal assessments are used in the Diploma Programme. IB examiners mark
work produced for external assessment, while work produced for internal assessment is marked by teachers and externally moderated by the IB.
There are two types of assessment identified by the IB.
•
Formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is concerned with providing accurate
and helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of learning taking place and the nature of
students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop students’ understanding and capabilities.
Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide information to
monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives.
•
Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring student achievement.
The Diploma Programme primarily focuses on summative assessment designed to record student
achievement at, or towards the end of, the course of study. However, many of the assessment instruments
can also be used formatively during the course of teaching and learning, and teachers are encouraged to
do this. A comprehensive assessment plan is viewed as being integral with teaching, learning and course
organization. For further information, see the IB Programme standards and practices document.
The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not norm-referenced. This approach to
assessment judges students’ work by their performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, and
not in relation to the work of other students. For further information on assessment within the Diploma
Programme please refer to the publication Diploma Programme assessment: Principles and practice.
To support teachers in the planning, delivery and assessment of the Diploma Programme courses, a
variety of resources can be found on the OCC or purchased from the IB store (store.ibo.org). Additional
publications such as specimen papers and markschemes, teacher support materials, subject reports and
grade descriptors can also be found on the OCC. Past examination papers as well as markschemes can be purchased from the IB store.
Methods of assessment
The IB uses several methods to assess work produced by students.
Assessment criteria
Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended. Each criterion concentrates on
a particular skill that students are expected to demonstrate. An assessment objective describes what
students should be able to do, and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do it. Using
assessment criteria allows discrimination between different answers and encourages a variety of responses.

=== Page 115 ===
Assessment in the Diploma Programme
Sports, exercise and health science guide 105
Each criterion comprises a set of hierarchically ordered level descriptors. Each level descriptor is worth one
or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The maximum marks for each
criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are added
together to give the total mark for the piece of work.
Markbands
Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance against which responses are judged.
They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds
to a range of marks to differentiate student performance. A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which
particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.
Analytic markschemes
Analytic markschemes are prepared for those examination questions that expect a particular kind of
response and/or a given final answer from students. They give detailed instructions to examiners on how to
break down the total mark for each question for different parts of the response.
Marking notes
For some assessment components marked using assessment criteria, marking notes are provided. Marking
notes give guidance on how to apply assessment criteria to the particular requirements of a question.
Inclusive assessment arrangements
Inclusive assessment arrangements are available for candidates with assessment access requirements.
These arrangements enable candidates with diverse needs to access the examinations and demonstrate
their knowledge and understanding of the constructs being assessed.
The IB document Candidates with assessment access requirements provides details on all the inclusive
assessment arrangements available to candidates with learning support requirements. The IB document
Learning diversity in the International Baccalaureate programmes: Special educational needs within the
International Baccalaureate programmes outlines the position of the IB with regard to candidates with diverse
learning needs in the IB programmes. For candidates affected by adverse circumstances, the IB documents
General regulations: Diploma Programme and the Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Programme provide details on access consideration.
Responsibilities of the school
The school is required to ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided
to candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Candidates with
assessment access requirements and Learning diversity in the International Baccalaureate programmes: Special
educational needs within the International Baccalaureate programmes.

Assessment
Internal assessment
Purpose of internal assessment
Internal assessment is an integral part of the course and is compulsory for both SL and HL students. It
enables students to demonstrate the application of their skills and knowledge, and to pursue their personal
interests, without the time limitations and other constraints that are associated with written examinations.
The internal assessment should, as far as possible, be woven into normal classroom teaching and not be a
separate activity conducted after a course has been taught.
The internal assessment requirements at SL and at HL are the same. This “Internal assessment” section of the
guide should be read in conjunction with the “Internal assessment” section of the teacher support materials.
Guidance and authenticity
The work submitted for internal assessment must be the student’s own. However, it is not the intention
that students should decide upon a title or topic and be left to work on the internal assessment component
without any further support from the teacher. The teacher should play an important role during both
the planning stage and the period when the student is working on the internally assessed work. It is the
responsibility of the teacher to ensure that students are familiar with:
•
the requirements of the type of work to be internally assessed •
the IB animal experimentation policy and the SEHS course safety guidelines (see “Safety requirements and recommendations”) •
the assessment criteria—students must understand that the work submitted for assessment must address these criteria effectively.
Teachers and students must discuss the internally assessed work. Students should be encouraged to initiate
discussions with the teacher to obtain advice and information, and students must not be penalized for
seeking guidance. As part of the learning process, teachers should read and give advice to students on one
draft of the work. The teacher should provide oral or written advice on how the work could be improved,
but not edit the draft. The next version handed to the teacher must be the final version for submission.
It is the responsibility of teachers to ensure that all students understand the basic meaning and significance of
concepts that relate to academic honesty, especially authenticity and intellectual property. Teachers must ensure
that all student work for assessment is prepared according to the requirements and must explain clearly to
students that the internally assessed work must be entirely their own. Where collaboration between students is
permitted, it must be clear to all students what the difference is between collaboration and collusion.
All work submitted to the IB for moderation or assessment must be authenticated by a teacher, and must
not include any known instances of suspected or confirmed malpractice. Each student must confirm that
the work is his or her authentic work and constitutes the final version of that work. Once a student has
officially submitted the final version of the work it cannot be retracted. The requirement to confirm the
authenticity of work applies to the work of all students, not just the sample work that will be submitted to
the IB for the purpose of moderation. For further details refer to the IB publication Academic honesty, The
Diploma Programme: From principles into practice and the relevant articles in General regulations: Diploma
Programme.

=== Page 121 ===
Internal assessment
Sports, exercise and health science guide 111
Authenticity may be checked by discussion with the student on the content of the work, and scrutiny of one or more of the following.
•
The student’s initial proposal •
The first draft of the written work •
The references cited •
The style of writing compared with work known to be that of the student •
The analysis of the work by a web-based plagiarism detection service such as www.turnitin.com
The same piece of work cannot be submitted to meet the requirements of both the internal assessment and the extended essay.
Group work
Each investigation is an individual piece of work based on different data collected or measurements
generated. Ideally, students should work on their own when collecting data. In some cases, data collected
or measurements made can be from a group experiment, provided each student collected his or her own
data or made his or her own measurements. In SEHS, in some cases, group data or measurements may be
combined to provide enough for individual analysis. Even in this case, each student should have collected
and recorded their own data and they should clearly indicate which data are theirs.
It should be made clear to students that all work connected with the investigation should be their own. It is
therefore helpful if teachers try to encourage in students a sense of responsibility for their own learning so
that they accept a degree of ownership and take pride in their own work.
Time allocation
Internal assessment is an integral part of the SEHS course, contributing 20% to the final assessment in the
SL and the HL courses. This weighting should be reflected in the time that is allocated to teaching the
knowledge, skills and understanding required to undertake the work, as well as the total time allocated to carry out the work.
It is recommended that a total of approximately 10 hours of teaching time for both SL and HL should be allocated to the work. This should include:
•
time for the teacher to explain to students the requirements of the internal assessment •
class time for students to work on the internal assessment component and ask questions •
time for consultation between the teacher and each student •
time to review and monitor progress, and to check authenticity.
Safety requirements and recommendations
While teachers are responsible for following national or local guidelines, which may differ from country to
country, attention should be given to the following guidelines, which were developed by The Laboratory
Safety Institute (LSI). The guidelines are posted on both LSI’s website (labsafetyinstitute.org/) and the
website of the International Council of Associations for Science Education (ICASE) Safety Committee.
(www.icaseonline.net/safety.html).

It is a basic responsibility of everyone involved to make safety and health an ongoing commitment. Any
advice given will acknowledge the need to respect the local context, the varying educational and cultural
traditions, the financial constraints and the legal systems of differing countries.

Using assessment criteria for internal assessment
For internal assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion has
level descriptors describing specific achievement levels, together with an appropriate range of marks. The
level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure to achieve may be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL against the criteria using the level descriptors.
•
The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.
•
The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained
by the student, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be
made when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark
awarded should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is
not necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.
•
When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors for each criterion until
they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a
piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the
one that more appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.
•
Where there are two or more marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper marks
if the student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent; the work may be close
to achieving marks in the level above. Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work
demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in the level below.
•
Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.
•
Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying
the appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.

=== Page 125 ===
Internal assessment
Sports, exercise and health science guide 115 •
The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by a
student. Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of the work being assessed.
•
A student who attains a high achievement level in relation to one criterion will not necessarily
attain high achievement levels in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a student who attains a low
achievement level for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the other
criteria. Teachers should not assume that the overall assessment of the students will produce any particular distribution of marks.
•
It is recommended that the assessment criteria be made available to students.
Practical work and internal assessment
General introduction
The internal assessment requirements are the same for biology, chemistry, physics and SEHS. The internal
assessment, worth 20% of the final assessment, consists of one scientific investigation. The individual
investigation should cover a topic that is commensurate with the level of the course of study.
Student work is internally assessed by the teacher and externally moderated by the IB. The performance in
internal assessment at both SL and HL is marked against common assessment criteria, with a total mark out of 24.
Note: Any investigation that is to be used to assess students should be specifically designed to match the relevant assessment criteria.
The internal assessment task will be one scientific investigation taking about 10 hours and the write-up
should be 6–12 pages long. Investigations exceeding this length will be penalized in the communication
criterion as lacking in conciseness. Examiners will be instructed not to read beyond the 12-page limit.
The practical investigation, with generic criteria, will allow a wide range of practical activities satisfying the
varying needs of biology, chemistry, physics and SEHS. The investigation addresses many of the learner
profile attributes well. See the “Approaches to teaching and learning” section for further links.
The task produced should be complex and commensurate with the level of the course. It should require a
purposeful research question and the scientific rationale for it. The marked exemplar material in the teacher
support materials will demonstrate that the assessment will be rigorous and of the same standard as the assessment in the previous courses.
Some of the possible tasks include:
• a hands-on laboratory investigation • manipulated or observational fieldwork • using a spreadsheet for analysis and modelling •
extracting data from a database and analysing it graphically •
producing a hybrid of spreadsheet/database work with a traditional hands-on investigation •
using a simulation, provided it is interactive and open-ended.
Some tasks may consist of relevant and appropriate qualitative work combined with quantitative work.

The tasks include the traditional hands-on practical investigations as in the previous course. The depth
of treatment required for hands-on practical investigations is unchanged from the previous internal
assessment and will be shown in detail in the teacher support material. In addition, detailed assessment of
specific aspects of hands-on practical work will be assessed in the written papers as detailed in the relevant
topic(s) in the “Syllabus content” section of the guide.
The task will have the same assessment criteria for SL and HL. The five assessment criteria are personal
engagement, exploration, analysis, evaluation and communication.

Levels of performance are described using multiple indicators per level. In many cases the indicators
occur together in a specific level, but not always. Also, not all indicators are always present. This means
that a candidate can demonstrate performances that fit into different levels. To accommodate this, the
IB assessment models use markbands and advise examiners and teachers to use a best-fit approach in
deciding the appropriate mark for a particular criterion.
Teachers should read the guidance on using markbands in the section called “Using assessment criteria
for internal assessment” before starting to mark. It is also essential to be fully acquainted with the marking
of the exemplars in the teacher support material. The precise meaning of the command terms used in the
criteria can be found in the glossary of the subject guide.

Rationale for practical work
Although the requirements for internal assessment are centred on the investigation, the different types of
practical activities that a student may engage in serve other purposes, including:
•
illustrating, teaching and reinforcing theoretical concepts •
developing an appreciation of the essential hands-on nature of much scientific work •
developing an appreciation of scientists’ use of secondary data from databases •
developing an appreciation of scientists’ use of modelling •
developing an appreciation of the benefits and limitations of scientific methodology.
Practical scheme of work
The practical scheme of work (PSOW) is the practical course planned by the teacher and acts as a summary
of all the investigative activities carried out by a student. Students at SL and HL in the same subject may carry out some of the same investigations.
Syllabus coverage
The range of practical work carried out should reflect the breadth and depth of the subject syllabus at each
level, but it is not necessary to carry out an investigation for every syllabus topic. However, all students must
participate in the group 4 project and the internal assessment investigation.
Planning your practical scheme of work
Teachers are free to formulate their own practical schemes of work by choosing practical activities according
to the requirements outlined. Their choices should be based on:
• subjects, levels and options taught • the needs of their students • available resources • teaching styles.
Each scheme must include some complex experiments that make greater conceptual demands on students.
A scheme made up entirely of simple experiments, such as ticking boxes or exercises involving filling in
tables, will not provide an adequate range of experience for students.
Teachers are encouraged to use the OCC to share ideas about possible practical activities by joining in the
discussion forums and adding resources in the subject home pages.
Flexibility
The practical programme is flexible enough to allow a wide variety of practical activities to be carried out.
These could include:
•
short labs or projects extending over several weeks • computer simulations • using databases for secondary data • developing and using models

=== Page 132 ===
Internal assessment
Sports, exercise and health science guide 122 •
data-gathering exercises such as questionnaires, user trials and surveys • data-analysis exercises • fieldwork.
Practical work documentation
The 4/PSOW form is a record of all practical activities carried out by a class. The form is not required to
moderate the individual investigations, so it is not necessary to submit this form. However, the 4/PSOW
is an essential planning and recording document for teachers to ensure that a suitable range of practical
activities is carried out and that the appropriate hours are allocated to practical work. Teachers should
continue to maintain this form (or their own version of it including all the same information) to record the
practical activities carried out by the class. The form should be retained in the school and made available to
the IB, for example, during the five-year school evaluation process.
Time allocation for practical work
The recommended teaching times for all Diploma Programme courses are 150 hours at SL and 240 hours
at HL. Students at SL are required to spend 40 hours, and students at HL 60 hours, on practical activities
(excluding time spent writing up work). These times include 10 hours for the group 4 project and 10 hours
for the internal assessment investigation. (Only 2–3 hours of investigative work can be carried out after the
deadline for submitting work to the moderator and still be counted in the total number of hours for the practical scheme of work.)

Assessment
The group 4 project
The group 4 project is an interdisciplinary activity in which all Diploma Programme science students must
participate. The intention is that students from the different group 4 subjects analyse a common topic
or problem. The exercise should be a collaborative experience where the emphasis is on the processes
involved in, rather than the products of, such an activity.
In most cases, students in a school would be involved in the investigation of the same topic. Where
there are large numbers of students, it is possible to divide them into several smaller groups containing
representatives from each of the science subjects. Each group may investigate the same topic or different
topics—that is, there may be several group 4 projects in the same school.
Students studying environmental systems and societies are not required to undertake the group 4 project.
Summary of the group 4 project
The group 4 project is a collaborative activity where students from different group 4 subjects work together
on a scientific or technological topic, allowing for concepts and perceptions from across the disciplines to
be shared in line with aim 10—that is, to “develop an understanding of the relationships between scientific
disciplines and their influence on other areas of knowledge”. The project can be practically or theoretically
based. Collaboration between schools in different regions is encouraged.
The group 4 project allows students to appreciate the environmental, social and ethical implications
of science and technology. It may also allow them to understand the limitations of scientific study, for
example, the shortage of appropriate data and/or the lack of resources. The emphasis is on interdisciplinary
cooperation and the processes involved in scientific investigation, rather than the products of such investigation.
The choice of scientific or technological topic is open but the project should clearly address aims 7, 8 and 10 of the SEHS subject guide.
Ideally, the project should involve students collaborating with those from other group 4 subjects at all
stages. To this end, it is not necessary for the topic chosen to have clearly identifiable separate subject
components. However, for logistical reasons, some schools may prefer a separate subject “action” phase (see the following “Project stages” section).
Project stages
The 10 hours allocated to the group 4 project, which are part of the teaching time set aside for developing
the practical scheme of work, can be divided into three stages: planning, action and evaluation.

=== Page 134 ===
The group 4 project
Sports, exercise and health science guide 124
Planning
This stage is crucial to the whole exercise and should last about two hours.
•
The planning stage could consist of a single session, or two or three shorter ones.
•
This stage must involve all group 4 students meeting to “brainstorm” and discuss the central topic, sharing ideas and information.
•
The topic can be chosen by the students themselves or selected by the teachers.
•
Where large numbers of students are involved, it may be advisable to have more than one mixed subject group.
After selecting a topic or issue, the activities to be carried out must be clearly defined before moving from
the planning stage to the action and evaluation stages.
A possible strategy is that students define specific tasks for themselves, either individually or as members of
groups, and investigate various aspects of the chosen topic. At this stage, if the project is to be experimentally
based, apparatus should be specified so that there is no delay in carrying out the action stage. Contact with
other schools, if a joint venture has been agreed, is an important consideration at this time.
Action
This stage should last around six hours and may be carried out over one or two weeks in normal scheduled
class time. Alternatively, a whole day could be set aside if, for example, the project involves fieldwork.
•
Students should investigate the topic in mixed-subject groups or single-subject groups.
•
There should be collaboration during the action stage; findings of investigations should be shared
with other students within the mixed-/single-subject group. During this stage, in any practically based
activity, it is important to pay attention to safety, ethical and environmental considerations.
Note: Students studying two group 4 subjects are not required to do two separate action phases.
Evaluation
The emphasis during this stage, for which two hours are probably necessary, is on students sharing their
findings, both successes and failures, with other students. How this is achieved can be decided by the teachers, the students or jointly.
•
One solution is to devote a morning, afternoon or evening to a symposium where all the students, as
individuals or as groups, give brief presentations.
•
Alternatively, the presentation could be more informal and take the form of a science fair where
students circulate around displays summarizing the activities of each group.
The symposium or science fair could also be attended by parents, members of the school board and the
press. This would be especially pertinent if some issue of local importance has been researched. Some of the
findings might influence the way the school interacts with its environment or local community.

Sports, exercise and health science guide 125
Addressing aims 7 and 8
Aim 7: “develop and apply 21st-century communication skills in the study of science”.
Aim 7 may be partly addressed at the planning stage by using electronic communication within and
between schools. It may be that technology (for example, data logging, spreadsheets, databases and so
on) will be used in the action phase and certainly in the presentation/evaluation stage (for example, use of
digital images, presentation software, websites, digital video and so on).
Aim 8: “become critically aware, as global citizens, of the ethical implications of using science and technology”.
Addressing the international dimension
There are also possibilities in the choice of topic to illustrate the international nature of the scientific
endeavour and the increasing cooperation required to tackle global issues involving science and technology.
An alternative way to bring an international dimension to the project is to collaborate with a school in another region.
Types of project
While addressing aims 7, 8 and 10, the project must be based on science or its applications. The project may
have a hands-on practical action phase or one involving purely theoretical aspects. It could be undertaken in a wide range of ways, such as:
•
designing and carrying out a laboratory investigation or fieldwork •
carrying out a comparative study (experimental or otherwise) in collaboration with another school •
collating, manipulating and analysing data from other sources, such as scientific journals,
environmental organizations, science and technology industries and government reports • designing and using a model or simulation •
contributing to a long-term project organized by the school.
Logistical strategies
The logistical organization of the group 4 project is often a challenge to schools. The following models
illustrate possible ways in which the project may be implemented.
Models A, B and C apply within a single school, and model D relates to a project involving collaboration between schools.
Model A: Mixed-subject groups and one topic
Schools may adopt mixed-subject groups and choose one common topic. The number of groups will depend on the number of students.
Model B: Mixed-subject groups adopting more than one topic
Schools with large numbers of students may choose to do more than one topic.

=== Page 136 ===
The group 4 project
Sports, exercise and health science guide 126
Model C: Single-subject groups
For logistical reasons, some schools may opt for single-subject groups, with one or more topics in the action
phase. This model is less desirable as it does not show the mixed-subject collaboration in which many scientists are involved.
Model D: Collaboration with another school
The collaborative model is open to any school. To this end, the IB provides an electronic collaboration board
on the OCC where schools can post their project ideas and invite collaboration from other schools. This
could range from merely sharing evaluations for a common topic to a full-scale collaborative venture at all stages.
For schools with few Diploma Programme students or schools with Diploma Programme course students,
it is possible to work with non-Diploma Programme or non-group 4 students or undertake the project once
every two years. However, these schools are encouraged to collaborate with another school. This strategy
is also recommended for individual students who may not have participated in the project, for example,
through illness or because they have transferred to a new school where the project has already taken place.
Timing
The 10 hours that the IB recommends be allocated to the project may be spread over a number of weeks.
The distribution of these hours needs to be taken into account when selecting the optimum time to carry
out the project. However, it is possible for a group to dedicate a period of time exclusively to project work if all/most other schoolwork is suspended.
Year 1
In the first year, students’ experience and skills may be limited and it would be inadvisable to start the
project too soon in the course. However, doing the project in the final part of the first year may have the
advantage of reducing pressure on students later on. This strategy provides time for solving unexpected problems.
Year 1–Year 2
The planning stage could start, the topic could be decided upon, and provisional discussion in individual
subjects could take place at the end of the first year. Students could then use the vacation time to think
about how they are going to tackle the project and would be ready to start work early in the second year.
Year 2
Delaying the start of the project until some point in the second year, particularly if left too late, increases
pressure on students in many ways: the schedule for finishing the work is much tighter than for the other
options; the illness of any student or unexpected problems will present extra difficulties. Nevertheless,
this choice does mean students know one another and their teachers by this time, have probably become
accustomed to working in a team and will be more experienced in the relevant fields than in the first year.
Combined SL and HL
Where circumstances dictate that the project is only carried out every two years, HL beginners and more experienced SL students can be combined.

=== Page 137 ===
The group 4 project
Sports, exercise and health science guide 127
Selecting a topic
Students may choose the topic, or propose possible topics, and the teacher then decides which one is the
most viable based on resources, staff availability and so on. Alternatively, the teacher selects the topic or
proposes several topics from which students make a choice.
Student selection
Students are likely to display more enthusiasm and feel a greater sense of ownership for a topic that they
have chosen themselves. A possible strategy for student selection of a topic, which also includes part of
the planning stage, is outlined here. At this point, subject teachers may provide advice on the viability of proposed topics.
•
Identify possible topics by using a questionnaire or a survey of students.
•
Conduct an initial “brainstorming” session of potential topics or issues.
•
Discuss, briefly, two or three topics that seem interesting.
•
Select one topic by consensus.
•
Students make a list of potential investigations that could be carried out. All students then discuss
issues such as possible overlap and collaborative investigations.
A reflective statement written by each student on their involvement in the group 4 project must be included
on the coversheet for each internal assessment investigation. See Handbook of procedures for the Diploma
Programme for more details.
