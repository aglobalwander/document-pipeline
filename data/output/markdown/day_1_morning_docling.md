## SELF-DIRECTEDNESS AS A 3-LEGGED STOOL WHAT?

The metaphor of the three-legged stool

- HOM thoughtful learners in a classroom setting
- CC thoughtful conversations between individuals
- AS thoughtful conversations within groups

## WHY?

Metaphors help us to make connections.

The metaphor offers us the history of this work.

## HOW?

## Suggested Language:

We refer to this body of work as a 3-legged stool. The 3 legs support self-directedness. The first leg is Habits of Mind, created by Art Costa and Bena Kallick, and is applied to the creation of thoughtful learning communities in a classroom setting.

Second leg of the stool is Cognitive CoachingSM created by Art Costa and Bob Garmston, which is applied to thoughtful conversations between individuals.

The third leg of the stool, the topic of this seminar, is Adaptive Schools, the work of Bob Garmston and Bruce Wellman. Adaptive Schools is about developing collaborative groups and is the systems thinking that completes this 3-legged stool.

What are some of the things you know or have heard about these three legs? Please share with a partner at your table.

## TEACH HAND SIGNAL

## Suggested Language:

## WHAT?

In this seminar, we will be using a hand signal to gain attention.

## WHY?

Respectful way to reconvene the group Majority of audience members tend to be visual

## HOW?

Everyone, please raise your hand. When the hand is raised, please finish your thought and refocus your attention this direction. (Hands down.)  Often in this seminar, you will be engaged in a conversation with your back to the presenter. People who process visually will often be first to see the hand signal and respond. People who process auditorally will hear the diminished volume and refocus. People who process kinesthetically tend to go with the flow.

<!-- image -->

## metaphor

entering new territory… new administrator, new teacher, new position, new building, new team

confronted with new, complex tasks work harder -&gt; enter that maze alone cubicles

isolation breeds mediocrity

can't do it alone -&gt; collaboration

move from that to this.

## WHAT?

The following slides (cartoon, Garmston-Wellman quote, goal, video) generally introduce the Adaptive Schools work.

## WHY?

Using cartoons, quotations, metaphors, video, and direct goal language appeals to the variety of learners in the room.

HOW?

## Suggested Language:

Think about teachers entering a new building in September, students entering a new community, administrators coming in a new building. So often we enter a new, potentially challenging, situation alone and in isolation. Particularly when you are entering into change alone, it  may seem daunting.

<!-- image -->

still just chatting… cordial / friendly

conviviality feels better…at least we huddle

still not where we need to be

True collaboration --&gt; greater, positive effects!

Resourcefulness inside organization stand on shoulders of others who can already do something, see far --&gt; boost others --&gt; can see farther

High level of trust need communities -- feel safe to say: I don't know how to…

Good at something --&gt; kept to ourselves Bad --&gt; really kept ourselves

attitudes where we boost each other up? dispositions?

Collaborators -- trust enough --&gt; boost each other

Adults don't always know how to do that

GOAL:  critical

What does this goal mean to you? Partner listen with truly caring ear / paraphrase

collaborators-start to inquire / ask right questions getting right questions on table

-&gt; requires trust, talking in deep ways requires leadership in new ways

Will experience 50-60 strategies/moves

Tendency -&gt;  treasure chest of great strategies!!!

more than treasure chest -&gt;  asks your organization to examine its identity

strategies -&gt;  actuate the goal

intentional about what doing.

GOAL OF ADAPTIVE SCHOOLS, p. 16 Suggested Language:

And here's the goal of this work. Please read this goal and note what it's saying about identity. Identity is our bias.

Give time to read.

Share what you are noticing with an elbow partner.

## Give time to share.

Adaptive schools work is more than a treasure chest of strategies and moves; it asks PLCs, committees, work teams, and any productive group, to examine its identity. Who groups believe they are in relation to others and their work directly influences what the group pays attention to, how it defines its work, the internal and external group dynamics, and how the group makes decisions. This is a capacity-building seminar and the identity we are inviting you to hold is about being collaborators, inquirers, and leaders. We're going to be coming back to this throughout the seminar and tomorrow we'll go into more depth with the goal.

## 3 intentions

1-YOUR learning Learning = pattern breaking / making / taking record on chart paper Experience them -&gt; workplace

2-value and usefulness develop / sustain high functioning groups

3-classrooms working with students transfer isn't automatic-&gt;tips

pull aside curtain-&gt;strategies. harvest strategies-plan applications to work

TRIPLE TRACK AGENDA

Suggested Language:

WHAT?

Triple track agenda refers to using strategies in three settings: Here in this training, with adults, and with students.

Triple track agendas allow audience members to transfer into various settings. It also supports the brain in organizing the presentation.

## HOW?

Use the slide to display the Triple Track.

## Suggested Language:

On p. 15 of the Learning Guide, there is space for you to record strategies. There are also pages for taking notes on p. 131.

## pull away curtain

NOT icebreakers-negative presupposition People cold -&gt; broken open

1-participative group-expectation of interacting

- 2-come to meetings from somewhere else--geographically, emotionally, cognitively broken up fight, taught best lesson-need transition to use minds of people in meeting
- 3-Connects-work / each other
- 4-From egocentric to macrocentric-self to community

INCLUSION STRATEGY: LIKE ME Suggested Language: WHAT?

Inclusion strategy

## WHY?

Set norms of participation Focus mental energy in the room Who am I relationship to this group? Psychologically transition from self to group

## HOW?

Through a variety of strategies that we will be exploring in this seminar starting with Like Me.

<!-- image -->

## Suggested Language:

## WHAT?

One example of an Inclusion Strategy is called Like Me.

## WHY?

Like Me is an Inclusion Strategy the purpose of which is to build community; learn about each other; and is brain-friendly in that it exercises the body and brings oxygen to the brain.

## HOW?

Here are the directions for Like Me: Each time you hear a statement that pertains to you, stand up, then scan the room and make eye contact with others that are also standing.

## TRAINERS NOTE:

Decisions about how to present directions include:

Show, don't say.

Show, then unpack.

Show and read.

Fishbowl demonstration

Combinations of the above.

Make decisions about when to read the slides based on the diverse needs of the group. Considerations include:

Literacy of the group

Visual impairments

Need to add humor, energy, or drama Visual availability of the material Complexity of the directions Audience fatigue

Marzano-Students what are you doing?  Could tell researchers. why are you doing it and what are you learning? Couldn't tell them. Offered what, WHY, how -&gt; increased learning by 33%

Give HOW visually learn visual, but do auditory explain, model-shared responsibility -&gt; follow-through

self-directedness, but give directions orally dependent on teacher/facilitator belong to everyone in room.

Visual - kids attention issues may not always hear what, why, how words-always embedded WHAT, WHY, HOW FORMAT FOR STRATEGIES PRESENTATION WHAT?

What? Why? How? is a format for presenting strategies to learners/participants.

## WHY?

WHAT-WHY-HOW Format is a respectful way to meet the variety of learning styles in your audience.

## HOW?

After completing the Like Me Inclusion Strategy, show the 'Format for Strategies Presentation' slide to the group.

## Suggested Language:

Notice the manner in which the Like Me strategy was just offered to you. First, the What-the strategy was named and briefly described.

Next, the Why-giving rationale for the strategy, something that adult audiences appreciate, yet is sometimes absent. Language might include words like, 'purpose, intention, rationale, etc.'

And third, giving the How-whenever possible having the steps in the directions visibly available, respectfully promoting self-directed learning. Language might include words like, 'Directions, steps, process, etc.'

Initially, you will hear the specific words, 'What, Why, How.' As we move through the seminar and you begin to own the pattern, you will hear these synonyms we just offered.

## How of today -&gt; public agenda

Agenda keeps focus -&gt; connections / sense of order. Anchor -visual memory and resource

No times-territories live in together

Fluffy, artfully vague Always have agenda. Meeting w/o agenda = on trip without map Unfacilitated meetings = good car w/o steering wheel Facilitation is rotated (our bias). Leadership is distributed and collaborative

Shared responsibility

Direct link -&gt; relationships between adult culture and what happens for kids

## Fire pits / chiminea

sense of belonging / community -&gt; conversation Angeles Arrien-Four Fold Way Program 'intimacy-into me see' four principles (archetype)

- 1. Show up / choose to be present human resources of power, presence, communication.  'Warrior'
- 2. Pay attention to what has heart and meaning. human resources of love, gratitude, acknowledgment, validation.  'Healer'
- 3. Tell the truth without blame / judgment. Nonjudgmental truthfulness maintains our authenticity,-&gt; inner vision / intuition.  'Visionary"
- 4. Be open to outcome, not attached to outcome. Openness and nonattachment help us recover the human resources of wisdom, objectivity.  'Teacher'

WHAT

inclusion strategy honor context and people

## WHY

1-norms of participation

3-gracious

6-values head and heart.  Emotion in constructive way

7-elicits agendas might otherwise not be heard concerns about topic, having to leave early, distractions Suggested Language:

The purpose of Grounding is to set a norm for respectful listening, to get everyone's voice in the room in a manner that is not confrontational, to allow people to connect with one another, and to allow for the expressions of hopes and apprehensions, to value thinking and feeling, and to surface agendas that might not otherwise be heard.

<!-- image -->

Exercise in listening deeply

Misunderstandings happen when not listening discipline of respectful listening-nonverbals: eye contact / attentive posture

Someone else talking, planning own speech / usually is rebuttal art of collaboration-requires listeners

Refrain from verbal responses (uh huh, can you clarify) HOW:  1-name is precious-call out name, call ourselves present

2-

3-Doesn't matter how feel

4-Expectations

Starter's job…

earth time, not clock time--doesn't matter how long it takes

I will start starter.

Starter will share.

No responses.

Go to next person.

Come back to starter.

starter: back closest to \_\_\_ corner

Here are the directions for Grounding (Refer to slide.)

When the members indicate that they understand the process, the facilitator 'Starts the Starter,' that is, names the first speaker. For example, person with fanciest shoes, most visible buttons, most blue, traveled the farthest, etc.

Post prompts on screen. Starter will summarize themes and patterns from the Grounding.

When all groups are finished, the facilitator conducts debrief below.

<!-- image -->

## will process

Without reflection, there is no learning information that is not processed is quickly lost

## David Rock, 2010

·Because brain is social-&gt;creating processes that require people -&gt; talk regularly about project will facilitate change

•Simply talking once / week -&gt; brain circuits alive

DEBRIEF PROCESS WHAT?

Debrief content and process

WHY?

Adults don't learn from experience. They learn from processing experience.

HOW?

Suggested Language:

Some people think that adults learn from experience, but in truth they learn from PROCESSING experience. (Show slide.) Because of this, we will engage in a pattern of debrief that you will note for the four days. We will first debrief Content. (A fundamental content debrief question is, 'What are we learning?') and will follow with a debrief about the process (A fundamental process debrief question is, 'How has this process supported our learning?').

<!-- image -->

First, you reflected on content by asking the starter to give a summary of themes that emerged in your group.

Others may add to the starter's response.

Starters stand and report out themes and patterns.

Tips-For larger groups, inform group you will be taking a sample only.

The point of this debrief is to give the group its own data, and allows the facilitator to gather data that may support group resourcefulness.

<!-- image -->

Our relationship to the topic is…

We feel…

Our expectations about being here…

## Paraphrase group to give group their own data back

Usually sounds like this:

2-varied experience

3-generally excited, some angst, generally feeling positive

4-holding expectations about learnings-to take back so kids learn

## Debrief

expression of feelings / thinking.  Whatever is fine.  Gets it in room.  Up and away from people so can set it aside.  Don't take personally.  Just data.  Keeps group resourceful.

Offer group paraphrase.  Giving group back data.

First, you reflected on content by asking the starter to give a summary of themes that emerged in your group. Others may add to the starter's response.

<!-- image -->

having problems or need to talk about something hard to talk aboutGrounding is THE right tool for conflict!!!! helps people feel like they are heard.

Start the Starter examples

person closest to front of room, fancy shoes, wearing most blue, etc.

## Language:

Now as a whole group, we're opening space to reflect on the process by responding to these prompts.

Show prompts one at a time and allow time to read; then open space for responses.

<!-- image -->

Bookend reminder inclusion strategies-WHY?

1-certain things are consistently going to keep happening

-respectful way of listening, not always leader talking

2-values cognition / feeling, enter with head / heart

3-connects group members, allows for expression of hopes / fears -where are my stacks / where everyone else's

4-builds community-&gt;sense of collaborative-ness in room

## CLOSURE FOR INCLUSION STRATEGIES Suggested Language:

Grounding and Like Me are examples of Inclusion Strategies which honor each person's presence, connects people to each other, allows group members to learn about each other, and builds community.

OPTIONAL: Trainers may offer other examples of Inclusion Strategies..

HOW:  spend based on interest Write how many and where

ASSESSING THE GROUP: Penny Payout

LG, p. 19

Suggested Language:

WHAT?

Penny Payout is a strategy for group member choice-making.

## WHY?

Penny Payout will give you the big picture of what's coming and to make personal connect It offers an efficient prioritizing process.

Three charts with 'Facilitating Groups,' 'Developing Groups,' and 'Becoming a More Skillful Group Member' have been created and posted during prep time before the Seminar

Use the slide to present directions for Spend-A-Buck. Allow time for reading.

layer Penny Payout with Corners

<!-- image -->

2&amp;3-If spent most of money in facilitating groups, move to this corner.

When get there, do 2 things, group will be large, cluster with 2/3 and talk about why you chose this theme for your focus

Look at standing data. 'What might be some implications?'

4-move to the corner where you spent your next highest amount of pennies and reengage in discussions

## CORNERS

LG, p. 19

Suggested Language:

We are going to layer Spend a Buck with a strategy called Corners. Move to the corner where you spent the most pennies and cluster with 2-3 people and talk about the reasons you chose this area of interest.

Please move to the corner where you spent your next highest and repeat the process.

<!-- image -->

don't learn from experience-&gt; processing experience

## CONTENT-talk at table-what learn?

facilitator most important person in group?-Not so, is skillful group member is most influential.

Group only as productive/strong as skillful group member will allow --&gt; develop all.

Develop group every time-choose something to work on-listening, pausing, paraphrasing, etc. Group development is responsibility of everyone

How develop group?

Public agenda -&gt; focus, connections between items Norms, structures/strategies, assess

In the beginnings of the Adaptive Schools work, we began by focusing on those individuals that were designated as facilitators, and focused on teaching facilitation skills. We began to realize that we also had to focus in other areas as well, such as developing the identity and capacity of the entire group. This led to adding another area of focus, helping every individual group member develop his/her skills. The seminar will offer practical suggestions for growth in each of these three focus areas.

While offering this content background information, the trainer walks to each chart corner.

PROCESS-talk at table-how did 2 strategies help learn content?

<!-- image -->

talker inners / talker outers-&gt; balance is prioritizing strategy - recognize important for me / important for community groups generate own data-&gt;less likely to argue.

groups up, moving / loud…feels, looks, sounds - break

Research-how communicate with each other directly impact learning of kids-kids watching

Can't teach collaboration unless WE learn it, use it, model it

Next step is to do three things:

Please listen to them all before you move.

Number one is say, 'Thank you' to your partners; number two is to return to your seats; and number three is to talk about these two strategies, Spend a Buck and Corners. Talk about what you noticed, and how you might use them.

## Suggested Language:

WHAT?

Research indicates that the relationship among the adults in schools has a direct impact on the achievement of students in the school. We will offer findings from several different sources.

## WHY?

All of us bring a wealth of background knowledge and reading about Professional Learning Communities. In this strategy, we will develop a shared understanding of key elements around Professional Communities Learning.

A benefit is that Garmston and Wellman have synthesized a decade of research to offer to us in a concise way.
