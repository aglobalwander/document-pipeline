## HOW IDENTITY IS FORMED

The mechanisms of forming identity occur in the upper brain stem and in a set of nuclei in the thalamus and regions of the cerebral cortex (Damasio 2010). People construct a set of essential characteristics to define their self-concepts. They interpret experiences and choose behaviors that are intended to maintain the continuity of those self-concepts over time. Identity formation is dependent on the state of mind of consciousness. Damasio (1999, 26) calls the simplest kind of consciousness core consciousness . 'It provides the person with a sense of self about one moment-now and about one place-here.' There is also an extended consciousness that provides the person with a sense of self and places 'me' into a historical frame, richly aware of the lived past, the anticipated future, and the world beside oneself, the present. Damasio explains extended consciousness as a complex biological phenomenon that depends on conventional memory, working memory, reasoning, and language. The sense of self that emerges in core consciousness is a transient entity, ceaselessly recreated for each and every object with which the brain interacts. Our traditional sense of self, however, corresponds to a nontransient collection of unique facts and ways of being that characterize a person. Damasio calls this the autobiographical self.
