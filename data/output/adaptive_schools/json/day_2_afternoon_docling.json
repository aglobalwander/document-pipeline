To get the blood flowing back to your brain and away from your digestive system, and refocused on Adaptive Schools, we're going to use a strategy called Bumper Sticker.\n\n## WHY?\n\nThe purpose of this strategy is to energize and to focus and to support you in synthesizing learning from the morning by identifying important points. If everything is important, then nothing is.\n\n## HOW?\n\nAt your table, using the strip of paper we've given you, create a bumper sticker you would like to see on the bumper of every car in your school's parking lot. When finished post it on the wall.\n\n## Optional:\n\nHave groups create their bumper sticker and share out without using chart paper.\n\nWhat: text as expert, use of written word\n\nWhy: when construct own understanding -&gt;understand at deeper level, retain ponder collectively to construct understanding Inquiry is central to professional communities that produce stable gains in student learning\n\nWhat: disposition to be developed within school (was originally one of the 7 norms)\n\nHow: Say something-supports collaboratively constructing meaning from written text\n\n## clarifications?\n\nOPTIONAL:\n\nSay Something\n\n## TRAINER NOTE:\n\nPresenter may invite participants to read pages in the LG at a later time.\n\ncomic is humorous signal to silence our technology\n\nexamples of working agreements from yesterday:\n\n'louder please' Hand signal / voice signal\n\n## WORKING AGREEMENTS\n\nLG, p. 44\n\nSuggested Language:\n\n## WHAT?\n\nAdaptive Schools distinguish between 'Norms,' which are the general best practices of all productive groups and 'Working Agreements,' which are the ad hoc agreements that each group creates depending on their needs. For example, 'Come on time,' 'Silence cell phones,' and 'Demonstrate mutual respect,' are Working Agreements.\n\nSetting working agreements with participant groups may be contextually driven. That is, they are congruent with the group's purposes and development. Agreements are also a way of applying the Norm of Paying Attention to Self and Others.\n\n## WHY?\n\nCreating and posting Working Agreements honors participant needs and styles, and provides a social lubricant for productive work. They also provide psychological safety for talking about difficult topics.\n\n## HOW?\n\nTee Up using cartoon such as 'I've got him on vibrate!'\n\n'group courtesies' and are idiosyncratic / specific to group\n\nNorms instead are ongoing, best practice of high performing groups the more friendly the group, the greater the need hard to refocus friends just\n\nif someone tries, then 'who died and made her queen? what's up with her? trying to have fun here!'\n\nex: 'Given this agenda, what might be our working agreements to get work done in any skillful group member can set / test working agreements safe way?'\n\nEx: I'm requesting that we make an agreement to start and end on time. 2x started 10 min late / finished 15 min later than planned.\n\nDialogue, discuss\u2026then decide on working agreement of starting on time Test 2 weeks later: I'd like to talk about decision we made 2 weeks ago about starting on time. Not happening. What do we need to do to keep our agreement?\n\nworking agreements as 3rd point in meetings\n\nwork safe -&gt; deepen level of talk -environment safe -&gt; not always comfortable if safe- then can say 'I don't know how to teach inference.'\n\n## norms = skills\n\ngroups -&gt; more skillful and less need for working agreements Show slide with definition.\n\nare intrapersonal tools to enable talk about hard stuff\n\nno need to laminate them\n\nmax 3-5\n\nPlace on wall and use as 3rd point\n\nbring them back when needed\n\nShow 'Cherub Choir Rules.' (Cherub means grade 2 and under in this choir).\n\n## TRAINERS NOTE:\n\nThinking Collaborative has permission to use this example.\n\n## clear examples:\n\n- \u2022Start on time / end on time\n- \u2022Silence electronics\n\n## fuzzy examples:\n\n\u2022Come prepared\n\n- \u2022Fulfill expectations\n\nadd clarity to working agreement using 'by' and adding behavioral examples\n\nOther examples:\n\n- \u2022Bring materials\n- \u2022Balance talk time\n- \u2022100% commitment/focus\n- \u2022Rank has no privilege\n- \u2022Finger-pointing and blame have no place\n- \u2022Use creativity over capital; mind over money\n- \u2022Think externally (avoid divisional/functional/silo'd thinking/us-them thinking)\n- \u2022No silent objectors. Do not leave in silent disagreement.\n- \u2022Respectful disagreement is encouraged.\n- \u2022Confidentiality-If it's said in the room, it stays in the room\n- \u2022Both/and not either/or\n- \u2022Adopt 'yes if' mindset. Eliminate 'can't' and 'no, because\u2026'\n- \u2022Eliminate 'we've always done it this way.'\n- \u2022Ask why, why not, what if\n- \u2022Be bold\n\nGive directions on slide.\n\n## What: SEVEN NORMS\n\nskill set and behaviors\n\nWhy: be habituated in groups -&gt; builds conversational capacity norms = skills\n\nas groups become more skillful, less need for working agreements\n\n## \u2022toolkit for both dialogue / discussion\n\n\u2022assists groups to become skillful in both ways of talking\n\nNorms of Collaboration LG, p. 46 Display banner WHAT? 7 Norms of Collaboration\n\n## WHY?\n\nSuggested language:\n\nNorms of are the 'glue' that hold together the Two Ways of Talking. They provide a toolkit for promoting a spirit of inquiry in dialogue and discussion and assist groups in becoming skillful in both ways of talking.\n\nWhen used consistently and appropriately, they reduce affective conflict. The norms provide a structure for assessing individual and group development.\n\n## HOW?\n\nShow the Norms on the Ways of Talking graphic from Day 1 in LG and on the banner, and share the WHY.\n\nWhat: Norms of collaboration live within the system in 2 Ways of Talking\n\n\u2022toolkit - dialogue / discussion\n\n\u2022assist groups -&gt; skillful in both ways of talking\n\n\u2022reduce affective conflict\n\n\u2022structure for assessing individual and group development\n\n## Comes from 'normal'\n\nbehaviors people know how to do explicitly named, taught, practiced, assessed-&gt;become normative -expected and part of the way groups work on a normal basis\n\nPremier tool kit-high level communicator at home and work. WHAT?\n\nIntroduction to the Norms of Collaboration\n\n## WHY?\n\nSuggested language:\n\nNorms comes from the word 'normal.' These are behaviors most people know how to do, but they are not habits of behavior in groups. As they are explicitly named and practiced they become normative. That is, they are expected and part of the way groups work on a normal basis.\n\nNorms are important because we want to promote a spirit of inquiry. Therefore, I want to pause, I want to paraphrase, I want to inquire .\n\nHOW?\n\nDifferentiate between Norms and Working Agreements.\n\n## Suggested language:\n\nWhile Working Agreements vary from group to group, based upon the needs of group members; Norms of Collaboration are 'best practice' across high performing groups. The Norms have their origin in the work of:\n\nPeter Senge and colleagues at Harvard, in their 5 th Discipline Fieldbook work;\n\nArt Costa, and colleagues Bill Baker and Stan Shallit, in their early work with Habits of Mind;\n\nBob Garmston and Bruce Wellman, as well as Adaptive Schools trainers' work with collaborative groups around the world.\n\nWhat: self-assessment of the Norms\n\nWhy: illuminates details of Norms consciousness of one's own behaviors\n\n## strength and stretch:\n\n- \u00b7 star by one you are pretty good at\n- \u00b7 checkmark on growth goal\n\nWrite self goal(s) top of page given your data\n\nNorms Inventory: Seven Norms of Collaboration LG, pp. 47-48 WHAT?\n\nThe inventory is a self-assessment of the Norms.\n\n## WHY?\n\nInventory elucidates the details of the Norms Inventory develops consciousness about one's own behaviors\n\n## HOW?\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nTo have a point of reference for you, think of your own behavior in a specific group with which you work. Using the inventory, rate your own behaviors when you are with that group.\n\nRead the directions on the slide describing Glow and Grow.\n\nnot suggesting starting with all Norms\n\nShare your inventories, your Glows and Grows, and consider what might need to happen in order for you to increase your use of selected norms when working with that group.\n\nhttps://www.edutopia.org/article/extending-silence\n\nStahl https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED370885.pdf\n\n- **stand, arms out bring in, thumb? do again other thumb on top\n\n## WHAT?\n\nPausing - hallmark of group's reflective listening / responding\n\nWHY?\n\nsupports brain -&gt; organizes thoughts / connects prior experience, knowledge, feelings honors people -&gt; reflective style\n\nWHAT?\n\nA norm that is a hallmark of a group's reflective listening and responding.\n\n## WHY?\n\nPausing supports the brain as it organizes thoughts and connects them to prior experience, knowledge and feelings. It honors people who have a reflective style.\n\n## WHAT? study pausing\n\nWHY? deepened thinking when given wait time / pausing\n\nsimilar to wait time in instructional process pausing to construct response -&gt; respect for what said / enables us to listen fully while other is talking\n\n'think' time-uninterrupted-the gift of pausing. -&gt; 'grow' complex thought system requires shared experience / conversation (ideas multiply, become refined, produce questions) equate quick responses = intelligence!! not so\n\nMary Budd Rowe: average wait-time after asking question before teacher cues, redirects, or tells answer / restates question -&gt; .5 seconds. Respond w/next question in less than second wait time is time to think, gift of pausing\n\nall classrooms- SPED, gifted / talented results when waited 3-5 seconds after asking question:\n\n\u2022students who ordinarily did not answer, did so (less 'I don't know')\n\n\u2022was improvement in language / logic\n\n\u2022answers were full sentences, not single words / phrases (length of responses increased 300-700%)\n\n\u2022answers were at higher levels of thinking\n\n\u2022students started responding to each other and commenting on each other's answers (students don't always do when competing for teacher attention).\n\n- \u2022Required less 'show and tell' from teacher\n\n\u2022more inferences were supported by evidence and logical argument\n\n- \u2022speculative thinking increased\n\n\u2022questions from students increased (less procedural 'how do we...?')\n\n- \u2022discipline moves decreased\n- \u2022student confidence went up\n- \u2022scores of academic achievement tests went up\n- \u2022teachers own questioning strategies became varied / flexible (fewer quantity/greater quality)\n- \u2022teacher expectations for performance improved\n\nArticle written by Mary Budd Rowe: http://www.sagepub.com/eis2study/articles/Budd%20Rowe.pdf wait-time I: After asking a question-gives time to form response\n\nESL-10-20 seconds (students labeled 'nonverbal' responded spontaneously 2x as much- in 1st hour!! invisible kids became visible.)\n\nsimilar finding when wait-time II and III used.\n\nwait-time II- after the student/adult answers answer often extended-strong correlation -&gt; higher level thinking If wait -&gt; may elaborate\n\nStahl-2nd wait time most powerful\n\nwait-time III: before the facilitator/teacher responds gives facilitator/teacher wait-time / signals what doing is important facilitator / teacher also needs to think\n\nHOW?\n\nConnect pausing to the wait time research of Mary Budd Rowe. Explain the 4 types, using 10-2 and referencing\n\n## 'positive pause'\n\nidea on table -&gt; all pause 15 seconds think how idea might work designate 'pauser' -&gt; signal group to pause at designated intervals or setting timer\n\nfrozen gesture - meeting no pausing 'Please hold on.  talking - 3 important ideas.' 3 fingers / paraphrasing 3 big ideas 'So what do we want to focus on right now?'\n\ncountdown - 'When I ask question -&gt; hold response for 5 seconds.' holds up fist, raising 1 finger at time, until 5 seconds up\n\nShare strategies groups can use to pause.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nA superintendent in California uses the 'positive pause.'  Whenever anyone puts an idea on the table, he asks that everyone pauses for 15 seconds to think about how the idea might work.\n\nAnother strategy is to designate a 'pauser' who will signal the group to pause at designated intervals. This can also be done by setting a timer.\n\nA third strategy is to use frozen gesture. This strategy can be used by one person in the group to get the whole group to pause. Let's imagine that you are at a meeting and no one is pausing, resulting in a fast-paced conversation. Looking around, you can tell that some people are not following the conversation. So you hold up your hand and say, 'Please hold on. We're talking about 3 important ideas.' You hold up 3 fingers on your hand and talk very slowly, paraphrasing the 3 big ideas. Then you say something like, 'So what do we want to focus on right now?'\n\nOptional: To honor the triple track agenda and give a classroom example, share the strategy of 'Classroom Countdown,' whereby the teacher says to students, 'When I ask a question, hold your response for five seconds.' To support kids the teacher holds up a fist, raising one finger at a time, until the 5 seconds is up.\n\nCovey-pause is 'arena of consciousness' wherein deep thinking can occur.\n\nJohn Maxwell-minute of thought is greater than an hour of talk\n\nI need thinking time when someone asks me a searching question.\n\nI wonder why it seems to be so uncomfortable for many people to wait through the silence.\n\nPeople of all ages have deep feelings, and if we have the patience to wait through the silence, it's often astounding what people will tell us.\n\nFred Rogers\n\n\u00a92025 Adaptive Schools Seminars\n\nWHAT:  homework\n\nWHY:  increase skills, prepared for next session\n\n## HOW:\n\n## EXTENDING LEARNING\n\n## WHAT?\n\nAn extended learning opportunity\n\n## WHY?\n\nTo prepare for tomorrow's content\n\n## HOW?\n\nGive reading assignment now--or earlier in day--so persons who have to leave early know about it.\n\n## The Neglected Norm: The Power of Paraphrasing\n\nLG, p. 13, 55 WHAT?\n\nRegroup into fern partners\n\n## WHY?\n\nReconnect with new partner to gain new perspective.\n\n## HOW?\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nFor this next piece, you're going to have an opportunity to connect with one of your fractal partners.

This paraphrase reflects the essence of the speaker's words.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nThe first type of paraphrase may be most familiar. It is an Acknowledging Paraphrase.\n\nUse prompt on screen. Allow time for pairs processing, then whole group share.\n\nAdd, if necessary:\n\n- \u2022Pronoun 'you' rather than I\n- \u2022Focused on thinking or feeling\n- \u2022No long preamble\n- \u00b7Reflect essence of speaker's message: The slide uses a mirror to indicate that this is reflective listening\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nOne intention might be to let the speaker know we are listening, we care, and that we are trying to understand. We may intend to establish rapport.\n\nGive directions using slide.\n\norganizing --&gt; indispensable for facilitators / group members responses into containers --&gt; theme(s) to speakers' thoughts.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nA second type of paraphrase is called an Organizing Paraphrase.\n\nWith quartet, what are some of the things you are noticing about these examples?\n\nAllow time for quartets processing, then have whole group share. Add, if necessary: Sorting multiple issues/topics\n\nOffering containers for ideas\n\nOften using physical gestures such as counting on fingers or holding out hands\n\nThe image of the suitcases suggests that lots of items are being placed in containers so we can carry them.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nA different intention might be to help the speaker clarify thinking. For a person or group that is overwhelmed, the intention might be to break a large task into smaller increments.\n\nGive directions using slide.\n\nabstracting -&gt; thinking to abstract (or sometimes concrete) level exploring what behind speaker's words - goal, belief, value that informs thinking / feeling Suggested Language:\n\nThe third form of paraphrase is Abstracting, which takes the speaker's thinking to either a more abstract or concrete level. It has the intention of exploring what is behind the speaker's words, the goal, belief, or value that informs their thinking and feeling.\n\nladder image -&gt; classic work in semantics by S.I. Hayakawa, Language in Thought and Action.\n\nusing ladder of abstraction can respond on the same rung of the ladder-same level of thinkingacknowledging and organizing paraphrases.\n\ncan invite speaker to climb the ladder and elevate level of thinking -&gt; abstracting paraphrase.\n\nFrom concrete details given, can abstract to bigger picture.\n\n## same rung -- synonym.\n\n'My car has broken down, and I don't know how I am going to get to work.' A response on the same rung of the ladder might be: 'So, you're having a problem with your automobile.' While this may reflect what was said, it may not do much beyond that.\n\n'So, there is an issue with transportation.'\n\nwhile the first paraphrase leaves us stuck with a broken car/auto, the abstracting example opens our thinking to alternatives such as public transportation, jogging, bicycling, carpooling, etc.\n\nWhile we may not use it as much, it is also possible to move down the ladder of abstraction to greater concreteness and detail: 'So, you want to get to the Ford dealership.'\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nA different intention might be to help the speaker shift or re-frame thinking.\n\nGive directions using slide.\n\n## self-assess\n\n## ORGANIZE &amp; INTEGRATE\n\nGive directions for Traffic Light Self-Assessment using slide.\n\nWhat:  opportunity-new skills taught in isolation used in an integrated, authentic\n\ncontext.\n\nWhy:  Organize and integrate the day's learning\n\nHow:\n\n15-20 minutes of dialogue time-pausing every 5 minutes to ask them to internally reflect on the Norms they have been using.\n\n## Intellectual humility-suspension\n\nDo I think more like a soldier or a scout?\n\nDo I want to understand or just be right?\n\nDo I seek opposing views?\n\nDo I enjoy the pleasant surprise of discovering I am mistaken?\n\n## DIALOGUE PRACTICE\n\nOPTIONAL\n\nWHAT?\n\nDialogue Practice (Time permitting)\n\n## WHY?\n\nAn opportunity to use the new skills that have been taught in isolation in an integrated, authentic context\n\nOrganize and integrate the day's learning\n\n## HOW?\n\nProvide 15 minutes of dialogue time practicing Pausing and Paraphrasing.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nYou're going to have an opportunity to integrate the learning you've been doing this afternoon in a dialogue.\n\nExtending Learning Organizing &amp; Integrating Reminder\n\n## WHAT?\n\nOne Word Summary\n\n## WHY?\n\nOrganize and integrate learning from today\n\n## HOW?\n\nRead directions from slide and have table groups share.\n\n## TRAINERS NOTE:\n\nIf time is short, have tables share their word without the What, Why, Who.\n\nThe Wisdom of the Sands\n\n## WHAT?\n\nClosing strategy\n\n## WHY?\n\nTo have participants leave thinking about their learning and the importance of identity.\n\n## HOW?\n\nShare quotation.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nWe leave you with this quotation to think about between now and our next time together. Remember too, the importance of identity - it's the bucket that holds everything else.",
