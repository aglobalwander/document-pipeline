## 3. Constructivist Approaches Begin with Raw Data and Direct Experiences from Which to Make Abstractions

Concepts, theorems, laws, criteria, and guidelines are abstractions that the human mind generates through interaction with previous information, new ideas, experiences, and data. The constructivist approach draws on primary sources, information from memory and past experiences, manipulatives, and real-life situations, and then helps learners generate abstractions from them. Learners are presented with data from a variety of sources and are then asked to compare, analyze, synthesize, and evaluate. Learning becomes the result of research related to real problems.

Providing information is also valid for constructivists. However, the provision of information is appropriate when:

- The learner feels a need for it, is interested in it, or requests it.
- The information is linked (scaffolded) to previous learnings.
- It is delivered in a manner that matches the learner's learning style.
- It is relevant to the learner's developmental levels.
- It is drawn from multiple sensory sources, such as visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and tactile.
- It is acted upon and processed by making inferences, forming concepts, synthesizing theorems, inducing algorithms, generating laws, and creating guidelines.
- Such generalizations are applied to contexts beyond the one in which it was learned.
