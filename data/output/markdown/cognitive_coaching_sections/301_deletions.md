## Deletions

Deletions are information left out of statements. Deleted information occurs more frequently in speech than either distortions or generalizations because if we were to speak inclusively of all details, our conversations would take a century: 'The man-that is, the tall, mustached man with the gray suit, green shoes, and white tie (and holding a cane), standing three feet from and to the north side of . . .'

The sensitive coach is selective about the frequency of challenges to deletions. Paraphrasing gives permission to ask any type of probing questions. For example, when a person says, 'They say it will get better,' the coach can respond, 'So, they believe it will improve. Who are 'they'?' Given the choice to clarify a vague referential index (vague noun or pronoun) or vague verb, we recommend clarifying first the subject of the conversation-who is being referenced. If the colleague says, 'We want them to think,' the coach can respond, after paraphrasing, 'Think how, specifically?' Unlike a conversation in which the parties are working to solve a problem and a solution has emerged worthy of trying, parties in a problem-resolving conversation need different signals about when to move on.
