## Language Cues

Vocally affiliated pairs and groups may converge their speech patterns. By matching a partner's speech style, a person may emphasize similarities and enhance attraction (Burgoon, Buller, and Woodall 1996). Specific behaviors on which people match speech include accent, rate, volume, pause length, vocalization length, and language choice. When a parent says, 'I see what you are saying,' we might infer that the parent is making images in her mind. When a student says, 'I don't see what you are saying,' we might infer the student is having difficulty making pictures out of the teacher's words. Until the student can make a picture, understanding remains elusive (Dilts and Epstein 1995). In this sense, we take people literally and adjust our communication styles to theirs.

Because words can be clues to thinking processes, Cognitive Coaches become familiar with word patterns from the sensory-based representational systems listed in figure 10.2. These words are an indicator of how the person is representing an experience. Words can also be cues

for metaphoric matching. We refer to this as language congruence. For example, when someone says, 'They play hardball around here,' you might respond by saying, 'Yeah, it's really tough. Bases are loaded, you go up to bat, and the team is counting on you.'

Many methodological errors can be found in the research on language congruence, unfortunately, but several solid studies-and our own experience-have affirmed the relationship between language and representational systems (Einspruch and Forman 1985).
