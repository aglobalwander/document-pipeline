## COGNITIVE COACHING: A REVELATION

After observing a demonstration of Cognitive Coaching for the first time, educators often make comments like these:

- The coach didn't make any value judgments; the other person had to judge for himself.
- There was a lot of silence after the coach's questions; she made the person think.
- The coach gave no advice or recommendations; instead, she asked her partner to suggest what should be done.
- The coach seemed to have a strategy in mind, like he knew where he was going.
- The coach listened; she reflected back what the person said and

- clarified a lot.
- Cognitive Coaching seems to be like a Socratic dialogue in a form of inquiry.

People who have undergone Cognitive Coaching for the first time often reflect on the experience with comments such as these:

- I became much clearer about my plans and how to achieve them.
- I felt that the coach understood my problem and the goals I had in mind. I have a better handle on my problem now.
- The coach really made me think. She made my brain 'sweat'!
- I want to know how I can learn to use this process in my work!

Although we agree with all of these comments, the essence of Cognitive Coaching is much more than these observations capture. In this chapter, we offer an overview of the model to serve as a basis for the detailed discussions of Cognitive Coaching theory and practice that follow.
