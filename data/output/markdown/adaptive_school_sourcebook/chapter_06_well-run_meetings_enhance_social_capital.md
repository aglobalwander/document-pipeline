## Chapter 6

## Well-Run Meetings Enhance Social Capital

I n  chapter  1,  we  described  schools  as  complex  or  dynamic  systems.  So  too are  groups  of  educators  working  together,  such  as  faculties,  departments, grade-level teams, and administrative cabinets. What happens in these groups influences other gatherings of educators throughout the system and can instill effectiveness, efficacy, and meaningful effort within an organization's DNA.

Human, social, and decisional capital  are essential  for  strong  schools  (Hargreaves  and Fullan, 2012). Together, they form professional capital.  Human  capital  refers  to  highly  qualified  teachers  with  knowledge  of  content,  student learning characteristics, sound preservice work,  emotional  intelligence,  and  capability in  relationships.  Social  capital  refers  to  trust, collaboration,  collective  responsibility,  peer pressure  and  support,  mutual  assistance,  and networks.  Decisional  capital  refers  to  teacher judgment, experience, practice, and the ability to reflect alone and together on their practices and  to  adjust  practice  to  improve  students' learning accordingly.

and manage differences, and it is in meetings that  their  working  culture  evolves-or  stays the same.

Well-run meetings produce specific benefits in social capital including norms of reciprocity, clear communication, and operationally sound information flow. At the heart of these meeting is  professional  discourse.  It  occurs  informally within disciplines as well as across disciplines, grade levels, departments, and faculties. It occurs in pairs, trios, and large groups. It occurs spontaneously and when planned. It happens in meetings. It is in meetings that teachers work together  to  improve  instructional  practice  and performance.  It  is  in  meetings  that  teachers clarify policies, identify and address problems, assess standards, and modify schedules. It is in meetings that faculties respond to the changing needs  of  students,  standards,  and  curriculum demands. It is in meetings that groups mature

Meetings have a greater effect on organizational  success  than  initially  meets  the  eye. First, effective and time-efficient meetings produce work that is important to the school. Second,  well-conducted  meetings  promote  member  satisfaction,  the  capacity  to  collaborate, and a willingness to conscientiously contribute. Third, the more successful groups are at getting important  work  done  in  meetings,  the  greater their collective efficacy, a resource that is undeniably  linked  to  student  success.  (We  will say  more  in  the  next  chapter  about  designing for  efficacy.)  Finally,  members  of  successful groups ultimately become members and leaders elsewhere and enrich the quality of work done by units within the school and the district. For these  reasons,  knowing  how  to  produce  work through meetings has become an essential part of  a  professional  portfolio,  regardless  of  an individual's role.

This chapter describes what members need to know and be able to do to have meetings that are  productive,  time-efficient,  and  satisfying. As noted earlier, teachers acquire social capital in these meetings. They also develop decisional capital  as  they  gain  wisdom  and  discernment relating  student  assessment  data  to  instructional decisions. As we described in chapter 4, two  ways  of  talking  support  such  learning  in

working groups: dialogue and discussion. Dialogue, which leads to understanding, is a necessary precursor to discussion, which leads to significant decisions.

## Talking to Decide

Inquiry  into  the  craft  of  meetings  is  fundamental  for  effective  meetings.  This  inquiry should include questions on (1) how to distinguish the urgent from the important; (2) how to stay on track, on topic, and focused; (3) how to use conflict constructively; (4) how to orchestrate space and materials; and (5) how to make decisions  that  stay  made.  This  is  important for leaders and members, for, as we shall see, skilled members have more influence on meeting success than good facilitators do.

Three organizing principles guide meeting productivity  and  satisfaction:  a  collaborative mindset,  positive  relationships,  and  collective energy sources. These are described below.

## Collaborative Mindset

Meeting success is influenced more by the collaborative mindset of the group than by the knowledge and skill of the group's facilitator. Schwartz  (2013)  reports  that  over  90  percent of  teams  have  a  unilateral  control  mindset, ascribing  to  the  leader  the  right  and  responsibility  to  make  decisions  for  the  team.  An alternative  mindset  is  collaborative,  recognizing that 'at any given moment, the insight and ability to move the team forward might come from anyone at the table' (p. 10). We refer to group members having this mindset as engaged participants.  The  overriding  commitment  of groups with a collaborative mindset is to work with  others  to  achieve  shared  goals.  For  a committee,  task  force,  department,  or  faculty to achieve this commitment, the members need to have the skills and knowledge for producing work  in  meetings.  Counterintuitively,  this  is more important than the skills of a good facilitator. Imagine an athletic team playing without goals, knowledge of the rules of the game, an awareness of other positions,  and  some  sense of  common  strategy.  As  much  as  a  football team needs a coach, it also needs players who have a common understanding of the game and who are committed to achieving the goals and improving their individual and collective performance. Whether or not a group knows that it is directing its own dynamics, this is the most determining factor in accomplishing work.

## Positive Relationships

The power of a group to produce results is rooted in the quality of the relationships among the participants. The highest performing groups have far more positive than negative communications, with a positivity ratio of roughly six to one  (Losada  and  Heaphy,  2004).  Becoming  a learning community that focuses on improving practice  and  developing  shared  accountability  is  a  goal  for  many  groups.  As  evidence mounts  that  student  learning  is  the  result  of such  cumulative  effort,  teachers  increasingly need the skills to conduct productive meetings in which they generate the know-how and the will  to  inquire  into  student  learning,  dialogue about data, assess and refine instruction, raise student achievement, and enhance professional community.  To  achieve  this  requires  skillful collaboration. Collaboration is not easy, nor has it been previously required in most schools. It implies  shared  objectives,  a  sense  of  urgency and commitment, mutual trust and respect, intellectual agility, and the application of diverse skills and knowledge. Achinstein (2002) notes the following:

When teachers collaborate, they run headlong into enormous  conflicts  over  professional beliefs and practices. In their optimism about caring  and  supportive  communities,  advocates  often  underplay  the  role  of  diversity, dissent, and disagreement in community life, leaving practitioners ill-prepared and conceptions of collaboration under explored. (p. 5)

Collaboration  requires  the  development and  exercise  of  social,  emotional,  and  cogni-

tive  skills.  Inquiring  into  the  views  of  others requires fluency in each of these skills sets and is  essential  to  problem  solving  and  working with conflict. High-performing groups are not only more positive than negative, but balance inquiry  with  advocacy  on  about  a  one-to-one ratio  (Losada  and  Heaphy,  2004). To  demand collaboration without providing training is like the government mandating a program without providing the money to implement it.

## Collective Energy Sources

The third organizing principle comes from cognitive  social  theory.  The  culture  of  the workplace  influences  what  teachers  do  and how they think more than their training, experience, or knowledge influences what they do. Cognitive social theory holds that robust social norms  and  behaviors  exert  an  influence  on the individual members of a group. The work culture inhibits or amplifies the learning of its members.  Well-structured  meetings  are  one way to influence working culture.

In  our  work  we  have  noticed  that five sources of collaborative energy become self-organizing  values  for  high-performing  groups: efficacy,  flexibility,  craftsmanship,  consciousness, and  interdependence.  We  introduced these in chapter 4, and readers who are familiar  with  'Cognitive  Coaching'  will  recognize them as the five states of mind held by individuals  (Costa  and  Garmston, 1994, 2002, 2016; Costa,  Garmston,  and  Zimmerman,  2014). How groups take on collaborative energy is an important question because collective efficacy is consistently  and  positively  related  to  increases in student achievement. Experts in any field  look  below  surface  behaviors  to  analyze the sources of successes and challenges. Paying attention to the flow and interchange of energy as  much  as  to  things  is  the  key  to  successful school  leadership.  Chapter  10  describes  how to detect the five energy sources and influence them. Here we describe their basic features.

Efficacy . Collective efficacy is consistently related to improved student achievement. Col- lective efficacy beliefs seem to influence group performance  by  shaping  the  behavioral  and normative  environment  of  schools  (Goddard, 2001). Groups with efficacy judge themselves to have the knowledge, skills, and will to meet goals and overcome obstacles to learning and behave  accordingly.  Efficacious  groups  use more  creative  approaches  to  problem  solving,  persevere  longer,  work  more  diligently, and achieve outcomes more successfully than groups without efficacy. The greater the collective efficacy of a school, the more that teachers persist  in  their  pursuit  of  excellence.  If  most teachers  in  a  school  believe  that  the  faculty can successfully teach students, it becomes the norm for teachers to help the students achieve high levels (Goddard, 2001).

Flexibility . To  inquire  into  data,  to  develop  theories  of  causation  and  solutions  for academic challenges, requires an ability to set aside the first (too) easy answers and continue to  delve  from  various  perspectives.  Groups who  develop  this  energy  source  honor  and value  diversity  inside  and  outside  the  group, attend  to  both  rational  and  intuitive  ways  of thinking, collectively shift perspective, and utilize a wide array of thinking and process skills. Such  groups  can  also  navigate  the  internal tensions that are related to confusion and ambiguity and open capacity for generating multiple ideas for moving ahead.

Craftsmanship .  Like  the  mindsets  of  expert  performers-musicians,  artists,  teachers, craftspeople, and athletes-groups with craftsmanship  take  pride  in  their  work  and  consistently  strive  to  improve  current  performance. Craftsmanship-the drive for elaboration, clarity,  refinement,  and  precision-is  the  energy source from which groups set demanding goals for themselves and ceaselessly work to deepen their knowledge, skills, and effectiveness.

Consciousness .  To  have  consciousness  is to be  mindful-moving  beyond  habituated thinking to thoughtful choice. Consciousness is a prerequisite to self-control and self-direction. Groups  that  tap  this  energy  source  maintain an awareness of their values, norms, and iden-

tity; monitor the congruence of their espoused beliefs and their manifested beliefs; and stand outside themselves to reflect on their processes and products.

Interdependence . Interdependent  groups value and trust the process of dialogue, have an  awareness  of  their  multiple  relationships and  identities  with  other  groups,  and  regard disagreement  as  a  source  of  learning  and transformation.

## Three Success Structures

We now turn our attention to three success structures. We use the term structure to describe a  system  of  order  and  organization.  Effective social structures honor the dynamic relationship of parts and bring them together into a workable whole. Since any group brings a variety of mental  models,  cognitive  styles,  personal  histories, and individual agendas to its work, the potential for chaotic interaction always exists. Providing structures permits a full and focused expression of these differences in a manner that is useful to the work and life of the group.

The  following  three  structures,  taken  together, guide groups to continual success. Each addresses significant questions in the work life of groups.

- 1. Who decides? What topics are ours? What decsion-making processes will be used?
- 2. What  meeting  room  features  (the  surround) will support the work?
- 3. What are the meeting standards that support us in staying focused and effective?

## Who Decides?

Is a decision to be made by certain individuals within the group, by the group as a whole, by the person who convened the group, or by some person or group not present at this meeting? Groups are most effective and productive when they are clear about whether their role is to inform, recommend, or decide.

Ask  any  group  to  describe  instances  in which a lack of decision-making clarity led to confusion  and  poor  implementation,  and  you will  hear  many  examples.  We  worked  with  a group  once  whose  members  discovered  that they didn't know who would make the decision on the topic they were discussing. Yet they vigorously continued to work on the issue within this conceptual vacuum.

Trust diminishes when a group is not clear about  who  is  making  the  final  decision  and what decision-making processes will be used. When group members lose trust, second-guessing,  resistance,  or  lengthy  and  unproductive process arguments can occur. This steals time and,  more  important,  saps  group  energy,  efficacy, and motivation to persevere on important agenda items.

When  curriculum  committees  understand that a final decision will be made by the school board,  they  can  strategically  plan  their  time. Thus 80 percent of committee time might be devoted to becoming as clear as possible about the recommendations they will make to the board. The other 20 percent of the time might be used to study and implement ethical systems of influence.  Many  a  curriculum  committee  has  been dismayed  to  have  its  recommendations  denied because it had not brought the board along in the deliberations. The following are possible levels of authority for decision making:

- · An individual or group above you;
- · An administrator unilaterally;
- · An administrator with input;
- · An administrator and staff by consensus;
- · A staff with input from administrators;
- · A staff by consensus;
- · A staff by a vote;
- · A  subgroup  of  a  staff  with  input  from others;
- · A subgroup of a staff unilaterally;
- · Individual staff members, selecting from a menu of options.

Constituents will blame the process when unhappy with the outcome. One of us worked in  a  district  in  which  a  neighborhood  school was to be closed. A representative community commitee  met  several  times,  examined  data, formulated criteria and recommendations, and forwarded this work to the superintendent. He then examined the committee's work with the administrative cabinet and made a recommendation  to  the  school  board.  When  the  board announced the school would be closed, all hell broke out. Why? The process was sound, but had  not  been  overcommunicated,  thus  consituents, both community and staff, assumed the decision had been in the superintendent's desk since  the  start  of  the  study.  Mistrust  clouded each new step in managing the transition.

Clarity about decision making is so crucial that we suggest that facilitators name the ultimate  decision  maker(s)  and  decision  process as many as four times. Why overcommunicate like  this?  When  people  are  investing  energy in topics important to them, they often forget that  there  might  be  other  parties  in  the  decision-making chain. Thus, while introducing an item, the facilitator could say, 'On this topic, you will be making a recommendation to the curriculum  committee,  which  has  the  final say.' During the conversation about the topic, the  facilitator  could  say,  'As  you  consider how to structure your recommendation to the curriculum committee. . . .' At the conclusion of the meeting, the facilitator could summarize the action taken on each item, again stating on which topics the group made a recommendation  or  decision.  Finally,  if  there  are  minutes for  the  meeting,  the  language  should  convey the  level  of  decision-making  authority  possessed  by  the  group.  One  of  us  worked  with a  superintendent  in  an  eastern  state  who  was particularly  adept  at  maintaining  clarity  with groups  about  decisions.  On  one  occasion,  he visited each school's faculty to seek its input on  a  decision  he  had  to  make.  He  said  to each group, 'Your job is to give me the best information  possible.  Your  job  is  to  inform me.  My  job  is  to  make  a  decision.  When  I

do decide, you will hear it first from me.' He then  asked  questions  and  listened.  When  his decision had been made, he again visited the schools. He reported to each staff, 'This is the decision I made. This is my rationale. Here is how your information influenced me.' He then responded to questions.

Several months later another issue emerged in which the superintendent wanted input from the  schools.  He  sent  a  memo  describing  the situation and saying that if the faculty wished to inform him, please send a representative to the central office for a meeting at a designated time.  The  teachers  said  to  one  another,  'He really means it.' They had learned to trust the process. Teachers went to the meeting and informed the superintendent.

Remember the principle that meeting success  is  influenced  more  by  the  collaborative mindset of  the  group  than  by  a  skilled  facilitator?  Members,  too,  share  responsibility  for group  consciousness  about  decision  making. They  can  ask  naïve  questions  (appendix  A) such as 'Excuse me. Who makes the final decision on this?' or 'Where does this recommendation go after it leaves us?'

Asking  a  naïve  question  is  one  way  that group members can effectively offer a correction  to  group  work.  To  communicate  naïvely is  to  speak  with  innocence. It is to be artless, unaffected,  and  natural.  Naïve  questions  have an  intonational  quality  of  childlike  inquiry  in which the question being asked is truly openended. 'Who will communicate this decision?' and  'Who  will  be  informed  about  this?'  are examples  of  naïve  questions.  They  serve  the group in developing awareness about process, and they sometimes serve leaders because the question has been overlooked in planning.

A  principal  from  a  large  urban  district complained about thirty years of attending dysfunctional meetings. After being introduced to naïve questioning, he realized that as a group member he could make a difference. He began to ask naïve questions and was amazed at the influence  he  held  as  a  group  member  to  get meetings on track.

Figure 6.1 . Decision Making Questions

<!-- image -->

One of the best guides for clarity about decision making is a seminal twelve-step model (figure  6.2)  offered  by  Saphier,  Bigda-Peyton,  and Pierson (1989). They emphasize that the model's effectiveness comes from making it public.

We  advocate  sharing  and  teaching  this information to all members of an organization through modeling and explicit discussion; this goal is critical to school improvement. We do not do the process 'to' or 'on' people, nor is it a Machiavellian model for working one's will on others.  It  is,  rather,  a  set  of  guidelines  for making good decisions that will stay made.

## What Topics Are Ours?

Groups  conserve  precious  energy  by  focusing  their  resources  where  they  have  direct influence. When the 'sandbox' in which a group is  to  'play'  is  clear  to  all  the  members,  group energy can be powerfully directed at the items it can affect. This structure works in tandem with the first structure, deciding who decides.

## Planning

Figure 6.2. Twelve Steps for Making Successful Decisions

As  simple  as  these  two  decision-making concepts  are,  they  become  complex  in  organizations  in  which  different  groups  have  intersecting interests. After much deliberation, a high school's faculty members went on a school holiday believing that because they had voted for  a  change  in  the  school  schedule,  it  would be changed when they returned to school. They were stunned to learn that schedule adjustments could not be made until administrators consultated with classified staff.

In  another  case,  a  teachers'  union  spearheaded a joint project with the administration for a site-based decision-making program. One provision was a district-level council to oversee the site work. The union published the responsibilities  and  functions  of  each  participating group,  describing  'sandbox'  topics  and  decision-making authority on some topics. Despite good effort, insufficient specificity led to confusion,  which  in  each  case  required  time  and emotional energy to untangle.

School site councils are common in many states  and  have  different  but  related  responsibilies  with  adminstration  and  the  governing board. Councils are often composed of persons elected by teaching faculty, support staff, parents  and  communty members, and the principal. Their work is complex, often encumbered with  well-intentioned  but  burdendome  state or  district  regulations.  To  foster  success  with these  groups,  districts  often  provide  training in managing meetings. We encourage avoiding Robert's Rules of Order for these groups. Robert's was designed to protect potentially messy gatherings from chaos and disorder-a unilateral  control  mindset.  A  collaborative  mindset using  information  about  meetings  provided here has been found to be less threatening and more productive.

All  groups  have  interests  that  intersect with  other  groups'  decision-making  authority. Considerations of collegiality, politics, and effectiveness must honor these overlapping areas of concern. Individual and collective vigilance is an essential ingredient of group success. At some time in every group's history, this struc- ture becomes important to departments, curriculum task forces, advisory groups, grade-level teams, site councils, and faculties.

An  issue  common  to  many  schools  is who should be responsible for decisions about schoolwide  policy  and  practices  on  student discipline. This seems like a simple 'sandbox' question. However, even the briefest conversation  will  reveal  that  several  related  questions must be explored. (We have labeled these naïve questions and listed examples in appendix A.) Student  discipline  is  necessary  in  what  areas (gum or guns)? Within what parameters (state law or district  policies)? At  what  level  of  authority (unilaterally or in consultation with the principal or parents)?

Suzanne Riley, a friend and colleague, was asked to consult with an elementary principal who was 'under siege.' The school technology committee, composed of parents and teachers, had  written  and  received  a  technology  grant from  a  community  business  partner.  The  initial  elation  at  receiving  the  funding  had  been replaced  by  frustration.  The  committee  had submitted  a  list  of  desired  equipment  to  the principal. The principal submitted the requisition for the equipment, but was then contacted by the district technology coordinator, who informed the principal that the desired equipment was  not  compatible  with  the  district  master technology  plan.  The  principal  informed  the committee. The committee was very upset. One of the parents, who was knowledgeable about computers, said that the district plan was totally outdated.  The  committee  argued  that  since  it had  secured  the  funding,  it  should  be  able  to purchase the best available equipment for the students. The committee accused the principal of wasting its time and ignoring its recommendations. The disagreement escalated into a very unpleasant  situation.  Had  the  committee  and principal  clarified  the  'sandbox'  issues  at  the beginning  of  the  process,  much  unhappiness could have been avoided.

What  decision-making  processes  will  be used? Over time, intact groups learn a number of  decision-making  processes.  Knowing  what

process is being used is as important as knowing  who  decides.  Collective  decision  making is  used  to  develop  criteria  for  deisions,  rank related values, or select within alternative approaches  to  achieve  goals.  V oting  is  the  least useful  approach,  typically  producing  a  set  of 'losers' without adequate opportuity to express opinions  or  influence  others.  Consensus  is  a concept,  not  a  strategy.  The  most  useful  consensus strategy we know is sufficient consensus,  a  process  in  which  80  percent  agreement is required  to  move  a  proposition  forward. When  a  decsion  requires  implementation  by group  members,  ranges  of  commitment  must be  expressed.  Sufficient  consensus  provides this  and  differeing  perpectives  can  be  heard, and accomodated when possible. The faciliator is responsible for assuring that minority voices are heard. It is understood that while some may not be fully in agreement with the group's decision, each has a professional obligation to carry it out. Chapter 8 on faciliation details a number of specific decision-making strategies.

## What Meeting Room Features Will Support the Work?

Consider  the  ideal  meeting  room.  It  is probably quiet, comfortable (but not too comfortable),  and  free  from  distractions.  David Perkins  (1992)  defines  these  and  other  factors  as  part  of  the  surroundings  that  mediate thinking and behavior. Although psychological, emotional,  cognitive,  and  physical  elements contribute  to  the  surroundings,  the  facilitator has  the  greatest  control  over  the  physical  arrangements in the meeting room.

Schwartz (2002) describes three principles for  seating  arrangements  in  meetings,  and  we have added a fourth. They are as follows:

- 1. All  participants  and  the  faciliator  should be  able  to  see  and  hear  each  other  and any visual information presented (e.g., flip charts, projected images).
- 2. Arrange the seating to distinguish the participants from the nonparticipants.
- 3. The  seating  arrangement  should  be  spacious  enough  to  meet  the  needs  of  the group, but no larger.
- 4. The  work-group  space  should  accommodate physical movement, subgrouping with different partners, and personal ownership of the entire room rather than of a single chair or a table.

Arranging a room to accommodate the first principle  is  rarely  a  problem  when  the  group size is about twenty or fewer. The semicircle, U-shape, or oval arrangements shown in figure 6.3 will easily serve twenty to twenty-five participants. As the group size expands up to forty or so in a council or decision-making group, arrange a series of tables in a herringbone pattern to  allow  all  participants  to  see  the  facilitator and the flip charts. When the group size reaches eighty to three hundred people, as it sometimes does  for  community  forums,  facilitate  from  a set  of  risers.  Position  flip  charts  on  the  risers and  use  large  markers  like  Washable  Marker available  online  and  in  many  office  supply stores.  Regardless  of  the  size  of  the  group,  if the participants cannot hear one another at any time,  they  should  call  out,  'Louder,  please!' The facilitator should remind the group of this at the beginning of the meeting.

Specific  tasks  require  conscious  room  arrangement  and  provision  of  materials.  The room  arrangement  communicates  and  structures the desired interaction.

Keep in mind that if eleven million bits of information  are  bombarding  the  participants each  second,  ten  million  come  through  the eyes, and only 40 percent of all that information is being processed consciously. Visual displays are  more  important  for  working  groups  than we have previously thought. Lightweight nylon banners  displaying  seven  norms  of  collaboration,  two  ways  of  talking,  meeting  standards, and group member capabilities are available at www.thinkingcollaborative.com  for  display  in meeting rooms.

High-performing  groups  post  charts  that state  outcomes  for  their  tasks  and  charts  that

Figure 6.3. Room Arrangement

<!-- image -->

remind the participants of the agenda, working agreements, and other central foci like collaborative  norms.  These  groups  chart  for  group memory during discussions. They choose strategies that include a visual component.

Group memory and graphic processes support learning and retention. Charting materials such as markers, tape, pads, and easels should be readily available. Wall space should also be considered. Blank walls without other artwork are  best  for  meeting  rooms.  This  lets  each group craft the space to its own needs. When groups  become  fatigued,  auditory  functions are  the  first  to  go.  The  very  best  markers  we have found for facilitaton and presentations are Charters ® Markers available at Grove Consulting  (store.grove.com).  Another  useful  brand, not as expensive, is Mr. Sketch Markers available online and in office supply stores. In video

6.1 the narrator describes room arrngment concepts and materials.

Many public bodies and decision-making groups  work  in  settings  in  which  others  are present  to  observe,  inform,  or  advocate.  It  is easier for the facilitator to monitor the moods, interactions, and energy of the members when the seating arrangements distinguish them from nonmembers. We've seen several arrangements for  this.  For  instance,  a  council  of  eight  to twelve  people  is  seated,  facing  one  another,

around a large conference table. Behind them are seated staff members and resource persons who may periodically be asked to 'come to the table' to give a report, offer an opinion, or give information on a topic.

strategically  uses  space,  tempo,  posture,  and gesture to keep the group moving together.

In  another  arrangement,  involving  a  group of  about  forty  people,  of  whom  fifteen  are  resource  people  and  guests,  the  entire  group  is seated  together  at  tables  during  the  dialogue portions of the meeting. The reason for this is to get a rich interplay of ideas and information from different perspectives. 'King Arthur knew what he was doing,' says Burleson (1990, p. 131). At a round table the distance across to another participant is less and the feeling of group involvement is  heightened When  the  group  shifts  to  a  decision-making  mode,  however,  the  guests  either leave or sit in a different part of the room. Policy boards sometimes formalize this in bylaws: 'Decision  making  will  be  by  80  percent  consensus of those present and voting. Only members shall advocate and vote in council meetings.'

Facilitators and recorders usually stand or sit  in  a  location  that  physically  distinguishes them from the other group members (see figure 6.4). Like an orchestra conductor, the facilitator

In  figure  6.4  the  facilitator's  role  is  indicated by the figure in the center. The figure in the upper right indicates the position of the recorder. The arrow indicates an aisle giving the facilitator freedom to move within the group.

Figure 6.4 depicts a room arrangement in which several key principles are apparent. First, par-

ticipants can easily access visual data; second, they  can  see  the  facilitator,  recorder,  and  one another; and third, because this arrangement is for a decision-making meeting, participants are seated close together with no empty chairs to prevent 'energy leaks.'

Two  of  the  most  important  facilitator  responsibilities are to focus the group on one topic at  a  time  and  one  process  at  a  time  (see  'Developing Standards,' below). Space, flip charts, other visual displays, gestures, and the position of  the  facilitator's  body  become  valuable  tools for focusing the group. In addition, all facilitator communications are enhanced when nonverbal signals  are  congruent  with  the  purpose  and the  facilitation  language.  For  example,  people consciously  direct  their  attention  to  an  area  at which someone points and unconsciously attend to  where  the  person's  eyes  are  looking.  Thus, recorders  who  point  to  a  flip  chart  and  direct their eyes to the same spot not only focus group energies there, but also ensure facilitator control of focus by not looking at the group.

Stand in one spot to give directions. Move to a new space to ask for clarification. This 'visual  paragraph'  separates  the  intention  of  the two  messages  both  verbally  and  nonverbally. Chapter 8 describes the facilitator role in detail and  offers  many  nonverbal  facilitation  strategies to direct. In video 6.2, a narrator describes a facilitors's use of the visual paragraph as we observe the facilitator give instructions.

Skilled groups develop a variety of seating patterns  and  room  arrangements  to  support different  types  of  social  and  cognitive  interactions.  Planning  these  setups  is  part  of  the

meeting  design  process.  Groups  and  meeting designers  who  lack  this  awareness  can  get trapped by the default furniture configurations of the rooms in which they work. Moving the furniture  to  support  productive  group  work  is an important part of a meeting's success.

One vital  consideration  is  to  remove  any empty chairs  from  the  work  area.  In  both  dialogue  and  discussion  settings,  empty  chairs draw energy from the group and increase both the  physical  and  psychological  divide  among the  participants.  The  actual  physical  removal of unused chairs sends a powerful message to the group about the need for connection. This is reinforced when latecomers have to move a chair to join the group.

When  people  in  meetings  sit  where  they always sit, they tend to see what they always see  and  say  what  they  always  say.  Group members will initially sit where they are most comfortable; let them. However, people unconsciously  become  territorial  in  meetings  quite easily. You might have noticed that in groups that  meet  periodically,  the  members  will  take the  same  space  that  they  occupied  in  the  last meeting.  There  are  two  generic  advantages for  periodically  changing  the  seating  arrangements.  First,  it  produces  energy  to  move  and sit with someone else. Group deliberations can be deadening, and thinking deadened, without physical movement.

Second,  subgroup  conversations  that  are always  held  with  the  same  person  or  small group  impose  limitations  on  thinking.  Conceptual  boundaries  are  formed  by  these  consistent  relationships,  backgrounds,  cognitive styles,  and  positions.  Moving  members  into different conversational subgroups brings

fresh  thinking.  Occasionally,  changing  seating can serve other purposes as well, such as breaking up a clique or signaling a transition from one agenda item to another.

Certain  tasks  are  done  more  effectively with special room arrangement and provision. For  example,  planning,  problem  solving,  and decision  making  require  access  to  multiple kinds of data. In addition to working with laptops,  tablets,  and  projector;  writing  on  charts; and  information  posted  on  the  walls  become group  memory  devices.  Many  times  we  have witnessed  a  group  fall  silent  while  members scan  what  is  on  display,  linking  and  relating information to the next task in their project.

Perhaps more important than serving memory,  what  is  written  becomes  a  visual voice-always  in  the  room,  never  silent,  interacting  with  group-member  thinking.  Many high-performing  groups  post  charts  to  clarify tasks  and  remind  members of working agreements. Some groups keep lists of collaborative norms, meeting standards, and group-member capabilities  on  permanent  display.  Furthermore, the act of composing language for public  recording  interacts  with  thinking,  forcing greater specificity, economy, and consensus. In video 6.4 the importance of markers, tape, flip charts, and wall space is noted.

## Technology Use in Meetings

In  meetings  with  or  without  technology, the  facilitator's  functions  remain  the  same:  to focus energy and attention and to support the group  in  collaboratively  attaining  its  goals. Central  to  this  is  maintaining  the  first  two standards  of  effective  meetings  which  are  to manage one process at a time and one topic at a time which are described later in this chapter.

Technology can be both a boon and a bane. Digital devices offer access to information and tools that help groups focus on their work by increasing  productivity  and  efficiency.  Unfortunately,  in  too  many  cases,  such  devices  are the  great  distracter,  removing  group  members from the task at hand and from their working relationships with the colleagues who are in the room. To mitigate this latter effect some groups develop working agreements to name appropriate ways to respond to text and voice messages and  clarify  when  and  under  what  conditions this might be appropriate. Mindful teams also name the elephant in the room of people bringing  personal  work  to  the  meeting.  Peeking  at laptops  and  scrolling  through  screens  on  tablets and smart phones has become the modern version  of  members  distracted  by  correcting student  assignments  and  grading  homework during team meetings. Ultimately, if the group and  its  work  are  valued  and  intended  to  produce value, then full presence with colleagues is the price of admission.

Increasingly,  working  groups  need  access  to  information  held  on  school,  district, and  state  or  provincial  Web  sites.  It  is  more productive to have participants share laptops or tablets to encourage  collaboration  with text and graphic information rather than work on  their  own  devices.  When  simultaneous attention  matters  it  is  even  better  to  set  up a  second  projector  with  attached  laptop  to create a group focus for exploring such data. The screen for such a set-up should be located off to the side, establishing the 'Third Point' pattern  described  in  appendix A. This  set-up leaves the main projector and screen available for the facilitator to project process directions that guide the group's work.

A  growing  number  of  digital  tools  are emerging. Most groups are better off mastering and applying a few rather than trying to work with  too  great  a  variety.  One  basic  toolkit  is the  Google  Suite  of  online  resources.  Skillful groups  develop,  modify,  analyze,  and  share documents,  spreadsheets,  and  graphs  using Google  Drive  tools  before,  during,  and  after

work sessions. These shared objects encourage both  synchronous  and  asynchronous  collaboration  by  keeping  the  group's  work  products visible to all.

For  larger  groups,  a  second  screen  is sometimes useful for creating a shared space by connecting  to Web  sites  such  as TodaysMeet. com. Group leaders can post prompts for small groups to consider and then have table groups huddle  to  craft  their  responses  before  posting them to the site. This pattern gives participants voice and provides a sense of the room to all involved. This then becomes a structured form of  the  collective  pause,  protecting  time  for thinking  and  reflection.  The  day's  work  can then  be  archived  and  accessed  later  by  interested participants.

New  tools  are  undoubtedly  being  developed  as  we  write  these  words. An  interesting example  of  a  recent  find  is  the  Post-it  Plus App which allows users to snap a picture with a tablet or smart phone of a set of sticky notes and  then  rearrange  the  notes  on  the  screen. Users  can  export  the  screen  images  to  other screens and archive them at sites like Dropbox, Evernote, and OneDrive. The point here is not to  become  enamored with a specific  tool,  but to focus on the meeting, the tasks, the collaborative  energy  of  the  group  and  the  group's development as a group by tapping resources that serve these purposes.

## Developing Meeting Standards

Standards  are  agreements  for  ways  of working  together.  Although  each  group  is responsible  for  deciding  what  standards  will guide its work, we advocate starting with the following  simple  set  of  standards,  because whenever  we  have  seen  these  standards  in place, we have witnessed successful meetings: (a) maximum product, (b) minimum time, and (c)  maximum  member  satisfaction.  In  addition,  when  effective  groups  implement  these standards,  their  levels  of  efficiency,  efficacy, craftsmanship,  and  satisfaction  soar.  When ineffective  groups  adopt  them,  their  productivity improves.

Doyle  and  Straus  (1993)  initially  discovered these standards for themselves in the form of  success  principles  from  attending  and  analyzing hundreds of meetings.

They noted that certain elements are common in all successful groups. A board of directors, a governmental task force, a student council, a  citizens'  committee,  an  administrative staff, [and] a radical political group may have different values and objectives, but they all face similar problems when they hold a meeting.

We have updated the principles to reflect current research. Our list of standards for this meeting structure is as follows:

- 1. Groups  should  address  only  one  topic  at a time.
- 2. Groups should use only one process  at  a time.
- 3. Meetings should be interactive and engage balanced participation.
- 4. Decision-making meetings should encourage cognitive conflict.
- 5. All parties should understand and agree on meeting roles.

## Addressing One Topic at a Time

There is a limit to what any individual can attend to in the moment. Groups are limited as well. If more than one topic is being discussed at  a  time,  a  group  will  lack  focus, and confusion will reign. We often hear group members ask, 'Which topic are we on right now?' Doyle and  Straus  (1993)  named  this  a  fundamental meeting  process,  a  multiheaded  animal,  'the tendency to go off in all directions simultaneously' (p. 20).

Multiple-topic  discussions  start  because many issues are linked with others or because one  idea  stimulates  an  associated  idea  in  another  person.  For  example,  a  subcommittee is  meeting  to  recommend  new  textbooks  for adoption.  One  member says, 'You know, I'm

really pleased that we are working on this task because  the  old  textbooks  aren't  that  useful. In fact, I was in the supply room the other day and I saw several books just sitting on the shelf with dust gathering. I think some teachers are not using them at all.' To this, another group member  responds,  'Supply  room!  I  thought we asked that it be cleaned up. I was in there the other day; it's still a mess!' Another group member  says,  'Has  anyone  seen  my  microscope? I've  been  looking  for  it.  It  was  in  the supply room the last time I was there.'

For the linear-minded among us, this type of  conversation  drives  us  crazy.  Here  are  a couple of facilitator moves that can redirect the group to one topic.

Relevancy Check . Offer a relevancy check by  asking,  'Please  help  us  understand,  Sam, how your comment relates to the topic that we are discussing.'

'Cape' comments . Use the flip chart like a  bullfighter's  cape.  Sam  makes  a  comment (e.g.,  about  cleaning  the  supply  room),  and the  facilitator  moves  to  the  flip  chart  and writes  'supply  room'  while  saying  to  Sam, 'Sam, I know there are several people interested in this. Let's put it here so we don't lose it. We'll come back to it later.' See appendix A for this procedure.

## Using Only One Process at a Time

Group  processes  are  vehicles  to  collectively  apply  cognitive  processes  to  common tasks.  To  generate  ideas,  to  clarify,  to  analyze, and to evaluate require different mental operations.  In  order  to  use  one  process  at  a time, all group members must know what the process is, how it works, and why it is being used.  Appendix  A  describes  many  meeting strategies,  including  some  alternatives  and tips for each one. These can be of great help to  meeting  planners  and  facilitators.  Doyle and  Straus  (1993)  observe  that  facilitators who 'go slow in  order  to  go  fast'  can  save meeting time by frontloading detailed instructions before they proceed.

Figure 6.5. PAG/PAU

Here are some facilitator moves that help groups be clear about and honor a process. See appendix A for details.

PAG/PAU ensures  that  members  understand the process correctly. It stands for Process as Given, Process as Understood. The facilitator communicates each stage in three different mediums:  space,  voice,  and  language  (figure 6.5). See video 6.3.

Stop and Redirect is  a  facilitator  move to correct deviations from a process.

Advertising  executive  Alex  Osborn  invented  brainstorming  nearly  a  century  ago. Today  it  remains  one  of  the  most  common ways groups generate ideas, yet alternatives to brainstorming  are  emerging.  They  challenge the assumption that an absence of criticism is necessary for groups to generate a quantity of ideas, yet maintain the principle that meetings must be safe for members to partipate productvely. In a University of California at Berkeley experiment, 265 undergraduate female students were  organized  into  teams  of  five  and  asked

to  generate  ideas  to  reduce  traffic  congestion. One-third  were  instructed  to  brainstorm,  another  third  received  no  process  instruction, and a final third were encourged to debate. On average  the  debating  teams  generated  nearly 20  percent  more  ideas  than  the  brainstorming  group.  The  group  receiving  no  process directions  performed  least  well.  Debate,  in this  situation,  appeared  to  create  more  ideas because  it  encouraged  greater  engagement  in the ideas of others and causes reassessment of one's own ideas (Lehrer, 2012). It is important to  note,  though,  that  certain  conditions  are necessary  for  success  in  this  approach.  First, a  collaborative mindset group with communication skills directed at constructive criticism, not discouraging criticism. Next, clarity about the  goal  and  rationale  for  the  process.  Lehrer (2012) cites research finding that brainstorming groups come up with fewer ideas than groups in  which  members  work  independently  and then share ideas.

Here  are  some  classic  and  alternative strateies for generating ideas.

## Brainstorm To Foster Quantity of Ideas

- · Call  out  ideas.  No  judgment,  criticism or questions  allowed.
- · One (or two) members record ideas on public charts as they are heard.
- · Quantity is more important than quality during this phase of group work.
- · Encourage out-of-the-box ideas.
- · Build on ideas on the list when you can.
- · Sequence of Events
- · Describe  the  guidelines.  Check  for understanding. (PAG/PAU)
- · State the topic 'What's the best focus for our time this year?'
- · Prime  the  pump.  (Pairs  generate initial ideas)
- · Invite members to call out ideas.
- · Assign numbrs to the first few raised hands  ( Airplane  stackingSee Appendix A).
- · Repeat airplane  stacking after  the first group have stated their ideas.
- · Facilitator  repeats  key  words  until recorder(s) have charted the idea.

Video  6.4  shows  how  a  facilitator  sequences  responses  from  a  group  allowing members to listen to others and not worry about their turn to speak.

## Holding Interactive Meetings With Balanced Participation

Groups can plan, share information, problem solve, evaluate, make decisions, and define their boundaries.  When  you  think  of  these purposes for working groups, it is clear that a pattern in which one person talks and the rest of  the  people  listen  is  not  productive.  If  you have twelve individuals in a meeting, you want twelve minds engaged. If you have thirty individuals, you want thirty minds engaged. Participants  construct  meaning  and  develop  ownership interacting with ideas and each other.

Here  are  some  examples  of  facilitator moves to balance participation:

- · 'Take a moment and jot down your ideas on this before we begin sharing.'
- · 'Turn to your neighbor and generate a few more ideas. You've got thirty seconds.'

Facilitators can employ other strategies  and  moves  (all  of  which  are  described

The  purpose  of  Brainstorm  and  Critique is to enrich idea generation with psychologically  safe  critiques.    In  this  protocol described  in  appendix  A,  a  normal  process  of  brainstorming  is  the  first  step. Next provide some silence in which trios critique items  on  the  list thinking  of alternatives  or  downsides.  Finally  these ideas are made public and the group, after dialoging about this data, uses the rule of one-third to identify the top few ideas.

.

in  detail  in  appendix  A).  In  'Assumptions Wall,'  groups  bring  up  and  and  examine their  assumptions.  This  requires  recordable wall space for subgroups. 'In and Out of the Frame' provides groups with opportunities to get outside their own perspectives to approach a topic. In 'Corners,' members vote with their feet, moving to a place in the room that represents their position.

Too  often  we  have  heard  the  statement that  the  purpose  of  participation  in  meetings is  for  'buy-in.' We discourage the use of this phrase because it carries with it suppositions of manipulation and inferences that the leader has something to sell and the group has an opportunity to buy it. We find, instead, that the purpose of participation is to develop ownership. When ideas  are  owned,  when  values  are  articulated and  owned,  when  beliefs  are  admitted,  when plans and programs and strategies are posed by the group, commitment is high and the likelihood of successful implementation is great. As we  shall  see  in  the  next  principle,  ownership does not occur without disagreements.

Balanced  participation  does  not  mean that  every  member  must  speak  for  an  equal amount of time; it means that the door is open

Groups needlessly waste brain cells anytime  a  group  sits  beyond  20  minutes without a chance to process information with a neighbor.

for member participation. There are two forms in which group members speak: to the entire group and to a partner or a small group nearby. Facilitate  participation  by  asking  individuals to share with a partner before speaking or to get together with a group of four and identify major criteria to be brought before the group. Partner talk is the safest form of member participation. Moves like these richly engage everyone in thinking processes. They also offer a cloak of anonymity when voices do not wish to be identified.

## Engage Cognitive Conflict

Meetings  must  be  safe,  but  not  necessarily  comfortable.  When  a  group's  meetings are  always  comfortable,  the  group  is  probably not  talking  about  the  right  things.  Cognitive conflict-disagreements among group members about substantive issues like goals, values, and assumptions-tends to improve team effectiveness, lead  to better decisions,  and  increase commitment, cohesiveness, empathy, and understanding. Cognitive conflict occurs as teams examine, compare, and reconcile these differences.

The  problem  with  encouraging  cognitive conflict  is  that  once  it  is  aroused,  it  can  be difficult  to  control.  If  cognitive  conflict  slides into affective conflict, then hostility, avoidance, cynicism, or apathy can result. Affective conflict  focuses  anger  on  individuals  rather  than ideas, and disagreement becomes personalized. It  can  occur  when  group  members  lack  the skills to disagree gracefully. The greatest insurance against affective conflict is group-member skills and practice of the seven norms of collaboration (see chapter 4).

Conflict  about  ideas  improves  decision quality  but  can  also  weaken  the  group's  ability to work together. Resolving this tension is especially important when consensus is valued and  follow-through  is  required.  Teams  that encourage cognitive conflict without affective conflict  are  characterized  by  focused  activity, creativity,  open  communication,  and  integration. They work close to the core of issues and are  not  distracted  by  trivial  points.  They  en-

courage thinking beyond normal options, listen to  the  'minority  voice,'  encourage  dissenting opinions, synergize the thoughts and perspectives of different members, and approach problems from new perspectives. The outcomes of conflict are shown in figure 6.6.

Conflict  can  be  an  asset  to  maintaining open communication. Members in groups with productive  conflict  challenge  each  other's  assumptions. They make the fullest possible use of all their members, whereas in less effective groups there is often a disproportionate contribution from certain members. Good teams seek out  the  opinions  of  those  who  are  less  active and moderate the input of those who monopolize the conversation. See chapter 12 for how certainty, risk, and adaptivity can be unresolveable sources of conflict unless understood.

The conditions in which cognitive conflict exist without affective conflict call for cognitive, emotional, and social maturity. These attributes can  be  scaffolded  with  the  understanding  of meeting  standards,  the  use  of  psychologically safe protocols (strategies), and the application of the seven norms of collaboration.

## Understand and Agree on Meeting Roles

Any  team  works  most  effectively  when its members  know  one  another's  responsibilities. The shortstop can anticipate the first baseman's  position  in  relation  to  first  base; therefore  his  throw  is  effective.  The  second baseman  knows  that  the  center  fielder  will back him up on a long ball. Because he can

Disagreements over personalized, individually oriented matters reduce team effectiveness and produce

- Destructive conflict
- Poorer decisions
- Decreased commitment
- Decreased cohesiveness
- Decreased empathy

count on his teammate, he stays close to second base to guard it. The same principle works for  group  meetings.  In  meetings  the  group members are the utility infielders.

Although there are many possible meeting roles,  we  identify  four  that  are  most  typically found  in  working  groups.  These  are  (a)  engaged  participant,  (b)  facilitator,  (c)  recorder, and (d) role or knowledge authority.

## Engaged Participant

Because  meeting  success  is  influenced more by the collaborative mindset of the group than by facilitator leadership, we call the people who occupy this role 'engaged participants' to illuminate the active and essential contribution they  make  to  the  group's  work.  Anyone,  at some  time,  might  be  an  engaged  participant. Standing-committee  members,  participating guests at a special session, the recorder or facilitator  before or after serving in those roles, and the building administrator can all at some time serve as engaged participants. What these group members know and do is critically important to group effectiveness.

In  groups  with  a  collaborative  mindset, engaged  participants  monitor  their  personal adherence to meeting standards. They notice and  set  aside  comments  they  are  about  to make if the comment would violate the 'one topic at  a  time'  standard. They also monitor the group's adherence to standards with naïve questions. Engaged participants use the seven norms of collaboration, seek and provide data,

clarify  decision-making  processes  and  levels of  authority,  and  perform  gatekeeping  functions for others. When members are clear they have  a  role  in  communicating  the  meeting's content to others, they are more likely to insist on their own clarity (Heifetz, Linsky, and Grashow, 2009).

Gatekeeping . Malita  might  say  to  Sid, 'Sid,  I'm  aware  that  you  haven't  talked  for  a little  while.  Is  there  anything  that  you  would like  to  add?'  Notice  in  this  interchange  that Sid  is  not  on  the  spot  to  respond.  The  gate, however, has been opened. Similarly, Leonardo might say to Aron, 'Aron, I know you served on a committee like this last year. Do you have anything  that  you'd  like  to  say?'  Alejandra says  to  Ken,  'Ken,  from  where  I'm  sitting, your eyebrows look furrowed. What are some comments might you like to add?'

Setting  and  testing  working  agreements . Engaged  participants  set  and  test  working agreements. For example, Jose sets a working agreement  by  saying  to  the  group,  'I'm  requesting that we make an agreement to start our meetings on time. I notice that some of us are here on time and others are not. Frequently, I have to wait fifteen minutes before the meeting starts.'  Discussion  ensues. The  group  decides to begin meetings on time. Several weeks later, Anhadh tests the agreement by saying, 'I'd like to talk about the decision that we made several meetings ago to start meetings on time. I notice that this is not happening. What do we need to do to keep our agreement?'

Testing  consensus . Engaged  participants informally  test  consensus  by  summary  paraphrasing.  Sometimes  they  say,  'It  seems  that we may have agreement on this. Is that true?' or 'Could we see a show of thumbs? Thumbs up if you are in agreement, thumbs down if not, thumbs sideways if you're not sure or it's not important to you.'

Monitoring internal  processes . Engaged participants  monitor  their  own  internal  processes  and  listen  to  their  own  listening.  They become  aware  of  when  they  have  stopped listening to others and are following a train of thought  in  their  own  minds.  They  recognize their  emotional  responses  to  other  speakers. When they are irritated, they notice it, but instead of giving in to the irritation, they locate the probable reason. Then they set the feeling aside  so  they  can  stay  fully  engaged  in  the conversation.  When  they  are  listening  to  understand, yet find themselves offering counterarguments in their own minds, they notice this and suspend the unproductive mental activity.

Finally, engaged participants are conscious of the assumptions they bring to a conversation and notice how these influence their listening, thinking, and speaking.

## Facilitator

As you will see in chapter 8, the facilitator role requires a sophisticated set of skills. A facilitator is a third party to a conversation and is responsible for process. As a director of process, the facilitator knows what kind of structures and strategies will be useful in helping the group do its  work.  When  the  facilitator  asks  the  group to  use  certain  procedures  or  intervenes  with counterproductive behavior, it is on the basis of this process knowledge. A facilitator must be a person who is acceptable to all members of the group, who is substantively neutral, and who has no decision-making authority about the topic.

Although  a  facilitator  displays  no  preference for any of the solutions the group considers,  no facilitator is truly neutral. To be 'substantively neutral' (Schwartz, 2002) means that facilitators  give  no  verbal  or  nonverbal  cues of  their  personal  reactions  to  the  ideas  being discussed.  Because  the  facilitator  is  serving the group, not certain members, this display of neutrality is important.

Facilitators  often  start  by  clarifying  their own role with the group:

My  job  is  to  help  you  have  a  conversation about  these  topics  in  such  a  way  that  you understand one anothers' views and the reasoning  that  leads  people  to  those  views.  In this way you have the information with which to make informed decisions. I will not share

my own views on topics you discuss. However [this would sometimes be appropriate to add], as you know, I have some expertise in one of the topics on your agenda. Should you like information from me on that topic, let me know and I will step out of the facilitation role to provide that.

Schwartz (2002) suggests that facilitators add another statement to their self-introduction in order to reinforce the group's understanding and  proactive  influence  on  roles:  'Please  let me know if at any time you think I am acting inconsistently with my role. Does anyone have any concerns?' With groups that have no history of working together, the facilitator may go on to describe other meeting roles.

Chapter 8 details facilitator functions and tools in a meeting and describes how the facilitator focuses group energy, keeps the group on task, and directs processes.

## Recorder

As groups tire, auditory acuity is the first modality  to  fade.  Because  many  meetings are  long,  members  begin  to  tire,  or  because meetings are at the end of the school day and members are already tired, public recording is critically important for the group's short-term memory. The later in the day the meeting or the  more  fatigued  the  participants,  the  more public  recording  is  necessary.  On  average humans  can  manage  three  to  four  items  of information in their working memories (Moskowitz,  2008).  Public  recording  keeps  key data in front of a group.

Recorders, like facilitators, occupy a position of purposeful neutrality. Their function is to support the group by maintaining a clear visual representation of important ideas and data and to support the facilitator in managing processes as effectively and efficiently as possible. The  recorder  and  facilitator  also  serve  as  behind-the-scenes custodians, arranging displays, clearing  out  unnecessary  data,  and  arranging the room for special activities.

Because  you  want  the  faciliator  to  direct the focus of the group, it is advisable that re- corders  look  at  the  charts  on  which  they  are working, or  at  the  faciliator,  instead  of  at  the group. Because members' eyes go in the direction  of  the  leader's  eyes,  recorders  looking  at the group split the visual-and cognitive-focus of the group.

A  great  deal  of  knowledge  is  emerging about  the  techniques  and  tools  of  public  recording  (Buckley,  2005).  Following  are  several basics:

- · Print rather than write.
- · Use uppercase and lowercase case letters, not all caps.
- · Use  color-alternate  green, blue, and brown for text. Never use red for text; it is hard to read. Reserve red for headlines and other organizers. Reserve black for boxes, arrows, or other organizers.
- · Use only water-based pens.
- · Write large enough for all members to read.
- · Keep all charts visible at all times.
- · Border charts for formal appearance.
- · Use  pictographs  (see  Buckley,  2002,  for traceable chart art).
- · Keep your eyes on the chart when you are recording.  See  eye-hand  coordination  in appendix A for rationale and ways to use this principle in other settings.
- · Have the facilitator tell the group to direct corrections.
- · Have the facilitator ask the group what not to record.
- · Point to or stand by the items as they are being discussed.
- · Remain still and nondistracting.
- · Move your body to support the facilitator's use of space.

## Role or Knowledge Authority

Leaders lead. Principals lead through modeling,  and  develop  leadership  in  others.  In the  past,  the  principal  has  been  expected  to lead  meetings,  but  this  is  changing.  'Because

of  their  positional  authority  and  control  over school  resources,  principals  are  in  a  strategic position  to  promote  or  inhibit  the  development of a teacher learning community in their school' (McLaughlin and Talbert, 2006).

Many  people  lead  meetings.  Leadership roles  in  meetings  are  called  by  many  names: chairperson,  convener,  facilitator,  leader,  consultant,  specialist,  manager,  and  others.  Because we see a critical leadership role in meetings that does not include running the meeting, we have been searching for a term that might be neutral, or at least unlike the other names we have for meeting leadership.

The most descriptive term we've found so far is role authority or knowledge authority . The role  authority  might  be  the  principal  in  a  staff meeting,  the  vice  principal  if  the  principal  is not there, the superintendent in a district office meeting, or the assistant superintendent if the superintendent is not there. The knowledge authority  might  be  the  literacy  coach,  at  a  task  force dealing  with  the  reading  program;  the  science consultant, in a committee addressing a science curriculum;  or  an  external  consultant  charged with making recommendations to the group on improving organizational effectiveness.

When the role  or  knowledge  authority  is in  a  meeting  without  a  facilitator,  this  person typically  manages the group processes. He or she sets the agenda, decides when to move to the  next  topic,  recognizes  those  who  want  to speak,  writes  meeting  notes  to  assist  remembering, and summarizes actions to be taken. In managing all these procedural tasks, the role or knowledge authority limits, or at least diffuses, the attention given to meeting content and also limits  group access to the special information resources that are part of this person's particular role or knowledge expertise.

Without a facilitator, the value of the role or  knowledge  authority's  information  is  limited.  First,  because  this  leader  has  to  balance attention  between  process  and  content,  there is  less  time  for  interaction  with  the  content. Second,  it  is  extremely  rare  that  a  leader  can maintain  the  neutrality  required  of  the  facili- tation  process  give  content  information to the group,  and  be  perceived  as  neutral.  For  this reason,  leaders  become  more  influential  and the group matures and makes better decisions when a person other than the role or knowledge authority facilitates the meeting.

When leaders such as department heads or principals use the services of a meeting facilitator, they will often set meeting schedules, coordinate topics with faculty and others, arrange to have department members rotate through the facilitator  and  recorder  roles,  and  codevelop the agenda design with the meeting facilitator. The  role  authority  will  also  follow  through to  see  that  subcommittee  tasks  are  clear,  that resources are available, and that evaluation of processes and products is provided.

In many ways, the role or knowledge authority  functions  like  any  engaged  participant in the meeting, but he or she is also available to inform the group about constraints, resources, and values related to the topic. Like other group members, the role or knowledge authority can advocate  one's  own  ideas  as  well  as  inquire about the ideas of others. Remember that until groups  have  attained  a  high  state  of  interdependence, actions in this role will speak louder than words.

Can the facilitator or recorder ever speak? Under certain conditions. Periodically the person  faciliating  or  recording  may  have  important  information  for  the  group  or  may  be asked for an opinion. In such cases, signal role change by asking if it is okay to change hats, ask a participant to take over the faciliation or recording role and sit as a member of the group until  you  have  completed  your  input.  Since people  are  influenced  more  by  what  they  see than what is said, the physcial shift is essential. This is especially useful for team leaders and department heads who often need to wear two hats-faciliator  and  leader.  In  some  settings, content specialists will often facilitate meetings in  content  areas  other  than  their  own  and  a special education consultant might periodically facilitate the superintendent's  cabinent.  For principals,  turning  the  meeting  over  requires

developing  a  collaborative  mindset  with  the faculty and gradually grooming individuals to take over the facilitation role.

In one Arizona district that was influenced by  the  concepts  and  tools  presented  here,  the superintendent  working  with  her  leadership team  redesigned  their  monthly  meeting  to break  the  pattern  of  each  major  department head  presenting  to  the  whole  group  in  serial fashion. As you can imagine, this common way of organizing a 'meeting' did not energize high levels of participation among the group members in attendance that were reluctant to raise points  of  confusion  or  offer  alternative  viewpoints in front of their peers and supervisors.

In the  revised  scheme,  major  players, including  the  superintendent  and  the  various associates  and  department  leaders  arranged themselves  around  the  periphery  of  the  room with chairs for participants to join them. Then, for  a  set  amount  of  time  each  district  leader presented  essential  information  to  their  small group and engaged each group in dialogue and discussion about that month's priorities. After a set amount of time, the small groups rotated to the next presentation. This format motivated district  leaders  to  develop  clear  outcomes  for the overall meeting and for their specific segments. They also reported much higher levels of engagement and a greater willingness on the part of participants to raise issues and concerns.

## Using the Three Success Structures

Every working group needs a declarative knowledge of the three success structures. This means  that  members  can  describe  the  structures,  their  parts,  and  the  principles  on  which they  are  based.  As  groups  learn  from  their experiences,  procedural  knowledge  will  develop, and members will become skillful at exercising,  monitoring,  and  self-correcting  both themselves as individuals and the group. One way to increase both consciousness about and skill in applying the three success structures is to use the meeting assessment inventory found in appendix I. Regular use of this inventory and reflective dialogue with group members about the results focuses attention on skill gains and sticking points for that group.

Mature groups eventually acquire a degree of  conditional  knowledge,  allowing  them  to recognize when to break the rules and achieve their purpose even more effectively. Such powerful  and  cumulative  knowledge  can  be,  and is,  developed  with  faculties,  committees,  task forces,  cabinets,  advisory  boards,  and  other groups. It does not have to be lost because of changing membership or environmental crises. We have facilitated a statewide group responsible for deciding how millions of dollars will be used each year to support technology. This group  met  for  a  full-day  meeting  three  times a  year.  Because  members  were  appointed  as representatives from regions, membership constantly changed. Yet after a year-and-a-half of facilitated meetings, the consensus of the group was that 'we have become our values and operating principles.' Effective groups develop a commitment to practice and monitor their use of the three structures.

In any session in which planning, reflecting,  or  problem  solving  occurs,  the  engaged participants-that is, the group members-are the  ones  who  do  the  work  of  the  meeting.  In fact,  the  meeting's  success is more dependent on  their  informed  participation  than  on  the skills  and  knowledge of a boss, a content expert,  or  a  facilitator.  This  is  especially  so  in small work teams. In large groups a facilitator is  required  to  orchestrate  and  direct  the  contributions of group members. Group members should be able to distinguish between data and inference;  distinguish  relevant  from  irrelevant information,  claims,  or  reasons;  identify  unstated assumptions; and interpret data.

## Conclusion

In  this  chapter  we've  explored  foundation knowledge for the art and science of meetings. Our  definition  of  success  for  meetings  is  that they  take  minimum  time,  produce  maximum work,  and  generate  a  maximum  amount  of

member  satisfaction.  The  ultimate  goal  is  that meetings serve as vehicles to protect and support the primary mission of the school, which is student learning. At schools and in special district committees-McLaughlin  and  Talbert  (2006) say  this  as  well-the  goal  is  to  study  data  on teaching and learning, and then agree to the next steps for changing instruction and for examining the effects of change on student learning.

Meetings are becoming as important a part of  teachers'  work  as  lesson  design.  For  this reason, knowing how to produce work through meetings  has  become  an  essential  part  of  a professional portfolio, regardless of one's role.

In the next chapter, we explore in detail the principles  of  facilitation,  facilitator  functions, and facilitation tools.

## Postscript

While this book was still in development, Google  released  the  results  of  a  multi-year study of 180 Google teams. The results confirm and extend ideas in this book and chapter. Google's approach to the development of teams and team  leadership  applies  findings  from  MIT's Human Dynamics Laboratory.

Psychology  safety,  more  than  anything else, produces effective group work. Psychological safety, they found, was based on group norms  in  which  individuals  set  aside  their personal  proclivities  during  group  work  and honor  team  norms.  Two  essential  attributes: equity  of  turn-taking  and  social  sensitivity, create a climate of interpersonal trust and mutual respect that foster task success. There was nothing  in  the  research  supporting  the  idea that  a  certain  mix  of  personalities,  skills  or backgrounds contributes to higher performing teams. (Duhigg 2016).

We propose that the seven norms of collaboration (chapter 4), two ways of talking (Chapter 5) and three success structures (chapter 6) forge a resilient foundation for psychological safety.
