## HOLONOMY: TRANSCENDING AUTONOMY AND INTERDEPENDENCE

As we develop soul in our work we need to recognize our dual identity: we are both individuals and members of a group. Indeed, finding the soul of work involves the balance and integration of apparent opposites, such as head and heart, intellect and intuition, and self and group. This process is not so much based on the 'shoulds' but upon 'what is.' It is my belief that as we attend to the soul of work we will find we feel more complete.

Because the mission of Cognitive Coaching is to produce self-directed persons who function well (have the cognitive capacity for excellence) individually and in groups, the concept of both-and represented by the word holonomy -remains key to appreciating the well-developed individual. Holonomy is a combination of two Greek words: holos meaning whole, and nomy meaning arrangements or distribution (as in eco-nomy-the study of the distribution of resources, or astro-nomy, the study of the distribution of celestial bodies). Holonomy conveys the notion that an entity is both an autonomous unit and a member of a larger whole simultaneously. Holonomy may be oxymoronic since it implies a combination of opposites: being both a part and a whole; acting autonomously and, at the same time, working interdependently. Because all life forces are simultaneously independent and interdependent, selfassertive and integrative-whole unto themselves yet always a part of systems larger than themselves-holonomy, therefore, is paradoxical.

When Arthur Koestler (1972) coined the word holon , he sought to describe something that has the characteristics of being both a part and a whole at the same time. Holonomy is the science or study of parts/whole relationships. As such, holonomy considers both our integrative tendencies and our autonomous aspects.

'It takes two to know one,' Gregory Bateson was fond of saying. All beings exist within holonomous systems. That is, each person is part of several greater systems (e.g., families, teams, schools) yet maintains a unique identity and palette of choices, both as an independent agent and as the member of a group. Each system influences the individual, and, to a lesser degree, the individual influences the system.

Holonomous persons have an awareness of themselves in this somewhat oxymoronic, conflicting state of being an independent entity while also part of being and responsive to a larger system. They have the cognitive capacity to exercise flexible, responsible self-directedness in both arenas, being alert to both environmental and internal cues that inform their knowing when and how to act autonomously as well as when and how to act interdependently. Holonomous persons understand that as we transcend the self and become part of the whole, we do not lose our individuality but rather our egocentricity.

In a school, for example, teachers are autonomous decision makers. They are, however, part of a larger culture-the school-which influences and shapes their decisions. In turn, the school is an autonomous unit interacting within the influence of the district and community.

This dichotomous relationship, in which every human being exists, often gives rise to certain tensions, conflicts, and challenges. These stem from the internal drive for self-assertiveness, which conflicts with a yearning to be in harmony with others and the surrounding environment. A holonomous person, therefore, is one who possesses the capabilities to transcend this dichotomous relationship, maintaining self-directedness while acting both independently and interdependently. Holonomous people recognize their capacities to self-regulate and to be informed by the norms, values, and concerns of the larger system. Of equal importance, they recognize their capacity to influence the values, norms, and practices of the entire system.

We provide both irritation and inspiration for each other-the grist for each other's pearl making.

-Stephen Nachmonovitch

A holonomous person continually accesses and develops resources for further growth. One's goal is to become an integrated whole, capable of knowing and supporting the purposes and processes of the groups to which one belongs. A holonomous person is one who:

- Explores choices between self-assertion and integration
- Draws from prior knowledge, sensory data, and intuition to guide, hone, and refine actions
- Pursues ambiguities and possibilities to create new meanings
- Seeks balance between solitude and togetherness, action and

- reflection, and personal and professional goals
- Seeks perspectives beyond him/herself and others to generate resourceful responses.
