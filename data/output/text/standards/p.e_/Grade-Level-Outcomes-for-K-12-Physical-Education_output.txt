National Standards for K-12 Physical Education
The goal of physical education is to develop physically literate individuals who have the knowledge, skills and confidence to enjoy a lifetime of healthful physical activity.
To pursue a lifetime of healthful physical activity, a physically literate individual*:
•	 Has learned the skills necessary to participate in a variety of physical activities.
•	 Knows the implications and the benefits of involvement in various types of physical activities.
•	 Participates regularly in physical activity.
•	 Is physically fit.
•	 Values physical activity and its contributions to a healthful lifestyle.
Standard 1. The physically literate individual demonstrates competency in a variety of motor skills and movement patterns.
Standard 2. The physically literate individual applies knowledge of concepts, principles, strategies and tactics related to movement and performance.
Standard 3. The physically literate individual demonstrates the knowledge and skills to achieve and maintain a health-enhancing level of physical activity and fitness.
Standard 4. The physically literate individual exhibits responsible personal and social behavior that respects self and others.
Standard 5. The physically literate individual recognizes the value of physical activity for health, enjoyment, challenge, self-expression and/or social interaction.
