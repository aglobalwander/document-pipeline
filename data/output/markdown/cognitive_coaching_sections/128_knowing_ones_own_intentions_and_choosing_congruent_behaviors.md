## Knowing One's Own Intentions and Choosing Congruent Behaviors

Behaviors can be either reactive or proactive. Proactive behaviors are based on intention or goal awareness. The ultimate goal of mediation is to help an individual become self-mediating. With that end in mind, mediators are clear about their intentions in the moment. Perhaps they want to reflect understanding, clarify a communication, help the colleague to feel comfort, or cause self-examination. Choosing behaviors that support intentions like these requires the following:

- Being conscious of one's intention in the moment and how that intention serves a greater goal
- Being alert to a colleague's verbal and nonverbal cues
- Having a repertoire of mediational tools
- Knowing how a particular tool may serve a specific intention
- Being able to use that tool with a great degree of craftsmanship
- Anticipating and searching for the effects a tool produces in a colleague
