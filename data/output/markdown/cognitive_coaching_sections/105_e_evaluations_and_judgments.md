## E. Evaluations and Judgments

Although the coach may think that making judgments-either positive or negative-is helpful or reinforcing for the coachee, in actuality, the opposite is true. The coach who makes value-laden comments sends a signal that he/she is judgmental and being evaluative. Such comments shift

the focus from coaching to evaluation. They cause mistrust, deplete creativity, and create fear. Such comments halt self-directedness and selfevaluation on the part of the coachee because the coach makes the evaluations rather than inviting the coachee to self-evaluate. Notice that all comments contain value-laden words. For example:

- Your lesson went well.
- You did a great job.
- Your PowerPoint presentation was very effective.
- The way you got kids involved really worked.
- Your questioning strategy could be improved.

Obviously, posing mediating questions and providing nonjudgmental data are the most supportive of self-directedness. Making interpretations, causal relationships, and inferences-along with personal opinions and value judgments-all rob coachees of performing those cognitive processes for themselves and thus are to be minimized and avoided. You are invited to monitor your own language tools of providing feedback. Which are most common with you? How does your choice fit with your intentions?
