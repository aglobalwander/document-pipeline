## Cognitive Coaching Mediates Flexibility

Unless a teacher thinks flexibly, what is the likelihood that, when faced with stubborn problems, she will consider various options and perspectives or even think about the perspective of a struggling parent? Flexibility involves the ability to step beyond and outside oneself and look at a situation from a different perspective. This is what Jean Piaget (1954) called 'overcoming egocentrism.' Many psychologists believe that this is the highest state of intelligent behavior. As we shall see later, it is also a prerequisite state of mind for functioning interdependently. The mental skills of flexibility include the ability to shift among egocentric, allocentric, and macrocentric views; between a bird's-eye view (detail) and an eagle-eye focus (gestalt); between the immediate present and the longrange future; between logic and intuition; and between an individual and a group.

With clear intentions to enhance flexibility in thinking, coaches deliberately compose such mediative questions as:

- What might be some other options you have?
- As you evaluate these alternatives, which seem most plausible? As you brainstorm all the possibilities, which . . . ? Knowing that John is a kinesthetic learner, what might be some ways to help him with this math concept?
- Because there doesn't seem to be an immediate solution to this problem, what might you be telling yourself, to hold it in abeyance?

Research evidence from Edwards (chapter 14), reporting on the results of teachers being coached by experienced coaches, indicates that teachers increased their creativity and flexibility.
