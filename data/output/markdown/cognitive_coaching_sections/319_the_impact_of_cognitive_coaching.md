## THE IMPACT OF COGNITIVE COACHING

I n this final section, a synthesis of research on the effects of Cognitive Coaching is presented by Dr. Jenny Edwards who, for over 20 years, has been monitoring work on this topic.

In this section, we restate the higher goals of Cognitive Coaching in systems and acknowledge the difficulties and stresses teachers and schools experience. We comment on the long-held myth that schools can be run from the top down and describe the attributes of natural systems that are more characteristic of schools. We close with the attributes of an 'agile organization' in which Cognitive Coaching would most likely take root and flourish.
