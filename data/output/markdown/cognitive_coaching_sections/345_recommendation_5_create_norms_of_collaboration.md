## Recommendation #5: Create Norms of Collaboration

It is essential that administrators create norms of collaboration in buildings to encourage teachers to use their Cognitive Coaching skills. In Johnson's (1997) study, teachers indicated that norms of 'leave me alone' and 'younever-want-to-shine' in the teaching culture worked against their using Cognitive Coaching. If they rose above the rest, they tended to be asked to take on additional responsibilities, adding to their already full workload. In addition, teacher schedules and the structure of the buildings in which they worked tended to keep teachers away from their colleagues and contribute to feelings of isolation, making coaching and building relationships with other teachers a challenge (Johnson 1997). While Johnson's study was done in the 1990s when school norms were different from what they are in 2014, administrators will still benefit from creating norms of collaboration.
