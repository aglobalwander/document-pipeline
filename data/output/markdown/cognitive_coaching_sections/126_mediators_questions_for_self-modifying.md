## Mediator's Questions for Self-Modifying

Furthermore, because the mediator has an explicit intention of helping the colleague become self-coaching by internalizing this process, the coach will invite the colleague to reflect on the process that has just been experienced. Questions intended to surface the benefits of the process might be:

- 'As you reflect on this coaching process, what insights have you gained?'
- 'What were you aware of in our interaction that produced those insights?'
- 'What coaching questions might you ask yourself?'
- 'If, for some reason I was unavailable to you, what parts of this coaching process might you conduct on your own?'
