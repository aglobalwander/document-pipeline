AP Equity and Access Policy
College Board strongly encourages educators to make equitable access a guiding
principle for their AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared
students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination
of barriers that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and
socioeconomic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented. Schools
should make every effort to ensure their AP classes reflect the diversity of their
student population. College Board also believes that all students should have
access to academically challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes,
which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to
equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.

About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking
AP courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and
AP Exams are developed and scored by college faculty
and experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges
and universities in the United States grant credit,
advanced placement, or both on the basis of successful
AP Exam scores; more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the content
and skills that are the focus of the corresponding
college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also
organizes the content and skills into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many AP teachers have
told us they follow in order to focus their instruction.
The intention of this publication is to respect teachers’
time and expertise by providing a roadmap that they
can modify and adapt to their local priorities and
preferences. Moreover, by organizing the AP course
content and skills into units, the AP Program is able to provide teachers and students with formative assessments—Personal Progress Checks—that
teachers can assign throughout the year to measure
student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students:
Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically
challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to equitable preparation and
access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses:
The AP Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP courses
must participate in the AP Course Audit, a process through which AP teachers’ course materials are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.

AP Microeconomics Course and Exam Description

=== Page 9 ===
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the
AP teacher and the school principal (or designated
administrator) to confirm awareness and understanding
of the curricular and resource requirements. A syllabus
or course outline, detailing how course requirements
are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The
AP Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor;
all AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision,
piloting, and analysis to ensure that questions are
accurate, fair, and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development,
College Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher
education institutions. This feedback is carefully
considered to ensure that AP courses and exams are
able to provide students with a college-level learning
experience and the opportunity to demonstrate their
qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam
development process, relies on the expertise of both
AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice
questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course performance
assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands
of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are
scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion
is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained,
and their work is monitored throughout the Reading
for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief
Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers
in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of
the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a curve.
Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which means that
every student who meets the criteria for an AP score of
2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no matter how many
students that is. The criteria for the number of points
students must earn on the AP Exam to receive scores
of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently
validates for credit and placement purposes—include:
Bullet The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
Bullet The number of points researchers have found to be predictive that an AP student will succeed when placed into a subsequent higher-level college course.
Bullet Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP scores as follows:
AP Score

AP Microeconomics Course and Exam Description

=== Page 10 ===
While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and
universities. To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/ placement policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/creditpolicies
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score the free-response sections of the AP Exams.
Ninety-eight percent of surveyed educators who took
part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an
AP Reader, including opportunities to:
Bullet Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
Bullet Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure
to the quality and depth of the responses from the
entire pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
Bullet Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
Bullet Score from home: AP Readers have online
distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects.
Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
Bullet Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs):
AP Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their performance.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide suggests a
sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds skill instruction across units, organizes content
into topics, and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course topics and skills, create
customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.
*To report misuses, please call, 877-274-6474 (International: +1-212-632-1781).

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
Bullet Teachers and students sign in to or create their College Board accounts.
Bullet Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
Bullet Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
Bullet Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP Coordinator.
Bullet Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and
AP Coordinators to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following
additional benefits:
Bullet Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
Bullet Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
Bullet Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student pack.
The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
Bullet Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

About the AP
Microeconomics Course
AP Microeconomics is a college-level course that introduces students to the principles
of economics that apply to the functions of individual economic decision-makers. The
course also develops students’ familiarity with the operation of product and factor markets,
distributions of income, market failure, and the role of government in promoting greater
efficiency and equity in the economy. Students learn to use graphs, charts, and data to analyze, describe, and explain economic concepts.
College Course Equivalent
AP Microeconomics is equivalent to a one-semester introductory college course in economics.
Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites for AP Microeconomics. Students should be able to read a
college-level textbook and possess basic mathematics and graphing skills.

Introduction
The AP Microeconomics course outlined in this framework reflects a
commitment to what economics teachers, professors, and researchers
have agreed is the main goal of a college-level microeconomics course:
to introduce students to the principles that apply to individual economic decision-makers.
The AP Microeconomics Course and Exam Description
defines concepts, skills, and understandings required
by representative colleges and universities for granting college credit and placement. The course prepares
students to think like economists by using principles
and models to describe economic situations and predict
and explain outcomes. Like economists, students do so by using graphs, charts, and data.
Although the course framework is designed to provide
a clear and detailed description of the course content
and skills, it is not a curriculum. A college-level textbook that covers the required course content should be
used, and teachers create their own curricula to meet
the needs of their students and any state or local requirements.

Components
Overview
This course framework provides a clear and detailed description of the course requirements necessary for student success.
The course framework includes two essential components:
1   COURSE SKILLS
The course skills are central to the study and practice of economics.
Help students develop and apply the described skills on a regular basis over the span of the course.
2   COURSE CONTENT
The course content is organized into commonly taught units of study
that provide a suggested sequence for the course. These units comprise
the content and conceptual understandings that colleges and universities
typically expect students to master to qualify for college credit and/or
placement. This content is grounded in big ideas, which are cross-cutting
concepts that build conceptual understanding and spiral throughout the course.

Skills
The AP Economics skills describe what a student should be able to do while
exploring course concepts. The table that follows presents these skills, which
students should develop during the AP Microeconomics and AP Macroeconomics
courses. These skills form the basis of the tasks on the AP Exam.
The unit guides later in this publication embed and spiral these skills throughout
the course, providing teachers with one way to integrate the skills in the course
content with sufficient repetition to prepare students to transfer those skills when
taking the AP Exam. Course content may be paired with a variety of skills on the
AP Exam.
More detailed information about teaching the course skills can be found in the

Course
Content
Based on the Understanding by Design® (Wiggins and McTighe) model, this course
framework provides a clear and detailed description of the course requirements
necessary for student success. The framework specifies what students must
know, be able to do, and understand, with a focus on big ideas that encompass
core principles and theories of the discipline. The framework also encourages
instruction that prepares students for advanced economics coursework.
Big Ideas
The big ideas serve as the foundation of the course and allow students to create
meaningful connections among concepts. They are often abstract concepts or
themes that become threads that run throughout the course. Revisiting the big
ideas and applying them in a variety of contexts allows students to develop deeper
conceptual understanding. Below are the big ideas of the course and a brief
description of each:
BIG IDEA 1: SCARCITY AND MARKETS (MKT)
Limited resources and unlimited wants result in the need to make choices.
In a market economy, the choices of buyers and sellers determine market prices and the allocation of scarce resources.
BIG IDEA 2: COSTS, BENEFITS, AND MARGINAL ANALYSIS (CBA)
There are trade-offs associated with any decision. Making optimal decisions
requires evaluating the additional costs and benefits of possible actions.
BIG IDEA 3: PRODUCTION CHOICES AND BEHAVIOR (PRD)
Firms seek to minimize costs and maximize profits, which influences their
production decisions in the short run and long run.
BIG IDEA 4: MARKET INEFFICIENCY AND PUBLIC POLICY (POL)
Private markets can fail to allocate resources efficiently, and well-designed
public policy can endeavor to promote greater efficiency and equity in the economy.

UNITS
The course content is organized into commonly
taught units. The units have been arranged in a logical sequence frequently found in many college courses and textbooks.
The six units in AP Microeconomics and their weighting on the multiple-choice section of the AP Exam are listed below.
Pacing recommendations at the unit level and on the
Course at a Glance provide suggestions for how to teach
the required course content and administer the Personal
Progress Checks. The suggested class periods are
based on a schedule in which the class meets five days
a week for 45 minutes each day, with the assumption
that there are approximately 70 instructional days per semester. While these recommendations have been
made to aid planning, teachers should of course adjust the pacing based on the needs of their students,
alternate schedules (e.g., block scheduling), or their school’s academic calendar.
TOPICS
Each unit is broken down into teachable segments
called topics. The topic pages (starting on page 34) contain the required content for each topic.

AP MICROECONOMICS
Unit
Guides
Introduction
Designed with input from the community of AP Microeconomics
educators, the unit guides offer teachers helpful guidance in building
students’ skills and knowledge. The suggested sequence was identified
through a thorough analysis of the syllabi of highly effective AP teachers
and the organization of commonly assigned classroom resources.
This unit structure respects new AP teachers’ time by providing one
possible sequence they can adopt or modify rather than having to
build from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units enable the
AP Program to provide interested teachers with formative assessments—
the Personal Progress Checks—that they can assign their students at
the end of each unit to gauge progress toward success on the AP Exam.
However, experienced AP teachers who are satisfied with their current
course organization and exam results should feel no pressure to adopt
these units, which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

Using the Unit Guides
Developing Understanding provides an overview that
contextualizes and situates the key content of the unit within the scope of the course.
The big ideas serve as the foundation of the course and
develop understanding as they spiral throughout the course.
The essential questions are thought-provoking questions that motivate students and inspire inquiry.
Building Course Skills describes specific aspects of the skills that are appropriate to focus on in that unit.
Preparing for the AP Exam provides helpful tips and common
student misunderstandings identified from prior exam data.
The Unit at a Glance table shows the topics, related enduring
understandings, and suggested skills. The “class periods” column
has been left blank so that teachers can customize the time they spend on each topic.
The suggested skill for each topic shows one way you can link
the content in that topic to a specific AP Economics skill. The
individual skill has been thoughtfully chosen in a way that allows
teachers to spiral the skill throughout the course. Students should
be able to use multiple skills with each topic, so the suggested
skill is not meant to imply an exclusion of other skills.

Developing Understanding
To understand economics, students need to understand that because most resources are
scarce, individuals and societies must make choices. When making rational choices, people
do so “on the margin,” taking into account the additional costs and benefits of their decisions.
The foundational economic ideas addressed in this unit form the basis for more advanced
analysis of consumer and producer behavior that will be developed throughout the course.
BIG IDEA 1
Scarcity and Markets MKT § How do individuals and economies confront the problem of scarcity?
§ Why do people and countries trade with one another?
BIG IDEA 2
Costs, Benefits, and Marginal
Analysis CBA § Why do all decisions have costs?
§ Why do people consider the additional costs and benefits of possible actions rather than just the total costs and benefits when making decisions?
Building Course Skills
1.A  1.C  1.D  2.C  4.A
This unit focuses on providing students with a thorough understanding of basic economic concepts. They need this understanding to be able to apply these concepts in subsequent units as the content increases in difficulty.
Many students have not had significant exposure to the study of economics in previous coursework, which means that thinking like an economist (e.g., evaluating decisions based on constraints and trade-offs and thinking on the margin) may not come naturally. Students can begin to develop this skill set early on by using simulations and examples relevant to their lives. For example, if students engage in a simulation in which they consume additional units of a good and record the utility of consuming each additional unit (please refer to the sample activities for Unit 1 on p. 33), they will be better able to understand marginal decision making and the concept of diminishing marginal utility. By actually experiencing these concepts, students will be better equipped to describe them in their own words and apply them in later contexts.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Questions that require students to analyze quantitative data and perform calculations to demonstrate their mastery of consumer theory are a frequent challenge area on the
AP Exam. While many students grasp the concept of consumer optimization, they are unable to apply that understanding using numbers. To prepare students for the exam, spend time first grounding students conceptually in the principles and logic behind consumer theory and then reinforce this learning by providing opportunities for students to practice using numerical examples. Students should understand the importance of showing their work when doing any calculations in the course.
Graphical models are first introduced in this unit. Graphing is an important skill in this course that will be tested in the free-response section of the AP Exam. It's helpful to model how to set up their graphs in this unit and throughout the course, stressing the importance of properly labeling axes and curves, and providing opportunities for students to practice setting up graphs themselves and interpreting situations represented graphically.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples
below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways
that they approach teaching some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional
Approaches section beginning on p. 105 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 1.1
Real-World Examples
Remove a few desks from the classroom so that on the first day of class there aren’t
enough desks for each student. When students recognize the problem, discuss how the
class will decide who gets a desk. This is a good way to introduce the problem of scarcity.
It allows students to discuss trade-offs and resource allocation.
2 1.3
Graph and Switch
Create a list of situations that can be illustrated with the production possibilities curve.
Pair students and distribute a small whiteboard to each student. Read a scenario and
instruct students to draw a graph that represents the situation. Then have students share
their graphs with their partner and provide feedback to each other.
3 1.5
Authentic Tasks
Assign students to investigate the total costs and benefits of a decision relevant to
their lives. For example, students might research the total costs and benefits of receiving
a college degree. Then have students evaluate whether that decision makes sense by comparing total benefits and total costs.
4 1.6
Simulation and Debriefing
Carry out a classroom simulation where students consume additional units of a good
(e.g., glasses of water, marshmallows, or pieces of candy) and record the utility of consuming
each additional unit on a scale of 1–10. Debrief the activity as a class to connect the
experience to the concepts of marginal decision making and diminishing marginal utility.

b. Explain (using a table or graph as appropriate) how a rational consumer’s decision making involves the use of marginal benefits and marginal costs.
c. Calculate (using a table or a graph when appropriate) how a rational consumer’s decision making involves the use of marginal benefits and marginal costs.
CBA-2.A.1
Consumers face constraints and have to make optimal decisions accounting for these constraints.
CBA-2.A.2
In a model of rational consumer choice, consumers are assumed to make choices so as to maximize their total utility.
CBA-2.A.3
Consumers experience diminishing marginal utility in the consumption of goods and services.
CBA-2.A.4
Consumers allocate their limited income to purchase the combination of goods that maximizes their utility by equating/comparing the marginal utility of the last dollar spent on each good.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
CBA-2.B a. Define marginal analysis and related terms.
b. Explain a decision using marginal analysis (using a table or a graph when appropriate).
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
CBA-2.B.1
Marginal analysis involves comparing the additional benefit of increasing a given activity with the additional cost. Comparing marginal benefit (MB) with marginal cost (MC) helps individuals (firms) decide whether to increase, decrease, or maintain their consumption (production) levels.
CBA-2.B.2
The optimal quantity at any point in time does not depend on fixed costs (sunk costs) or fixed benefits that have already been determined by past choices.
CBA-2.B.3
The optimal quantity is achieved when marginal benefit is equal to marginal cost or where total benefit is maximized.

were introduced in the first unit and explore the factors that influence consumer and producer
behavior. They will learn how the interaction of consumers and producers in competitive markets
determines market prices and results in the most efficient allocation of scarce resources. At the
end of the unit, students will also begin exploring the effects of government policy on market
outcomes, laying the groundwork for additional analysis in the last unit of the course.

It is important for students to continue to build on their graphing skills in this unit.
Many students lose points on the AP Exam for not properly labeling axes and curves on graphs and for not properly demonstrating the effects of changes on graphs. It can help to model the appropriate setup of graphs, stressing the importance of proper labeling, and to provide opportunities for guided practice drawing and manipulating graphs.
Help students to see from the beginning of the course how graphs can be used as tools for making sense of economic situations and predicting and explaining economic outcomes. These are important skills in this unit in the context of learning about supply and demand. Even if a graph is not asked for on the exam, drawing one may help to answer a given question or explain a situation.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Exam, students frequently have difficulty answering questions that require them to analyze numbers and do calculations that are relevant to the content of this unit (e.g., calculating and interpreting measures of elasticity and calculating areas of consumer surplus, producer surplus, and deadweight loss).
Students may apply the wrong formula or mathematical process, such as when they incorrectly calculate the elasticity of demand as the change in quantity divided by the change in price, when they should instead calculate the percentage change in quantity divided by the percentage change in price.
Providing students with opportunities to practice carrying out these calculations and emphasizing the importance of showing their work can help identify these types of mistakes and correct them before the AP Exam.
In other cases, though, calculation errors reveal a lack of understanding of the underlying concept, which manifests itself in an incorrect calculation. For example, students might know how to calculate the area of a triangle when asked to calculate consumer or producer surplus from a given graph but then they calculate the area of the wrong triangle. Analyzing numbers and doing calculations in this course require an understanding of the content itself.

Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 2.1
Simulation and Debriefing
Carry out a classroom auction for an item of value to introduce students to the relationship
between price and quantity demanded. Use the data from the auction to graph demand.
Then simulate a change in one of the determinants of demand (e.g., by providing students
with fake money to increase their income) so that students can distinguish between a
change in quantity demanded and a change in demand. Debrief the experience with students
to ensure that connections are made to the concepts being studied.
2 2.2
Simulation and Debriefing
Explain a hypothetical scenario in which you need to hire workers for one hour to clean the
school bathrooms on Friday afternoon or describe another scenario that is applicable to
your students’ lives. Create a supply schedule on the board and conduct an auction, asking
how many students will work for $0, $1, $2, etc. As students respond, ask them to explain
their decisions. Graph the data and discuss the relationship between price and quantity supplied in the context of their decision making.
3 2.7
Think-Pair-Share
Pair students and tell them to choose an economic good. Provide students with three
index cards on which to write three different situations that will change the good’s demand
or supply. Collect the cards and choose a few to read to the class. For each scenario
that is read out loud, students will draw an accurately labeled supply-demand graph that
demonstrates the effect of the change on equilibrium price and quantity and check their
graphs with their partner. Then call on a student pair to share the graph with the class.

Production, Cost, and the Perfect
Competition Model
UNIT 3
~11–13 CLASS PERIODS
Developing Understanding
Unit 3 focuses on firm behavior and culminates with an introduction to the perfect
competition model, which will form a basis of comparison for other market structures in the
next unit. This unit builds on the idea of supply, which was introduced in the previous unit, and
explores in more detail what drives the decisions that firms make. Thinking like a firm may be
challenging for students, who are more used to acting as consumers in their everyday lives.
Drawing connections to students’ own experiences and carrying out classroom simulations
can help bring these concepts to life. Reminding students of the ways in which the behavior
of firms is consistent with the ideas of cost-benefit analysis and marginal decision-making
addressed in the first unit of the course may also be helpful in elucidating these concepts.

Building Course Skills
1.A  1.C  1.D  2.A  4.A
In this unit, students will be expected to describe the production function, the costs of production, and firms’ profit-maximizing behavior. Students should be able to represent these concepts graphically and numerically. It is important to devote sufficient time to introducing new vocabulary to students and may be helpful for students to create a vocabulary notebook. Since grasping the behavior of firms is not always intuitive for students, consider beginning this unit by carrying out a factory simulation in the classroom and having students graph the data generated and interpret the outcomes of the simulation. It helps to debrief the simulation during and immediately following the activity to clarify misconceptions and deepen students’ understanding of relevant concepts. Students should have additional opportunities to practice graphing, interpreting given graphs, and doing numerical problems in the context of the content covered in this unit. Proper graphing habits should continue to be reinforced throughout this unit and the entire course.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The perfect competition model is foundational to the study of market structures in this course and is frequently tested on the AP Exam. It’s important to ground students in the conceptual underpinnings of perfect competition, including the concept of efficiency and production in both the short run and the long run. Students will benefit from having multiple opportunities to practice drawing and interpreting graphs that represent perfect competition; past AP Exams may be helpful in this exercise. If students are able to grasp the concepts behind perfect competition and how it’s graphically represented, they will be better able to understand imperfect market structures in the next unit.
Questions on the AP Exam that cover long-run production costs are often challenging for students. It may be helpful to provide students with opportunities to practice identifying and explaining given situations to reinforce their understanding of long-run production. Keep in
mind, though, that while this is a difficult topic for students, it does not comprise a significant portion of the AP Exam.

Simulation and Debriefing
Carry out a factory simulation in which students take on the role of producers in a firm.
Begin the simulation with a few fixed capital resources and no workers. Then add workers
one at a time and record production data as students seek to produce additional units of
a good (e.g., paper links). Connect the concepts of total product, marginal product, and
average product to their results when debriefing the experience.
2 3.2
Think-Pair-Share
Provide students with a list of formulas for short-run production costs. Include formulas
that show total, average, and marginal costs. Some formulas on the list should be correct
and some should be incorrect. Students should then determine which are or are not correct and explain why to a partner.

Real-World Examples
The difference between accounting profit and economic profit is often difficult for
students to understand, so it can be helpful to solidify students’ understanding by using
concrete examples. You can provide students with the salary and costs associated with
a particular job and discuss whether that person makes accounting profit. Then discuss
what implicit costs are and whether that person makes economic profit.

b.	 Explain (using graphs where appropriate) equilibrium and firm decision making in perfectly competitive markets and how prices in perfectly competitive markets lead to efficient outcomes.
c.	 Calculate (using data from a graph or table as appropriate) economic profit (loss) in perfectly competitive markets.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PRD-3.A.5
At a competitive market equilibrium, the price of a product equals both the private marginal benefit received by the last unit consumed and the private marginal cost incurred to produce the last unit, thus achieving allocative efficiency.
PRD-3.A.6
In a short-run competitive equilibrium, price can either be above or below its long-run competitive level resulting in profits or losses, motivating entry or exit of firms and moving prices and quantities toward long-run equilibrium.
PRD-3.A.7
In a long-run perfectly competitive equilibrium, productive efficiency implies all operating firms produce at efficient scale, price equals marginal cost and minimum average total cost, and firms earn zero economic profit.
PRD-3.A.8
Firms may be in a constant cost, increasing cost, or decreasing cost industry. Long-run prices depend on the portion of the long-run cost curves on which firms operate.
PRD-3.A.9
A perfectly competitive market in long-run equilibrium is allocatively and productively efficient.

Developing Understanding
In the real world, firms rarely operate in perfectly competitive markets. In this unit, students
will encounter the ways in which imperfectly competitive markets depart from the model
of perfect competition introduced in Unit 3. Students will continue to build on their
understanding of what it means for a market to be efficient or inefficient as they consider the
welfare implications of imperfect markets. In the context of learning about oligopoly behavior,
students will be introduced to the field of game theory as an approach to studying strategic decision making.
Building Course Skills
1.D  2.C  4.B  4.C
In this unit, students should be able to describe the similarities and differences between market structures. To help students develop this skill, consider first approaching the topic by using real-world examples and having students describe distinguishing characteristics of those examples. Using graphic organizers such as Venn diagrams might also be helpful to keep track of similarities and differences.
Graphing continues to be essential in this unit, and graphing each market structure can be difficult for some students. Be deliberate in modeling the differences between a license/patent monopoly and a natural monopoly, as well as a monopolistically competitive firm both in the short-run (with profits or losses) and at long-run equilibrium.
While it is critical that students understand the differences between the graphs in each of these models, it is also important to stress the similarities. For example, a common characteristic of all imperfect product market graphs is that the marginal revenue curve lies below the demand curve.
Regardless of the market structure, students should practice neatly drawing each graph and labeling it appropriately until they can do so flawlessly.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Game theory is an important concept in the field of economics and is a challenge for some students on both the multiple-choice and free-response sections of the
AP Exam. Students should have sufficient opportunities for guided practice interpreting payoff matrices, identifying dominant strategies and Nash equilibria, and redrawing payoff matrices after given changes.
Answering past free-response questions on the topic (e.g., 2013 AP Exam Question #2) is a good way to practice.

In a market with monopolistic competition, firms producing differentiated products may earn positive, negative, or zero economic profit in the short run. Firms typically use advertising as a means of differentiating their product. Free entry and exit drive profits to zero in the long run. The output level, however, is smaller than the output level needed to minimize average total costs, creating excess capacity. The price is greater than marginal cost, creating allocative inefficiency.

Developing Understanding
By this point in the course, students are familiar with how product markets operate and what
drives firm decision making. In this unit, students will apply many of the concepts they learned
previously but now in the context of factor markets. Like with product markets, the laws
of supply and demand apply to factor markets with an upward-sloping supply curve and a
downward-sloping demand curve. In factor markets, firms hire additional resources up to the
point at which the resource’s marginal revenue product is equal to its marginal resource cost.
This decision is another application of the idea first introduced in Unit 1 of making an optimal
choice by equating marginal benefit with marginal cost and firms’ decisions to maximize
profits where marginal revenue equals marginal cost.
Building Course Skills
1.A  2.A  2.C  3.B
In this unit, students should be able to describe the principles of factor markets so that they can apply that understanding in context. Devote sufficient time to introducing students to new concepts and vocabulary while also connecting key terms and concepts to items addressed previously in the course.
Students should also be able to represent factor markets graphically in this unit. It helps to explain the basis of each model and the underlying assumptions so that students can create properly labeled graphs to represent economic situations and interpret given graphs.
Students will continue to build their quantitative skills by solving problems in which they interpret how firms should allocate inputs to minimize costs or maximize profits. Once again, it’s important to spend time conceptually grounding students in the underlying concepts of these quantitative problems and provide ample time for numerical examples and practice.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Factor markets are one of the biggest challenge areas for students on the AP Exam.
There can be a tendency to rush through this unit because it only accounts for a small percentage of the multiple-choice section of the AP Exam and is near the end of the course. Sufficient time should be devoted to introducing the concepts and providing opportunities for student practice to properly prepare students for factor market questions on the exam. It may also be helpful to teach factor markets as another application of concepts such as supply and demand and marginal analysis so that students can see the connections to previous content and the ways in which factor markets differ. For example, cost minimization by firms works like utility maximization by consumers when you equalize the marginal product per dollar for each input.

Developing Understanding
This unit prepares students to understand the theoretical arguments for and against
government intervention in markets and therefore has important public policy applications.
Students will examine the conditions under which markets may fail and the effectiveness
of government policies that are designed to correct market failures. In exploring the idea of
market failures and government interventions to correct them, students will build on their
understanding of efficiency and what it means for a firm to produce the socially optimal
quantity or not. Students will also learn about how inequality is measured and the sources of income and wealth inequality.
Building Course Skills
1.A  1.B  2.A  4.B  4.C
Students will have had multiple opportunities to practice the course skills by this point in the course. This unit provides various opportunities to engage students in identifying economic concepts and principles, interpreting given outcomes, and predicting and explaining the effects of economic situations using real-world examples that are relevant to their lives and role as citizens in a democratic republic.
Continue to appropriately model and provide opportunities for students to practice graphing economic situations and the effects of changes in economic situations.
This is particularly important in the context of graphing externalities and the effects of government intervention, which are frequent challenge areas for students on the AP Exam.
Preparing for the AP Exam
As in Unit 5, the topics addressed in this unit (namely, externalities and the effects of government intervention in different market structures) appear in some of the most frequently missed questions on the AP Exam.
Again, there may be an inclination to rush through this unit since overall it accounts for only a small percentage of the multiple choice questions on the AP Exam and is at the very end of the course when there may be limited time left before the exam.
However, it is important to prepare students to answer questions about positive and negative externalities, deadweight loss, and government interventions.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples
below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways
that they approach teaching some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional
Approaches section beginning on p. 105 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 6.2
Response Groups
Working in small groups, provide students with examples of situations that describe either
a negative or positive externality. Give each group a different situation. Each group should
identify the externality, graph the market failure indicating the deadweight loss, and then
offer solutions to correct the situation. A presenter from each group will demonstrate the findings for the class.
2 6.3
Socratic Seminar
Tell students a true or fictional story of a public good problem. For example, explain that
you live on a lake that is no longer safe for swimming because of an algae bloom. Provide
pictures and compelling details. Engage students in a classroom discussion to determine
how and why a private market could or could not solve this problem. Challenge students to propose a cost-effective solution.
3 6.4
Practice Modeling
First, demonstrate to students how to graphically model the effect of a government
policy action in the context of a specific market structure. Then change the scenario by
considering a different action or market structure. Provide an opportunity for students to
practice generating the graph with appropriate labels. Allow students to provide feedback
to one another and circle the room to clarify questions and misunderstandings.

Topic 6.1 Socially
Efficient and In efficient Market Outcomes
Required Course Content
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
POL-2
Perfectly competitive markets allocate resources efficiently, but imperfect
competition often results in market inefficiencies.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
POL-2.A a. Define social efficiency.
b. Explain (using graphs where appropriate) why resource allocation in perfectly competitive markets is socially efficient.
POL-2.A.1
The optimal quantity of a good occurs where the marginal benefit of consuming the last unit equals the marginal cost of producing that last unit, thus maximizing total economic surplus.
POL-2.A.2
The market equilibrium quantity is equal to the socially optimal quantity only when all social benefits and costs are internalized by individuals in the market. Total economic surplus is maximized at that quantity. [See also
PRD-3 and POL-3.]
POL-2.B
Explain (using graphs where appropriate) how private incentives can lead to actions by rational agents that are socially undesirable (inefficient) market outcomes.
POL-2.B.1
Rational agents can pursue private actions to exploit or exercise market characteristics known as market power.
POL-2.B.2
Rational agents make optimal decisions by equating private marginal benefits and private marginal costs that can result in market inefficiencies.
SUGGESTED SKILL

Market Failure and the Role of Government
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
POL-2.B
Explain (using graphs where appropriate) how private incentives can lead to actions by rational agents that are socially undesirable (inefficient) market outcomes.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
POL-2.B.3
Policymakers use cost-benefit analysis to evaluate different actions to reduce or eliminate market inefficiencies.
POL-2.B.4
Market inefficiencies can be eliminated by designing policies that equate marginal social benefit with marginal social cost.
POL-2.C a. Explain equilibrium allocations in imperfect markets relative to efficient allocations (using graphs where appropriate) and why these markets are inefficient.
b. Calculate (using graphs where appropriate) the deadweight loss resulting from the production of a non-efficient quantity.
POL-2.C.1
Equilibrium allocations can deviate from efficient allocations due to situations such as monopoly; oligopoly; monopolistic competition; negative and positive externalities in production or consumption; asymmetric information; and insufficient production of public goods.
POL-2.C.2
Producing any non-efficient quantity results in deadweight loss.

POL-3
Private incentives can fail to account for all socially relevant considerations.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
POL-3.A a. Define externalities.
b. Explain (using graphs where appropriate) how in the presence of externalities, private markets do not take into consideration social costs or social benefits.
POL-3.A.1
The socially optimal quantity of a good occurs where the marginal social benefit of consuming the last unit equals the marginal social cost of producing that last unit, thus maximizing total economic surplus.
POL-3.A.2
Externalities are either positive or negative and arise from lack of well-defined property rights and/or high transaction costs.
POL-3.A.3
In the presence of externalities, rational agents respond to private costs and benefits and not to external costs and benefits.
POL-3.A.4
Rational agents have the incentive to free ride when a good is non-excludable.
POL-3.B
Explain (using graphs where appropriate) how public policies address positive or negative externalities.
POL-3.B.1
Policies that address positive or negative externalities include taxes/subsidies, environmental regulation, public provision, the assignment of property rights, and the reassignment of property rights through private transactions.

Private incentives can fail to account for all socially relevant considerations.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
POL-3.C a. Define whether goods are rival and/or excludable.
b. Explain how the nature of rival and/ or excludable goods influences the behavior of individuals and groups.
POL-3.C.1
Private goods are rival and excludable, and public goods are non-rival and non-excludable.
POL-3.C.2
Due to the free rider problem, private individuals usually lack the incentive to produce public goods, leaving government as the only producer.
POL-3.C.3
Governments sometimes choose to produce private goods, such as educational services, and to allow free access to them.

In imperfect markets, well-designed government policy can reduce waste.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
POL-4.A a. Define government policy interventions in imperfect markets.
b. Explain (using graphs where appropriate) how government policies can alter market outcomes in perfectly and imperfectly competitive markets.
c. Calculate (using data from a graph or table as appropriate) changes in market outcomes resulting from government policies in perfectly competitive and imperfectly competitive markets.
POL-4.A.1
Per-unit taxes and subsidies affect the total price consumers pay, net price firms receive, equilibrium quantity, consumer and producer surpluses, deadweight loss, and government revenue or cost. The impact of change depends on the price elasticity of demand and supply.
POL-4.A.2
Lump-sum taxes and lump-sum subsidies do not change either marginal cost or marginal benefit; only fixed costs will be affected.
POL-4.A.3
Binding price ceilings and floors affect prices and quantities differently depending on the market structures (perfect competition, monopoly, monopolistic competition, and monopsony) and the price elasticities of supply and demand.

Selecting and Using
Course Materials
Although a college-level textbook will cover the
required course content, students should also examine
alternative source materials in different and varied forms
to develop the habits of thinking like an economist.
Textbooks
The AP Microeconomics course requires the
use of a college-level textbook. It is unlikely that a
high school-level textbook will cover the content and
skills of the course in the depth necessary to succeed
on the AP Exam. It is important to select a textbook that
covers the content of the AP Microeconomics course
as outlined in the course framework. Additionally, a
textbook that emphasizes skill development will be
helpful in providing students with opportunities to
practice graphing, solving numerical problems, and explaining economic situations.
An example textbook list of college-level textbooks
that meet the AP Course Audit resource requirements is provided on AP Central.
Secondary Sources
Supplementing the textbook with editorials, journal articles, news articles, and essays and books by
economists can help bring course concepts to life and
encourage students to think critically. Microeconomists study a wide variety of current issues; examples
include price hikes during natural disasters, pollution abatement, healthcare costs, traffic jams, and
minimum-wage laws. Using a variety of sources that
represent different points of view will engage students while enhancing learning.

Teaching the
AP Economics Courses
The AP Microeconomics course framework presents
content in six units to be taught in a single semester.
If teachers are offering both AP Microeconomics and AP Macroeconomics with the same students over the course of two semesters and do not want to
repeat the introductory material that is covered in both courses, they can use the AP Microeconomics course framework for Units 1 and 2. Following the
AP Microeconomics course framework for the
first two units will ensure coverage of topics that are included in the AP Microeconomics course
(e.g., consumer choice theory, elasticity) but not the AP Macroeconomics course. From there, teachers can proceed to AP Macroeconomics Unit 2 or AP Microeconomics Unit 3, depending on which course they choose to teach first.

Instructional Strategies
The AP Microeconomics course framework outlines the concepts and skills
students need to master to be successful on the AP Exam. In order to address
those concepts and skills effectively, it helps to incorporate a variety of instructional
approaches into daily lessons and activities. The following table presents strategies
that can help students apply their understanding of course concepts.
Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Activating Prior
Knowledge
Students recall what they already know about a concept and make connections to current studies.
To prepare students to establish content connections.
When introducing the monopoly model, ask students to recall what they previously learned about perfect competition and list how firms in monopoly markets are similar to and different from firms in perfect competition.
For example, firms in both market structures face increasing marginal costs.
Authentic
Tasks
Students apply economic analysis to real-world issues.
To provide students with authentic experience in how economists study current issues and problems.
When covering the concept of market failure, ask students to work alone or in groups to analyze a local economic issue, like water quality, traffic jams, or public stadium financing. Then have students use their analysis to write a letter promoting the most cost-effective solution to a local supervisory board or media outlet.
Debate
Students engage in an informal or a formal argumentation of an issue.
The goal is to debate ideas without attacking the people who defend those ideas.
To provide students with an opportunity to collect and orally present evidence supporting the affirmative and negative arguments of a proposition or an issue.
Have students debate whether or not the federal government should impose a $15 minimum wage (price floor).

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Flipped
Instruction
Students watch a recorded lecture before attending class. In class, students then apply their understanding of the lecture through interactive activities with teacher support.
To provide students with the opportunity to practice skills and wrestle with problems in class, where teacher help is available.
To prepare for a lesson on labor markets, assign students to watch a video lecture explaining how MRP and MRC are derived in perfectly competitive labor markets.
In class the next day, have students participate in a labor market simulation that allows them to calculate MRP based on their own performance in a series of tasks.
Graph and Switch
Students generate a graph and then switch papers or whiteboards to review each other’s work.
To allow students to practice creating different representations and both give and receive immediate feedback.
Provide students with the initial scenario provided in the prompt from a released FRQ—for example,
Firm X is operating as a perfectly competitive firm at long-run equilibrium—and ask students to draw a correctly labeled graph of the scenario.
Have students switch papers or whiteboards and provide feedback on each other’s work.
Model
Questions
Students answer items from released AP Exams.
To provide rigorous practice and assess students’ ability to respond to AP-level multiple-choice and free-response questions.
After teaching about positive and negative externalities, provide an opportunity for students to practice answering a previous free response question on one of these topics.
Practice
Modeling
Model techniques for the class. Students then practice using those techniques and gain feedback from their peers.
To learn from the teacher’s example and then have opportunities for guided practice.
When introducing a new graph in the course, model it for students first by drawing it on the board, explaining what you are doing and why, and then provide an opportunity for students to practice generating the graph with appropriate labels themselves.
Allow students to provide feedback to one another and circle the room to check for understanding.

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
QHT
Students expand their prior knowledge of vocabulary words by marking words with a Q, an
H, or a T (Q signals words students have a question about; H signals words students have heard and might be able to identify;
T signals words students know well enough to teach to their peers).
To allow students to build on their prior knowledge of words and to provide a forum for peer teaching and learning of new words.
When introducing game theory, provide students with a list of terms specific to game theory (e.g., players, strategies, payoffs, dominant strategy).
Have students mark their list with Q for words they have questions about, H for words they have heard and might be able to identify, and T for words they know well enough to teach. Discuss their markings as a class and ask students who have marked any words with a T to describe the terms to their classmates. Keep in mind that students may know the words in different contexts, where they have slightly different meanings.
Real-World
Examples
Teacher and students relate personal stories, examples, or anecdotes to illustrate key content.
To create relevance and personal meaning of economic terms and models, which can otherwise be very abstract for students.
When introducing fixed and variable costs, ask students to recall experiences they’ve had with starting small businesses.
Then ask students to identify the fixed and variable costs of these enterprises.
Response
Groups
Students work in small groups with thought provoking questions to develop solutions.
A presenter shares each group’s findings with the class.
To allow students to collaborate, practice, and build content understanding with each other.
Once students have learned the basic model of a perfectly competitive labor market, give them graphing and analysis problems to work on with partners. Students construct their responses on whiteboards, discussing questions and ideas with their partners, and then share their findings with the class.
Simplify the
Problem
Students use simpler numbers or examples to help solve a problem.
To provide insight into the strategies needed to solve the problem.
When explaining to students why a firm will continue to operate in the short run despite earning economic losses, use dollar figures to represent a coffee shop’s fixed and variable costs, showing why the shop would continue to operate if its monthly revenue is above variable costs but below total costs.

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Simulation and Debriefing
Students assume the role of characters or economic agents in a simulation or case study. Students then discuss and reflect on the activity to clarify its purpose.
To help students better grasp a concept by participating in short, memorable experiences.
Involve students in a factory simulation in order to introduce the concepts of total product, marginal product of labor, and diminishing marginal productivity. Debrief as a class to reflect on the purpose and meaning of the activity.
Socratic
Seminar
This is a focused discussion in which students engage with open-ended questions tied to a specific topic or text. The discussion continues with student responses and, when needed, additional open ended questions that allow students to express their ideas and engage in complex thinking.
To help students arrive at a new understanding by asking questions that clarify; challenge assumptions; question facts, reasons, and evidence; or examine implications and outcomes.
Following instruction on negative externalities, assign students several readings relating to a local externality problem—for example, light pollution caused by stadium lights—and encourage students to discuss and evaluate market and governmental solutions to the problem.
Systematic and Explicit
Instruction
Instruction that involves a teacher demonstrating a specific plan for solving problem types and students using this plan to think their way through a solution.
To provide students with procedures and questions to ask when solving problems.
Demonstrate a specific series of steps for students to systematically calculate opportunity costs and identify comparative advantage in both input and output problems.
Think-Pair-Share
Students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with the class.
To construct meaning about a topic or question by first developing ideas individually that are then tested and revised with a partner and the class.
After Systematic and Explicit
Instruction or Flipped
Instruction on solving game theory problems, present a game matrix and ask students to work through it and identify any dominant strategies on their own. Then ask students to share responses and questions with a partner and then share their results with the class.
Vocabulary
Notebook
Using a designated format such as a notebook, journal, or personal list to maintain an ongoing list of vocabulary words, definitions, and connections to academic study.
To facilitate and sustain a systematic process of vocabulary development.
Scarcity is the first topic of the course, and students will immediately be introduced to important economic terms that will come up throughout the course. Have students start a vocabulary notebook with definitions of key terms (e.g., scarcity, economics, land, labor, capital) and continue to add to their notebook with each new topic.

Developing Course Skills
Throughout the course, students will develop skills
that are fundamental to the discipline of economics.
Students will benefit from multiple opportunities to develop these skills in a scaffolded manner
since they represent the complex skills that adept economists demonstrate.
The AP Microeconomics course framework provides
a suggested skill for each course topic. However, the
suggested skill provided should not be the only one
used to teach any given topic. One skill is provided as a starting point for thinking about how to
approach teaching that topic, but it is important in
the discipline of economics that students are able to
use all the skills. For example, “Topic 2.1: Demand”
suggests skill “4.A: Draw an accurately labeled graph or
visual to represent an economic model or market.” When
approaching the topic of demand, students will need
to be able to draw a demand curve (Skill Category 4),
but within that given topic, students will also need to do
things like describe the law of demand (Skill Category 1),
explain what might have caused a shift in the demand
curve (Skill Category 2), and predict and explain the result
of a change in a determinant of demand (Skill Category 3).
The tables on the pages that follow look at each of the
skill categories and provide examples of questions that
frame instruction for each skill, along with sample
activities and strategies for incorporating that skill into the course.

Question 1: Long 1.
On the island of Gratin, potatoes are produced in a perfectly competitive constant cost industry. The market for
potatoes is currently in long-run equilibrium at the market price of $5 per sack.
(a) Draw correctly labeled side-by-side graphs for the potato market and for farmer Lamo and show each of the following.
(i) The market equilibrium quantity and price, labeled A text reads: Q subscript M.and $5, respectively
(ii) The quantity produced and the price for farmer Lamo, labeledA text reads: Q subscript L.and $5, respectively
(b) Believing that the incomes of potato farmers are unfairly low, the government of Gratin imposes a binding price
floor at $7 per sack. The government will purchase any surpluses of potatoes. On your graph in part (a), show each of the following.
(i) The market quantity of potatoes that would be supplied at the price floor, labeledA text reads: Q subscript F.
(ii) The profit farmer Lamo earns, shaded completely
(c) If the absolute value of the price elasticity of demand is 0.92, would consumer spending on potatoes increase,
decrease, or stay the same as a result of the price floor? Explain.
(d) How would the price floor affect the demand for labor by potato farmers?
(e) Potatoes, corn, and rice are all produced on the island of Gratin in perfectly competitive markets.
(i) Assume corn is a substitute in production (an alternate output) for potatoes. How would setting the price floor
on potatoes affect the equilibrium price and quantity of corn?
(ii) As a result of an increase in the price of rice, the demand for potatoes increased. Are rice and potatoes substitutes or complements in consumption?

Big Idea 1: Scarcity and Markets (MKT)
Limited resources and unlimited wants result in the need to make choices. In a market economy, the
choices of buyers and sellers determine market prices and the allocation of scarce resources.
Enduring
Understanding
Learning Objective
Essential Knowledge
MKT-1
Most resources are scarce, and in most cases use of resources involves constraints and trade-offs.
MKT-1.A
Define resources and the cause(s) of their scarcity.
MKT-1.A.1
Economic trade-offs arise from the lack of sufficient resources (scarcity) to meet society’s wants and needs.
MKT-1.A.2
Most factors of production (such as land, labor, and capital) are
scarce, but some factors of production (such as established
knowledge) may not be scarce due to their non-rival nature.
MKT-1.B
Define how resource allocation is influenced by the economic system adopted by society.
MKT-1.B.1
Resource allocation involves answering three basic questions—
What goods and services to produce? How to produce
those goods and services? And who consumes those goods and services?
MKT-1.B.2
Resource allocation is significantly influenced by the economic
system adopted by society, such as command economy, market
economy, or mixed economy. Each system involves a particular
set of institutional arrangements and a coordinating mechanism
for allocating scarce resources and distributing output.
MKT-1.C a. Define (using graphs as appropriate) the production possibilities curve (PPC) and related terms.
b. Explain (using graphs as appropriate) how the production possibilities curve (PPC) illustrates opportunity costs, trade-offs, inefficiency, efficiency, and economic growth or contraction under various conditions.
c. Calculate (using data from PPCs or tables as appropriate) opportunity cost.
MKT-1.C.1
The PPC is a model used to show the trade-offs associated with allocating resources.
MKT-1.C.2
The PPC can be used to illustrate the concepts of scarcity,
opportunity cost, efficiency, underutilized resources, and economic growth or contraction.
MKT-1.C.3
The shape of the PPC depends on whether opportunity costs are constant, increasing, or decreasing.
MKT-1.C.4
The PPC can shift due to changes in factors of production as well as changes in productivity/technology.
MKT-1.C.5
Economic growth results in an outward shift of the PPC.

MKT-2
The consequences of scarcity can be mitigated through specialization in production and by exchange.
MKT-2.A a. Define absolute advantage and comparative advantage.
b. Determine (using data from PPCs or tables as appropriate) absolute and comparative advantage.
MKT-2.A.1
Absolute advantage describes a situation in which an individual,
business, or country can produce more of a good or service
than any other producer with the same quantity of resources.
MKT-2.A.2
Comparative advantage describes a situation in which an
individual, business, or country can produce a good or service
at a lower opportunity cost than another producer.
MKT-2.B a. Explain (using data from PPCs or tables as appropriate) how specialization according to comparative advantage with appropriate terms of trade can lead to gains from trade.
b. Calculate (using data from PPCs or tables as appropriate) mutually beneficial terms of trade.
MKT-2.B.1
Production specialization according to comparative advantage,
not absolute advantage, results in exchange opportunities that lead to consumption possibilities beyond the PPC.
MKT-2.B.2
Comparative advantage and opportunity costs determine the
terms of trade for exchange under which mutually beneficial trade can occur.
MKT-3
Individuals and firms respond to incentives and face constraints.
MKT-3.A a. Define (using graphs as appropriate) key terms and factors related to consumer decision making and the law of demand.
b. Explain (using graphs as appropriate) the relationship between price and quantity demanded and how buyers respond to incentives and constraints.
MKT-3.A.1
A well-defined system of property rights is necessary for the market system to function well.
MKT-3.A.2
Economic agents respond to incentives.
MKT-3.A.3
Individuals often respond to incentives, such as those
presented by prices, but also face constraints, such as income, time, and legal and regulatory frameworks.
MKT-3.A.4
The law of demand suggests that a change in the own-price
causes a change in quantity demanded in the opposite direction
and a movement along a demand (marginal benefit) curve.
MKT-3.A.5
The conceptual relationship between price and quantity stated
by the law of demand leads to downward-sloping demand
curves explained by the income effect and substitution effect and/or by diminishing marginal utility.
MKT-3.A.6
The market demand curve (schedule) is derived from the
summation of individual demand curves (schedules).
MKT-3.B
Explain (using graphs as appropriate) buyers’ responses to changes in incentives and constraints.
MKT-3.B.1
Changes in the determinants of consumer demand can cause the demand curve to shift.

MKT-3
Individuals and firms respond to incentives and face constraints.
MKT-3.C a. Define (using graphs as appropriate) the law of supply.
b. Explain (using graphs as appropriate) the relationship between price and quantity supplied.
MKT-3.C.1
A change in own-price causes a change in quantity supplied in
the same direction and a movement along a supply curve.
MKT-3.C.2
The market supply curve (schedule) is derived from the
summation of individual supply curves (schedules). The market supply curve is upward-sloping.
MKT-3.D
Explain (using graphs as appropriate) producers’ (sellers’) responses to changes in incentives and technology.
MKT-3.D.1
Changes in the determinants of supply can cause the supply curve to shift.
MKT-3.E a. Define measures of elasticity.
b. Explain (using graphs where appropriate) measures of elasticity and the impact of a given price change on total revenue or total expenditure.
c. Calculate (using data from a graph or a table as appropriate) measures of elasticity.
MKT-3.E.1
Economists use the concept of elasticity to measure the
magnitude of percentage changes in quantity owing to any given
changes in the own-price, income, and prices of related goods.
MKT-3.E.2
Price elasticity of demand is measured by the percentage
change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage
change in price or the responsiveness of the quantity
demanded to changes in price. Elasticity varies along a linear demand curve, meaning slope is not elasticity.
MKT-3.E.3
Ranges of values of elasticity of demand are described as
elastic or inelastic with the separating benchmark being a
magnitude of 1, where the change in the price and the change in the quantity demanded are proportional.
a. When the magnitude of the value of elasticity is greater than 1,
the demand is described as being elastic with respect to that price in the range of the given change.
b. When the magnitude of the value of elasticity is less than 1,
the demand is described as being inelastic with respect to that price in the range of the given change.
c. When the magnitude of the value of elasticity is equal to 1,
the demand is described as being unit elastic with respect to that price in the range of the given change.
MKT-3.E.4
The price elasticity of demand depends on certain factors such as the availability of substitutes.
MKT-3.E.5
The impact of a given price change on total revenue or total
expenditure will depend on whether demand is elastic, inelastic, or unit elastic.

The price elasticity of supply depends on certain factors such as the price of alternative inputs.
MKT-3.E.9
Elasticity can be measured for any determinant of demand or supply, not just the price.
MKT-3.E.10
Income elasticity of demand is measured by the percentage
change in the quantity demanded divided by the percentage
change in consumers’ income. Economists use the income
elasticity of demand to determine whether a good is normal or inferior.
MKT-3.E.11
Cross-price elasticity of demand is measured by the percentage
change in the quantity demanded of one good divided by the
percentage change in the price of another good. Economists
use the cross-price elasticity of demand to determine whether
goods are substitutes, complements, or not related.

b. Explain (using graphs as appropriate) how equilibrium price, quantity, consumer surplus, and producer surplus for a good or service are determined.
c. Calculate (using data from a graph or table as appropriate) areas of consumer surplus and producer surplus at equilibrium.
MKT-4.A.1
The supply-demand model is a tool for understanding what
factors influence prices and quantities and why prices and
quantities might differ across markets or change over time.
MKT-4.A.2
In a perfectly competitive market, equilibrium is achieved
(and markets clear with no shortages or surpluses) when the
price of a good or service brings quantity supplied and quantity
demanded into balance, in the sense that buyers wish to
purchase the same quantity that sellers wish to provide.
MKT-4.A.3
Equilibrium price provides information to economic decision makers to guide resource allocation.
MKT-4.A.4
Economists use consumer surplus and producer surplus to
measure the benefits markets create to buyers and sellers and understand market efficiency.
MKT-4.A.5
Market equilibrium maximizes total economic surplus in the
absence of market failures, meaning that perfectly competitive markets are efficient.
MKT-4.B a. Define a surplus and shortage.
b. Explain (using graphs where appropriate) how changes in underlying conditions and shocks to a competitive market can alter price, quantity, consumer surplus, and producer surplus.
c. Calculate (using data from a graph or table as appropriate) changes in price, quantity, consumer surplus, and producer surplus in response to changes in market conditions or market disequilibrium.
MKT-4.B.1
Whenever markets experience imbalances—creating
disequilibrium prices and quantities, surpluses, and
shortages—market forces drive price and quantity toward equilibrium.
MKT-4.B.2
Factors that shift the market demand and market supply curves
cause price, quantity, consumer surplus, producer surplus,
and total economic surplus (within that market) to change.
The impact of the change depends on the price elasticities of demand and supply.

Rational economic decisions require evaluation of costs and benefits.
CBA-1.A a.	 Define opportunity cost.
b. Explain the opportunity costs associated with choices.
c. Calculate the opportunity costs associated with choices.
CBA-1.A.1
Rational agents consider opportunity costs, whether implicit
or explicit, when calculating the total economic costs of any decision.
CBA-1.A.2
Total benefits form the metric “utility” for consumers and total revenue for firms.
CBA-1.B a. Explain a decision by comparing total benefits and total costs (using a table or a graph when appropriate).
b. Calculate total benefits and total costs (using a table or graph when appropriate).
CBA-1.B.1
Total net benefits, the difference between total benefits and total costs, are maximized at the optimal choice.
CBA-1.B.2
Some decisions permit rational agents to look at only marginal
benefit and marginal cost. Other decisions cannot be broken
down into increments in this way and must be evaluated by looking at total benefits and total costs.
CBA-2
To determine the optimal level at which to pursue an activity whose total benefits exceed total cost, rational economic agents compare marginal benefits and marginal costs.
CBA-2.A a. Define the key assumptions of consumer choice theory.
b. Explain (using a table or graph as appropriate) how a rational consumer’s decision making involves the use of marginal benefits and marginal costs.
c. Calculate (using a table or a graph when appropriate) how a rational consumer’s decision making involves the use of marginal benefits and marginal costs.
CBA-2.A.1
Consumers face constraints and have to make optimal decisions accounting for these constraints.
CBA-2.A.2
In a model of rational consumer choice, consumers are
assumed to make choices so as to maximize their total utility.
CBA-2.A.3
Consumers experience diminishing marginal utility in the consumption of goods and services.
CBA-2.A.4
Consumers allocate their limited income to purchase the
combination of goods that maximizes their utility by
equating/comparing the marginal utility of the last dollar spent on each good.
X  Exclusion:
Indifference curves are beyond the scope of the course and

CBA-2.B a. Define marginal analysis and related terms.
b. Explain a decision using marginal analysis (using a table or a graph when appropriate).
CBA-2.B.1
Marginal analysis involves comparing the additional benefit of
increasing a given activity with the additional cost. Comparing
marginal benefit (MB) with marginal cost (MC) helps individuals
(firms) decide whether to increase, decrease, or maintain their consumption (production) levels.
CBA-2.B.2
The optimal quantity at any point in time does not depend on
fixed costs (sunk costs) or fixed benefits that have already been determined by past choices.

b. Explain how firms respond to profit opportunities.
c. Calculate a firm’s profit or loss.
CBA-2.C.1
Firms respond to economic profit (loss) rather than accounting profit..
CBA-2.C.2
Accounting profit fails to account for implicit costs (such as cost
of financial capital, compensation for risk, or an entrepreneur’s
time) which if fully compensated result in normal profit.

Firms’ production and cost constraints over different input and output levels shape optimal decisions in the short run and long run.
PRD-1.A a. Define (using graphs where appropriate) key terms and concepts relating to production and cost.
b. Explain (using graphs where appropriate) how production and cost are related in the short run and long run.
c. Calculate (using data from a graph or table as appropriate) the various measures of productivity and short-run and long-run costs.
PRD-1.A.1
The production function explains the relationship between
inputs and outputs both in the short run and the long run.
PRD-1.A.2
Marginal product and average product change as input usage changes, and hence, total product changes.
PRD-1.A.3
Diminishing marginal returns occur as the firm employs more of
one input, holding other inputs constant, to produce a product (output) in the short run.
PRD-1.A.4
Fixed costs and variable costs determine the total cost.
PRD-1.A.5
Marginal cost, average (fixed, variable, and total) cost, total cost,
and total variable cost change as total output changes, but total
fixed cost remains constant at all output levels, including zero output.
PRD-1.A.6
Production functions with diminishing marginal returns yield an upward-sloping marginal cost curve.
PRD-1.A.7
Specialization and the division of labor reduce marginal costs for firms.
PRD-1.A.8
Cost curves can shift in response to changes in input costs and productivity.
PRD-1.A.9
In the long run, firms can adjust all their inputs, and as a result, all costs become variable.
PRD-1.A.10
The relationship between inputs and outputs in the long run is
described by the scale of production—increasing, decreasing, or constant returns to scale.
PRD-1.A.11
The long-run average total cost is characterized by economies
of scale, diseconomies of scale, or constant returns to scale (efficient scale).
PRD-1.A.12
The minimum efficient scale plays a role in determining the
concentration of firms in a market and the market structure.

Firms’ short-run decisions to produce output, and long-run decisions to enter or exit a market, are based on profitability.
PRD-2.A
Explain (using graphs or data where appropriate) firms’ short-run decisions to produce positive output levels, or long-run decisions to enter or exit a market in response to profit-making opportunities.
PRD-2.A.1
In the short run, firms decide to operate (i.e., produce positive
output) or shut down (i.e., produce zero output) by comparing total
revenue to total variable cost or price to average variable cost (AVC).
PRD-2.A.2
In the absence of barriers to entry or exit, in the long run (i.e., once
factors that are fixed in the short run become variable), firms
enter a market in which there are profit-making opportunities and
exit a market when they anticipate economic losses.
PRD-3
Even with a common goal of profit-maximization, market structure constrains and influences prices, output, and efficiency.
PRD-3.A a. Define (using graphs as appropriate) the characteristics of perfectly competitive markets and efficiency.
b. Explain (using graphs where appropriate) equilibrium and firm decision making in perfectly competitive markets and how prices in perfectly competitive markets lead to efficient outcomes.
c. Calculate (using data from a graph or table as appropriate) economic profit (loss) in perfectly competitive markets.
PRD-3.A.1
A perfectly competitive market is efficient. Firms in perfectly
competitive markets face no barriers to entry and have no market power.
PRD-3.A.2
In perfectly competitive markets, prices communicate to
consumers and producers the magnitude of others’ marginal
costs of production and marginal benefits of consumption and
provide incentives to act on that information (i.e., price equals marginal cost in an efficient market).
PRD-3.A.3
In perfectly competitive markets, firms can sell all their outputs at a constant price determined by the market.
PRD-3.A.4
At a competitive market equilibrium, firms are price takers and
select output to maximize profit by producing the level of output
where the marginal cost equals marginal revenue (at the price).
PRD-3.A.5
At a competitive market equilibrium, the price of a product
equals both the private marginal benefit received by the last unit
consumed and the private marginal cost incurred to produce the last unit, thus achieving allocative efficiency.
PRD-3.A.6
In a short-run competitive equilibrium, price can either be above
or below its long-run competitive level resulting in profits or
losses, motivating entry or exit of firms and moving prices and quantities toward long-run equilibrium.
PRD-3.A.7
In a long-run perfectly competitive equilibrium, productive
efficiency implies all operating firms produce at efficient scale,
price equals marginal cost and minimum average total cost, and firms earn zero economic profit.
PRD-3.A.8
Firms may be in a constant cost, increasing cost, or decreasing
cost industry. Long-run prices depend on the portion of the long-run cost curves on which firms operate.
PRD-3.A.9
A perfectly competitive market in long-run equilibrium is allocatively and productively efficient.

Explain (using graphs where appropriate) equilibrium, firm decision making, consumer surplus, producer surplus, profit (loss), and deadweight loss in imperfectly competitive markets and why prices in imperfectly competitive markets cannot be relied on to coordinate the actions of all possible market participants and can lead to inefficient outputs.
c. Calculate (using data from a graph or table as appropriate) areas of consumer surplus, producer surplus, profit (loss), and deadweight loss in imperfectly competitive markets.
PRD-3.B.1
Imperfectly competitive markets include monopoly, oligopoly,
and monopolistic competition in product markets and monopsony in factor markets.
PRD-3.B.2
In imperfectly competitive output markets and assuming all else
is constant, a firm must lower price to sell additional units.
PRD-3.B.3
In imperfectly competitive markets, consumers and producers
respond to prices that are above the marginal costs of
production and/or marginal benefits of consumption (i.e., price
is greater than marginal cost in an inefficient market).
PRD-3.B.4
Incentives to enter an industry may be mitigated by barriers to
entry. Barriers to entry—such as high fixed/start-up costs, legal
barriers to entry, and exclusive ownership of key resources—
can sustain imperfectly competitive market structures.
PRD-3.B.5
A monopoly exists because of barriers to entry.
PRD-3.B.6
In a monopoly, equilibrium (profit-maximizing) quantity is
determined by equating marginal revenue (MR) to marginal cost
(MC). The price charged is greater than the marginal cost.
PRD-3.B.7
In a natural monopoly, long-run economies of scale for a single
firm exist throughout the entire effective demand of its product.
PRD-3.B.8
A firm with market power can engage in price discrimination
to increase its profits or capture additional consumer surplus under certain conditions.
PRD-3.B.9
With perfect price discrimination, a monopolist produces the
quantity where price equals marginal cost (just as a competitive
market would) but extracts all economic surplus associated
with its product and eliminates all deadweight loss.
PRD-3.B.10
In a market with monopolistic competition, firms producing
differentiated products may earn positive, negative, or zero
economic profit in the short run. Firms typically use advertising
as a means of differentiating their product. Free entry and exit
drive profits to zero in the long run. The output level, however,
is smaller than the output level needed to minimize average
total costs, creating excess capacity. The price is greater than marginal cost, creating allocative inefficiency.

PRD-3
Even with a common goal of profit-maximization, market structure constrains and influences prices, output, and efficiency.
PRD-3.C a. Define (using tables as appropriate) key terms, strategies, and concepts relating to oligopolies and simple games.
b. Explain (using tables as appropriate) strategies and equilibria in simple games and the connections to theoretical behaviors in various oligopoly market and non-market settings.
c. Calculate (using tables as appropriate) the incentive sufficient to alter a player’s dominant strategy.
PRD-3.C.1
An oligopoly is an inefficient market structure with high barriers
to entry, where there are few firms acting interdependently.
PRD-3.C.2
Firms in an oligopoly have an incentive to collude and form cartels.
PRD-3.C.3
A game is a situation in which a number of individuals take
actions, and the payoff for each individual depends directly on
both the individual’s own choice and the choices of others.
PRD-3.C.4
A strategy is a complete plan of actions for playing a game;
the normal form model of a game shows the payoffs that result
from each collection of strategies (one for each player).
PRD-3.C.5
A player has a dominant strategy when the payoff to a particular
action is always higher independent of the action taken by the
other player. Dominant strategies can be eliminated from each
player’s action set and can sometimes lead to an equilibrium outcome (see Nash equilibrium below).
PRD-3.C.6
A Nash equilibrium is a condition describing the set of actions
in which no player can increase his or her payoff by unilaterally
taking another action, given the other players’ actions.
X  Exclusions:
Dominant strategies and Nash equilibrium with more than
two players or more than two actions per player, mixed-strategy
equilibria, extensive form games, and normal form games with
more than two players or more than two actions per player are beyond the scope of the course and the AP Exam.
PRD-3.C.7
Oligopolists have difficulty achieving the monopoly outcome
for reasons similar to those that prevent players from achieving
a cooperative outcome in the Prisoner’s Dilemma; nevertheless,
prices are generally higher and quantities lower with oligopoly (or duopoly) than with perfect competition.

Factor prices provide incentives and convey information to firms and factors of production.
PRD-4.A a. Define (using graphs where appropriate) key terms and concepts relating to factor markets.
b. Explain (using graphs where appropriate) the relationship between factors of production, firms, and factor prices.
c. Calculate (using data from a graph or table where appropriate) the marginal revenue product and marginal resource cost.
PRD-4.A.1
Factors of production (labor, capital, and land) respond to
factor prices (wages, interest, and rent), and employers’ (firms’)
decision to hire is based on the productivity of the factors, output price, and cost of the factor.
PRD-4.A.2
The quantity of labor demanded is negatively related to
the wage rate, while the quantity of labor supplied is positively
related to the wage rate in a given labor market, other things constant.
PRD-4.B
Explain (using graphs where appropriate) firms’ and factors’ responses to changes in incentives and constraints.
PRD-4.B.1
Changes in the determinants of labor demand, such as the
output price and the productivity of the worker, cause the labor demand curve to shift.
PRD-4.B.2
Changes in the determinants of labor supply (such as
immigration, education, working conditions, age distribution,
availability of alternative options, preferences for leisure, and
cultural expectations) cause the labor supply curve to shift.
PRD-4.C a. Define (using graphs as appropriate) the characteristics of perfectly competitive factor markets.
b. Explain (using graphs where appropriate) the profit-maximizing behavior of firms buying labor (with other inputs fixed) in perfectly competitive markets.
c. Calculate (using data from a graph or table where appropriate) measures representing the profit-maximizing behavior of firms buying labor (with other inputs fixed) in perfectly competitive markets.
PRD-4.C.1
In a perfectly competitive labor market, the wage is set
by the market and each firm hires the quantity of workers,
where the marginal factor (resource) cost (wage) equals the
marginal revenue product of labor. A typical firm may be a
perfect competitor in the labor market even if it is an imperfect competitor in its output markets.
PRD-4.C.2
A typical firm hires labor in a perfectly competitive labor market
as long as the marginal revenue product of labor is greater than the market wage.
PRD-4.C.3
To minimize costs or maximize profits, firms allocate inputs
such that the last dollar spent on each input yields the same amount of marginal product.
PRD-4.C.4
Marginal revenue product of a factor of production is the
change in total revenue divided by the change in that factor
of production, which is also equal to the marginal physical
product of that factor multiplied by the marginal revenue
(MRP = MP × MR). Firms in a perfectly competitive output market
will have marginal revenue product of labor that is equal to the
value of the marginal product of labor (VMPL = MPL × P ) because
marginal revenue for each unit of output is equal to price.

c. Calculate (using data from a graph or table where appropriate) measures representing the profit-maximizing behavior of firms buying labor (with other inputs fixed) in monopsonistic markets.
PRD-4.D.1
In a monopsonistic labor market, a typical firm hires additional
labor as long as the marginal revenue product is greater than
the marginal factor (resource) cost (the wage of a new unit of
labor plus the wage increase given to all existing labor).
PRD-4.D.2
When a typical firm hires additional workers in a monopsonistic
labor market, the marginal factor (resource) cost is greater than the supply price of labor.

b. Explain (using graphs where appropriate) how government policies alter consumer and producer behaviors that influence incentives and therefore affect outcomes.
c. Calculate (using data from a graph or table where appropriate) changes in market outcomes resulting from government policies.
POL-1.A.1
Some government policies, such as price floors, price ceilings,
and other forms of price and quantity regulation, affect incentives and outcomes in all market structures.
POL-1.A.2
Governments use taxes and subsidies to change incentives in
ways that influence consumer and producer behavior, shifting the supply and demand curves accordingly.
POL-1.A.3
Taxes and subsidies affect government revenues or costs.
POL-1.A.4
Government intervention in a market producing the efficient
quantity through taxes, subsidies, price controls, or quantity controls can only decrease allocative efficiency.
POL-1.A.5
Deadweight loss represents the losses to buyers and sellers as
a result of government intervention in an efficient market.
POL-1.A.6
The incidence of taxes and subsidies imposed on goods traded
in perfectly competitive markets depends on the elasticity of supply and demand.
POL-1.B a. Define tariffs and quotas.
b. Explain (using graphs where appropriate) how markets are affected by public policy related to international trade.
c. Calculate (using data from a graph or table as appropriate) changes in market outcomes resulting from public policy related to international trade.
POL-1.B.1
Equilibria in competitive markets may be altered by the decision
to open an economy to trade with other countries; equilibrium
price can be higher or lower than under autarky, and the gap
between domestic supply and demand is filled by trade. Opening
an economy to trade with other countries affects consumer
surplus, producer surplus, and total economic surplus.
POL-1.B.2
Tariffs, which governments sometimes use to influence
international trade, affect domestic price, quantity, government
revenue, and consumer surplus and total economic surplus.
POL-1.B.3
Quotas can be used to alter quantities produced and therefore
affect price, consumer surplus, and total economic surplus.
X  Exclusion:
The graphing of quotas is beyond the scope of the course

Perfectly competitive markets allocate resources efficiently, but imperfect competition often results in market inefficiencies.
POL-2.A a. Define social efficiency.
b. Explain (using graphs where appropriate) why resource allocation in perfectly competitive markets is socially efficient.
POL-2.A.1
The optimal quantity of a good occurs where the marginal
benefit of consuming the last unit equals the marginal
cost of producing that last unit, thus maximizing total economic surplus.
POL-2.A.2
The market equilibrium quantity is equal to the socially optimal
quantity only when all social benefits and costs are internalized
by individuals in the market. Total economic surplus is
maximized at that quantity. [See also PRD-3 and POL-3.]
POL-2.B
Explain (using graphs where appropriate) how private incentives can lead to actions by rational agents that are socially undesirable (inefficient) market outcomes.
POL-2.B.1
Rational agents can pursue private actions to exploit or exercise market characteristics known as market power.
POL-2.B.2
Rational agents make optimal decisions by equating private
marginal benefits and private marginal costs that can result in market inefficiencies.
POL-2.B.3
Policymakers use cost-benefit analysis to evaluate different
actions to reduce or eliminate market inefficiencies.
POL-2.B.4
Market inefficiencies can be eliminated by designing policies
that equate marginal social benefit with marginal social cost.
POL-2.C a. Explain equilibrium allocations in imperfect markets relative to efficient allocations (using graphs where appropriate), and why these markets are inefficient.
b. Calculate (using graphs where appropriate) the deadweight loss resulting from the production of a non-efficient quantity.
POL-2.C.1
Equilibrium allocations can deviate from efficient allocations
due to situations such as monopoly; oligopoly; monopolistic
competition; negative and positive externalities in production
or consumption; asymmetric information; and insufficient production of public goods.
POL-2.C.2
Producing any non-efficient quantity results in deadweight loss.

Private incentives can fail to account for all socially relevant considerations.
POL-3.A a. Define externalities.
b. Explain (using graphs where appropriate) how in the presence of externalities, private markets do not take into consideration social costs or social benefits.
POL-3.A.1
The socially optimal quantity of a good occurs where the
marginal social benefit of consuming the last unit equals the
marginal social cost of producing that last unit, thus maximizing total economic surplus.
POL-3.A.2
Externalities are either positive or negative and arise from lack
of well-defined property rights and/or high transaction costs.
POL-3.A.3
In the presence of externalities, rational agents respond to private
costs and benefits and not to external costs and benefits.
POL-3.A.4
Rational agents have the incentive to free ride when a good is non-excludable.
POL-3.B
Explain (using graphs where appropriate) how public policies address positive or negative externalities.
POL-3.B.1
Policies that address positive or negative externalities include
taxes/subsidies, environmental regulation, public provision,
the assignment of property rights, and the reassignment of property rights through private transactions.
POL-3.C a. Define whether goods are rival and/or excludable.
b. Explain how the nature of rival and/or excludable goods influences the behavior of individuals and groups.
POL-3.C.1
Private goods are rival and excludable, and public goods are non-rival and non-excludable.
POL-3.C.2
Due to the free rider problem, private individuals usually lack the
incentive to produce public goods, leaving government as the only producer.
POL-3.C.3
Governments sometimes choose to produce private goods,
such as educational services, and to allow free access to them.
POL-3.C.4
Some natural resources are, by their nature, non-excludable and
rival and therefore open access. Private individuals inefficiently overconsume such resources.

AP Microeconomics Graphing and Visuals
Students are expected to model economic situations using graphs or visual representations throughout the
AP Microeconomics course. The pages that follow identify the graphs and visuals that are required on the AP
Microeconomics Exam along with the associated learning objectives. One illustrative example of the set-up of
each graph or visual is provided for reference; however, it is only one example and students are expected to do
more than simply set up a graph or visual on the AP Microeconomics Exam. As the AP Economics Skills outline,
students must be able to demonstrate their understanding of specific economic situations on accurately labeled
graphs (e.g., via properly labeled and placed points, curves, and shaded areas) and demonstrate the effect of
changes on accurately labeled graphs or visuals (e.g., via properly labeled shifts in curves, new quantities and/
or prices, arrows indicating the direction of change, and shaded areas). Students must also be able to interpret
and manipulate provided graphs and visuals representing different economic situations. To access past AP Exam
questions and formative practice questions that use graphs or visual representations, teachers can visit the AP
Question Bank on AP Classroom and filter questions by stimulus, skill, topic, and other criteria.
Draw and Analyze Provided Graphs and Visuals
Students should be able to answer questions about a provided graph or visual of each of the following models in
