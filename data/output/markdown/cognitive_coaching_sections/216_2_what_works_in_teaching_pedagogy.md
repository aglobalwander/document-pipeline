## 2. What Works in Teaching? (Pedagogy)

The queen on a chessboard is a useful metaphor for the knowledge domain of pedagogy. The queen is the piece with the greatest flexibility and range of movement. So, too, an experienced, effective teacher flexibly draws on a variety of moves during classroom work. This is the knowledge area of pedagogy.

Saphier et al. (2008), for example, identify 53 ways that a teacher can gain students' attention and keep them on task. Although an individual teacher might not know all 53 of these moves, experienced teachers draw from a large personal repertoire to select the best match for each situation. Teachers also manage momentum, space, time, routines, and discipline. They apply principles of learning, hold high expectations, and design and guide learning experiences that enable students to reach objectives (Marzano, Pickering, and Pollock 2001).

Teacher clarity about pedagogy correlates highly with student learning. Clarity is required when teachers make learning objectives explicit, present

new material, explain concepts, give directions, elaborate on directions, activate prior knowledge, re-explain old material, address confusion, and make instructional connections. Again, expert teachers develop a repertoire in this area and make best-fit matches for individual students and situations. Following are some pedagogical guidelines:

- Consistently drawing on an extensive repertoire of appropriate strategies and resources, and adapting and refining strategies while teaching in response to students' needs
- Using questions to revise activities and extend students' abilities to synthesize what they know to achieve learning goals
- Facilitating challenging learning experiences that promote collaboration, independent learning, thinking dispositions, and choice for all students
- Using a variety of formative, ongoing self-assessments that are embedded in instruction to guide short- and long-term plans and to support learning for all students
