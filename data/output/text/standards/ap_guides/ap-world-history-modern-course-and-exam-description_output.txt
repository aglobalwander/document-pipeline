About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking
AP courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and
AP Exams are developed and scored by college faculty
and experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges
and universities in the United States grant credit,
advanced placement, or both on the basis of successful
AP Exam scores; more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the content
and skills that are the focus of the corresponding
college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also
organizes the content and skills into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many AP teachers have
told us they follow in order to focus their instruction.
The intention of this publication is to respect teachers’
time and expertise by providing a roadmap that they
can modify and adapt to their local priorities and
preferences. Moreover, by organizing the AP course
content and skills into units, the AP Program is able to provide teachers and students with formative assessments—Personal Progress Checks—that
teachers can assign throughout the year to measure
student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students:
Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically
challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to equitable preparation and
access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses:
The AP Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP
courses must participate in the AP Course Audit, a
process through which AP teachers’ course materials
are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.

AP World History: Modern Course and Exam Description

=== Page 9 ===
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the AP teacher and the school principal (or designated
administrator) to confirm awareness and understanding
of the curricular and resource requirements. A syllabus
or course outline, detailing how course requirements
are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The
AP Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor;
all AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision,
piloting, and analysis to ensure that questions are
accurate, fair, and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development,
College Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher
education institutions. This feedback is carefully
considered to ensure that AP courses and exams are
able to provide students with a college-level learning
experience and the opportunity to demonstrate their
qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam
development process, relies on the expertise of both
AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice
questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course performance
assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands
of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are
scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion
is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained,
and their work is monitored throughout the Reading
for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief
Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers
in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of
the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a curve.
Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which means that
every student who meets the criteria for an AP score of
2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no matter how many
students that is. The criteria for the number of points
students must earn on the AP Exam to receive scores
of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently
validates for credit and placement purposes—include:
§§ The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
§§ The number of points researchers have found to be predictive that an AP student will succeed when placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
§§ Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP scores as follows:
AP Score
Credit
Recommendation
College Grade
Equivalent 5
Extremely well qualified
A 4
Well qualified
A-, B+, B 3
Qualified
B-, C+, C 2
Possibly qualified n/a 1
No recommendation n/a

=== Page 10 ===
While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and
universities. To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/ placement policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/creditpolicies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score the free-response sections of the AP Exams.
Ninety-eight percent of surveyed educators who took
part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an
AP Reader, including opportunities to:
§§ Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
§§ Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure to the quality and depth of the responses from the entire pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
§§ Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
§§ Score from home: AP Readers have online distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects. Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
§§ Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs):
AP Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.
How to Apply

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide suggests
a sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds skill instruction across units, and organizes content into topics.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course topics and skills, create
customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.
*To report misuses, please call, 877-274-6474 (International: +1-212-632-1781).

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
§§ Teachers and students sign in to, or create, their College Board accounts.
§§ Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
§§ Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
§§ Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP Coordinator.
§§ Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and
AP Coordinators to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following
additional benefits:
§§ Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
§§ Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
§§ Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student pack.
The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
§§ Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

Instructional
Model
Integrating AP resources throughout the course can help students develop skills and
conceptual understandings. The instructional model outlined below shows possible ways to incorporate AP resources into the classroom.
Plan
Teachers may consider the following approaches as they plan their instruction before teaching each unit.
§§ Use the Unit at a Glance table to identify related topics that build toward a common
understanding, and then plan appropriate pacing for students.
§§ Identify useful strategies in the Instructional Approaches section to help teach the concepts and skills.
Teach
When teaching, supporting resources can be used to build students’ conceptual understanding and their mastery of skills.
§§ Use the topic pages in the unit guides to identify the required content.
§§ Integrate the content with a skill, considering any appropriate scaffolding.
§§ Employ any of the instructional strategies previously identified.
§§ Use the available resources on the topic pages to bring a variety of assets into the classroom.
Assess
Teachers can measure student understanding of the content and skills covered in the unit and provide actionable feedback to students.
§§ At the end of each unit, use AP Classroom to assign students the online Personal Progress
Checks, as homework or as an in-class task.
§§ Provide question-level feedback to students through answer rationales; provide unit- and
skill-level feedback using the progress dashboard.
§§ Create additional practice opportunities using the AP Question Bank and assign them through AP Classroom.

About the AP
World History:
Modern Course
In AP World History: Modern, students investigate significant events, individuals,
developments, and processes from 1200 to the present. Students develop and use
the same skills, practices, and methods employed by historians: analyzing primary and
secondary sources; developing historical arguments; making historical connections; and
utilizing reasoning about comparison, causation, and continuity and change over time. The
course provides six themes that students explore throughout the course in order to make
connections among historical developments in different times and places: humans and the
environment, cultural developments and interactions, governance, economic systems, social
interactions and organization, and technology and innovation.
College Course Equivalent
AP World History: Modern is designed to be the equivalent of an introductory college or university survey of modern world history.
Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites for AP World History: Modern. Students should be able to read a
college-level textbook and write grammatically correct, complete sentences.

Course Framework
Components
Overview
This course framework provides a description of  what students should know and be
able to do to qualify for college credit or placement.
The course framework includes two essential components:
1   HISTORICAL THINKING SKILLS AND
REASONING PROCESSES
The historical thinking skills and reasoning processes are central to the
study and practice of world history. Students should practice and develop
these skills and processes on a regular basis over the span of the course.
2   COURSE CONTENT
The course content is organized into commonly taught units of study
that provide a suggested sequence for the course. These units comprise
the content and conceptual understandings that colleges and universities
typically expect students to master to qualify for college credit and/or
placement. This content is grounded in themes, which are cross-cutting
concepts that build conceptual understanding and spiral throughout the course.

Course
Content
Influenced by the Understanding by Design® (Wiggins and McTighe) model, this
course framework provides a description of the course requirements necessary for student success.
The course content is organized into commonly taught units. The units have been
arranged in a logical sequence frequently found in many college courses and textbooks.
The nine units in AP World History, and their approximate weighting on the
AP Exam, are listed on the following page.
Pacing recommendations at the unit level and on the Course at a Glance provide
suggestions for how to teach the required course content and administer the
Personal Progress Checks. The suggested class periods are based on a schedule
in which the class meets five days a week for 45 minutes each day. While these
recommendations have been made to aid planning, teachers should of course
adjust the pacing based on the needs of their students, alternate schedules
(e.g., block scheduling), or their school’s academic calendar.
TOPICS
Each unit is broken down into teachable segments called topics. The topic pages
(starting on page 38) contain all required content for each topic. Although most
topics can be taught in one or two class periods, teachers are again encouraged to
pace the course to suit the needs of their students and school.

Themes
The themes serve as the connective tissue of the course and enable students to
create meaningful connections across units. They are often broader ideas that
become threads that run throughout the course. Revisiting them and applying
them in a variety of contexts helps students to develop deeper conceptual
understanding. Below are the themes of the course and a brief description of each.
THEME 1: HUMANS AND THE ENVIRONMENT (ENV)
The environment shapes human societies, and as populations grow and
change, these populations in turn shape their environments.
THEME 2: CULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS AND INTERACTIONS (CDI)
The development of ideas, beliefs, and religions illustrates how groups in
society view themselves, and the interactions of societies and their beliefs
often have political, social, and cultural implications.
THEME 3: GOVERNANCE (GOV)
A variety of internal and external factors contribute to state formation,
expansion, and decline. Governments maintain order through a variety of
administrative institutions, policies, and procedures, and governments obtain,
retain, and exercise power in different ways and for different purposes.
THEME 4: ECONOMIC SYSTEMS (ECN)
As societies develop, they affect and are affected by the ways that they
produce, exchange, and consume goods and services.
THEME 5: SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND ORGANIZATION (SIO)
The process by which societies group their members and the norms that
govern the interactions between these groups and between individuals
influence political, economic, and cultural institutions and organization.
THEME 6: TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION (TEC)
Human adaptation and innovation have resulted in increased efficiency, comfort,
and security, and technological advances have shaped human development
and interactions with both intended and unintended consequences.

AP WORLD HISTORY
Unit
Guides
Introduction
The structure of the unit guides respects new AP teachers’ time by
providing one possible sequence they can adopt or modify rather than
having to build from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units
enable the AP Program to provide interested teachers with formative
assessments—the Personal Progress Checks—that they can assign their
students at the end of each unit to gauge progress toward success on the
AP Exam. However, experienced AP teachers who are satisfied with their
current course organization and exam results should feel no pressure to
adopt these units, which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

Using the Unit Guides
The Unit at a Glance table shows the topics, related thematic
focus, suggested skills, and reasoning processes for each topic.
The Class Periods column has been left blank so that teachers can customize the time they spend on each topic.
The suggested skill for each topic shows one way teachers
can link the content in that topic to a specific AP historical
thinking skill. The individual skill has been thoughtfully chosen
in a way that helps spiral those skills throughout the course. The
questions on the Personal Progress Checks are based on this
pairing. However, AP Exam questions may pair the content with any of the skills.
The Sample Instructional Activities page includes optional
activities that can help tie together the content and skill of a
particular topic. Additionally, this page offers space for teachers
to make notes on their approach to the individual topics and the unit as a whole.
The Global Tapestry
SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use these
activities and are free to alter or edit them. The examples below were developed in partnership
with teachers from the AP community to share ways that they approach teaching some of the
topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional Approaches section beginning on p. 171 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 1.2
Questioning a Text
Using a section of the textbook, have students brainstorm words or phrases that they
associate with the title, subheadings, pictures, graphics, and bold words in the section. Then
have them complete the following steps: Predict four questions about cause and effect that the
text might answer. Read the section and answer the questions. Cross out questions that cannot
be answered and replace with new ones. Skim the text again and answer the new questions.
2 1.3
Graphic Organizer
Assign an excerpt from a secondary source like Southeast Asia in World History by
Craig A. Lockard (available on World History Connected). Ask students to read the
document silently. Then have them complete the following steps: With a partner, choose
a graphic organizer that represents the structure of the author’s argument. Reread the
document and organize the information learned on the graphic organizer. Individually,
write a summary of the graphic organizer. Start with “According to the author . . . .” 3 1.4
Close Reading
Assign a short excerpt of Bernal Diaz del Castillo’s description of Tenochtitlan. As students
read, ask them to highlight evidence that supports the author’s claim that Tenochtitlan was a large, well-organized metropolis.
4 1.7
Think-Pair-Share and Debriefing
In pairs, assign students two of the regions addressed in this unit. Ask them to individually
complete a Venn diagram comparing how the governments of each region developed
and maintained power. Have students share their diagrams with their partner and work
together to write a claim about similarities in the process of state formation. Ask a few
students to volunteer to share their claims. Debrief by discussing the strengths and areas for improvement for each claim with the class.

Geographical Coverage
The AP World History: Modern course requires that students learn world history from a global
perspective. Balanced coverage of the regions within the course ensures that a single region
is not situated at the center of the historical narrative.
Students need basic geographical knowledge in order to understand world history.
Geospatial awareness is also essential for students to build an understanding of the
cross-cultural contacts, trade routes, migrations, etc., which are important concepts in the AP World History course.
The two maps that follow give students a starting point for identifying regions and their
locations relative to other regions and landforms. These maps are a reference point for teachers
and students alike. Because geographic naming conventions are not universal, these maps
define regions and show the locations and commonly used names of regions that students are likely to encounter on the AP World History Exam.
§§ Map 1. AP World History: World Regions—A Big Picture View identifies five major
geographical regions: Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania.
AP WORLD HISTORY: WORLD REGIONS—A BIG PICTURE VIEW
§§ Map 2. AP World History: World Regions—A Closer Look identifies various subregions within the five major geographical regions.

Place students into groups of five. Assign each student a technology from this topic and
provide them a reading about it. Present students with this scenario:
Imagine you are on the writing staff of Scientific American magazine. Your team is going
to write an article entitled “Five Technologies that Changed the World.” The steam engine,
railroad, internal combustion engine, steamship, and telegraph will be the featured
technologies; your job is to decide how to rank them. After reading about your assigned
technology, engage in a debate with your group about each technology’s relative
importance. As a group, rank them from most important to least and write a few paragraphs justifying your decision.

Governments used ideologies, including fascism and communism to mobilize all of their state’s resources for war and, in the case of totalitarian states, to repress basic freedoms and dominate many aspects of daily life during the course of the conflicts and beyond.
KC-6.1.III.C.ii
New military technology and new tactics, including the atomic bomb, fire-bombing, and the waging of “total war” led to increased levels of wartime casualties.

Selecting and Using
Course Materials
Using a wide array of historical source material helps
students become proficient with the practices and skills and develop a conceptual understanding of world
history. In addition to using a textbook that will provide
required course content, students should have regular
opportunities to examine primary source material in
different and varied forms as well as other types of
historical scholarship. Rich, diverse source material
provides more flexibility in designing learning activities
that develop the habits of historical thinking that are essential for student success in the course.
Textbooks
The AP World History: Modern course requires the use
of a college-level textbook that includes discussion of historical developments and processes from
c. 1200 into the 21st century in a way that encourages conceptual understanding.
While nearly all college-level world history textbooks address the six themes of the AP World History:
Modern course, they often do not do so in a balanced
fashion. As such, it is important to identify other types of secondary sources and supplement the textbook
accordingly to ensure that each of the six thematic
approaches receives adequate attention. Many college level world history textbooks organize content by
civilization or region within a specified periodization.
These periodization models vary across textbooks and
may be different than the AP World History: Modern course periodization. Teachers can use curricular
materials and strategies that ensure that students can
make connections across civilizations, regions, and time periods.
While College Board provides an example textbook list that teachers may consult to help
determine whether a text is considered appropriate in meeting the AP World History: Modern Course Audit curricular requirement, teachers select textbooks
locally. Additionally, the AP World History Teacher
Community on AP Central provides reviews of recently published texts to help teachers determine their appropriateness for the AP course.
Primary Sources
Students will find it useful to analyze primary source
material regularly to deepen their understanding of the learning objectives and develop the required
processes and skills. While publishers are increasingly
including primary source material within the textbook,
students should be introduced to a wide variety of
source material so that they can analyze evidence from
the past from diverse sources. These sources should
include written documents as well as images, such as
photographs, cartoons, and works of art. Teachers may
use the ancillary materials and website sources that
accompany most of the recently published textbooks
to find high-quality primary source documents, artwork,
charts, and other sources of data that are linked to
the topics and themes addressed in the textbook. If a
textbook does not provide ample primary sources, or
the sources are too brief, teachers can supplement the
course with primary source anthologies that provide
lengthier selections or online compilations of primary sources related to particular topic areas.
Secondary Sources
Student success in the course also depends on
exposure to and analysis of multiple secondary sources.
These include noncontemporary accounts of the
past written by historians or scholars of other related
disciplines, such as economists, sociologists, political
commentators, or art historians as well as data sets,
charts, and maps. Secondary sources of all types can
provide a broader and more substantive perspective
on topics addressed by the textbook. Additionally, secondary sources can be helpful in supplementing
textbooks with older publication dates. It is especially important that students practice analyzing and
comparing historians’ interpretations of events; they should have opportunities to compare a primary source with a secondary source or to compare the
views represented by two different secondary sources.
This need can often be met by source collections that
provide both primary and secondary source material
or through ancillary resource materials offered by
textbook publishers. When finding resources to use

with students, consider a variety of sources that vary in
complexity, building toward publications by practicing
historians, university presses, or scholarly journals.
A school library media specialist can help identify databases that contain a variety of useful source
material, both primary and secondary. Many schools already subscribe to databases such as ABC-CLIO,
JSTOR, EBSCO, or Gale that may augment the materials
found in texts or source collections. World History
Connected is an important e-journal that is dedicated
to teaching and learning in world history. Current as well
as all past issues are free and available online. Library
media specialists can assist in developing LibGuides
specific to individual courses that give students easy
access to source material teachers identify to be used at home or in the classroom.

Instructional Strategies
The AP World History: Modern course framework outlines the concepts and skills students should master to
be successful on the AP Exam. To address those concepts and skills effectively, it helps to incorporate a variety
of instructional approaches into daily lessons and activities. The following table presents strategies that can
help students master the historical thinking skills and reasoning process and apply their understanding of course concepts.
Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Close Reading
Students read, reread, and analyze small chunks of text word for word, sentence by sentence, and line by line.
Develops comprehensive understanding of a text.
When students are reading primary documents, have them highlight relevant words and passages that support the author’s claim.
Create
Representations
Students create tables, graphs, or other infographics to interpret text or data.
Helps students organize information using multiple ways to present data.
Give students a set of data, such as the migration rates by place of origin and destination, and have them create a graph that best shows the data and the trends.
Critique
Reasoning
Through collaborative discussion, students critique the arguments of others, questioning the author’s perspective, evidence presented, and reasoning behind the argument.
Helps students learn from others as they make connections between concepts and learn to support their arguments with evidence and reasoning that make sense to peers.
Have students critique
Simón Bolívar’s arguments for independence in his “Letter from Jamaica.” Have them examine Bolívar’s perspective and the evidence and reasoning he uses to support this position.
Debate
Students present an informal or formal argument that defends a claim with reasons, while others defend different claims about the same topic or issue. The goal is to debate ideas without attacking the people who defend those ideas.
Gives students an opportunity to collect and orally present evidence supporting the affirmative and negative arguments of a proposition or issue.
Have students debate whether the Mongol conquest stifled or stimulated economic growth in Asia, using evidence and reasoning to support their claims.
Debriefing
Students participate in a facilitated discussion that leads to consensus understanding or helps students identify the key conclusions or takeaways.
Helps students solidify and deepen understanding of content.
For complex issues, such as changes in social class structures, lead students in a debrief to ensure their understanding.

Discussion
Groups
Students engage in an interactive, small-group discussion, often with an assigned role (e.g., questioner, summarizer, facilitator, evidence keeper), to consider a topic, text, question.
Helps students gain new understanding of or insight into a text or issue by listening to multiple perspectives.
Use the learning objectives, such as Explain how and why globalization changed culture over time, with the view to help students gain new understanding by hearing the views of their classmates.
Fishbowl
Some students form an inner circle and model appropriate discussion techniques, while an outer circle of students listens, responds, and evaluates.
Provides students with an opportunity to engage in a formal discussion and to experience roles both as participant and active listener;
students also have the responsibility of supporting their opinions and responses using specific textual evidence.
Have students discuss the arguments presented in Latin
American revolutionary-era documents and how they responded to European actions and policies leading up to the Latin American revolutions.
Graphic
Organizer
Students use a visual representation for the organization of information.
Provides students a visual system for organizing multiple ideas, details, and/or textual support to be included in a piece of writing.
Ask students to use a graphic organizer to compare political, economic, religious, social, intellectual, and technological ideas. Make sure students use any organizer thoughtfully and do not simply “fill in the blanks.”
Guided
Discussion
A guided discussion is an umbrella strategy that allows for the use of different techniques as you guide students through the lesson.
Helps students see the big picture and builds their confidence when dealing with difficult content and/or new skills.
Use brainstorming and quickwrite as strategies during a guided discussion to help students understand the motivations and patterns of colonization in America by
European countries.
Jigsaw
Each student in a group actively reads a different text or different passage from a single text, taking on the role of “expert” on what was read.
Students share the information from that reading with students from other groups and then return to their original groups to share their new knowledge.
Helps students summarize and present information to others in a way that facilitates an understanding of a text (or multiple texts) or issue without having each student read the text in its entirety;
by teaching others, they become experts.
Use this strategy to facilitate understanding of the various methods and motivations for 19th-century imperialism by having students read and analyze primary and secondary sources related to topics like industrialization and the demand for raw materials, missionary work, and social Darwinism.
Look for a
Pattern
Students evaluate data or create visual representations to find a trend.
Helps students identify patterns that may be used to draw conclusions.
Using a complex graph (with at least two data sets), have students compare data related to the relationship between urbanization and capitalism to find a trend and draw a conclusion.

Making
Connections
Students are given a concept, term, event, or document and asked to write what they know about it. Then, students are paired and asked to determine, describe, and then explain the connection between the two concepts.
Reinforces the fact that historical concepts are often connected and provides the opportunity for students to make and explain connections between and among these concepts.
Write concepts related to one of the course themes on cards, place them into a box, and have students pick a concept at random. Give students a few minutes to gather and recall information about the term and then pair students and ask them to find the connection between their concepts.
Finally, ask the pairs to write a brief explanation of how the concepts are related.
Match Claims and Evidence
Students are given sample claims (most of which can be improved upon) to evaluate and revise.
Then students match their revised claims with pieces of evidence that can be used to support the claims.
Once matched, students write a statement explaining how and why the evidence supports the claim.
Provides opportunities for students to edit existing claims and match those claims with existing evidence in preparation for writing their own argumentative essays.
After studying the major trading networks in Unit 2, have students practice argumentation by asking small groups of students to write claims and supporting evidence statements in response to the following
learning objective: Explain the similarities and differences among the various networks of exchange in the period from c. 1200 to c. 1450.
Have groups trade claims and evidence and revise or modify the claims (if necessary), match the claims and evidence, and write statements explaining why the evidence supports the claim.
Questioning the Text
Students develop literal, interpretive, and universal questions about a text before and during reading it. Students should then respond to the questions during and after reading.
Allows students to engage more actively with texts, read with greater purpose and focus, and ultimately answer questions to gain greater insight into the text.
Assign students to read and analyze the writings of Ibn
Battuta and write down any clarification and discussion questions that come to mind while reading the text. Form groups around similar questions and ask students to research answers from a source, such as the textbook, working with peers to answer any remaining questions. Have groups present their findings and lead a discussion about how
Ibn Battuta’s point of view shaped his impressions of the places he visited.

Example
Quickwrite
Students write for a short, specific amount of time about a designated topic.
Helps students generate ideas in a short time.
As preparation for the free response questions, use a learning objective, such as Explain the similarities and differences among the various networks of exchange in the period from c. 1200 to c. 1450, to do a quickwrite where students write a claim and explain evidence that supports their claim for the assigned learning objective.
Self/Peer
Revision
Students work alone or with a partner to examine a piece of writing for accuracy and clarity.
Provides students with an opportunity for editing a written text to ensure correctness of identified components.
Have students perform self- and peer revisions of their practice document-based and long essay questions so that they have the opportunity to review and revise their practice claims, supporting evidence, sourcing, and analysis and reasoning.
Shared Inquiry
Students actively read a provocative text, asking interpretive questions (questions for which there are no predetermined right answers) before and during reading. After reading the text, students engage with their peers to make meaning from the text, offer different answers to the questions, and debate one another, supporting their positions with specific evidence from the text.
Allows a teacher to lead a deep discussion about a text and encourage diverse ideas to emerge as students think deeply and share interpretations.
Provide a selection of primary sources from individuals involved in African and Asian independence movements.
In groups, ask students to formulate responses to this
learning objective: Compare the processes by which various peoples pursued independence after 1900, and present their ideas to the class. Then lead a whole-group discussion comparing these movements to the earlier movements in the Americas.

Socratic Seminar
Students engage in a focused discussion tied to a topic, essential question, or selected text in which they ask questions of one another.
The questions initiate a conversation that continues with a series of responses and additional questions.
Helps students arrive at a new understanding by asking questions that clarify;
challenging assumptions;
probing perspective and point of view; questioning facts, reasons, and evidence;
or examining implications and outcomes.
Have students read an extended excerpt from
Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s
The Social Contract. Place students in groups of six to eight and have them discuss the following questions:
§§ According to Rousseau, what is the social contract?
§§ What role should government play in the lives of people?
§§ What is the general will?
§§ How should individuals participate in government?
§§ Why were Rousseau’s ideas revolutionary?
Think-Pair-Share
Students think through a question or issue alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with the class.
Enables the development of initial ideas that are then tested with a partner in preparation for revising ideas and sharing them with a larger group.
To prepare for a long essay about the causes of military conflict in the 20th century, use think-pair-share as a prewriting activity in response to the following learning
objective: Explain the relative significance of the causes of global conflict in the period 1900 to the present.

Developing Historical
Thinking Skills
Throughout the AP World History: Modern course, students will develop skills that are fundamental
to the discipline of history. Since these historical
thinking skills represent the complex skills that adept
historians demonstrate, students will benefit from
multiple opportunities to develop these skills in a scaffolded manner.
The historical thinking skills and reasoning processes
used in the course framework equip students to begin
to understand and create historical knowledge in a
process similar to that followed by historians. This
process begins with a close analysis of historical sources and reaches its conclusion when evidence,
drawn from historical sources, is used effectively to support an argument about the past.
The tables on the pages that follow look at each of the
skills and provide examples of tasks or questions for
each skill, along with instructional notes and strategies for implementing that skill into the course.

Historical Thinking Skill 1: Identify and explain historical developments and processes
Historical knowledge is gained from a variety of formats: knowledge transfer from
the teacher, reading textbooks, analyzing primary and secondary sources, and from
other media. In order to perform historical analysis and argumentation, students
should establish a depth of knowledge about historical events, processes, and
people and their actions. This skill allows students to gain that empirical knowledge
that they can then apply using more sophisticated skills.

Historical Thinking Skill 2: Analyze sourcing and situation of primary and secondary sources
Historians use primary sources and the arguments of other historians (secondary
sources) as the foundation for creating an understanding about historical events—
in short, a historical argument. Sources need to be closely evaluated so that they
can be used properly to support, refute, or even modify an argument. By using these
skills, students will build an understanding of source analysis that they can later
use in developing their own historical arguments. Good analysis requires a critical evaluation of the source’s limitations.
Skill
Tasks/Questions
Sample Activity

Historical Thinking Skill 3: Analyze arguments in primary and secondary sources
Because historians rely on primary and secondary sources to serve as evidence
to support their claims, they need to closely analyze these sources. This analysis
includes investigating what the source does and does not communicate, determining
the argument established by a source, and identifying the evidence the author uses to support that argument.
Skill
Tasks/Questions
Sample Activity
Instructional
Strategies
3.A: Identify and describe a claim and/or argument in a text-based or non text-based source.
§§ What is the author trying to prove in the source?
Ask students to identify Adam
Smith’s argument in an excerpt from the Wealth of Nations.
§§ Close Reading
3.B: Identify the evidence used in a source to support an argument.

Historical Thinking Skill 4: Analyze the context of historical events, developments, or processes
Historical events, developments, and processes do not happen in a vacuum.
They cannot be understood without proper examination within the relevant context.
While students are often taught to focus on comparison, causality, and patterns of
continuity and change over time as ways to look at these events, historical context
also plays a part. Analyzing historical events using context helps students see the big
picture and make the connections they will need to make when developing thoughtful
arguments. These skills guide students through the process of contextual analysis.

Strategies
4.A: Identify and describe a historical context for a specific historical development or process.
§§ What events led up to the one we are studying?
§§ What else is happening in the world at this time?

Historical Thinking Skill 5: Using historical reasoning processes (comparison, causation, continuity and change), analyze patterns and connections between and among historical developments and processes
Analyzing patterns and making connections is the bridge between all of the
previous historical thinking skills. This skill pulls everything together and allows
students to connect all concepts. Whether they are using sources or their own
historical knowledge, students will use the historical reasoning processes to identify
and explain patterns and connections between historical events and developments.

§§ Where does the development or process fit into a pattern of continuity or change over time?
§§ What are the similarities and differences between this development or process and another?
§§ What does the data in a non text based source show?
§§ What trends and patterns can you identify from data?

Using excerpts from Kwame
Nkrumah’s 1953 speech to the House of Commons, have students quickwrite a series of explanations that connect Nkrumah’s opinion on independence to other historical developments and processes using historical reasoning.
For example, connect the source to the rise of nationalism after
World War II using causation, connect the source to Indian independence using comparison, and connect the source to the
Enlightenment using patterns of continuity and change over time.

Historical Thinking Skill 6: Develop an argument
Writing claims is often the first argumentation skill that students practice, but claims
are difficult to develop without prompting. Giving students prompts to work with can
help them as they learn this skill. The prompt should establish parameters that require
students to take a position, either by choosing one of two presented alternatives or
by assessing the extent to which a given proposition or scenario is valid.
In order to develop a historically defensible claim, students need to know what
evidence is available to support that claim. They can practice writing claims using
just their knowledge as evidence, as they will in the long essay question. They
should also write claims using documents, to practice both evidence and sourcing (a
few at first, then build quantity as students gain skills and confidence), as they will in the document-based question.
The reasoning processes, discussed in more depth starting on page 190, will
help students develop historical reasoning needed to appropriately connect their evidence to their claims.
There is no simple path to teaching students to develop complex arguments.
The tasks/questions and the sample activities in the table below can serve as a
roadmap. However, students will also need a mastery of the course content, source
analysis, a highly developed understanding of historical context, and the ability to
make connections between and among events to demonstrate this skill. In short,
it is the culminating skill for an AP World History: Modern student.
Skill
Tasks/Questions
Sample Activity
Instructional
Strategies
6.A: Make a historically defensible claim.
§§ What do you know about the development or processes established the prompt?
§§ What are your options regarding positions to take?
§§ What historical reasoning process is indicated (or best fits the structure of the essay you plan to write)?
§§ Based on the prompt and the evidence (either provided or from your own knowledge), which position will you take?
§§ State in a few words how you will prove your claim.
Provide students with a practice writing prompt, such as Develop an argument that evaluates how industrialization affected Asia after 1830.
Have students break down the question into potential positions (industrialization fostered economic growth or industrialization led to imperial domination, or both).
Have them identify a historical reasoning process that best fits the essay that they would go on to develop (such as comparison or causation).
Ask them to think of evidence that would support all of the identified positions; then, ask them to write a defensible claim that establishes a line of reasoning by stating their chosen position and provides a roadmap for how they are going to prove their claim.

§§ Describe specific examples of historically relevant evidence.
§§ Explain how specific examples of historically relevant evidence support an argument.
§§ Brainstorm relevant evidence that relates to the development or process established in the prompt.
§§ Hone your initial list of evidence by describing specific examples that support the argument.
§§ If practicing a document based question, evaluate the evidence provided.
§§ Determine whether the evidence supports, refutes, or modifies each of the possible positions.
Provide students with three to four documents* that could be used to support the positions outlined in a sample prompt, such as Evaluate the extent to which European industrialization produced a radical change in the lives of Africans. Ask students to evaluate the evidence using a Venn diagram. They should group the evidence into
three categories: evidence that supports the idea that industrialization produced a radical change, evidence that the change was not as radical, and evidence that could be used to support both positions. For each piece of evidence, have students write a statement explaining how the evidence supports the position(s).
*Teachers can use this same activity for long essay question practice by asking students to brainstorm relevant evidence instead of providing documents.
§§ Graphic Organizer
6.C: Use historical reasoning to explain relationships among pieces of historical evidence.
§§ Which reasoning process(es) is indicated in the prompt (comparison, causation, continuity and change)?
§§ If comparison is indicated, establish relevant categories in which to compare the evidence.
§§ If causation is indicated, how does the evidence show a pattern of causes and/or effects?
§§ If continuity and change is indicated, identify patterns or developments that indicate change and/or continuity and draw conclusions in support of your claim.
When practicing for the long essay, have students identify the historical reasoning process indicated in the prompt. Then have them develop and use a graphic organizer (such as a
Venn diagram or flow chart) to arrange the evidence in a way that reflects the organizational structure of the historical reasoning process.

Developing the
Reasoning Processes
Reasoning processes describe the cognitive
operations that students will be required to apply
when engaging with the historical thinking skills on the AP Exam. The reasoning processes ultimately represent ways in which historians think.
Student responses on the AP Exam should reflect their
ability to apply a reasoning process that aligns to the
intent of the question. For example, if students are asked
to explain how and why the Silk Road and trans-Saharan
trade networks impacted society in the period 1200–
1450, successful student responses will be organized
around the reasoning process of comparison. In many cases, guiding students toward a better alignment
between the reasoning process and the task unlocks
their understanding and helps them improve their writing.
The following table provides suggestions for
approaching the reasoning processes in the AP World

ferocity in battle unless the Pope is able to persuade other Christian rulers to send us aid to fortify our kingdom.
When the Mongols invaded in 1241, we sent requests for military aid to the
papacy, the Holy Roman Emperor, the king of France, and others. But from
all of them we received only words of support. We, for shame, resorted to inviting pagan Cumans* into our kingdom.
If, God forbid, our kingdom fell to the Mongols, the door would be open
for them to invade the other regions of the Catholic faith from the Hungarian
steppes. So, the people in our kingdom cannot cease to be amazed that you
offer substantial help to the Christian territories overseas, which if they were
lost would not harm the inhabitants of Europe more than if our kingdom fell.”

Questions 7–9 refer to the passage below.
“Concerning his greatest project, the Selimiye imperial mosque, Sinan himself
said this:
‘Sultan Selim II [reigned 1566–1574] ordered the building of a great mosque
in the city of Edirne. I, Sinan, his humble servant, prepared for him a design
showing four minaret towers, each standing at one of the four corners of
an enormous central prayer hall topped by a great dome. Each of the four
minarets had three balconies, with separate staircases leading to each balcony.
Previously only one Ottoman mosque had a minaret with three balconies,
and its one minaret is like a thick tower. But the minarets I designed for
Sultan Selim’s mosque are slender and elegant. The difficulty of putting three
staircases in such slender structures should be obvious to anyone.
Those among the Christians* who consider themselves architects used to
say that no building can ever be covered by a dome that is larger than that
of the Christian church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. They used to
claim that no Muslim architect would ever be able to build a mosque whose
dome even approaches in size that of the Hagia Sophia. Yet in the Selimiye
mosque, with the help of God and with the support of His Majesty the Sultan,
I was able to build a dome that is about 10 feet higher and 6 feet wider than the dome of the Hagia Sophia.’”
*Sinan himself was born into an Ottoman Greek Christian family, but was converted to Islam when he
began training for government service as a young boy.
Sai Mustafa Chelebi, Ottoman court official, biography of the famous
Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan, written circa 1600
7.	 Which of the following characteristics of the Ottoman Empire best explains
why Sinan was determined to match the dimensions of the Hagia Sophia church, as discussed in the third paragraph?
(A)	The Ottoman dynasty was descended from Turkic pastoralist nomads
who did not have their own tradition of monumental architecture.
(B)	 Ottoman art often illustrated the historical and spiritual connections
between Islam and other monotheistic religions, such as Christianity and Judaism.
(C)	 By the time the Ottoman Empire began to expand, the Byzantine
Empire had already been dramatically reduced in size and geopolitical importance.
(D)	Bringing Constantinople, with its imperial traditions, under Islamic
rule was one of the central pillars of Ottoman rulers’ claims to political legitimacy.

(B)	 understating the extent of Ottoman royal support for the building of the mosque
(C)	 overstating Christian architects’ achievements and their contributions to the building on the mosque
(D)	intentionally attributing the building of the mosque to Sinan even though he was not the architect
9.	 Sinan’s service to the Ottoman state best illustrates the fact that land-based empires in the period 1450–1750 often relied on
(A)	appointed bureaucrats to break the power of entrenched landed aristocracies
(B)	 mass conscription of soldiers to carry out their territorial expansion

Questions 10–12 refer to the passage below.
“Imagine that Chinese ships were to start importing arsenic* into England,
advertising it as a harmless, foreign and fashionable luxury. Next, imagine
that after a few years of arsenic being all the rage, with hundreds of thousands
using it, the British government were to ban its use because of its bad effects.
Finally, imagine again that, in opposition to this ban on arsenic, Chinese
ships were to be positioned off the coast of England, making occasional raids on London.
Advocates of the opium-smuggling profession argue that it is immensely
profitable and that supplying opium in bulk as they are doing is not immoral
and it only becomes vulgar when the opium is sold in small portions, to
individual users. What admirable logic with which one may shield oneself
from reality, satisfied that the opium trade is nothing more than ‘supplying
an important source of revenue to British companies operating in India.’
The trade may be a profitable one—it may be of importance to the Indian
government, and to individuals—but to pretend that it can be defended as
harmless to health and morals is to argue the impossible. Anyone who
seriously thinks about the subject cannot defend what is, in itself, manifestly indefensible.” *a poisonous substance
“Remarks on the Opium Trade,” letter to a British magazine
from an anonymous English merchant in Guangzhou (Canton),
China, published in 1836
10.	 The trade described in the passage is best seen as an early example of which of the following?
(A)	The economic decline of Asian states resulting from the importation of cheap consumer goods from Europe
(B)	 The growing economic influence of European immigrants in China
(C)	 The declining political power of European joint-stock companies in Asia
because of states assuming direct imperial control
(D)	The use of economic imperialism by European merchants and states
11.	 As described in the second paragraph, the arguments made by the supporters
of the opium trade were most similar to the arguments made in the early
nineteenth century by supporters of the continued use of
(A)	artisanal and craft production, as opposed to the factory system
(B)	 mercantilist trade practices, as opposed to free trade
(C)	 African slave labor on sugar plantations in the Americas
(D)	women’s and children’s labor in the production of luxury goods in Chinese households

turning point in world history primarily because the opium trade
(A)	shifted the pattern of historic European trade imbalances with China
(B)	 marked the transition from mercantilist trade toward capitalist free trade
(C)	 was the first time that Europeans used migrant labor to grow crops for global distribution

Questions 13–15 refer to the following two passages.
Source 1
“I have long dreamed of buying an island owned by no nation whatsoever
and of establishing the World Headquarters of the Dow company there, on
the truly neutral ground of such an island, beholden to no nation or society.
If we were located on such truly neutral ground, we could then operate
in the United States as U.S. citizens, in Japan as Japanese citizens, and in
Brazil as Brazilians rather than being governed primarily by the laws of the
United States. We could even pay any native workers handsomely to move elsewhere.”
Carl A. Gerstacker, chairman of the Dow Chemical Company,
a United States corporation, speech before the White House “Conference on the Industrial World Ahead,” 1972
Source 2
“I was asked the other day about United States competitiveness in the world
economy. I replied that I don’t think about it at all. We at NCR think of
ourselves as a globally competitive company that happens to be headquartered in the United States.”
Gilbert Williamson, president of NCR Corporation, a United States
technology company, interview with the New York Times, 1989
13.	 The views expressed in the two passages were most directly enabled by which of
the following economic trends in the late twentieth century?
(A)	Many of the defeated countries in the Second World War received generous
economic assistance from the United States after the war.
(B)	 Governments in newly independent postcolonial states sought to limit
their countries’ economic reliance on the former colonial powers.
(C)	 The governments of many developed Western countries adopted policies of economic liberalization and deregulation.
(D)	Governments in Asia cooperated with private businesses in an effort to
maximize exports and acquire foreign currencies from Europe and the
United States.
14.	 The corporate philosophy reflected in the two passages most directly contributed to which of the following?
(A)	The inability of the Soviet-planned economy to compete successfully with
the economies of the United States and other Western countries
(B)	 The shift of manufacturing capacity from the postindustrial countries of
the West to the new manufacturing centers in Asia and Latin America
(C)	 The passage of stronger measures to safeguard workers’ and consumers’ rights in many developed countries
(D)	Increased popular hostility toward economic migrants and migrations in many countries

PART B: SHORT-ANSWER QUESTION WITH PRIMARY SOURCE
The following is an example of short-answer question 2 found on the AP Exam. Note
that on the actual AP Exam, students will answer three short-answer questions.
2.	 Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that follows.
“Having questioned Sidotti,* I understand that Christians teach that their
God produced heaven and earth and make him out to be the Great Lord and
Father. This God of theirs, they say, cannot be served without giving him all
of one’s love and all of one’s reverence. What these Christians are in effect
saying is this: I have a [real] father, but I do not love him because I reserve
all my love for God; I have a [real] lord, but I don’t revere him because I
reserve all my reverence for God. Now this is what we call being impious and
disloyal! According to the Book of Rites, it is the emperor, the Son of Heaven,
who should be worshiping God, the Lord of Heaven. It is not a duty that is
given to ordinary people. And that is in order to prevent the blurring of the
line between the exalted and the base. Thus, the sovereign is Heaven to the
subjects just as the father is Heaven to the child.”
*Giovanni Battista Sidotti was an Italian priest who had entered Japan in 1708, in violation of the
Japanese government’s prohibition on Christian missionary activities.
Arai Hakuseki, Japanese scholar and adviser to the
Tokugawa shogun, report, circa 1720
(A)	Describe ONE way in which Hakuseki’s argument was influenced by long-standing Asian cultural traditions.
(B)	 Explain ONE way in which the religious encounter referred to in the
passage differed from most other religious encounters in the period circa 1450–1750.
(C)	 Explain ONE historical situation in the period 1450–1750, other than the
one illustrated in the passage, in which states in Asia or Africa adopted
policies to limit European political power or cultural influence.

The following are examples of the kinds of free-response questions found on the exam.
Note that on the actual AP Exam, students will answer one document-based question
and will select one of the three long essay questions to answer.
DOCUMENT-BASED QUESTION
1.	 Evaluate the extent to which the experience of the First World War changed
relationships between Europeans and colonized peoples.
In your response you should do the following:
§§ Respond to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a line of reasoning.
§§ Describe a broader historical context relevant to the prompt.
§§ Support an argument in response to the prompt using at least six documents.
§§ Use at least one additional piece of specific historical evidence (beyond that found
in the documents) relevant to an argument about the prompt.
§§ For at least three documents, explain how or why the document's point of view,
purpose, historical situation, and/or audience is relevant to an argument.
§§ Use evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the prompt.
Document 1
Source: John Chilembwe, native of British Nyasaland (present-day
Malawi) and ordained Baptist minister, letter sent to the Nyasaland Times,*
November 1914.
We have been invited to shed our innocent blood in this world war which
is now in progress. In the past, it was said indirectly that Africa had nothing
to do with the civilized world. But now we find that the poor African has
already been plunged into the great war. The masses of our people are ready
to put on uniforms, ignorant of what they have to face or why they have to
face it. We natives have been loyal since the commencement of this [British]
Government, and in all departments of Nyasaland the welfare of the British
would have been incomplete without our loyalty. But in time of peace the
Government failed to help the underdog. In time of peace everything was for
Europeans only. But in time of war it has been found that we are needed to
share hardships and shed our blood in equality. The poor Africans who have
nothing to win in this present world are invited to die for a cause which is not theirs.
*The letter was published but later retracted by the newspaper’s British editors, and the entire
issue was subsequently withdrawn from circulation and destroyed by the Nyasaland colonial government.

Source: Kalyan Mukerji, Indian officer in the British Indian army that
was fighting against the Ottoman army in Iraq, letter to a friend in India,
October 1915. The letter was intercepted by British mail censors and was not delivered.
England is the educator. The patriotism that the English have taught us,
the patriotism that all civilized nations have celebrated—that patriotism is
responsible for all this bloodshed. We see now that all that patriotism means
is snatching away another man’s country. To show patriotism, nationalism,
by killing thousands and thousands of people all to snatch away a bit of land, well it’s the English who have taught us this.
The youths of our country, seeing this, have started to practice this brutal
form of nationalism. Therefore, killing a number of people, throwing
bombs—they have started doing these horrific things. Shame on patriotism.
As long as this narrow-mindedness continues, bloodshed in the name of
patriotism will not cease. Whether a man throws a bomb from the roof-top
or whether fifty men, under orders from their officer, start firing from a
cannon-gun at the front line—the cause of this bloodshed, this madness, is the same.
Document 3
Source: French postcard, showing colonial troops in France and French
civilians, 1915. The text of the card says: “Our Black troops in the Great War
1914–1915 [say]: ‘What are we doing here?! . . . We came to kill savages*. . .

Source: Behari Lal, Indian soldier in the British Indian army on the Western
Front, letter to his family, November 1917. The letter was intercepted by
British mail censors and was not delivered.
There is no likelihood of our getting rest during the winter. I am sure
German prisoners would not be worse off in any way than we are. I had to
go three nights without sleep, as I was on a truck, and the Europeans on the
truck did not like to sleep next to me because I am an Indian. I am sorry the
hatred between Europeans and Indians is increasing instead of decreasing,
and I am sure the fault is not with the Indians. I am sorry to write this, which
is not a hundredth part of what is in mind, but this increasing hatred and
continued ill-treatment has compelled me to give you a hint.
Document 5
Source: Popular Egyptian protest song sung during the Egyptian revolt of
1919 against the British occupation of Egypt. The revolt led to Great Britain’s
recognition of Egypt’s nominal independence in 1922.
Laborers and soldiers were forced to travel, leaving their land
They headed to the battlefields and the trenches!
And now the British blame us for revolting?
Behold the calamities you have caused! Had it not been for our laborers,
You and your troops would have been helpless in the desert sand!
Oh, you who are in authority, why didn’t you go all alone to the
Dardanelles?*
Oh Maxwell** now you feel the hardships, how does it feel?
The Egyptian is resilient; and now he is willing and able and can do anything.
His achievements are worthy of praise, and he will do his all to gain a constitution.
We are the sons of Pharaohs, which no one can dispute. . . .

British Army and leader of a labor union formed to defend the rights of
Jamaican war veterans, petition to the British colonial government, 1935.
It has taken 17 years of countless petitions, marching through the streets of
Kingston,* as well as agitations before we were given worthless lands in some
of the most remote parts of the island without even a well-needed five-pound
bill to assist us in making a shabby shelter, much less in trying to cultivate
the place for an existence. In some cases, not even wild birds would care to
inhabit the worthless lands that we were given. Not even an inch is suitable
for cultivation, and as far as roads are concerned, the inaccessibility of the places renders that impossible.

Document 7
Source: Nar Diouf, African veteran of a West African regiment in the French
army, interview for an oral history project, 1982.
My experience in the war gave me many lasting things. I demonstrated my
dignity and courage, and I won the respect of my people and the [French
colonial] government. In the years immediately after the war, whenever the
people of my village had something to contest with the French—and they
didn’t dare do it themselves because they were afraid—I would go and take
care of it for them. And many times when people had problems with the
government, I would go with my war decorations and arrange the situation
for them. Because whenever the French saw your decorations, they knew
that they are dealing with a very important person. So I gained this ability—
to obtain justice over the Europeans—from the war.
For example, one day a French military doctor was in our village, and there
was a small boy who was blind. The boy was walking, but he couldn’t see and
he bumped into the Frenchman. And the Frenchman turned and pushed
the boy down on the ground. And when I saw this, I came and said to the
Frenchman: “Why did you push the boy? Can’t you see that he is blind?” And
he looked at me and said: “Oh, pardon, pardon. I did not know. I will never
do it again, excuse me!” But before the war, it would not have been possible
for me to interact like that with a European, no matter what he had done.

AP History Rubrics
Introductory notes:
§§ Except where otherwise noted, each point of the rubric is earned independently.
For instance, a student could earn a point for evidence beyond the documents without earning a point for thesis/claim.
§§ Accuracy: The components of this rubric each require that students demonstrate
historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, a
response may contain errors that do not detract from its overall quality, as long as
the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate.
§§ Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain
grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a student unless
they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and reasoning processes described in the rubrics.

Part B: Short-Answer Question with Secondary Source   
1.	 Use the passage below to answer all parts of the question that follows.
“Having questioned Sidotti,* I understand that Christians teach that their God produced heaven and
earth and make him out to be the Great Lord and Father. This God of theirs, they say, cannot be served without
giving him all of one’s love and all of one’s reverence. What these Christians are in effect saying is this: I have a
[real] father, but I do not love him because I reserve all my love for God; I have a [real] lord, but I don’t revere him
because I reserve all my reverence for God. Now this is what we call being impious and disloyal! According to the
Book of Rites, it is the emperor, the Son of Heaven, who should be worshiping God, the Lord of Heaven. It is
not a duty that is given to ordinary people. And that is in order to prevent the blurring of the line between the
exalted and the base. Thus, the sovereign is Heaven to the subjects just as the father is Heaven to the child.”
*Giovanni Battista Sidotti was an Italian priest who had entered Japan in 1708, in violation of the Japanese government’s prohibition on Christian missionary activities.
Arai Hakuseki, Japanese scholar and adviser to the
Tokugawa shogun, report, circa 1720
(A)	Describe ONE way in which Hakuseki’s argument was influenced by long-standing Asian cultural traditions.
(B)	 Explain ONE way in which the religious encounter referred to in the passage differed from most
other religious encounters in the period circa 1450–1750.
(C)	 Explain ONE historical situation in the period 1450–1750, other than the one illustrated in the
passage, in which states in Asia or Africa adopted policies to limit European political power or cultural influence.

Describe one way in which Hakuseki’s argument was influenced by long-standing Asian cultural traditions.
Examples that earn this point include the following:
•	 Hakuseki’s argument was influenced by Confucianism.
•	 Hakuseki’s argument that sovereign is Heaven to the subjects and the father is Heaven to the child was influenced by Confucian beliefs.
•	 Hakuseki’s argument that only the emperor is supposed to serve the Lord of Heaven reflects the beliefs of Confucianism.

2.A (b)
Explain one way in which the religious encounter referred to in the passage differed from most other
religious encounters in the period circa 1450–1750.
Examples that earn this point include the following:
•	 One important difference is that most Christian missionaries and Muslim Sufis traveled across the
world and spread their religion without being banned by other governments.
•	 One important difference between the circumstances of the religious encounter in eighteenth-century
Japan and other religious encounters in the period 1450–1750 is that religious interactions in this
period more frequently led to the development of syncretic belief systems such as Vodou or Santería
than the outright banning of the preaching of a religion.
•	 One important difference between the Tokugawa shogunate banning the preaching of Christianity
and most other religious interactions in the period 1450–1750 is that some governments, such as the
Mughal Empire under Akbar, encouraged religious tolerance and interaction.
1 point
5.B (c)
Explain one historical situation in the period 1450–1750, other than the one illustrated in the passage, in
which states in Asia or Africa adopted policies to limit European political power or cultural influence.
Examples that earn this point include the following:
•	 The Mughal emperors of India and the African kings of Kongo attempted to restrict European merchants to certain towns and trading posts.
•	 The Ming and Qing emperors of China confined the Portuguese merchants to Macao and placed legal restrictions on converting to Christianity.
•	 Although the Safavid Empire allowed European merchants to settle in some cities and even serve as
advisors at court, preaching Christianity was strictly forbidden.

Document 1
Source: John Chilembwe, native of British Nyasaland (present-day Malawi) and ordained Baptist minister, letter sent to the Nyasaland Times,* November 1914.
We have been invited to shed our innocent blood in this world war which is now in progress. In the past, it was
said indirectly that Africa had nothing to do with the civilized world. But now we find that the poor African has
already been plunged into the great war. The masses of our people are ready to put on uniforms, ignorant of what
they have to face or why they have to face it. We natives have been loyal since the commencement of this [British]
Government, and in all departments of Nyasaland the welfare of the British would have been incomplete without
our loyalty. But in time of peace the Government failed to help the underdog. In time of peace everything was for
Europeans only. But in time of war it has been found that we are needed to share hardships and shed our blood in
equality. The poor Africans who have nothing to win in this present world are invited to die for a cause which is not theirs.
*The letter was published but later retracted by the newspaper’s British editors, and the entire issue was subsequently withdrawn from circulation
and destroyed by the Nyasaland colonial government.

Source: Kalyan Mukerji, Indian officer in the British Indian army that was fighting against the Ottoman army in Iraq,
letter to a friend in India, October 1915. The letter was intercepted by British mail censors and was not delivered.
England is the educator. The patriotism that the English have taught us, the patriotism that all civilized nations
have celebrated—that patriotism is responsible for all this bloodshed. We see now that all that patriotism means
is snatching away another man’s country. To show patriotism, nationalism, by killing thousands and thousands of
people all to snatch away a bit of land, well it’s the English who have taught us this.
The youths of our country, seeing this, have started to practice this brutal form of nationalism. Therefore, killing a
number of people, throwing bombs—they have started doing these horrific things. Shame on patriotism. As long
as this narrow-mindedness continues, bloodshed in the name of patriotism will not cease. Whether a man throws a
bomb from the roof-top or whether fifty men, under orders from their officer, start firing from a cannon-gun at the
front line—the cause of this bloodshed, this madness, is the same.

1917. The letter was intercepted by British mail censors and was not delivered.
There is no likelihood of our getting rest during the winter. I am sure German prisoners would not be worse off
in any way than we are. I had to go three nights without sleep, as I was on a truck, and the Europeans on the truck
did not like to sleep next to me because I am an Indian. I am sorry the hatred between Europeans and Indians is
increasing instead of decreasing, and I am sure the fault is not with the Indians. I am sorry to write this, which is not
a hundredth part of what is in mind, but this increasing hatred and continued ill-treatment has compelled me to give you a hint.
Document 5
Source: Popular Egyptian protest song sung during the Egyptian revolt of 1919 against the British occupation of
Egypt. The revolt led to Great Britain’s recognition of Egypt’s nominal independence in 1922.
Laborers and soldiers were forced to travel, leaving their land
They headed to the battlefields and the trenches!
And now the British blame us for revolting?
Behold the calamities you have caused! Had it not been for our laborers,
You and your troops would have been helpless in the desert sand!
Oh, you who are in authority, why didn’t you go all alone to the Dardanelles?*
Oh Maxwell** now you feel the hardships, how does it feel?
The Egyptian is resilient; and now he is willing and able and can do anything.
His achievements are worthy of praise, and he will do his all to gain a constitution.
We are the sons of Pharaohs, which no one can dispute. . . .

Source: Hubert Reid, Jamaican veteran of a West Indian regiment in the British Army and leader of a labor union
formed to defend the rights of Jamaican war veterans, petition to the British colonial government, 1935.
It has taken 17 years of countless petitions, marching through the streets of Kingston,* as well as agitations before we
were given worthless lands in some of the most remote parts of the island without even a well-needed five-pound
bill to assist us in making a shabby shelter, much less in trying to cultivate the place for an existence. In some cases,
not even wild birds would care to inhabit the worthless lands that we were given. Not even an inch is suitable for
cultivation, and as far as roads are concerned, the inaccessibility of the places renders that impossible.

Document 7
Source: Nar Diouf, African veteran of a West African regiment in the French army, interview for an oral history project, 1982.
My experience in the war gave me many lasting things. I demonstrated my dignity and courage, and I won the
respect of my people and the [French colonial] government. In the years immediately after the war, whenever the
people of my village had something to contest with the French—and they didn’t dare do it themselves because
they were afraid—I would go and take care of it for them. And many times when people had problems with the
government, I would go with my war decorations and arrange the situation for them. Because whenever the French
saw your decorations, they knew that they are dealing with a very important person. So I gained this ability—to obtain justice over the Europeans—from the war.
For example, one day a French military doctor was in our village, and there was a small boy who was blind. The boy
was walking, but he couldn’t see and he bumped into the Frenchman. And the Frenchman turned and pushed the
boy down on the ground. And when I saw this, I came and said to the Frenchman: “Why did you push the boy? Can’t
you see that he is blind?” And he looked at me and said: “Oh, pardon, pardon. I did not know. I will never do it again,
excuse me!” But before the war, it would not have been possible for me to interact like that with a European, no matter what he had done.

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes
Responses that do not earn this point:
•	 The intended thesis or claim is not historically defensible •
The intended thesis or claim only restates or rephrases the prompt
•	 The intended thesis or claim does not respond to the prompt
•	 The intended thesis or claim offers no indication of a line of reasoning
•	 The intended thesis or claim is overgeneralized
Responses that earn this point:
•	 The response must provide a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes
a position on the extent to which the experience of the First World War changed
relationships between Europeans and colonized peoples. The thesis or claim
must either provide some indication of the reason for making that claim OR by establishing categories of the argument
Examples that do not earn this point:
Historically defensible claim, but no indication of a line of reasoning
•	 “The First World War was a major turning point in the
relationships between Europeans and colonized peoples in Africa and Asia”
Indication of a line of reasoning, but not a historically defensible claim
•	 “Since the Great War was mostly a European conflict, it had
almost no influence on European colonies or colonial peoples”
Examples that earn this point:
Establish a line of reasoning that evaluates the topic of the prompt
•	 “The experience of the First World War greatly changed the relationship between
Europeans and colonized peoples because the war showed that Europeans needed colonial troops to fight their wars”
•	 “Although many people in the colonies at first responded patriotically to the call to
arms, their experiences during the war led to disillusionment and questioning of the colonial order”
Establish a line of reasoning that evaluates the topic of the prompt with analytic categories
•	 “Despite the sacrifices of colonial troops, the war did not change the basic political
relationship between Europeans and their colonies. Europeans continued to view
colonized peoples as inferior and, except for a few small cultural changes, did not
take any meaningful steps toward giving them greater rights or self-rule after 1918”
Establish a line of reasoning
•	 “The experience of the First World War greatly changed the relationship between
Europeans and colonized peoples because the war showed that Europeans needed
colonial troops to fight their wars.” (Minimally acceptable thesis/claim)
Additional Notes:
•	 The thesis or claim must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion (which may not be limited to the first or last paragraphs).
•	 The thesis or claim must identify a relevant development(s) in the period, although it is not required to encompass the entire period.

Examples of unacceptable contextualization that do not earn
this point:
Do not provide context relevant to the topic of the prompt
•	 “The Great War began as a relatively small conflict in the
Balkans escalated into a global war. The systems of alliances,
war strategies, and mobilization plans made it impossible to contain and stop the conflict”
Examples of relevant context that earn this point include the following, if appropriate elaboration is provided:
•	 The causes of the First World War •	 European empire-building in South Asia •	 The Scramble for Africa
•	 Cultural, economic, or racial justifications of imperialism
Examples of acceptable contextualization:
•	 “Both Great Britain and France had long recruited local troops in their colonies and
had used them to suppress revolts and expand their colonial empires. When World
War I started, it was pretty clear that it will be a ‘total war’ requiring all the resources
countries could muster - so it was a foregone conclusion that these colonial armies
will be used, whether on European fronts or in Asia and Africa”
Additional Notes:
•	 The response must relate the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that occur before, during, or continue after the time frame of the question.
•	 To earn this point, the context provided must be more than a phrase or reference.

Responses that earn 1 point:

Responses that earn 2 points:
•	 Support an argument in response to the prompt by
accurately using the content of at least six documents.
•	 The six documents do not have to be used in support
of a single argument, but they can be used across sub arguments or to address counterarguments
Examples of describing the content of a
document:
Describe evidence from the documents relevant to the topic but do not use that evidence to support an argument •	 (Document 2) “Officer Kalyan Mukerji’s letter to a friend in India shows that the experience of the war has changed his views of England so that now he sees
English-style nationalism as nothing but an excuse to kill and conquer other people”
Examples of supporting an argument using the content of
a document:
•	 (Document 1): “John Chilembwe’s letter to the Nyasaland
Times shows that Europeans’ need for African recruits has
changed the relationship between colonizers and colonial
peoples because the British in Nyasaland now have to
appeal to Africans’ sense of duty and patriotism. But, after
seeing how Europeans have treated their colonial subjects
in peacetime, Chilembwe isn’t buying it.” (Connects the
contents of the document to an argument about how the
experience of the First World War changed the relationships
between Europeans and colonized peoples, as well as the attitudes towards those relationships)
•	 (Document 5): “The lyrics of the Egyptian protest song
demonstrate how the experience of World War I has given
Egyptians greater confidence to assert their demands
before their British colonial government. The song
reminds the British of the contributions Egyptians made
during the war and forcefully demands that Britain grant
Egypt its own constitution.” (Connects the content of the
document to an argument about how the experience of
the war changed perceptions of the relationships between colonized peoples and Europeans)

Responses that do not earn this point:
•	 Provide evidence that is not relevant to an argument about the prompt
•	 Provide evidence that is outside the time period or region specified in the prompt
•	 Repeat information that is specified in the prompt or in any of the documents •	 Provide a passing phase or reference
Responses that earn this point:
•	 Must use at least one specific piece of historical evidence relevant to an argument
about the extent to which there were changes in relationships between European
and colonized people that resulted from the First World War
Examples of evidence beyond the documents relevant to an argument
about the prompt:
•	 “Many colonized people had hoped that after the end of the war they would be
rewarded by their service by giving them fuller citizenship rights, if not outright
independence. But the peace treaties left the British and French empires
untouched and actually expanded them through the Mandate system.” (Provides a
piece of evidence not in the documents relevant to an argument that addresses the
lack of change in relationships despite the upheaval of the war)
•	 “The British generally trusted their Indian troops and, before WWI broke out, had
used in several campaigns outside of India, for example in East Africa and in China
during the Boxer rebellion.” (Provides a piece of evidence not in the documents to
connect military actions and decisions to the larger discussion of European/colonial relationships)
Additional Notes:
•	 Typically, statements credited as evidence will be more specific than statements credited as contextualization.
•	 To earn this point, the evidence provided must be different from the evidence used to earn the point for contextualization.
•	 To earn this point, the evidence provided must be more than a phrase or reference.

•	 “The purpose of document 4 was as a letter to his family to communicate with them about the war”
Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s point of view:
•	 (Document 1): “As an ordained minister, John Chilembwe is probably opposed to
wars in general, but in the case of the First World War he is particularly against the
idea of Africans serving because he can see that there is no higher purpose to the
war than European political and economic gain.” (Identifies the point of view of the
source and how this might influence his view of European/colonial relationships)
Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the author’s purpose:
•	 (Document 3): “Part of the French government’s purpose in printing this postcard
may have been to reassure the French population that African troops serving in
France can be friendly and trustworthy. So even though the card shows Africans
and French civilians sitting next to each other and smiling, it probably indicates
that ordinary French people continued to be biased against Africans, even those
fighting for their country.” (Connects the purpose of the postcard to the argument
about European/colonial relationships with references both to the source and to the intended audience)
Example of acceptable explanation of the relevance of the historical situation of
a source:
•	 (Document 7): “Nar Diouf’s experiences in the war are recorded in the 1980s as
part of an oral history project. So he has the benefit of hindsight regarding both the
end of the war and the end of French colonialism in Africa. From this perspective,
it is understandable that Nar Diouf emphasizes the way in which being a veteran
allowed him to be effective in helping his community resist the abuses of French
colonizers.” (Provides sourcing regarding the historical situation of the document
and how this relates to the argument about European/colonial relationships) continued on next page

Sourcing
Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the audience:
•	 (Document 4): “Even though someone writing a private letter to his family can be
expected to share their honest opinion of a situation, this was not always the case
with soldiers’ letter during the war. The reason for that was that soldiers knew that
government censors often read their letters and could decide not to deliver them if
they thought they revealed something secret or could be bad for people’s morale.
For example, Behari Lal’s letter says that what he is writing “is not a hundredth
part” of what is on his mind, suggesting that his experiences were actually much
worse than he reveals in the letter.” (Provides information about the audience of the
government report relevant to an argument about European/colonial relationships)

Demonstrates a complex understanding of the historical development that is the
focus of the prompt, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the question
Decision Rules and Scoring Notes
Responses that earn this point:
May demonstrate a complex understanding in a variety of ways, such as:
•	 Explaining nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables
•	 Explaining both similarity and difference, or explaining both continuity and change,
or explaining multiple causes, or explaining both causes and effects
•	 Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across periods
•	 Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives across themes
•	 Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence
Demonstrating complex understanding might include any of the following, if appropriate elaboration is provided:
•	 Analyzing multiple variables, such as the different effects of wartime experiences
on the relationship between Europeans and colonized peoples. For example, an
argument that the war both fostered and eroded colonial soldiers’ loyalty and
patriotism for their colonial empires, as the early enthusiasm for the war gave
way to disillusionment and the realization that their sacrifices have been in vain.
(Explains nuance)
•	 Analyzing multiple variables by arguing that wartime experiences sometimes
challenged Europeans’ sense of cultural superiority over Africans and Asians and
sometimes reinforced these prejudices. (Explains nuance)
•	 Explaining how some colonial leaders hoped that the wartime contributions
of African and Asian troops would convince colonial powers to grant broader
autonomy to the colonies and, when these hopes failed to materialize, Africans
and Asians increasingly turned to nationalism. (Explains relevant and insightful connections)
•	 Explaining how the war transformed European culture by leading Europeans (much
as it did Africans and Asians) to question the accepted social and cultural norms.

Complexity
•	 Explaining relevant and insightful connections across periods, such as explaining
how wars sometimes prove to be important political or cultural turning points. For
example, the effects on the Napoleonic Wars on Latin American independence
movements. (Explains relevant and insightful connections)
•	 Corroborating multiple perspectives, such as explaining how different documents
corroborate an argument in spite of the differing perspectives of the authors.
(Corroborates, qualifies or modifies an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence)
Additional Notes:
•	 This demonstration of complex understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference.

Document
Summary of Content
Explains the relevance of point of view, purpose, situation, and/or audience by elaborating on
examples such as:
1. John
Chilembwe, letter to Nyasaland
Times (1914) •	 Criticizes the duplicity of the British who,
Chilembwe argues, have maintained that
Africans cannot be the equal to Europeans in peacetime but are now calling for Africans to share equally in the hardships and sacrifices of war
•	 Within months of the outbreak of the war, the British have already begun recruiting African troops (situation)
•	 The author, an educated African (as evidenced by his being an ordained minister) is well aware of
the narratives used to justify imperialism (for example the claim that “Africa had nothing to do with
the civilized world” and turns these narratives around to point out the duplicity of British calls that
Africans share equally in the hardships of war (POV)
•	 Because the letter is addressed to British settlers and colonial authorities in Nyasaland it states its
objection in a relatively mild and measured way; nonetheless, the authorities ended up destroying
the issue of the newspaper in which the letter was published (audience)
2. Kalyan Mukerji, letter from the
Iraq Front (1915) •	 Denounces patriotism and nationalism, which the author blames for the bloodshed of the war. Argues that Indian youth have turned to political violence because they have been taught the politics of patriotism by Britain
•	 The British used the colonial Indian army extensively on the Mesopotamian front in present-day Iraq, against the Ottoman Empire (situation)
•	 Because it is a private, front-line letter to a friend in India, the letter likely describes the author’s real
feelings about the war (audience). Alternatively, an essay may argue that the author knew all mail was
read by censors, so he used the letter to convey his protest to the authorities
3. French postcard of colonial troops in France (1915) •	 The postcard shows three Black French colonial troops sitting in a bench in a French town with two French civilians. Both the soldiers and the civilians are smiling and appear comfortable together
•	 Whether the photo was candid or staged, the fact that it was selected by the French government
to print as a postcard suggests that it presents an idealized version of colonial troops wartime experiences (purpose/POV)
•	 The postcard is a response to German propaganda claiming that by deploying colonial troops on
the Western Front, the French (and the British) were turning Europe over to “savages.” The postcard
counters that by suggesting that the real savages were the Germans - a common claim of French propaganda during the war (situation)
4. Behari Lal, letter from the Western
Front (1917) •	 Narrates the author’s experience being transported together with British troops in a truck; the British troops would not sleep next to him because he was Indian. The author claims that a German prisoner would not have been any worse, and expresses regret that the war is exacerbating the “hatred” between
Europeans and Indians
•	 Written on the Western Front at a point in the war when it was clear that trench warfare with little or
no gain would continue for a long time (situation)
•	 The author’s cautious analysis of the reasons for the increased “hatred” and his mention that he has
more on his mind than he is letting on indicate that he knows his letter will be read by the censors
and is being extra careful in what he says or does not say (audience/purpose) continued on next page

Summary of Content
Explains the relevance of point of view, purpose, situation, and/or audience by elaborating on
examples such as:
5. Egyptian protest song (1919) •	 Addressing the British in general and General
Maxwell in particular, the song recalls the contribution of Egyptian “laborers” to British the wartime effort in the Dardanelles campaign. The song claims that Egyptians are resilient and are “sons of Pharaohs” and highlights the Egyptians’ determination to “gain a constitution”
•	 Colonies’ dashed hopes of independence/autonomy in the aftermath of the war; resistance to colonial rule after the war (situation)
•	 The song’s seeks to rally ordinary Egyptians behind the cause of resisting the British by referring to
Egypt’s past glory under the Pharaohs and praising the Egyptian national character (audience)
6. Hubert Reid, petition to British colonial authorities in Jamaica (1935) •	 Claims that the “worthless lands” that
Jamaican war veterans had received from the British colonial government after years of protests are worthless because of their poor location, lack of infrastructure, and lack of government financial support for veterans
•	 Post-war veterans’ rights movements; unkept promises made by the colonial authorities to former troops (situation)
•	 Since the purpose is to convince the Jamaica colonial authorities to expand veteran aid, the letter
likely portrays veterans’ fortunes as worse than they actually were (purpose)
•	 The author is not only a veteran himself, but also a leader of a veterans’ labor union, therefore he is
likely to have a good grasp on the problems faced by Jamaican war veterans on the “macro” level  not just his own (POV)
7. Nar Diouf, interview recalling post-war experiences in West Africa (1982) •	 Recounts the author’s experiences in West
Africa after he had served in the French
Army during the war. The author argues his social standing was increased because of his wartime service and decorations.
Other people in his village would ask him to represent them in their dealings with the
French. The author narrates an episode in which he used the respect his service commanded to confront a French man being abusive to a blind African boy
•	 Interview for an oral history project, many decades after the end of the war; the elapsed time may
have affected the accuracy of the memories (situation)
•	 The interviewee speaks from the point of view of someone important in his community and
highlights the importance of his experience in the war in enhancing his social standing; he also
speaks from the vantage point of the 1980s, so he sees his experiences under colonialism from the vantage point of post-colonial Africa (POV)

General Scoring Notes
•	 Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a student could earn
a point for evidence without earning a point for thesis/claim.
•	 Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible content
knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality,
as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate.
•	 Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not
be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and reasoning processes described below.

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes
Responses that do not earn this point:
•
The intended thesis or claim is not historically defensible •
The intended thesis or claim only restates or rephrases the prompt •
The intended thesis or claim does not respond to the prompt •
The intended thesis or claim offers no indication of a line of reasoning •
The intended thesis or claim is overgeneralized
Responses that earn this point:
•
The response must provide a historically defensible thesis or claim about the extent to which
reform movements succeeded in bringing about political or social change in industrial society in
the nineteenth century. The thesis or claim must either provide some indication of the reasoning
for making that claim OR by establishing analytic categories of the argument
Examples that do not earn this point:
Do not focus on the topic of the prompt, and offers no specific line of reasoning •

revolutions and violence during the nineteenth century”
Do not establish a line of reasoning, although the claim is historically defensible •
“Nineteenth-century reform movements were successful
in bringing about social change in industrial societies”
Restate the prompt or are overgeneralized • “Reform movements brought about change socially, politically and economically”
Examples that earn this point:
Establish a line of reasoning that evaluates the topic of the prompt •
“Nineteenth-century reform movements were somewhat successful in bringing about political
change in industrial societies because more people received the right to vote”
Establish a line of reasoning that evaluates the topic of the prompt with analytic categories •
“Reform movements in the nineteenth century had only limited success in bringing about political
change in industrial societies because governments were able to demonize reformers and coopt
their agendas by enacting minor political changes that satisfied the majority of the population but
did not fully address the complaints of reformers”
Establish a line of reasoning that evaluates the topic of the prompt •
“Reform movements in the nineteenth century had only limited success in bringing about political
change in industrial societies because of opposition from conservatives and the bourgeoisie”
Establish a line of reasoning •
“In the nineteenth century, reform movements brought about social change because they were
able to convince governments to change labor laws.” (Minimally acceptable thesis/claim)
Additional Notes:
•
The thesis or claim must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion (which may not be limited to the first or last paragraphs).
•
The thesis or claim must identify a relevant development(s) in the period, although it is not required to encompass the entire period.

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes
Responses that do not earn this point:
•	 Provide an overgeneralized statement about the time period referenced in the prompt
•	 Provide context that is not relevant to the prompt •	 Provide a passing phase or reference
Responses that earn this point:
•	 Must accurately describe a context relevant to reform movements or industrial society in the nineteenth century
Example of unacceptable contextualization that does not
earn this point:
Has no clear relevance to the topic of the prompt
•	 “European transnational companies often supported the establishment
of colonies in Africa in the hopes of extracting natural resources for factories in Europe”
Examples of relevant context that earn this point include the following, if appropriate elaboration is provided:

•	  Increased urbanization in industrial societies •	 The second industrial revolution
Example of acceptable contextualization:
•	 “Advances in agriculture in Europe allowed for an increase in
mechanization in the manufacturing of goods. This industrial revolution
spread across Europe and to North America and led to challenges to traditional social and political structures”

Provides specific examples of evidence relevant to the topic of the prompt 2 points
Supports an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant examples of evidence
Decision Rules and Scoring Notes
Responses that do not earn points:
•
Identify a single piece of evidence •
Provide evidence that is not relevant to the topic of the prompt •
Provide evidence that is outside the time period or region specified in the prompt •
Repeat information that is specified in the prompt
Responses that earn 1 point:
•
Must identify at least two specific historical examples
relevant to reform movements or industrial society in the nineteenth century
Responses that earn 2 points:
•
Must use at least two specific historical evidence examples to support an argument regarding how reform movements brought about political or social change in industrial society in the nineteenth century
Example of a statement that does not earn any
points for evidence:
Does not provide specific information beyond what is provided in the prompt • “Many reform movements demanded political or social changes in industrial societies during the nineteenth century”
Examples of evidence that are specific and relevant include the following (2 examples required):
•
The British government extending suffrage to all males in 1867 •
The role of labor unions, socialists, anarchists, communists, and feminists in the Paris Commune of 1871 •
The establishment of a social security system in Prussia under Otto von Bismarck •
The passage of child labor reform laws in Great Britain during the early nineteenth century •
Socialists and labor unions demanding the enactment of minimum wage and eight-hour workday Laws •
Labor rights movements, such as unions, proposing to limit working hours and increase wages
Example of a statement that earns 1 point for evidence • “The Chartist movement emerged in Great Britain largely from the frustration that many working class people felt about poor working conditions in
factories and the unwillingness of the owners and the government to address these problems. These were
the same motivations that influenced the development of labor unions”
Examples that successfully support an argument with evidence:
• “During the nineteenth century, most governments of industrial societies successfully resisted adopting most of the demands of political and social reform movements. For example, the British government adopted very few of the Chartist demands, such as annual elections for Parliament, and minimum wage and eight-hour work day laws were only enacted in the twentieth century in most industrialized states.” (Uses multiple, specific pieces of evidence to support the argument that governments resisted reform) • “Women’s suffragists were a force for change as they argued for greater political rights in part because of their increased economic importance in industrial factories. While suffrage was not immediately achieved, through years of effort, women did receive additional rights, eventually including the right to vote, representing a significant political and social change both.”  (Uses evidence to support the argument that reforms were successful in achieving social and political change)
Additional Notes:
•
Typically, statements credited as evidence will be more specific than statements credited as contextualization.
•
If a response has a multipart argument it can meet the threshold of two pieces of evidence by giving one example for one part of the argument and another example
for a different part of the argument, but the total number of examples must still be at least two.

(For example, labor abuses in industrial factories encouraged some women to become more involved in political reform movements; industrialization provided some
women with more economic power in their households, which encouraged some to advocate for greater political rights).

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes
Responses that do not earn
points:
•
May include evidence but offer no reasoning to connect the evidence to an argument •
May assert the use of historical reasoning but do not use it to frame or structure an argument
Responses that earn 1 point:
•
Must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to explain how reform movements brought about political or social change in industrial society in the nineteenth century, although the reasoning may be uneven, limited or imbalanced
Responses that earn 2 points:
May demonstrate a complex understanding in a variety of ways, such as:
•
Explaining nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables •
Explaining both similarity and difference, or explaining both continuity
and change, or explaining multiple causes, or explaining both causes and effects •
Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across periods •
Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives across themes •
Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence
Example of unacceptable use of historical reasoning:
Provides evidence but offers no reasoning to connect the evidence to an argument • “Various groups in different parts of the world in this time called for reform. They wanted rights and better hours and working conditions”
Using a historical thinking skill to frame or structure an argument could include:
•
Explaining how the changes to economic production that industrialization introduced led to reform movements •
Explaining how the political demands of reform movements contributed to the expansion of suffrage in some European states •
Comparing how different or similar factors led to the success or failure of reform movements in different industrial societies
Example of acceptable use of historical
reasoning:
• “Widespread reform movements, many of which began in Britain and were later experienced in other areas of the world, were effective enough that they sparked additional reform movements and eventual action on the part of the government to result in a number of improvements in  workdays, conditions, and protections for laborers.” (Indicates change as a result of the reform movements.)
Demonstrating complex understanding might include any of the
following, if appropriate elaboration is provided:
•
Explaining that nineteenth-century reform movements sometimes
struggled to bring about political change in industrial societies because their
membership frequently consisted of numerous factions that had competing
objectives and advocated for different methods of protest. (Explains nuance,
considers both causes and effects, and qualifies an argument) •
Claiming that reform movements were successful in bringing about social or
political changes in nineteenth-century industrial societies but acknowledging
that many of the reforms that were implemented did not go nearly as far as the reform movements wanted. (Modifies an argument) •
Illustrating that some social or political reforms in industrial societies during
the nineteenth century were enacted partly because they had gained support
from centrist politicians and even laissez-faire economists, such as John
Stuart Mill. (Qualifies an argument) •
Demonstrating how one factor, such as the growth of labor unions, led to the
adoption of labor reform laws in different places for different reasons and
includes a discussion of labor unions as both a causative factor and an effect.
(Corroborates an argument, considers both causes and effects)
Additional Notes:
•
This demonstration of complex understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference.
