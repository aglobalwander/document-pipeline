The IB Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous, academically challenging and bal anced programme of education designed to prepare students aged 16 to 19 for
success at university and in life beyond. The DP aims to encourage students to be
knowledgeable, inquiring, caring and compassionate, and to develop intercultural
understanding, open-mindedness and the attitudes necessary to respect and evalu ate a range of viewpoints.  Approaches to teaching and learning (ATL) within the DP
are deliberate strategies, skills and attitudes that permeate the teaching and learning
environment. In the DP students develop skills from five ATL categories: thinking,
research, social, self-management and communication.
To ensure both breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding, students must
choose at least one subject from five groups: 1) their best language, 2) additional lan guage(s), 3) social sciences, 4) experimental sciences, and 5) mathematics. Students
may choose either an arts subject from group 6, or a second subject from groups
1 to 5. At least three and not more than four subjects are taken at higher level (240
recommended teaching hours), while the remaining are taken at standard level (150
recommended teaching hours). In addition, three core elements—the extended
essay, theory of knowledge and creativity, action, service—
are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.
These IB DP subject briefs illustrate four key course components.

I. Course description and aims
The Diploma Programme design technology course aims to develop
internationally minded people whose enhanced understanding of
design and the technological world can facilitate our shared guardian ship of the planet and create a better world.
Inquiry and problem-solving are at the heart of the subject. DP design
technology requires the use of the design cycle as a tool, which pro vides the methodology used to structure the inquiry and analysis of
problems, the development of feasible solutions, and the testing and
evaluation of the solution. A solution can be defined as a model, proto type, product or system that students have developed independently.
DP design technology achieves a high level of design literacy by
enabling students to develop critical-thinking and design skills, which
they can apply in a practical context. While designing may take various
forms, it will involve the selective application of knowledge within an ethical framework.
Through the overarching theme of the nature of design, the aim of the
DP design technology course is to enable students to develop:
1.	 a sense of curiosity as they acquire the skills necessary for inde pendent and lifelong learning and action through inquiry into the technological world around them
2.	 an ability to explore concepts, ideas and issues with personal, local
and global significance to acquire in-depth knowledge and under standing of design and technology
3.	 initiative in applying thinking skills critically and creatively to identi fy and resolve complex social and technological problems through reasoned ethical decision-making
4.	 an ability to understand and express ideas confidently and crea tively using a variety of communication techniques through col laboration with others
5.	 a propensity to act with integrity and honesty, and take responsi bility for their own actions in designing technological solutions to problems
6.	 an understanding and appreciation of cultures in terms of glob al technological development, seeking and evaluating a range of perspectives
7.	 a willingness to approach unfamiliar situations in an informed man ner and explore new roles, ideas and strategies to confidently artic ulate and defend proposals
8.	 an understanding of the contribution of design and technology to
the promotion of intellectual, physical and emotional balance and the achievement of personal and social well-being
9.	 empathy, compassion and respect for the needs and feelings of
others in order to make a positive difference to the lives of others and to the environment
10.	skills that enable them to reflect on the impacts of design and tech nology on society and the environment in order to develop their
own learning and enhance solutions to technological problems.

The group 4 project
The group 4 project is a collaborative activity where students from dif ferent group 4 subjects, within or between schools, work together. It al lows for concepts and perceptions from across disciplines to be shared
while appreciating the environmental, social and ethical implications
of science and technology. It can be practically or theoretically based
and aims to develop an understanding of the relationships between
scientific disciplines and their influence on other areas. The emphasis is
on interdisciplinary cooperation and the scientific processes.
III. Assessment model
The assessment objectives for design technology reflect those parts
of the aims that will be formally assessed either internally or externally.
Wherever appropriate, the assessment draws upon environmental and
technological contexts and identify the social, moral and economic ef fects of technology. It is the intention of the design technology course
that students are able to fulfill the following assessment objectives:
1.	 Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of:
• facts, concepts, principles and terminology • design methodology and technology
• methods of communicating and presenting technological information.
2.	 Apply and use:
• facts, concepts, principles and terminology • design methodology and technology
• methods of communicating and presenting technological information.
3.	 Construct, analyse and evaluate:
• design briefs, problems, specifications and plans • methods, techniques and products
• data, information and technological explanations.
4.	 Demonstrate the appropriate research, experimentation, model ling and personal skills necessary to carry out innovative, insight ful, ethical and effective designing.
