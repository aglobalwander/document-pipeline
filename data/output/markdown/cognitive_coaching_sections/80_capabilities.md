## Capabilities

These are the metacognitive maps, models, and internal skills that individuals use to guide behavioral choices: when to use, how to use, or not use specific skills sets (Dilts 2003). For example, a prime mental ability for Cognitive Coaches is to set aside un-productive patterns of listening. Relating what the coachee is saying to one's own story directs attention away from the coachee and is unproductive. The richer the mental maps and models, the more understanding about under what condition to use a behavior, ways of assessing the behavior's effectiveness, and processes for self-monitoring. To elegantly perform a behavior

requires accessing the cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains. Mental processes drive behavior through the selection of personal strategies and skills. A person operating at this level of capabilities is thinking about how to achieve something, including what skills she might need to develop to do so. As described in chapter 4, Cognitive Coaches employ four essential internal capabilities to guide and give direction to their behaviors: 1) know one's intentions and choose congruent behaviors;

- 2) set aside unproductive patterns of listening, responding, and inquiring;
- 3) adjust one's own style preferences; and 4) navigate between and within maps and support functions to guide meditational interactions.
