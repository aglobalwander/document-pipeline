How do we cope with such an increasingly 
unpredictable world? To move with the flow of 
change we need to be able to let go of past as-
sumptions and learn to think afresh. As change 
pushes us to make more decisions faster and 
faster, it becomes increasingly important not 
to fall into the trap of rushing our judgments 
or being seduced by the comfort of action. 
Complex problems always have simple solu-
tions—that are usually wrong. Quality deci-
sions require that we slow down and create the 
opportunity for insights and feelings to emerge 
in our awareness. Slowing to think, to inquire, 
to collaborate, to talk together about student 
learning is what biologists call an adaptive trait.
Adaptive traits have a current functional 
role in the life of an organism. In organiza-
tions, these traits maintain, sustain, and evolve 
by becoming normative forces that shape the 
behavior of managers and employees. This is 
not a simple matter, as this new normal requires 
support, monitoring, and indelible connection 
with values. The organization must remain vi-
able at all stages of its development and within 
all phases of environmental change.
On a recent break from working with in-
ternational educators in Mumbai, India, while 
wandering the alleyways and passageways 
of Dharavi, the locale for the movie Slumdog 
Millionaire, we wondered what adaptive traits 
might be keeping this multireligious, multieth-
nic, diverse settlement alive. With nearly one 
million people sardined into five hundred acres, 
these human beings are amazingly resourceful. 
Adaptivity is their essential human quality, en-
abled by self-conscious intelligence modifying 
either the conditions or themselves to such an 
extent that they can live at the extremes. People 
adapt and use their ingenuity and inventiveness 
to survive, but also to find meaning and pur-
pose, and whatever degree of pleasure, even 
happiness, that humans may know.
We also wondered anew about the adaptive 
traits necessary for twenty-first-century schools 
to crest the waves of unrelenting change. From 
the first edition of this book in 1999 until now, 
the essential adaptive traits we have witnessed 
in many settings are the dispositions to in-
quire, to collaborate, and to talk about student 
learning and teachers’ roles in student enlight-

n the blink of a cosmic eye the technological developments from the atom 
bomb, cell phone, Internet, and ingestible cameras for medical research have 
brought profound changes. The individual and cumulative effects of these 
revolutionary developments liberate, endanger, connect, and separate us. Mass 
media, telecommunications, information technology, and artificial intelligence 
are changing our world and our very selves, as they bring us to new starting 
points for human and social development. This is a world in which serious con-
versations among researchers in the field of artificial intelligence urgently ask the 
questions: What is intelligence? What is the mind? Will machines wrest control 
from their human masters?

enment. These traits, and the instruments that 
serve them, have been sustainable and em-
braced internationally now for seventeen years. 
Teaching is a people business, and effective 
schools are settings in which people meet in the 
center of their practice. They meet as humans 
and with the practical and productive tools de-
scribed in this book.
Regarding this third edition we especially 
appreciate the keen editing eyes of Jane Elli-
son, Carolee Hayes, Carolyn McKanders, and 
Wendy Ferguson and the invaluable assistance 
provided by Michael Dolcemascolo in refining 
this new organization and material on facili-
tator moves and strategies. And above all, we 
want to express gratitude to Sue Canavan, 
acquisitions editor and friend, who has guided 
this work through three editions now, and 
whose indefatigable spirit, encouragement, and 
problem-solving abilities have been indispens-
able in making this work available to readers.
We are eternally grateful to the many 
voices that have contributed to our learning, 
from schools around the world, from col-
leagues at Thinking Collaborative, and from 
the emerging research and knowledge in our 
profession. We remain committed to the notion 
that adaptation is a process requiring relatively 
small changes over time and those changes 
begin with us.

his edition of The Adaptive School represents much of our learning about 
school systems and groups in the past twenty years as we have worked 
with educators in settings that span the globe. Although each school is 
unique, there are social patterns that are easily recognizable when people gather in 
groups to work together. Drawing on these experiences and looking at group work 
through the theoretical filters of biology, ecology, quantum physics, complexity 
science, systems thinking, and cognitive and social psychology, we offer a practi-
cal set of principles and tools for developing and facilitating collaborative groups.
Introduction
The Adaptive School is about develop-
ing strong groups and schools in which col-
laborative faculties are capable of meeting 
the uncertain challenges of tomorrow. Some 
schools are flourishing. Others are making 
remarkable gains in improving student achieve-
ment, increasing attendance, attaining higher 
post-school accomplishments, and developing 
satisfying relationships with their communities. 
Some schools produce only fair results; others 
languish. We believe that all can be better.
As realists, we recognize that difficult 
and different challenges beset schools and 
communities in their quest to serve students. 
Issues differ from school to school. Urbanism 
and ruralism bring their own special problems. 
Defeatism, extremism, apathy, or politics infect 
some schools. Schools can become obsessed 
with ensuring predictable results or they can 
struggle to overcome the effects of extreme 
poverty, neglected children, or the burdens of 
ponderous bureaucracy. Money can bring its 
own problems. Some affluent communities 
lobby for traditional definitions of success at 
the expense of other needs. In some districts, 
the teachers and students struggle daily with in-
adequate and outdated materials and facilities. 
In some settings, faculty turnover is so frequent 
it is difficult to maintain a collaborative core. 
Regardless of the nature of the issues, it is our 
premise that the means for improvement exist 
within the school community. The practical 
ideas in this book show how to activate these 
resources if they are dormant and focus them if 
they are scattered.
We believe that leadership is important, 
and that the most effective leadership is widely 
distributed, informed, and deeply developed. 
To be adaptive and meet the demands of om-
nipresent change requires more than linear 
thought, old problem-solving formulas, and 
recycled strategic plans. In the work of school 
improvement, human energy matters as much 
as the elements of good management do—
maybe more.
How to Use This Book
This book is informed by the central no-
tion of adaptivity, five principles of complex 
systems, and focusing questions that bring 
attention to the fundamental issues of capacity 
building in schools. (See sidebar.) These ideas 
are initially introduced in part I and elaborated 
in the remaining chapters. They form the con-
ceptual backbone of the chapters and provide a

rationale for the tools and approaches that we 
present.
The book is designed as a sourcebook to 
support you in developing and facilitating col-
laborative groups to improve student learning. 
You can use it as a basic text for yourself or 
with a study group and as a reference book for 
diagnosis and problem solving. We encourage 
you to choose the approaches that best serve 
your interests and needs.
Read from the beginning to the end. The 
chapter content is designed sequentially, with 
each chapter building on the preceding ones.
Check the table of contents for an issue of 
specific interest and read that chapter. It will 
provide references to other chapters.

(table I.1) to search the text for information 
about specific problems.
A major section of this book is the tool-
kit of facilitator moves and strategies, which 
makes up appendix A. Appendix I offers a 
self-assessment device from which every meet-
ing can be improved.

In all the chaos there is a cosmos, in all 
disorder, a secret order.
—Carl Jung, 1955
School reform has been a topic of study for 
much of the history of formal schooling. These 
generations of inquiry continue to influence 
present practices in both productive and, in many 
cases, nonproductive ways. Traditional views 
and linear designs for organizing learning limit 
our ability to see schools as complex systems of 
interacting parts, each influencing the others.
This opening section of the book reveals 
a glimpse of the patterns and emerging evo-
lution of thinking related to significant human 
achievements, including the education of chil-
dren and youth. We make the case that clock-
work thinking has driven most organizational 
innovation, especially in the ways reformers 
think about school change. These habits of 
technical thought guided the exploration of the 
ancient world and even now the exploration 
of space. We propose that newer sciences are 
revealing a fresh way of thinking about com-
plex organizations, including schools, and offer 
promise for working with the perennial chal-
lenges in schooling. Here we offer a definition 
of adaptivity, explore its importance to educa-
tion, and present a short version of how groups 
operate with it as a driving principle.
Here we provide a brief history of school 
improvement efforts. Our thinking is informed 
by constructivist psychology, quantum me-
chanics, complexity theory, fractal geometry, 
evolutionary biology, and systems thinking 
as new ways of looking at schools. Here we 
address several issues: Why adaptivity is im-
portant to schools, what adaptive leaders do 
to support sustainable change, and what both 
formal and informal leaders can do to support 
adaptivity in their schools.
We also explore the limits of traditional 
leadership and comment on emerging under-
standings of the role of the adaptive leader.
PART I	
ADAPTIVITY


3
A
n adaptive school is neither a place, nor a program, neither a leader nor a 
structure. Rather, it is the application of two lenses, one for “things” and 
one for “energy” to examine learning and the organic systems in which it 
thrives. Central to these lenses is a dual focus held by leaders—leaders not just in 
the traditional sense of assigned authority, but including those passionate enough to 
step forward and lead from any role when conditions favor such emergence. These 
dual perspectives might be found in a grade-level group, a department, a cross 
disciplinary team, a school, or an entire district. The lens for “thing” focuses on 
the basic stuff of good management. “Thing” ways of seeing and working get the 
details handled, the bills paid, and the buses running on time and making the right 
stops in the right neighborhoods. “Thing” thinking is the historical foundation of 
management systems in modern organizations.
Chapter 1	
What is an Adaptive School?
The second leadership perspective focuses 
on energy. Margaret Wheatley (1992) observed 
that the quality of human relationships creates 
the energy that produces work. This inter-
dependence, noted by Wheatley, studied by 
Louis, Marks, and S. Kruse (1996) and exam-
ined in high performing groups by Woolley 
and colleagues (2010) is an essential energy 
for school success. Other important energies 
are the energies of commitment, will, efficacy, 
craftsmanship, consciousness, and others. With 
the additional lenses explored in this book, 
leaders in all roles can identify, enhance, and 
concentrate these energies on the moral mis-
sion of schools.
The revolution in physics called quan-
tum mechanics clarifies the essential distinc-
tions between matter and energy and simul-
taneously blurs the line between them. The 
very term quantum mechanics means bundles 
of energy (quantum) in motion (mechanics) 
(Capra, 1991). This book describes ways to 
shape this energy through the liberating struc-
tures of collaborative norms, well-organized 
meetings, new frames for conflict, and com-
munication practices that make a difference 
for student learning.
As Richard Elmore (1995) reminds us, 
the real work of changing schools lies not 
in changing things, but in changing norms, 
knowledge, and skills (energy) at the individ-
ual and organizational levels. In fact, without 
new norms, knowledge, and skills, structural 
changes such as block scheduling, site-based 
decision-making, multiage classrooms, and in-
clusive classrooms will have little or no effect 
on student learning.
In adaptive organizations, leaders pay at-
tention to both things and energy and to the 
flow and interchange of energy and informa-
tion. Energy becomes an avenue to attainment. 
We will expand on this idea in chapter 3 with 
descriptions of four leadership roles, in chapter 
8 with an elaboration on the role of facilitator,

and in chapter 10, in which we will describe 
five invisible sources of high performance.
Adaptive, Not Adapted
Evolutionary biology is the source for a 
central notion in our work: adaptivity. To be 
adaptive means to change form in concert with 
clarifying identity. This is quite different from 
being adapted, which means to have evolved 
through specialization to fit specific conditions 
within tightly defined boundaries.
Monarch butterflies are a good example of 
an adapted species. As we write this, the mon-
arch has been added to the endangered species 
list. Across North America, the summer fields 
sparkle with their flight. Monarchs, as most 
schoolchildren learn, lay their eggs only on 
milkweed plants. When the larvae hatch, they 
feed on the milkweed leaves, growing and de-
veloping until it is time to spin a chrysalis that 
is attached to the milkweed plant. The larvae 
metamorphose into adult butterflies, and the 
cycle repeats. Without milkweed there would 
be no monarchs. The monarch’s nutritional 
and habitat needs are firmly adapted to this 
one type of plant.
An example of adaptivity within a species 
can be found on another continent. As prima-
tologists study the social lives of chimpanzee 
groups, they discover a remarkable range of 
behaviors within individuals and within popu-
lations that are isolated from one another. They 
are now using the term culture to describe vari-
ations in food-gathering techniques that include 
prepositioning hammer stones for cracking nuts 
in anticipation of ripening, using grass stalks as 
tools to fish termites from holes, and sharpening 
sticks to use as thrusting spears when hunting 
small monkeys. These cultural variations spread 
through local populations and to the next gener-
ation but remain unique to a given region.
Organizations, like species, also need to 
contend with adapting to changing environ-
ments. This usually means letting go of existing 
forms and continually clarifying the core iden-
tity of the enterprise. As we write this volume, 
the United States Post Office is struggling for 
relevancy. Years of deficit budgets have coin-
cided with changes in the ways people com-
municate. E-mails, texts, Twitter, Skype calls, 
and other digital innovations have eroded the 
Post Office’s dominance in the communication 
field. Today, they are reasserting their place 
in the economy with a change in form, and in 
identity. “Our former identity,” an official told 
us, “was connecting people. You write your 
grandmother a letter. In a couple of days she 
gets it. Today people have all these other ways 
of connecting. So our emerging identity is con-
necting goods. We are cheaper than FedEx or 
UPS and are the delivery service for Amazon.” 
The Post Office is changing its form, eliminat-
ing a fleet of planes, handling more packages 
than letters, with big-brother data everywhere 
clocking the time people spend in line, and how 
long it takes a driver to get out of the truck at 
a stop. “FedEx drivers,” he told us, “are disci-
plined if they spend too much time backing up” 
because studies show backing is less efficient 
than moving forward.
One of the most significant changes in 
form and identity in schools has been the rel-
atively recent transformation of the role of the 
school librarian. This was first brought to our 
attention several years ago at a seminar we 
were conducting, when a participant stopped 
by at a break to share her struggles with this 
issue. As the head librarian for a medium-sized 
school district, she described all of the profes-
sional changes she had experienced since com-
pleting her master’s degree in library science in 
the early 1970s. As a supervisor, she supported 
several librarians who were also struggling 
with similar changes. She noted that as librari-
ans they were taught to be quality filters and to 
stock the shelves with reliable and authoritative 
reference materials. When students and teach-
ers asked for resources, the librarians were able 
to supply the best sources available and took 
professional pride in knowing and having these 
materials on hand.

What is an Adaptive School?	
Chapter 1

As students and teachers became increas-
ingly computer savvy, the librarians began 
feeling devalued. The budget for reference 
materials switched to online resources, and 
the librarians became concerned about the 
quality of the information that students and 
teachers access through Google and Wiki-
pedia, and other searchable sources. Being a 
quality filter was a role that gave the librarians 
pride in their work. They have found that they 
now have to be teachers of quality filtering. 
The deep transition is therefore not a change 
in the knowledge base of librarians, but in the 
ways that they apply their knowledge within 
their new identities.
All around us we see examples like this. 
As Internet-based courses for students become 
common, what it means to be a teacher and to 
have a class will dramatically shift. What it 
means to be a student is changing. The very 
concept of the schoolhouse may increasingly 
be seen as a historical artifact rather than a 
current reality.
Voice-recognition software, coupled with 
high bandwidth, cheap digital storage, and 
artificial intelligence, will most likely dra-
matically change the teaching of foreign lan-
guages. It is not hard to imagine digital envi-
ronments in which students or their avatars 
interact with native speakers of the language 
they are learning. The scenes will come com-
plete with full cultural settings, appropriate 
body language and nonverbal messages, and 
an oscilloscope-like readout displaying the 
voice inflections of the native speaker com-
pared to the voice inflections of the novice 
learner. Conversations can be repeated with 
this patient tutor until they are fully mas-
tered. In such an environment the form of 
specialty teacher of one language is replaced 
by the identity of master of second-language 
learning. This identity is accompanied by the 
elements of designer, motivator, manager, 
and clinician. The number of languages to be 
taught is limited not by personnel, but by the 
availability of software and hardware.
Table 1.1 sums up the relationship between 
form and identity in several examples.
The great challenge for schools is to let go 
of the comforts and routines of adapted behav-
iors and to develop the patterns and practices 
of adaptivity. The demographic, technological, 
economic, environmental, social, and political 
pressures driving our rapidly changing world 
make this necessary. This is especially true in 
climates in which the metaphorical milkweed 
might not live forever. Adaptivity consists of 
informed inquiry leading to flexible responses 
interacting with changing environmental condi-
tions. This is true for individuals, species, and 
organizations. It requires a clear identity and a 
lack of attachment to form.

Why Adaptivity Matters  
to Schools
To address this question we must first ad-
dress the differences between technical change 
(fixing an ordinary problem without altering 
the system) and adaptive change (fixing a 
problem by disrupting the system), for in truth, 
adaptivity matters when one’s goal is sustain-
able change. Educational literature is replete 
with dramatic stories of change; a heroic prin-
cipal turns around an underperforming school, 
a superintendent promotes reforms that raise 
the test scores in a middle-class district, a spe-
cial ed director causes improvements in math 
scores for students whose teachers she directs. 
Inevitably, these dramatic accounts of progress 
realized by treating adaptive challenges as 
technical ones reverse course, and gains made 
during a brief period of charismatic attention 
return to a status quo.
Sustainable change is, of course, an oxy-
moron unless it is understood that healthy 
change efforts include a period of refinement 
and revision as educators seek to bring the 
changes into alignment with best possible 
benefits for students. Mutation monitoring is 
a process in which leaders monitor application 
practices that differ from the adopted innova-
tion, eliminate those that interfere with pro-
gram fidelity, and expand on those that provide 
better mechanisms to achieve program goals.
Sustainable change is driven by moral 
clarity, only possible with adaptive approaches, 
and only realized when identity is clear. CVS 
Pharmacy is changing its name to CVS Health 
as it shifts its emphasis to promote health in 
line with its emerging identity. It is banning 
cigarette sales from its stores and, as reported 
by Hakim at the New York Times (2015), re-
cently resigning from the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce because of that institution’s position 
against antismoking laws.
Using Fresh Lenses  
and New Skills
Technical challenges, differ from adaptive 
ones in that the problems are easy to identify, 
may lead to quick and easy solutions, can some-
times be solved by edict, and rarely address the 
root causes of problems. Adaptive change, how-
ever, requires a systems view, asks for changes 
in values, is difficult to identify, easy to deny, 
requires altering numerous arenas within the 
organization, needs people with the problem to 
resolve it, and requires experimental thinking. 
In the medical field, if high blood pressure is the 
problem, taking blood pressure medicine is an 
example of technical change while moving to a 
healthier lifestyle would be a more adaptive ap-
proach. Managing schools calls for both kinds of 
change. Examples of problems requiring tech-
nical change are altering bus routings to reduce 
time students are in transit, improving the win 
record of a high school sports team, or changing 
the start times of school even with the resulting 
challenges this brings to other aspects of the 
program such as student schedules, after-school 
work opportunities, and athletic practices. Send-
ing a person to the moon and performing open-
heart surgery are often offered as examples of 
complicated problems needing technical change 
and linear reasoning.
In contrast adaptive changes require non-
linear thought, attention to an ever-changing 
environment, ownership of the problem by 
the people closest to it, fearless inquiry, and 
addressing values conflicts. In schools, im-
proving the reading performance of primary 
students, achieving a student body committed 
to inquiry, or eliminating bullying requires 
adaptive change.
The same problem can be viewed from ei-
ther lens. One school confronting the challenge 
of receiving a passing mark on a tenth-grade 
state literacy test focused its remedial efforts 

What is an Adaptive School?	
Chapter 1

on boosting the achievement of students who 
were falling just below a failing grade. Another 
school facing the same situation concentrated 
its efforts on improving literacy for all students 
for the long run. Teachers worked together to 
improve their practices and engaged the com-
munity with a full month emphasis on literacy 
skills. In the second school, results for the first 
year were not dramatic, but by the third year the 
school had become the district’s second-highest 
scoring school (Hargreaves and Fink, 2004). In 
the first example, the school treated an adaptive 
challenge as a technical one and got quick but 
nonsustainable change.
One emerging, messy issue for schools 
that requires adaptive change is that a sus-
tained emphasis on information and commu-
nication technologies has significantly influ-
enced students and their school experience. 
At a restaurant the other night we watched a 
three-year-old competently manage an iPod. 
Ian Jukes (2006) notes that kids’ brains are 
being changed because of intense sustained 
experience (seven days a week, several hours 
a day) with the digital world. Some observe 
that the average working memory space might 
be less today than when we were students.

The Peripatetic Pivot Point
Successful sea captains must apply adaptive competence, explains P. F. Willteron in 
Basic Ship Handling for Master, Mates and Pilots (1980). There is no formula for ship han-
dling, but an array of forces that must be monitored lest the captain be caught off guard. Tide, 
displacement, wind, and current can all cause a ship to pivot, and the captain must be able to 
anticipate these forces and tap into learning from past experience in order to skillfully move 
the vessel forward.
The tricky thing about the pivot point is that the location of the pivot point changes from 
moment to moment because the location of the pivot point of a boat that is underway depends 
on how or even whether the boat is already moving relative to the water that it is in contact 
with at that moment.
Added to the complexity of ship handling is the reality that ships do not have brakes. An 
anchor helps when a ship is moving slowly, but a ship can still move forward even with its 
anchor dropped. This increases the importance of monitoring forces, as well as how forces in-
teract with one another. For example, given that part of the vessel is underwater, if the current 
is moving faster than the wind, the water will exert more force than the air. This knowledge 
of which forces are exerting the most impact informs the captain’s decision-making regarding 
steering and adjustments.
Schools are much like ships, requiring monitoring forces rather than following a formula. 
Anchorage District principal Deanna Beck (Lt. Commander, U.S. Coast Guard Reserve) told 
us how she prioritizes forces as a leader. “It depends on your speed,” she replied. If you’re 
going fast you’ll have to pay attention to what will have the biggest impact on your vessel and 
what else is going on in the environment. When coming into San Francisco Bay, for example, 
she first makes note of anything nearby such as trees or buildings, then figures out how fast 
she’s going. With that collective information she can determine whether the wind or water is 
having more force, and how to adapt accordingly (Beck, 2015; Whiteley, 2015).

Schools Are Complex Systems

From Different Disciplines  
Come These Synonyms
Nonlinear 
Complex 
Dynamical
Beyond the issues of sustainability, and a 
rapidly changing environment, another reason 
adaptivity is important is that schools are com-
plex systems, and, while it is not possible to 
change such systems, it is possible to disturb 
them. A complex system is one in which tiny 
events cause major disturbances (the butterfly 
effect in meteorology or the paraphrase in 
social systems); everything affects everything 
else (on days when David is absent, everything 
goes better in class); you don’t have to touch 
everyone to make a difference (six teachers 
changed the work culture of an entire school by 
being publicly polite in public places); and both 
things and energy matter (while things like new 
books are important, more important are effort, 
caring, and commitment).
Complicated systems, on the other hand, 
lack the interactive characteristics of complex 
ones and can be changed through edict and 
linear logic. Performing brain surgery is an 
example of working in a complicated system. 
Managing a marriage represents a complex 
system challenge (Cuban, 2010; Garmston and 
Wellman, 2013).
Schools are nonlinear systems in which 
cause and effect are not tightly linked. In non-
linear systems, the parts do not add up to the 
same sum each time they are combined. Fresh 
combinations result in different outcomes. For 
teachers, the curriculum combines with in-
structional and assessment practices to support 
student learning. Yet every school year turns 
out differently as the pedagogical mix blends 
with a new crop of students.
A blend of regularity and irregularity 
shapes nonlinear systems, producing patterns 
of stability and instability. Critical choice 
points present new possibilities and new 
forms of order. Instability permits creative 
life in school systems. The self-organizing 
interactions between people develop feedback 
loops that recur and amplify across the scale 
of the organization. Changes in such systems 
may be unexpected.
Self-organization develops through mean-
ingful adult interactions about students, stu-
dent work, and the purposes and processes of 
schooling. To be productive, such interactions 
must be infused with and guided by shared 
values and norms of collaboration. The envi-
ronment must encourage reflection, inquiry, 
challenge, and deprivatization of practice for 
both teachers and administrators. This in turn 
requires skills in dialogue, discussion, plan-
ning, and problem solving. At times the work

is messy and nonrational. Habitual, linear ways 
of thinking will work for some issues but not 
for the increasingly complex and ill-structured 
problems that beset many schools today.
Principles of Complex or 
Dynamical System Change
In the early 1950s a trucking magnate 
named Malcolm McLean and his colleagues 
began the process that produced the ship-
ping-container industry that we know today, 
revolutionizing costs as cargo handling at ei-
ther end of the voyage produced as much 
as 50 percent of the costs of moving goods 
(Levinson, 2006). McLean was not limited by 
the identity of being a trucker. He realized that 
he was in the moving goods business and that 
trucks, trains, and ships could work in harmony 
to move material if that material was placed 
in uniform-sized containers and a supporting 
infrastructure facilitated the rapid deployment 
of these containers across the globe.
His innovations rapidly reduced the costs 
of moving goods and negated the need to have 
sources of production and storage close to ports. 
The waterfronts of the world swiftly shed manu-
facturing industries, and warehouses were trans-
formed into high-status housing and recreation 
areas in many locales. In 1964 the five boroughs 
of New York City were home to manufacturing 
concerns that employed nearly 900,000 workers. 
By the mid-1970s more than one-third of those 
jobs were gone. Cheap transportation motivated 
the search for cheaper labor and lower manufac-
turing costs. Distance was no longer an obstacle 
to commerce. This example illuminates five un-
derlying principles, described below, that guide 
adaptive systems such as the shipping industry, 
weather systems, and schools.
1.	
More data do not lead to better predic-
tions. Malcom McLean did not need to 
know all the economic data points about 
the industries that were his customers. He 
merely needed sufficient data about his 
own business and the appropriate metrics 
to guide his business plans. Meteorologists 
have more data than at any time in his-
tory, yet their radars and computer models 
lose meaning beyond a four-day window. 
Many schools we work with are data-rich 
and meaning-poor. They collect endless 
surveys and pore over spreadsheets but 
don’t take the time to dialogue and make 
meaning from their experiences and the 
knowledge they have within them.
2.	
Everything influences everything else. The 
rise of the shipping container made the 
economic boom possible both in Asia and 
for Wal-Mart and other big-box discount 
stores. These forces have fueled growing 
prosperity as well as environmental dam-
age across the globe. In weather systems, 
temperature changes affect wind patterns, 
which affect precipitation patterns, which 
in turn influence climate changes, includ-
ing droughts and floods. In schools, the 
affective climate of the building and class-
rooms influence how adults feel about 
their work, the energy they invest, and the 
academic results for students.
3.	
Tiny events create major disturbances. 
Putting a stack of boxes in and on ships 
is in many ways a tiny event. Yet this 
simple revolution has changed economies 
throughout the world, changed labor rela-
tions by making loading ships highly tech-
nical skilled work, and changed the bal-
ance of power as emerging countries flex 
their new financial and political muscles. 
As tropical storms develop off the coast of 
the African continent and swing across the 
Atlantic Ocean and into the Caribbean Sea, 
encountering water that is as little as one-
fourth degree warmer tips the storm into a 
raging hurricane. In collaborative groups, 
a participant who is skilled in paraphras-
ing and inquiry opens up the thinking of 
others and deepens the meaning that these 
conversations produce.

tem to make a difference. Malcom Mclean

didn’t have to run around the globe and get 
all the policymakers and decision makers 
in place and on board before starting his 
venture. He designed some sturdy boxes, 
converted some old tanker ships, and built 
some special cranes at the sending and 
receiving ports. The rest of the system 
responded over time to these innovations. 
Weather systems affect behaviors by their 
mere presence. Whether these systems 
are hot or cold, wet or dry, environments 
and organisms respond to these influences 
without the right to vote. In the same way, 
a school culture shapes the behavior of 
its members. That is why school cultures 
are so tenacious in the face of personnel 
changes. The real work of school improve-
ment, then, is the work of “reculturing” by 
shaping the norms, beliefs, and values of 
those cultures. We’ve consulted with sev-
eral international schools on this for whom 
this is a special challenge.
5.	
Both things and energy matter. Ships, 
boxes, cranes, trucks, and trains are all 
things. They have to work together in a 
timely fashion to move the goods that 
move the economy. They also represent 
the energy of commerce—the innovating, 
buying, selling, and improving of products 
that engage human minds and imagina-
tions. Wind, sun, and rain are all tangible 
phenomena, but it is the energy they con-
tain and transmit that moves windmills, 
sprouts plants, and produces waterfalls. 
Schools require books and bells, halls and 
balls, but again it is the energy of caring 
and commitment that moves minds and 
produces learning.
How Schools Become Adaptive
So far we have discussed the importance of 
adaptivity and the need to clarify identity, both 
as individuals and as organizations, without 
clinging to outmoded forms. We’ve suggested 
a rationale for why this is important by framing 
schools as nonlinear, complex, dynamical sys-
tems in which cause-and-effect linkages are not 
so easily drawn. We will now briefly describe 
how schools can achieve this. The chapters that 
follow will expand, elaborate on, and share 
many of the concrete tools we have learned to 
use from our work with successful schools.
For readers that prefer to see the big pic-
ture, figure 1.1 gives an overview of concepts 
that follow in this book.
A Short Course in Adaptivity: 
Focusing Questions
We encourage departments, committees, 
councils, and faculties to reflect frequently on 
three focusing questions: (a) Who are we? (b) 
Why are we doing this? and (c) Why are we do-
ing this this way? The byproduct of this reflec-
tion is action for improving student learning.
Who Are We?
Principal Kathy Dunton of Vine Hills Ele-
mentary School in California told us that these 
three questions transformed her school. She 
encourages teachers and parents to ask them 
frequently and to explore them in depth. The 
question “Who are we?” leads directly to the 
issue of identity. This issue forces the related 
questions of “About what do we care?” and 
“How much do we dare?” The form taken by a 
school, team, department, or teacher’s assign-
ment is less important than identity. Identity 
represents the story that a group tells itself 
to organize its values and beliefs. A group’s 
beliefs determine its behavior. Collectively, its 
behavior affects student learning (Dilts, 1994). 
(See chapter 10.)
Identity cannot be found in a mission 
statement. It displays itself in hallways, faculty 
lounges, meeting minutes, and student aca-
demic results. Identity reveals itself in periods 
of stress: What a group strives to preserve or 
fights to protect describes its identity. The very 
definitions of success, the awards and rewards

for both students and staff members, symbolize 
driving values and beliefs.
Why Are We Doing This?
Folk wisdom, tradition, and unexamined 
habit rule much of what schools do. The 
agricultural calendar, factory schedules, and 
athletic practices continue to frame yearly 
and daily time use. Bus schedules and teacher 
contracts exert powerful and often unexamined 
influences on student learning. Yet these and 
other features of school life go unquestioned. 
“It’s just the way we do things around here,” 
one is told when bold enough to inquire.
A classic story captures the essence of this 
issue. A little girl, watching her mother prepare 
a ham for the oven, wanted to know why her 
mommy was cutting the end off before placing 
it in the roasting pan. “I don’t really know,” her 
mother replied, “That’s the way my mommy 
did it.”
So the little girl went to see her grand-
mother and asked her why she cut the end of 
the ham off before putting it in the roasting pan. 
“I don’t really know,” her grandmother replied, 
“That’s the way my mommy did it.”
So the little girl went to see her great-grand-
mother and asked her why she cut the end of 
the ham off before putting it in the roasting pan. 
“Well,” the old woman explained, stretching 
her arms wide, “I grew up on the prairie in a 
little sod house, and our hams were this big.” 
Bringing her hands closer together, she con-
cluded, “And our oven was this big. We had 
to cut the end off the ham to fit it in the oven.”
In many settings, educators continue to 
“cut the end off the ham” long after the origi-
nal rationale has passed. The deep structure of 
schooling is set on foundations of “hams and 
end scraps” from earlier eras. Unquestioned 
assumptions form the “ovens” in which they 
“cook.” Many current practices are rooted in 
beliefs about the need for power and control 
over others and over resources (Sarason, 1990). 
Such beliefs were at the heart of the manage-
ment literature during most of the 1800s and 
1900s. They are the source of conflicts over 
curriculum and at the center of most tensions 
around any form of shared decision making. 
The question “Why are we doing this?” brings 
attention and choice to practices that have be-
come unquestioned habits.
Why Are We Doing This This Way?
The “this” that we are doing could be 
grouping students for instruction, developing 
learning experiences, or deciding time allot-
ments for activities. This last question, valued 
so highly by California principal Kathy Dun-
ton, brings focus not to the what and why of 
the activity but to the how. Walk through any 
school with a notebook in hand, because this 
question will have you scribbling rapidly.
The daily schedule is a good starting 
point. Anyone who has observed the sleeping 
and waking patterns of adolescents knows 
that 8:00 a.m. is not peak time for anything 
not conducted in a prone position, yet district 
schedules organized by transportation patterns 
typically have high schools starting around that 
hour. On the other hand, many five- and six-
year-olds are up and bustling, ready to get on 
with the new day. Schools might, in fact, have 
the daily time schedule for the various levels of 
schooling in reverse order from what would be 
a better fit with physical development patterns.
The question “Why are we doing this this 
way?” could be restated, as “Who benefits from 
the current system?” Exploring this form of the 
question provides insight into the forces that 
keep current practices in place. As Kathy Dun-
ton found, these three focusing questions open 
up new ways of seeing school practices. Once 
revealed, they can be acted on and modified. 
Left unexamined, they keep the institutional 
drivers on autopilot and the “map” stuffed in 
the “glove compartment.”

place in it. The Aboriginal people of Australia 
believe that their land is covered with a web of 
invisible pathways. These “dreaming-tracks” or 
“songlines” first appeared during the Tjukurpa 
(djook-oor-pah) or “Dreamtime,” when an-
cestral beings wandered over the featureless 
landscape, singing the world into existence. 
These totemic ancestors sang out the name of 
everything that crossed their path. They sang 
out the names of plants, animals, rocks, rivers, 
salt pans, and waterholes, coding and wrapping 
the world in a web of song (Chatwin, 1987).
When an Aboriginal mother is pregnant 
and feels the baby kick for the first time, she 
calls the shaman to identify that child’s totemic 
spirit guide. Physical features at the site of 
the kick are then interpreted, and the spirit of 
the child—the child’s “dreaming”—is thus 
identified. This dreaming can be one of any 
number of mammals, insects, birds, or reptiles. 
As the child grows, he or she learns the song 
of this spirit guide. Coded into the song are 
the features of the local landscape—where to 
find food, water, shelter, and safe travel routes. 
Song is the oldest mnemonic device, far easier 
for a nomad to carry than any road atlas.
An Aborigine who goes “walkabout” on 
a journey of discovery or on a hunting foray 
calls on this song to guide him or her. Along 
one’s “songline,” one has safe passage, meeting 
others who share the dreaming along the way. 
Memory carries the traveler to the limits of the 
song. At the boundaries Aborigines meet and, 
through ritual, swap songs. This sharing rela-
tionship extends the territory of each and binds 
one to another through song.
To find new territory and new routes, we 
all need to learn new songs. This earth and its 
workings are not as we were once taught. At the 
limits of our songs, we need one another so that 
we can be adaptive in a world made of bundles 
of energy in motion.

W
hen pioneering navigators first sailed from the coasts of Asia, Africa, 
and Europe, they were guided by their dreams, the stars, and primitive 
compasses—sailing into territories marked on their fanciful charts as 
unknown lands and seas of mystery. Undoubtedly many in the ships’ crews cast 
apprehensive glances at familiar receding shores, trusting in the soundness of their 
vessel and the courage and skills of their leaders. Their affects were legion: some 
were destructive, decimating indigenous cultures and native ecologies; others were 
constructive, made possible by the forces of technical change, the same forces that 
propelled a satellite in a flyby of the dwarf planet Pluto in July 2015.
Chapter 2	
The Context
Their tools, by today’s standards were 
primitive: the compass, the sextant, the quad-
rant to measure the altitude and angle of 
celestial bodies, and primitive maps of the 
world and its seas. Incredibly, the same class 
of scientific thinking, admittedly more so-
phisticated, directed the twenty-first-century 
spacecraft passing Pluto, sending images back 
over three billon miles from its nine-and-a-
half-year journey. This form of thinking has 
also governed approaches to school change 
for hundreds of years. It was present in the 
early life of kindergartens in 1900, the intro-
duction of “scientific management” during the 
period 1900 to 1925, an approach introduced 
in industry by Francis Taylor. Scientific man-
agement promoted the virtues of efficiency 
and time management.
Taylor’s educational followers saw teach-
ers as workers requiring direct supervision to 
meet predetermined goals. Edward Thorndike, 
another researcher committed to efficiency, 
introduced standardized testing, including in-
telligence testing adopted by the U.S. Army 
beginning in 1900. In 1948 one of these authors 
graduated eighth grade, the same year the Na-
tional Commission on School District Reorga-
nization proposed to eliminate the one-room 
schoolhouses, thereby reducing the country’s 
115,000 districts to five thousand.
Efforts to study and improve curriculum 
were launched by twenty men in 1930, eventu-
ally leading to the formation of the Association 
of Supervision and Curriculum Development, 
still a dominant force in staff development. 
Major attempts to reform secondary education 
occurred during the period 1933 to 1941. Ac-
cording to Tyack and Cuban (1995) this “Eight 
Year Study” allowed students to attend courses 
that crossed departmental boundaries. The first 
“In Service Workshops” emerged during this 
era. The effects of the Eight Year Study de-
clined as reformers responding to the perceived 
threats of World War II and the Cold War 
advocated for more authoritarianism in school 
organizations. Technical thinking drove efforts 
in innovation throughout the period from 1930 
into the 1950s. Later, during the 1980s and 
1990s the effective schools research led to lists, 
inventories, and an emphasis on behaviorist 
psychology with rewards and sanctions as the 
means to school improvement.

The Adaptive School
16
The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 
(NCLB) perpetuated this same line of think-
ing in school reform. Insensitive to schools as 
systems, NCLB spawned unintended results; 
the vast majority of schools “increased time 
for reading and math while decreasing time 
for social studies, science, art, music and even 
recess” (Goldstein, 2014). In many regions 
teacher pay was linked to student test scores, 
as parent and teacher revolts erupted over ex-
cessive testing. The debates on testing in this 
country were not unusual as Goldstein (2014) 
accounts in her history of education, conclud-
ing that no other profession operates under the 
same level of political scrutiny. Educational 
change has been a battlefield since the early 
1800s and, at the present time, public school 
teaching has become one of the most contro-
versial professions in America. Opposing a 
business orientation to schools, Sergiovanni 
(1994) famously said, “Schools are not fast 
food chains or armies.” Rather, they are more 
like families and religious organizations in 
respect to culture, mission, and personnel than 
like corporations. Educators are interdependent 
groups regarding knowledge as fluid, provi-
sional, and subject to improvement. Schools 
are ultimately moral organizations and become 
increasingly so when they replace talking at or 
to one another with true conversations.
By 1925 a human relations orientation 
had emerged in opposition to the scientific 
movement of the times. Teachers and admin-
istrators were advised to be more democratic 
in their treatment of others. This form of edu-
cational philosophy, never completely absent 
since then, became measurable in the latter part 
of the twentieth century. Researchers began 
exploring other ways of understanding school 
change, leading to efforts that, while having a 
humanistic bent, were still “technical” in their 
implementation efforts. The RAND change-
agent study in the late 1970s revealed three 
principles of school change that are still sound: 
(a) the importance of staff efficacy; (b) the re-
lated value of participation in decision-making; 
and (c) the necessity for the simultaneity of 
both bottom-up and top-down change efforts 
(McLaughlin, 1990).
This was followed by the meta-analysis of 
school improvement designs by such authors as 
Mathew Miles (1984), Richard Elmore (1990), 
Seymour Sarason (1990), Larry Cuban, and 
Michael Fullan that informed further change 
efforts as they drew on knowledge emerging 
from the field of organizational development. 
Researchers recruited from Xerox and the uni-
versities of Stanford and Berkeley, representing 
the disciplines of anthropology, computer sci-
ence, education, psychology, and linguistics, 
formed an educational think tank, the Institute 
for Research on Learning (IRL) that operated 
from 1986 to 2000. The IRL contributed to a 
social approach to learning expressed in the 
“Seven Principles” of learning and the idea of 
communities practice. Their work represented a 
break from what we are calling technical think-
ing, to understanding change through a more 
adaptive lens.
In the late twentienth century and the early 
twenty-first century, research began to develop 
around what we will call school energies. These 
included a focus on trust (Bryk and Schneider, 
2002), professional communities learning (Hall 
and Hord, 2001), collaboration (Little, 1990), 
teacher efficacy (Bandura, 1977; Goddard

(Hargreaves and Fullan, 2012; Heifetz, Linsky, 
and Grashow, 2009), neurosciences (Damasio, 
1999; Rizzolatti and Sinigaglia, 2008; Rock,

Today, we enter a new world, personally, 
in education and in the broader environment. 
Innovation, new opportunities, and challenges 
confront us: from fMRI studies of the brain to 
proposals by Amazon to use drones to get prod-
ucts to customers more speedily. Our personal 
and organizational maps for this new world 
are in many ways incomplete. What we most 
need to develop are the mental, emotional, and 
social tools for finding our way in these shift-
ing landscapes. We also need new lenses to see 
the world not as a reflection of ourselves, but 
as images of the many possibilities within the 
human landscape, and to grasp a more complex 
understanding of how change occurs.
New lenses lead to unfamiliar tools that 
help us to see fresh sights, think new thoughts, 
and do new things. For productive school im-
provement efforts, many of these new tools are 
both cognitive and cultural. How we think in-
fluences the ways that we work together. How 
we work together influences the ways that we 
think about that work. This book explores the 
previously unfamiliar lens of adaptivity as it 
relates to improving our schools
Evolutionary forces shaped human brains 
and response systems to meet the demands 
of much earlier times. If a saber-toothed tiger 
were to bound through the door, these systems 
Adaptivity in a Complex System
In the summer of 2015, we witnessed a grey wolf and two grizzly bears maneuvering 
over an elk carcass, brought down that morning by the wolf. What we learned is that the elk 
is an adaptive animal, changing its habits according to environmental conditions. Elk move 
into heavy timber when wolves are around and return to grassy meadow when wolves are 
absent. The return of the grey wolf to Yellowstone National Park triggered a trophic cascade 
among animals and plants (Yellowstone Wolf Project, Annual Report 2013).
In 1995 grey wolves were reintroduced to the park after nearly a seventy-year absence. 
Technical thinking in the 1930s led to the extermination of park wolves, because they were 
believed to be bad for the survival of elk. Elk are also prey for bears and at that time cougars, 
but the culprit focused on by park managers was the grey wolf. With wolves gone and less 
predatory pressure on the elk, herds grew so large as to become unsustainable because of 
insufficient food; many elk grew sick and died as they over-grazed pastures. The park, like 
schools, is an ecosystem in which everything affects everything else. Elk populations grew, 
and without the predatory pressure from wolves, didn’t move around much in the winter, 
instead feeding heavily on aspen, cottonwood plants, and willow. Beavers need willow to 
survive in the winter. Because the elk felt safe from the wolves, giving them no need to move, 
willow were over-browsed leading the beaver population’s decrease to one colony.
Today, with the grey wolf back, elks keep on the move, and healthier willow stands 
enable nine beaver colonies to thrive in the restored habitat. More beavers mean more dams 
and ponds, with multiple effects on stream hydrology. The dams even out the seasonal pulses 
of runoff, store water for recharging the water table, and provide cold, shaded water for fish, 
while newly robust willow stands provide habitat for songbirds. Scavengers that once relied 
on winter-killed elk for food now depend on wolf-killed elk. That benefits ravens, eagles, 
magpies, coyotes, and bears (grizzly and black), especially as the bears emerge hungry from 
hibernation. Wolf kills also affect beetles, wolverine, lynx, and other species.

would immediately trigger a host of chemical, 
physical, and emotional reactions. Modern hu-
mans still possess automatic routines for Pleis-
tocene-era problems and like frogs in warming 
water, can’t sense the change until it is too late.
The fast reflexes that supported our hunting 
and gathering ancestors will not help educators 
develop the forms of schools and schooling that 
we need in this new era. These demands require 
new minds and models that are better suited for 
the challenges of today. Most of all, educators 
need new sensitivities that can discern what is 
not readily apparent to the senses and help to 
craft new ways of improving schools for the 
journey ahead.
Adaptive Leaders
When the task is done, the people will 
say we did it ourselves.
—Lau Tzu, describing the  
best leader (Tzu’s Tao Te Ching,  
c. 500 BC)
Traditional, views of leadership are less and 
less useful given the complexities of our modern 
world. Never-ending reform efforts, ongoing po-
litical challenges to schools, and rapid social and 
technological change strain systems organized 
as hierarchies. At no time has the need for adap-
tivity been so urgent, requiring both protection 
and questioning of the status quo, orchestrating 
conflict to press for richer levels of understand-
ing and action, and developing capacities for 
provocative leadership in all members of an 
organization. As both stability and change are 
needed, the adaptive leader is both a member 
of a group and an observer of the group and its 
environment. Teachers, school and department 
heads, and students can all lead adaptively.
One of the demands of adaptive leadership 
is the need to mobilize people to take on dif-
ficult challenges. Such leadership is grounded 
in the idea that prevailing issues in schools 
are often addressed unsuccessfully because 
of insufficient knowledge, skills, and values 
(Zoller, Lahera, and Noremore, 2015). Adap-
tive leadership activates new perspectives and 
builds on the past, helping people determine 
what is worth preserving and what is produc-
tive to question (Heifetz and Linsky, 2002). 
“Who are we?” “Why are we doing this?” and 
“Why are we doing this, this way?” (chapter 1) 
are potent questions, stimulating adaptivity. As 
such, successful adaptive changes build on the 
past rather than ignoring it making successful 
adaptations both conservative and progressive.
Mobilization includes developing facul-
ties for cultures of inquiry and collaboration. 
Adaptive leaders patiently cultivate the social 
skills of professional capital, by nurturing the 
skills sets for dialogue, discussion, productive 
conflict, and pushing teachers to continually 
explore the relationship between curriculum, 
pedagogy, and student learning. Mobilization, 
too, involves developing in faculties a sense 
of system awareness and discernment between 
technical and adaptive challenges. Technical 
problems are head and shoulders issues, adap-
tive changes are processed lower in the gut 
(Linsky and Zoller, 2015).
Adaptive challenges are issues that, in the 
beginning, others do not recognize as prob-
lems. It is the adaptive leader that brings heat 
to the system, and structures responses in such 
a way that the people who have the problem do 
the work. These leaders sell the problem and 
not the solution.
Because adaptive change is disruptive, 
leaders also support people in navigating the 
change. Rather than resisting change, according 
to Heifetz and Linsky, people resist loss. This is 
congruent with Bridges’s (1980) seminal work 
on transitions in which people inevitably move 
through three psychological zones related to 
change—endings, where loss is profoundly ex-
perienced, a neutral zone of disorientation, and 
finally new beginnings in which leaders focus 
people on the process of achieving outcomes, 
not the outcomes themselves. Because these 
first two are normal reactions to change, and 
because, uninformed, many feel there is some-
thing wrong with them when they experience 

The Context

the emotions of loss and disorientation, the 
adaptive leader helps normalize the processes 
and offers tools for making the psychological 
changes necessary.
We have found these questions useful with 
groups experiencing adaptive change (Garm-
ston, 2004).
•	
What is over and what is not?
•	
What do you value and want to continue? 
As individuals and as a group, what can we 
do to support ourselves through changes?
•	
What are some areas in which we might 
need to tap into our creativity?
•	
What are some areas in which we might 
need to manage the chaos of transition?
•	
If this phase of life for this school looks like 
clouds, what might be some silver linings?
Viewing the system and system change 
from the balcony is an essential trait of leader-
ship. We have watched countless examples of 
skilled quarterbacks, in the middle of the action, 
appear seemingly calm as they scan the field 
looking for possible receivers. In the immedi-
acy, the quarterback is sensitive to burly bodies 
hurling his way allowing him to step aside to 
avoid them, while the balcony view affords an 
understanding of the whole play. Every leader, 
according to Heifetz and Linsky (2002), should 
routinely climb to the balcony over their organi-
zation to survey, study, and to gain perspective 
on what is going on and determine needed 
adjustments. School leaders, too, operate from 
these multiple perspectives—participating in 
the group, modeling new behaviors, embracing 
learning and risk taking, keeping ears to the 
ground in private conversations, and moving 
to the balcony in meetings and in reflections as 
they consider progress of their unit as a whole.
Consistent with the values, goals, and tools 
of Adaptive Schools, we increasingly witness 
the following adaptive leadership practices in 
schools, departments, and grade-level teams.
•	
Reframing the leader’s job from that of 
problem-solver to problem framers and 
developer of problem solvers.
•	
Asking the important, tough questions 
without having the answers.
•	
Knowing how to help people learn, not by 
telling, but by understanding the percep-
tions, beliefs, and values that drive their 
action, and helping them to plug into alter-
native, more agile ways of thinking.
•	
Fostering reflection and big-picture think-
ing, slowing down to move the action 
forward.
•	
Demonstrating and modeling conscious-
ness, efficacy, flexibility, and courage.
•	
And, finally, seeking or being open to 
coaching, a practice consistent with 
world-renowned classical musicians and 
professional dancers as well as profes-
sional athletes in team and individual 
sports.
It seems the critical question is no longer, 
“How to manage change?” rather, the current 
question asked by Heifetz and Linsky (2002) 
is, “How to lead adaptive change.”
As educators, authors, and consultants, 
we are actively exploring new possibilities 
and developing ways of thinking about adult 
interactions in schools. Our own thinking is in-
fluenced by the emerging sciences of quantum 
mechanics, complexity theory, fractal geome-
try, evolutionary biology, and systems thinking 
as they apply to social organizations. We are 
also influenced by constructivist psychology, 
as it relates to learning and leadership: and 
our personal histories in a variety of roles 
in education—teacher, curriculum consultant, 
staff developer, principal, superintendent, and 
professor; and our current work as consultants 
with schools throughout North America, and 
schools in Australia, Africa, Asia, Europe, the 
Middle East, and India.


21
Developing shared expertise and working 
with common purpose are vividly present in the 
schools that are beating the odds and making a 
difference for student learning internationally 
and in North America.
How teachers talk affects how students 
learn. Loaded with practical tools, this section 
of the book underscores how the will to make 
a difference in the lives of students is more 
important than school structures, buildings, 
textbooks, or lab materials. When this will is 
collective, school teams can overcome many 
obstacles to student learning.
Drawing from essential research findings 
from the 1980s to the present and the work 
on professional capital by Hargreaves and 
Fullan (2012) we emphasize the increasing 
importance of developing strong professional 
communities in schools.
Part II makes the case that the Adaptive 
Schools’ models and tools serve two major un-
derpinnings of professional capital: developing 
human capital and enhancing social capital. 
In this section, we introduce ways to develop 
seven norms for collaborative work as expected 
patterns of behavior in all school communi-
cations: in groups, in hallway conversations, 
with students, and with parents. Importantly, 
we provide descriptions of the metacognitive 
skills for being an effective group member, 
which cannot be found in other literature as far 
as we can discern. This role, in our experience, 
is more crucial to group success than having a 
skilled facilitator. Here we distinguish the role 
of the group leader from that of the facilitator. 
The group leader is the person with knowledge 
and/or role authority and in many situations 
should not be facilitating the meeting or work 
session. Finally, we offer a simple model for 
helping participants be clear about their inten-
tions during group conversations. These Two 
Ways of Talking give focus and structure to 
conversations that flow from dialogue to dis-
cussion to decisions that stay made.
PART II	
COLLABORATION MATTERS


23
T
he term professional community is striking when it is applied to the 
working cultures of schools. The word professional has its roots in pro-
fess, meaning to declare, to own, and to claim some body of knowledge; 
it therefore implies a level of expertise with a strong technical core that can be 
clearly articulated by practitioners. The word community has its roots in the 
word common, and its relationship to the word communicate implies that this is a 
shared body of expertise. The practitioners in a professional community talk reg-
ularly about their collective practice and work together to extend and effectively 
apply this knowledge base.
Chapter 3	
The Importance of  
Professional Community
Developing shared expertise and working 
with common purpose are vividly present 
in the schools that are beating the odds and 
making a difference for student learning both 
internationally and in North America (Bryk 
and Schneider, 2002; Dufour, Eaker, and 
Baker, 1998; Louis, Marks, and Kruse, 1996; 
McLaughlin and Talbert, 2006; Hargreaves 
and Fullan, 2012).
Unfortunately, the notion of shared prac-
tice within a school or a district is still not as 
universal as we would like. Richard Elmore 
(2000) pointed out that schools and school-
ing are governed by the principle of “loose 
coupling” (p. 6), with many decisions about 
what and how to teach residing in individual 
classrooms and not in the surrounding organi-
zation. Loose coupling tied to a weak technical 
core is a recipe for disaster. The effects of both 
effective and ineffective teachers are felt for 
years. The issue, then, is how to enhance and 
spread good practice throughout the school 
to produce cumulative and lasting effects for 
all learners, not just those who are fortunate 
enough to learn the material the way it is 
presently taught. Fresh studies are emerging 
that document student gains as a result of 
high-functioning teacher learning communi-
ties. As one example, research investigating the 
extent to which teachers’ collaborative school 
improvement practices are related to student 
achievement was conducted from a sample of 
2,536 fourth-grade students in forty-seven ele-
mentary schools in a large urban school district 
in the mid-western United States. Schools with 
greater levels of teacher collaboration produced 
higher achievement in mathematics and read-
ing than those with lesser amounts (Goddard, 
Goddard, and Tschannen-Moran, 2007). In 
John Hattie’s meta-analysis of more than eight 
hundred studies, teacher collaboration is an im-
portant characteristic for three of nine teaching 
standards (Hattie, 2009).
One of the most stable factors in schools 
over the years has been the relative isolation 
of teachers from one another throughout their 
workday and work year. Working lives in 
which autonomous teachers are organized by 
a culture of individualism are still common. In 
some of these schools teachers live episodically 

The Adaptive School

from one year to the next and seek routines 
that are efficient and energy conserving. Cau-
tion about intruding in others’ territory and 
guardedness or resistance about changes in 
curriculum and instruction are normal. Teach-
ers in these schools work hard, but with little 
sense of their potential collective power. We 
have worked in many of these schools, from 
the west to the east coasts in North America 
and in a some international settings. Despite 
leadership efforts, and various forms of profes-
sional development, many classroom practices 
remain fundamentally unchanged even though 
teacher collaboration is undoubtedly linked to 
improving student learning outcomes.
The Professional Learning Community 
(PLC) movement (Teacher Learning Com-
munity in the United Kingdom) organizes 
practices around the premise of improving 
learning by improving teaching practice. Rich-
ard Dufour, a champion of PLCs, cautions that 
the term has been used so loosely that it is 
forfeiting meaning (Dufour, 2004). And while 
PLCs are not what we are describing in this 
book, research in this area sheds some light 
on two questions related to teacher collaboara-
ton. First, does collaboration change teaching 
practices, and second, do changes in practices 
improve student learning? (Vescio, Ross, and 
Adams, 2008). Only recently have researchers 
gathered empirical data on these two questions, 
and the short answer to these queries is yes.
In their award-winning book Hargreaves 
and Fullan (2012) declare that one can’t grow 
much human talent by focusing on individu-
als. They envision a pathway to schools with 
high-quality teachers and teaching. They re-
mind readers of Leana’s (2011) finding
that patterns of interaction among teachers 
and between teachers and administrators that 
are focused on student learning make a large 
and measurable difference in student achieve-
ment and sustained improvement. (p. 34)
These patterns of interaction are the basis of 
social capital in schools. In a sense, helping 
schools bring into being the structures and so-
cial capital necessary for profoundly effective 
teaching is the purpose of this book.
Hargreaves and Fullan (2012) are envi-
sioning communities of practice. “Communi-
ties of practice are groups of people who share 
a concern, a set of problems, or a passion about 
a topic, and who deepen their knowledge and 
expertise in this area by interacting on an ongo-
ing basis” (p. 4). Communities of practice is a 
concept first proposed by cognitive anthropol-
ogists Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger in 1991. 
Members in these communities collectively 
learn in order to do better that which they are 
passionate about. Wenger (1998) described 
such groups as having shared norms and col-
laborative relations; a shared understanding 
of what binds them together and shared reper-
toire, literally creating a communal resource. 
Hargreaves and Fullan (2012) note that first it 
is about developing trust and relationships and 
second, collaborative work will benefit “from 
deliberate arrangements of meetings, teams, 
structures and protocols” (p. 127). But if these 
are built in the absence of commitment, all this 
will be ineffective. “First,” by the way, is not a 
statement of sequence, rather it is statement of 
primary focus while doing shared work around 
teaching and learning.
The Elements of  
Professional Community
In our work, we are becoming increasingly 
optimistic that schools as professional commu-
nities hold rich promise for meaningful staff 
engagement leading to increases in student 
learning. Our intent is to share what we are 
learning in this area. We offer ways to build 
professional communities in schools so that 
teachers and administrators can talk about dif-
ficult things, ask hard questions about teaching 
and learning practices, and adults can actively 
learn from one another.
The fundamental definition of adaptiv-
ity, the principles of complex systems and

focusing questions introduced in chapter 1, 
directly apply to the work of developing robust 
professional communities in schools. These 
factors interact to produce adaptivity and work 
together to energize the emergence of a pro-
fessional community. The combined effects 
of these relationships (figure 3.1) produce in-
creased student learning.
Figure 3.1.  Adaptive Schools and Professional Community

Six factors work in concert to produce 
a sense of shared responsibility for student 
success that successfully delivers results. They 
are a prime example of the complex systems 
principle that everything influences everything 
else. Each principle on its own is important, but 
not sufficient for the task of energizing instruc-
tional improvements. The emerging research 
base supports the importance of these essential 
elements of professional community. The six 
factors are as follows:
1.	
Compelling purpose, shared standards, and 
academic focus;
2.	
Collective efficacy and shared responsibil-
ity for student learning;
3.	
Social capital emerging from teacher talk 
about learning and improving said learning;
4.	
Collaborative cultures communally apply-
ing effective teaching practices;
5.	
Relational trust in one another, in students, 
and in parents;
6.	
Individual and group learning based on 
ongoing assessment and feedback.
These shared efforts produce school-wide 
gains in student achievement. When teachers 
take collective responsibility for students, 
they conceive their work to be a joint enter-
prise (Little, 1990). They have a greater sense 
of personal and collective efficacy and assume 
that learning is a result of school rather than 
nonschool factors (Lee and Smith, 1996). In 
high schools where this sense of collective 
responsibility was strong, students have been 
found to have larger gains in mathematics, 
reading, history, and science than in schools 
where the collective sense was weaker. These 
outcomes were especially true for minority 
students and students from low socioeco-
nomic backgrounds.
Compelling Purpose, Shared 
Standards, and Academic Focus
Communities come into existence and 
thrive because of a common purpose for 
working together. A group’s compelling pur-
pose establishes reciprocal expectations for 
its members. International evidence suggests 
that educational reform’s progress depends 
on teachers’ individual and collective capac-
ity and its link with school-wide capacity for 
promoting pupils’ learning (Stall et al., 2006). 
Compelling purposes, however, do not mean 
a race to the top. Andy Hargreaves notes that 
while Singapore schools are consistently rated 
among the best in the world, they have not set 
goals to be the best. Rather, they have set goals 
to be effective, and like other successful orga-
nizations, aim for 2 percent annual gains. They 
teach less so students can learn more. Teacher 
innovation flourishes in their collaborative cul-
tures. Teachers give away their best ideas and 
then invent new ones
Teachers’ professional communities op-
erate with a sense of moral authority and 
moral responsibility for making a difference 
in the lives of students. Such purpose is 
grounded in clearly articulated standards for 
both student and teacher performance. Defin-
ing and refining the meaning of doing good 
work is the task of a professional learning 
community.
Collective Efficacy and Shared 
Responsibility for Student Learning
Collective efficacy refers to the shared 
sense that teacher knowledge and effort will 
overcome obstacles to student learning. Such 
efficacy is achieved through four routes: (1) 
direct experience in which a group overcomes 
difficulties through persistent effort; (2) vi-
carious experience, the observation of others’ 
successful experiences; (3) social persuasion 
in which members are persuaded they have 
what it takes to make a difference and the stu-
dents they are working with have the capacity 
to learn; and (4) personal emotional states, in 
which the sense of feeling good about what one 
is accomplishing is a further reinforcement. 
This raises confidence, which in turn reinforces 
the practice of working hard. Stress can weaken

this affect, and weaken the sense of collective 
efficacy (Holanda, et al. 2014).
The personal efficacy of individual teach-
ers is a well-studied phenomenon. Teachers 
with stronger personal efficacy beliefs consis-
tently outperform teachers in the same settings 
with weaker beliefs. They also work harder and 
experience less stress. Participating in decision 
making contributes strongly to teachers’ beliefs 
in the capabilities of their peers, fosters com-
mitment to school goals, and promotes gains in 
student achievement. A group of high-efficacy 
teachers, however, is not the same as a group 
with collective efficacy.
Collective efficacy, however, is not a pan-
acea. Parker (1994)—and other, earlier re-
searchers—found that collective efficacy can 
partially counteract the negative effects of low 
socioeconomic conditions.
Social Capital Emerging from Teacher 
Talk about Learning and Improving 
Said Learning
One invests capital to reap returns. In 
schools, social capital develops from the fre-
quency with which teachers and others engage 
in conversations about student work and teach-
ing practices related to that work (Hargreaves 
and Fullan, 2012). Social capital improves the 
teaching performance of all teachers. Schools 
with rich social capital invest in teacher de-
velopment; not only in pedagogy, but collegial 
practices which themselves further inform col-
lective teaching practices. Trust, reciprocity, 
information, and cooperation are associated 
with these social networks.
Talent is the human capital teachers bring 
to their work. Regardless of starting levels, hu-
man capital grows in relationship to social cap-
ital, in magnitudes not possible through atten-
tion to individual teacher development. Social 
capital raises the aspirational and performance 
bar for everyone. Two parallel dimensions are 
related to social capital: decisional capital and 
cognitive capital. Decisional capital rises from 
the professional decision making of teachers 
when they are treated as professionals, rather 
than being treated as workers who need to be 
told what and how to teach. Costa, Garmston, 
and Zimmerman (2014) assert that training in 
reflection, not teacher assessment, is a driving 
force for self-directed learning. Not only is 
teaching complex requiring agile thinking, but 
also sustainable decisions made by groups re-
quire similar competencies.
Collaborative Cultures Communally 
Applying Effective Teaching Practices
The norm of privacy has deep roots in 
“real” schools. Once the classroom door is 
closed, the teacher is God. In this sphere 
of autonomy lies both greatness and sorrow. 
Within the zone of isolation, some teachers 
still find ways to develop craft knowledge, 
content knowledge, and compassion for their 
students. These extraordinary individuals man-
age to stimulate their teaching and continually 
renew their passion for daily interactions with 
young minds. All too often, however, this same 
isolation buffers mediocrity and hides high per-
formers from those who might learn from their 
modeling, consultation, and coaching.
When practice is deprivatized, teachers 
visit one another’s classrooms to observe mas-
ter teaching, to coach each other, to mentor, and 
to solve problems in the living laboratory of in-
structional space. Students are the beneficiaries 
of shared teaching repertoires. Although many 
schools and districts have spent much time 
and energy developing coherent curriculum 
maps, shared instructional maps are equally 

The Adaptive School

important. When a student proceeds to the next 
grade or next subject in a secondary school, 
having possession of a predictable learning 
repertoire (such as an understanding of a pal-
ette of graphic organizers), energizes learning 
and increases success—especially for the least 
successful learners.
By developing communities of practice, 
teachers establish a working zone between 
the macro world of district initiatives and 
resources and the micro world of their class-
rooms (McLaughlin and Talbert, 2006). In this 
way they develop more coherent instructional 
approaches that represent shared understand-
ings of their unique setting.
Relational Trust in One Another,  
in Students, and in Parents
In their work on the effects of academic op-
timism on student achievement Hoy, Tarter, and 
Woolfolk-Hoy (2006) point out that collective 
efficacy is the cognitive side of the equation; 
academic emphasis is the behavioral side; and 
faculty trust in one another, in students, and in 
parents is the affective side. Given the powerful 
biochemical connections between thinking and 
feeling in our bodies and our brains, it is difficult 
to separate these functions in practice.
Trust is the glue that binds community 
members to one another. This is equally true for 
teacher communities, classroom communities, 
and parent communities. When all three parties 
hold high expectations for their relationships, 
and these expectations are grounded in shared 
goals and values, trust is a powerful resource 
for learning.
Bryk and Schneider (2002), in their semi-
nal work in Chicago schools, name four criteria 
for the discernment of relational trust: respect, 
competence, personal regard for others, and 
integrity. Respect comes in the form of basic 
civility and a willingness to listen deeply to 
what each person has to say. Parents, students, 
and teachers need opportunities to talk with and 
influence each other and to believe that they 
can positively affect educational outcomes. 
Competence is the sense that each party has 
the ability to carry out its appropriate roles 
and produce desired outcomes. This applies to 
both academic results and teacher-student rela-
tionships. When gross incompetence goes un-
checked, it erodes trust and undermines shared 
efforts toward improving learning. Personal 
regard for others deepens relational trust. We 
are a social species, wired for relationships and 
reciprocity. Mutual support and mutual caring 
fuel these associations. Extending ourselves 
to and for others is like making a deposit in 
the trust account; the interest in this account 
compounds with each deposit. Integrity is the 
congruence between saying and doing. In trust-
ing relationships, this means we believe that a 
sense of morality and ethics is operating in oth-
ers and in the ways we are relating. Following 
through with agreements and commitments is a 
key aspect of integrity.
Individual and Group Learning Based 
on Ongoing Assessment and Feedback
“Learning is a basic, adaptive function of 
humans. More than any other species, people are 
designed to be flexible learners and active agents 
in acquiring knowledge and skills” (Bransford, 
Brown, and Cocking, 1999, p. xi). Cognitive sci-
ence tells us that learning is socially constructed 
and individually integrated; learning therefore 
requires engaging with other learners and is an 
active process for all involved. Individual and 
collective learning is one of the key characteris-
tics of effective professional learning communi-
ties (Bolam et al., 2005).
For adult groups, learning how to learn to-
gether requires conscious attention, purposeful 
structures, and meaningful feedback. One form 
of feedback arises when teachers look at stu-
dent work together to explore what is working 
and what might require modification in their 
curricular and instructional approaches. Groups 
apply another form of feedback when they take 
time to reflect on their own processes and out-
comes to consider which practices to continue, 
which to abandon, and which to modify.

The Importance of Professional Community 	
Chapter 3	
29
From time to time a group or team will 
share with us that it has some great number of 
years of combined teaching experience. Their 
assumption is that learning is additive, when 
in fact the group members have merely been 
involved in side-by-side processes. Engaging 
in parallel play without feedback and reflection 
is usually a poor teacher.
Developing Teachers’ 
Professional Communities
Despite the existence of these descriptors 
of schools that make a difference for students, 
the question of how we get there remains. 
Schools require frameworks, role clarity, and 
self-renewing tool kits for collaborative prac-
tice. Based on our understanding of the liter-
ature on school change, organizational devel-
opment, and teaching and learning, as well as 
our experiences with schools the past several 
years, we offer the following four frameworks 
as organizers for this journey:
•	
Twin goals: developing organizational ca-
pacities and developing professional ca-
pacities;
•	
Four “hats”: facilitating, presenting, coach-
ing, and consulting;
•	
Five energy sources: efficacy, flexibility, 
craftsmanship, consciousness, and inter-
dependence;
•	
Seven norms of collaboration: pausing, 
paraphrasing, posing questions, providing 
data, placing ideas on the table, paying 
attention to self and others, and presuming 
positive intentions.
Figure 3.3 shows the interaction of the first 
three frameworks.
Figure 3.2.  Adaptive Schools

The Adaptive School
30
To address problems in languishing 
schools, districts and schools must continually 
apply energy and resources to both production 
and production capacities. Leaders of adaptive 
schools simultaneously develop two goals re-
lated to the organization’s ongoing need for 
self-improvement. The first goal expands six 
organizational capacities for adaptivity. The 
second goal strengthens six professional capac-
ities for adaptivity. These twelve capacities for 
organizational and professional adaptivity are 
the source of and focus for reflective dialogue 
in professional communities. Exploration of 
these twelve areas helps communities to focus 
their work and strengthen their ties to one an-
other. We offer them here as lenses for exam-
ining schools and teaching practice in the hope 
that they will become focal points for important 
dialogues and discussions in schools, depart-
ments, teams, and governing councils. We will 
provide brief descriptions here and elaborate on 
them in chapter 13.
The Languishing High School
At the languishing high school, many 
students proactively disengage from learning. 
They slump in their seats on the days that they 
even bother to come to class. Students ignore 
homework assignments, and remediation needs 
outweigh the coverage of new material. Exter-
nal rewards such as grades, honor rolls, and 
college admissions requirements hold little or 
no motivational power. Teachers are attempt-
ing to deal with this situation by embracing 
tradition, enforcing standards, and struggling 
to maintain the integrity of teaching methods 
and materials. The net result of all these inter-
actions includes departments with abnormally 
high failure rates, decreased enrollments in 
advanced courses, falling attendance, and in-
creased dropout rates. Staff morale and teacher 
efficacy plummet.
This is a classic situation in which the five 
principles of complex systems (see chapter 1) 
are at work:
1.	
More data do not lead to better predictions. 
Additional surveys and reports about at-
tendance, dropout rates, test scores, and 
staff attitudes will not improve this school.
2.	
Everything influences everything else. 
Tough standards only raise the bar higher 
for students who lack basic jumping skills. 
Poor student performance lowers expec-
tations and teachers’ professional pride 
and sense of purpose. Parental concerns 
and complaints cause defensiveness and 
withdrawal.
3.	 Tiny events create major disturbances. 
Student expulsions, a dropped section of 
an honors course, and half-full classes 
create ripple effects throughout life in the 
school.
4.	
You don’t have to touch everyone in the 
system to make a difference. A belief that 
everyone in the school must be ready for 
change before any action can be taken 
blocks movement and innovation.
5.	
Both things and energy matter. Rules, rou-
tines, and procedures will count for little 
unless you also attend to the qualities of 
human relationships in the school.
Organizational Capacities  
for Adaptivity
The six organizational capacities for adap-
tivity are (1) vision, values, and goal focus; (2) 
systems thinking; (3) initiating and managing 
adaptation; (4) interpreting and using data; (5) 
developing and maintaining collaborative cul-
tures; and (6) gathering and focusing resources.
Vision, Values, and Goal Focus
Clarity of vison, values, and goals is a hall-
mark of successful schools. The most important 
goals are the academic goals for the students. 
These in turn are an expression of the value 
system that governs the organization. Healthy 

The Importance of Professional Community 	
Chapter 3	
31
schools and organizations hold a vision for 
themselves of how they wish to operate in the 
world. This is a vision of values and goals in 
action. Such a vision is informed by real-world 
measures of student achievement and other 
goal accomplishments.
At the languishing high school, vision, 
values, and goals require rethinking and refo-
cusing. English literature might not be the most 
appropriate course to teach students who have 
fundamental literacy needs.
Systems Thinking
Systems thinking and vision, values, and 
goal focus are the major organizers of adaptivity. 
Helping others to see systems places the work of 
schools in a larger context. This framework re-
veals influential interactions and helps to answer 
the question “What part of the system can we 
influence to create positive change?”
Adaptve schools engage in systems think-
ing. Whether explicitly labeled as such or not, 
this is what professional communities do.
Initiating and Managing Adaptation
Adaptation is the work of leaders at all lev-
els of the school and professional community. 
Inquiry is an essential tool of adaptation. The 
three focusing questions offered in chapter 1 are 
resources: “Who are we?” “Why are we doing 
this?” and “Why are we doing this, this way?”
Interpreting and Using Data
Data have no meaning on their own. 
Meaning is a result of human interaction with 
data. Many schools are data-rich and mean-
ing-poor. Adaptive groups develop the capacity 
to discern what data are worth paying attention 
to and what collaborative practices help people 
to engage with data in ways that increase own-
ership and willingness to act on conclusions. 
(See chapter 11.)
The languishing high school usually has 
enough data about the system, but little knowl-
edge. Knowledge, meaning, and commitment 
result from dialogue and discussion about what 
story is told by the data. Without organized story 
making, people in organizations make up their 
own explanations for events. Part of the reason 
for this is protection from unwanted truths.
Developing and Maintaining 
Collaborative Cultures
Collaboration is the essence of teachers’ 
professional community in schools. Collabo-
ration, social captital, and group development 
work hand in hand. In chapter 10 we will dis-
cuss ways to help groups become more interde-
pendent and cohesive.
Collaboration operates within and between 
groups. When students work with units of mea-
sure as they quantify lab materials, interdepen-
dence connects the math teachers to the science 
teachers. Success in the lab builds on math 
skills learned in other settings. Laboratory ap-
plications further reinforce the practical nature 
of algorithms learned in math class.
A sense of collaboration is lacking at the 
low-performing high school. The teachers and 
the departments feel besieged, hunkering down 
and fighting their own fights for some sense of 
accomplishment and dignity. The students and 
the teachers do not see themselves aligned in 
a shared task. Each sees the other as an adver-
sary, with small victories and losses accumu-
lating on a daily basis. Each carries an identity 
as a teacher of a discipline or grade level, not 
as part of a team dedicated to student success.
Gathering and Focusing Resources
Time, money, and human energy are some 
of the resources that support goal accomplish-
ment in schools. Overload and fragmentation 
are the enemies of success. Resources must 
be focused where they will make the greatest 
difference. Ultimately this leads to some hard 
decisions in schools. Resource allocation and 
goal accomplishment are directly linked. What 
receives attention gets done.

The Adaptive School
32
This last organizational capacity for adap-
tivity cannot work without clarity in the others. 
Values and goals point out resource needs. Sys-
tems thinking frames where to target resources. 
To initiate and manage adaptation means to ap-
ply and manage resources. All this is missing at 
the languishing high school. Energy, time, and 
money are thrown at problems to fix the most 
visible ones. Doing anything is considered 
good enough. The goal is to protect individuals 
and the organization from the accusation of not 
working hard enough. Without a clear focus 
and without honest feedback systems, however, 
this only saps resources and increases the mag-
nitude of the problems.
Professional Capacities  
for Adaptivity
The six professional capacities for adap-
tivity are (1) collegial interaction; (2) cognitive 
processes of instruction; (3) knowledge of the 
structure of the discipline; (4) self-knowledge, 
values, standards, and beliefs; (5) a repertoire 
of teaching skills; and (6) knowing about stu-
dents and how they learn.
Collegial Interaction
In many respects, collaboration needs to 
be taught. Past practices and workplace cul-
ture influence the capacity for collaboration. 
So does gender and school organization (el-
ementary, middle, or high). Attitudes, knowl-
edge, skills, and practices can be taught; these 
are the focus of chapters 4, 5, 6, and 10. The 
capacity to be a colleague is different from 
other capacities of good teaching. It draws 
upon craft knowledge, self-knowledge, and 
interpersonal skills to form a web of recipro-
cal relationships and services.
Norms of privatism are strong at the lan-
guishing high school. Each teacher operates as 
an independent artisan. There is no craft guild 
with which to share professional knowledge 
and concerns. Small breakthroughs with stu-
dents are personal victories to be savored and 
fleetingly enjoyed in quiet moments.
Cognitive Processes of Instruction
Instructional thinking occurs in four 
phases: planning, teaching, analyzing and eval-
uating, and applying what has been learned to 
future work.
The more cognitively adept a teacher is, 
the better the results are in classrooms and with 
colleagues. This capacity includes the abilities 
to manage multiple goals simultaneously, to 
align one’s work with that of one’s colleagues, 
and to learn from experience in the classroom 
(Costa and Garmston 2015).
Teachers in the languishing high school 
feel as if they have no time to reflect. The pace 
of survival puts action ahead of reflection on 
most personal and collective agendas. Peer 
coaching programs sputter out in the press for 
time. Formal supervision is pro forma and ritu-
alized. Administrators are mostly satisfied with 
teachers who “keep the lid on” in a classroom 
and keep kids out of the office.
Knowledge of the Structure  
of the Discipline
Knowledge of the structure of the dis-
cipline moves beyond content knowledge, 
which is necessary but not sufficient for good 
teaching. The former involves knowing the 
organizing schema of the field, including the 
significant ideas in the discipline and how they 
relate to one another. Anticipating major mis-
conceptions and barriers to learning and under-
standing the significant ideas are also important 
here. These inform curricular choices and the 
selection and use of resource materials.
Little attention has been given to matters 
of curriculum at the low-performing high 
school beyond periodic textbook adoptions. 
Teachers’ knowledge of their fields is not al-
ways up to date. In fact, more than a quarter of 
the staff might be teaching outside their areas 

The Importance of Professional Community

of certification or in areas in which they did 
not major in college.
Self-Knowledge, Values, Standards, 
and Beliefs
The knowledge of what one stands for is 
the most important assest a professional edu-
cator has to maintain a steady course through 
the ups and downs of life in schools. Having 
clarity about personal standards for good work 
and good behavior and effectively
A lack of deep professional interaction 
does not serve teachers in the languishing high 
school. Many are unsure of themselves and in-
secure in the changing world in which they find 
themselves. Old touchstones, such as grades, 
course syllabi, and school traditions no longer 
provide comfort and a sense of purpose in the 
world. Some cling tightly to known elements 
even in the face of evidence of their negative 
effects. The comforts of the past hold memories 
of the way things are supposed to be.
A Repertoire of Teaching Skills
In chess, the queen is the most powerful 
piece on the board because she has the most 
flexibility of movement: She can move forward 
or backward, left or right, and diagonally, for 
any number of spaces. Like a chess queen, 
teachers with an expanded repertoire of teach-
ing skills have the most flexibility of movement 
and thus the most options.
No one knows it all in the classroom. Craft 
knowledge is a lifetime in the making. There is 
always something new to invent and learn as 
research, technology, and professional practice 
continually expand both the knowledge base 
of teaching and the answers to the questions 
about what works and why. Teachers at the 
low-performing high school cling to old ways 
of doing business in the classroom. Lectures, 
videos, reading from textbooks, note taking, 
and quizzes prevail. Students play out their part 
of the ritual, minimally complying with this 
production. Alternative teaching techniques 
such as simulations and project-based learning 
are usually rejected as “not my style.”
Knowing about Students  
and How They Learn
Just as educators can never know enough 
about the structure of their disciplines, them-
selves, and their teaching repertoire, they can 
never know all there is to know about their 
students and how they learn. This capacity is 
divided into two parts. The first, knowing about 
students, means knowing them as people—who 
they are and where they come from. This is the 
stuff of genuine relationships that nurture and 
motivate learning. The second part, knowing 
how students learn, is informed by knowledge 
of learning styles, developmental stages of 
intellectual growth, cultural differences, and 
gender differences.
Students in the low-performing high 
school are often viewed as problems to over-
come. They are the objects of instruction, not 
the constructors of meaning. All too often, 
relationships between teachers and students 
are strained in the battle for power and control. 
Each side needs the other but does not always 
know how to cross the gap that divides them.
The Four “Hats” of  
Shared Leadership
In adaptive schools, all players learn to 
“wear four hats,” or play four roles. By all 
players we mean administrators, teachers, sup-
port staff, students, and, when appropriate, par-
ents. In such schools all the players must have 
the knowledge and skills to manage themselves 
and influence and lead others.
Leadership is a function, not a role and is a 
shared function in meetings, staff development 
activities, action research, and classrooms. 
Recognizing the “hats” and knowing when 
and how to change them is shared knowledge 
within the organization. When values, roles, 
and work relationships are clear, decisions 
about appropriate behavior are easy. We offer 

The Adaptive School
34
definitions to illustrate the major functions 
of four leadership roles and the distinctions 
among the roles. See Costa and Garmston, and 
Zimmerman (2014) for extended discussion on 
how each of these functions can contribute to 
the development of cognitive capital.
Facilitating
To facilitate means “to make easier.” A 
facilitator conducts a meeting in which the 
purpose is dialogue, shared decision making, 
planning, or problem solving. The facilitator 
directs the processes used in the meeting, 
choreographs the energy within the group, 
and maintains a focus on one content and one 
process at a time. Ideally the facilitator is not 
the person with role or knowledge authority 
(described in chapter 8). The role of facilitator 
is central to the ideas in this book. Many of the 
templates, tools, and strategies provided here 
apply to it. We have therefore elaborated on 
this role in chapter 8.
Presenting
To present is to teach. A presenter’s 
goals are to extend and enrich knowledge, 
skills, or attitudes and to enable these to be 
applied in people’s work. A presenter may 
adopt many stances—expert, colleague, nov-
ice, or friend—and use many strategies of 
presentation—lectures, cooperative learning, 
study groups, or simulations. Touchstones of 
effective presentations include clarity of in-
structional outcomes, of standards for success, 
and ways to assess learning (Garmston, 2005; 
Garmston and Wellman, 1992).
Coaching
To coach is to help a group take action 
toward its goals while simultaneously helping 
it to develop expertise in planning, reflecting, 
problem solving, and decision-making. The 
coach takes a nonjudgmental stance and uses 
open-ended questions, pausing, paraphrasing, 
and probing for specificity. The skillful coach 
focuses on group members’ perceptions, think-
ing, and decision-making processes to medi-
ate resources for self-directedness (Costa and 
Garmston, 2015).
Consulting
To consult is to have your expertise be 
used by others. A consultant can be an infor-
mation specialist or an advocate for content 
or process. As an information specialist, the 
consultant delivers technical knowledge to the 
group. As a content advocate, the consultant 
encourages group members to use a certain 
instructional strategy, adopt a particular cur-
riculum, or purchase a specific brand of com-
puter. As a process advocate, the consultant 
influences the group’s methodology, such as 
by recommending an open rather than a closed 
meeting to increase trust in the system. To 
effectively consult, one must have trust, com-
monly defined goals, and the group’s desired 
outcomes clearly in mind (Block, 1981).
Marshaling the Energy  
for Changing Schools
Carl Glickman (1998) writes that with-
out the will to change for the better, all re-

sources and management schemes will have 
little effect. “This issue of will—wanting to be  
better—is critical to understanding how long-
term policies, allocation of resources, and work 
conditions can or cannot work” (p. 3).
Two major problems related to change 
confront all groups. One is adapting to and 
surviving in the external environment. The 
other is developing internally to support daily 
functioning and increase the capacity to adapt 
(Shein, 1992). Groups either develop toward 
greater inclusion and effectiveness or dissolve 
through fragmentation and disarray. Changing 
the structure of the group or teaching group 
members skills does not guarantee growth 
toward increased group performance. Help-
ing members to pay attention to basic energy 
sources within the group encourages the devel-
opment of these resources and permits learned 
skills to be applied and structures to be rein-
vented for greater impact.
Group development is accelerated by the 
following five intervention approaches, which 
we will elaborate on in chapter 10.
1.	
Structure the environment to release and 
enhance energy sources.
2.	
Teach about the five energy sources of 
high-performing groups.
3.	
Mediate selected intervention points.
4.	
Model the five energy sources.
5.	
Monitor evidence and artifacts of selected 
energy sources.
The five energy sources, drawn from the 
work of Costa and Garmston (2015) and mem-
bers of the Institute for Intelligent Behavior, are 
discussed below.
Efficacy
The group believes in its capacity to pro-
duce results and stays the course through 
internal and external difficulties to achieve 
goals. The group aligns energies within itself 
in pursuit of its outcomes.
Flexibility
The group regards situations from multiple 
perspectives, works creatively with uncertainty 
and ambiguity, and values and utilizes differ-
ences within itself and the larger community of 
which it is part. The group attends to rational 
and intuitive ways of working.
Craftsmanship
The group strives for clarity in its val-
ues, goals, and standards. It applies these as 
criteria for its planning, actions, reflections, 
and refinements. It attends to both short- and 
long-term time perspectives. It continually 
refines communication processes within and 
beyond the group.
Consciousness
The group monitors its decisions, actions, 
and reflections based on its values, norms, and 
common goals. Members are aware of the im-
pact of their actions on each other, the entire 
group, and outside individuals and groups.
Interdependence
The group values its internal and external 
relationships. It seeks reciprocal influence and 
learning. Members treat conflict as an oppor-
tunity to learn about themselves, their own 
group, and other groups. The group trusts its 
interactions and the processes of dialogue and 
discussion.
Simple Rules Govern  
Complex Behavior
In this book we are attempting to frame 
the complex work of developing and facilitat-
ing collaborative groups. Although the frame-
works, lenses, and tools we offer might seem a 
bit overwhelming at first, underneath them are 
some simple principles that guide our work.

This simplicity is illustrated in a story 
related by M. Mitchell Waldrop in his book 
Complexity: The Emerging Science at the Edge 
of Order and Chaos (1992). Complexity is 
the study of intricate dynamical systems. It is 
an integrative science in which economists, 
biologists, ecologists, meteorologists, and spe-
cialists from other fields connect to explore 
the underlying principles that govern natural 
and human systems. Much of the work is done 
using high-powered computers to simulate nat-
ural and designed systems.
Craig Reynolds of the Symbolics Corpora-
tion in Los Angeles is one such researcher. He 
designed a computer program that captures the 
essence of the flocking behavior of birds, the 
herding behavior of sheep, and the schooling 
behavior of fish. The elegance of his design 
was in not trying to build rules into the group. 
Instead, the rules resided within the individ-
uals. He created a collection of autonomous, 
birdlike agents he called boids. Each “boid” 
was programmed with three simple rules:
1.	
Maintain a minimum distance from other 
objects in the environment, including other 
“boids.”
2.	
Match the velocity of other “boids” in your 
vicinity.
3.	
Move toward the perceived center of the 
mass of other “boids” in your vicinity.
There was no superintendent of “boids.” 
None of these rules said to form a flock, yet 
flocks formed every time the program ran. 
“Boids” would at first be scattered around 
the computer screen but would soon flock 
up. Flocks were able to fly around obstacles 
or break into subflocks to fly around objects, 
coming together again on the other side. On 
one occasion a “boid” banged into a pole, lost 
its bearings momentarily, then darted forward 
to rejoin the flock.
If simple rules govern complex behavior 
in groups, what might be some simple rules 
for group members to follow? We propose the 
following:
1.	
Take care of me. It is each group member’s 
groundedness, resourcefulness, and en-
ergy that develops the synergy that makes 
high-performing groups possible.
2.	
Take care of us. It is our interdependence, 
interactions, and caring for each other and 
the group that motivates us to want to con-
tinue to work together.
3.	
Take care of our values. It is our values 
that drive our goal clarity about who we 
are, how we want to be together, and what 
we will accomplish for students.
In chapters 4 and 5 we explore these sim-
ple rules in action as we discuss group-member 
capabilities, the seven norms of collaboration, 
and two ways of talking in groups.
Who teachers are to one another is as 
important as who they are to their students. 
In high-performing and improving schools, 
studies show that collaboration is the norm. 
We are not talking here about project-based 
collaboration or the “contrived collegiality” 
described by Hargreaves and Dawe (1990) in 
which administrators create tasks and agendas 
to occupy teachers’ collective energies. Rather, 
we are referring to sharing expertise and per-
spectives on teaching and learning processes, 
examining data on students, and developing a 
sense of mutual support and shared responsi-
bility for effective instruction.

W
e once observed a faculty during a September meeting. Eight teach-
ers, new to the school were studiously attentive to the veterans, em-
ulating their patterns of interaction. This was a vivid example of one 
essential benefit of establishing norms of collaboration: they are normative—that 
is, they become a model for newcomers, and are especially valuable in schools 
with high teacher turnover.
Chapter 4	
Developing Collaborative Norms
In this chapter we reveal the metacognitive 
skills of effective group members, show why 
collaborative inquiry is at the heart of improv-
ing student achievement and describe seven 
norms of collaboration. Groups who employ 
these norms in conversations about student 
learning consistently develop the social capital 
that improves collective teaching expertise 
(Hargreaves and Fullan, 2012).
Working in groups is a natural condition 
of human life. Since the dawn of humanity on 
the plains of Africa, bands, clans, tribes, and 
families have collaborated for defense, food 
gathering, and ceremonial purposes. Work in 
groups is often difficult, filled with conflicts 
and tensions, but it is also absolutely necessary 
for achieving results in modern organizations.
Each group member must balance personal 
goals with collective goals, acquire resources 
for his or her own work, and share those 
resources to support the work of others. Nav-
igating the tensions between part and whole—
between personal autonomy and collabora-
tion—is an ongoing feature of both the surface 
and the deep structure for any working group.
Many organizations try to control these 
tensions by using facilitators to shape and mold 
group energy and task focus. Although a per-
son in such a role can often make a difference 
in a group’s performance, a skilled facilitator 
is only one element of group success. (See 
chapter 8 for more on the role and skills of the 
facilitator and chapter 3 for a description of 
four leadership roles.) Individual group mem-
bers need consciousness and lenses for shaping 
personal decisions and behaviors in meetings.
All surface behaviors are driven by inner 
awareness and ongoing calibration of deeper 
values. Skillful group members monitor and 
adjust their behaviors to support the other 
group members and the group as a whole. To 
operate with sufficient flexibility, group mem-
bers need self-awareness and self-monitoring 
skills to guide their choice making. Skillful 
facilitators increase this awareness by shining 
the light of reflection on group processes and 
by supporting group members in reflecting on 
the behavioral decisions they are making.
Four capabilities shape the self-monitoring 
system of high performing group members. 
These in turn organize and drive seven norms 
of collaboration. The seven norms are the day-
to-day working tools for both skilled group 
members and skilled facilitators.
The Four Group- 
Member Capabilities
We first realized the special power of 
focusing on capabilities as part of a group 

The Adaptive School
38
that was developing “Cognitive Coaching” 
with Art Costa and other colleagues from the 
Institute for Intelligent Behavior. A capability 
names what a person is able to do. It is different 
from capacity, which refers to how much one 
can hold. Capabilities are the metacognitive 
awarenesses with which people determine how 
to use, when to use, or when not to use certain 
skills. Capabilities therefore organize and di-
rect the use of skills; they influence the applica-
tion and effectiveness of knowledge and skills.
The four group-member capabilities are 
as follows:
1.	
To know one’s intentions and choose con-
gruent behaviors;
2.	
To set aside unproductive patterns of lis-
tening, responding, and inquiring;
3.	
To know when to self-assert and when to 
integrate;
4.	
To know and support the group’s purposes, 
topics, processes, and development.
To Know One’s Intentions and  
Choose Congruent Behaviors
Clarity of intention drives attention, which 
in turn drives the what and how of a group 
member’s meeting participation. This is true in 
the moment and over time. This clarity precedes 
and influences the three other capabilities. It is 
the source of impulse control, patience, strate-
gic listening, and strategic speaking.
This capability is the foundation for flex-
ible and effective behavior. If, for example, 
a person’s intention is to positively influence 
the thinking of others, various behaviors can 
be used congruently with that intention: under 
some circumstances, a paraphrase will convey 
an attempt to understand and open the door for 
reciprocal understanding; in some situations, 
direct advocacy will be persuasive; in other 
cases, an inquiry into the thinking of another 
speaker might more effectively influence point 
of view.
To Set Aside Unproductive Patterns of 
Listening, Responding, and Inquiring
For each meeting participant, there are two 
audiences. One is external, made up of the other 
group members. The other is internal, made up 
of the feelings, pictures, and talk going on inside 
each individual. Group members need to contin-
ually decide which audience to serve.
Three major set-aside areas focus this 
choice and allow fuller and more nonjudgmen-
tal participation. They are as follows:
1.	
To set aside autobiographical listening, 
responding, and inquiring: “Me too!”
2.	
To set aside inquisitive listening, respond-
ing, and inquiring: “Tell me more!”
3.	 To set aside solution listening, respond-
ing, and inquiring: “I know what you 
need to do!”
The autobiographical frame leads to sev-
eral problems in group work. The first is the 
filtering process that goes on when individuals 
try to hear another’s story through the lens of 
their own experiences. Although this can be a 
source of empathy, it can also lead to distortion 
and miscommunication.
This type of listening, responding, and in-
quiring, while typically the way people listen, 
is a major source of wasted time in meetings. 
It often triggers endless storytelling in which 
everyone around the table shares a related 
anecdote. This is dinner party conversation, 
not productive meeting talk. Each member of 
the eighth-grade team does not have to relate a 
discipline horror story. Instead, the team could 
more productively spend its time developing 
a collective understanding of the students and 
their needs and generate appropriate response 
patterns to elicit desired behaviors.
The inquisitive frame is sometimes trig-
gered by the autobiographical. People inquire 
to see how others’ stories compare to their own. 
Pure curiosity also motivates inquisitive listen-
ing, responding, and inquiring. A critical ques-
tion at this juncture is “How much detail do we 

Developing Collaborative Norms	
Chapter 4	
39
need to move this item?” This is an example of 
what we call a naive question. (See appendix 
A for other examples of naive questions.) Such 
questions can be asked by any group member. 
The purpose is to focus attention on critical 
matters and avoid unnecessary specificity.
The solution frame is deeply embedded 
in the psyche of educators. Status, rewards, 
and identity are all tied up with being a good 
problem solver. The pressure of time in schools 
pushes people toward action and away from 
reflection. The downside of this pattern is that 
groups and group members get trapped in sit-
uations and action plans before they have time 
to fully understand the perspectives of others.
The solution frame also stifles the genera-
tion of new possibilities. It gets in the way of 
developing alternative ways of framing issues 
and problems, pushing groups toward action 
before creating and clarifying clear outcomes.
To Know When to Self-Assert  
and When to Integrate
In productive groups, each member must 
decide when to self-assert and when to inte-
grate with the group. In one group, a member 
confided to us that she was concerned about 
the autocratic disposition of the new chairman. 
Although she valued the directness that he 
brought to the group’s work, she was concerned 
that they would lose collective ownership if 
she or other group members did not advocate 
for their own ideas and perspectives. Her issue, 
and the tension for each group member, was 
when to challenge and when to go with the 
flow. Self-assertion and integration are con-
scious choices only when group members have 
personal clarity about their own intentions as 
well as a knowledge of and a willingness to 
support the group’s outcomes and methods.
Self-assertion does not necessarily mean 
self-focus. It can mean asserting oneself into 
the flow of group interactions to refocus the 
group on a topic or on a process. It can mean 
reminding others of the purpose of the meeting 
when the conversation strays off course. It can 
also mean speaking up and advocating topics 
and processes.
When individual group members integrate, 
they align their energy with the content and 
processes of the meeting. During dialogue they 
suspend judgments and counterarguments in 
an attempt to understand viewpoints differ-
ent from their own. During discussions, they 
follow the flow of logic and reasoning as it 
emerges. In this way, solutions satisfying to the 
group as a whole are more likely to emerge.
Consensus decision making is the ulti-
mate test of this capability. This procedure as-
sumes that participants know when and how to 
self-assert and when and how to integrate, both 
during and after the decision-making process. 
The next two chapters describe ways of talking 
in groups as well as principles and practices 
for successful meetings. In these chapters you 
will find many ideas and examples of places for 
self-assertion and for integration.
To Know and Support the Group’s 
Purposes, Topics, Processes,  
and Development
All ongoing groups need to balance three 
simultaneous agendas. The first is task focus, 
which is the ultimate expression of the group’s 
purpose. The second agenda is process skills 
development. Without continued attention to 
expanding repertoire and skills, the group 
stagnates and does not increase its capacity for 
handling more complex work in the future. The 
third agenda is group development. All groups 
exist on a continuum from novice to expert per-
formance. Experience alone is an insufficient 
teacher. Many longstanding groups operate at 
novice levels of performance. In chapter 9 we 
elaborate on concepts of group development.
High-performing groups are adaptive 
groups. They learn from experience and im-
prove the way they work. In supporting the 
group’s purposes, topics, processes, and de-
velopment, individual group members make 

The Adaptive School
40
a commitment to this shared learning and to 
personal learning.
The paradoxes of work in groups establish 
the essential tensions that groups and their 
individuals must continually resolve. The four 
group-member capabilities supply metacogni-
tive and emotional filters for decisions, choices, 
and behaviors. All this requires a toolkit for 
productive group work.
Promoting a Spirit of Inquiry
High-functioning groups and group mem-
bers infuse their work with a spirit of inquiry. 
Inquiry is central to professional communities 
that produce stable gains in student learning. 
Learning at its root is a questioning process, 
and successful collaboration embraces the pat-
terns and practices of inquiry. Inquiry presumes 
an openness to and an investment in the ideas 
of others. Physicist David Bohm has noted that 
thought is “largely a collective phenomenon.” 
These thoughts, like electrons, are shaped by 
their interactions with others (Senge, 1990).
To inquire is to ask, be curious, invite the 
transmission of thoughts or feelings, confer, 
consult, wonder, request, examine, and inves-
tigate ideas. David Hackett Fischer, a Pulitzer 
prize-winning historian, observed that questions 
“are the engines of intellect—cerebral machines 
that convert curiosity into controlled inquiry” 
(Berger, 2014, p. 15). Richard Elmore (2000) 
points out that “the knowledge we need to solve 
problems [in schools] often doesn’t reside close 
at hand; it has to be found through active inquiry 
and analysis” (p. 13). Such interactions are not 
always the norm in schools. Collaborative work 
is fraught with the tensions and the fears of 
being judged or of being perceived as one who 
might be judging others.
Teaching as a private practice has a deep 
cultural history. Breaking and reshaping the 
patterns within a culture requires both skill and 
commitment to the ongoing process of building 
community. Teaching in many ways has tradi-
tionally been a “telling” profession. Teachers 
tell students what they need to know and how 
to do the things they need to learn how to do. 
This “telling” behavior often carries over into 
patterns of adult communication as we tell oth-
ers our stories, thoughts, and opinions or wait 
for our turn to do so. This culture of advocacy 
defines much of the interaction in adult groups. 
We are often caught up in the tyranny of or 
(Collins and Porras, 1997). The “or” in the 
statements that things must be right or wrong, 
true or false, yes or no causes these declarations 
to be dichotomous.
Dichotomous thinking leads to dichoto-
mous questions, which in turn polarize group 
members. The art of asking invitational ques-
tions that avoid these dichotomies is the heart 
of collaborative inquiry. Invitational questions 
form connections between people and ideas as 
well as between ideas and other ideas.
All group work is about relationships. 
Relationships shape and define patterns of dis-
course. These relationships are shaped by who 
initiates a query and the form of that query. 
Who responds and how he or she responds is 
a direct result of the ways in which a group 
member initiates a topic. Form, function, and 
outcome are linked within an emotional and 
social system that, when handled with care, 
opens and expands thought and creates new 
possibilities. For example, a person initiating 
a topic with, “One idea we might consider is 
. . .” will result in a totally different response 
from a person initiating a topic with, “I think 
we should . . .” The former will elicit responses 
from more group members, who will treat the 
idea as a possibility, not a decision. Those 
respondents will also be inclined to generate 
more ideas, increasing the group’s flexibility. 
The second response will increase the possibil-
ity of defensiveness among group members and 
discourage the generation of new ideas.
The patterns of inquiry built with the tools 
of the seven norms of collaboration lead to 
deeper understanding and to better-informed 
action. This understanding and these actions can 
be internal for participants and external in their 
behaviors. As we grapple with ideas and per-
spectives we come to know others and ourselves 

Developing Collaborative Norms

41
more deeply. To do so requires us to reflect on 
our inner and outer reactions to data, informa-
tion, and events. Purposeful inquiry helps us 
to interpret personal and collective values and 
the implications of these as we live them out in 
our organizations. Skillful inquiry also helps us 
to clarify our priorities for a topic on the table. 
Where does this issue fit within the bigger pic-
ture? In what ways is this topic important and 
in what ways might this topic be a distraction?
In the end, what we talk about and how we 
talk to one another is a way of acting out our 
beliefs about the world and the way it works, 
our beliefs about the group and its purposes, 
and our beliefs about our personal place in both 
arenas. What we talk about and how we talk 
also defines who we are and ultimately who 
we become. By promoting a spirit of inquiry 
within our groups, we make an investment in 
our personal and collective futures.
What the Norms of Collaboration  
Are Not
Occasionally groups establish working 
agreements to set standards within a specific 
meeting or series of meetings for a group. 
These are different from the seven norms in 
two ways. First, they are group and setting spe-
cific. Second, they are developed by a group to 
guide behaviors when that group is convened. 
Some common examples are: start and end on 
time, come prepared, and listen respectfully. 
To arrive at these a facilitator might invite the 
group to brainstorm agreements they might like 
to make in order to maximize group success 
when they meet. After brainstorming, the group 
clarifies the posted ideas. Finally the group se-
lects five to seven agreements most important 
to them. These are posted on the wall or appear 
on each subsequent meeting agenda.
Another approach to working agreements 
occurs when a group is meeting only once 
and time is limited. In these cases, a facilitator 
might display, then ask for agreement on a set 
of agreements.
We offer two cautions about working 
agreements. For groups that already have a 
successful group history they are unnecessary 
and establishing them runs the risk of pre-
suming members would not select productive 
behaviors without this step. This can have an 
infantilizing effect on members. Next, should 
groups establish them, monitoring is necessary. 
“Once groups establish rules, the facilitator 
must make sure that group members follow the 
working agreements. From time to time, indi-
viduals might need to violate a rule by leaving 
early or taking an emergency phone call; as 
long as deviations are outside of the agreement, 
no one will care. When bad habits become the 
de facto working agreement, everyone notices” 
(Garmston and Zimmerman, 2013, p. 54). 
Since an overarching aim of group work is 
self-directedness, self-monitoring is best.
In contrast to working agreements, the 
seven norms are not only a tool kit for inquiry 
but for developing and sustaining collaborative 
cultures capable of making the best decisions 
for students. Such cultures, as we shall describe 
later, engage in cognitive conflict, a type of 
conflict that in its absence leads to poor de-
cisions, limited follow-through, and too often 
Balkanizing or apathy.
Working Agreement 
Examples
•	
Demonstrate mutual respect. Re-
spect people and ideas. Respecting 
others does not equate to agreeing 
with them.
•	
Employ skillful listening. Seek first 
to understand, then to be understood.
•	
Develop sufficient consensus. Work 
to understand all views, distinguish 
between dialogue and discussion, 
give each person an equal voice, and 
reach 75 percent agreement of those 
present to constitute consensus.

The Seven Norms  
of Collaboration
Several years ago our friend and colleague 
Bill Baker commented that organizations have 
been training the wrong people. Instead of 
spending time and energy developing more 
skilled facilitators, he said, they should de-
velop group members’ skills as the way to 
improve practice and success. Our experience 
bears out the wisdom of this approach. When 
group members are knowledgeable and skilled, 
anyone with simple knowledge of facilitation 
principles and moves can facilitate constructive 
group work.
Drawing from the “Cognitive Coaching” 
model (Costa and Garmston, 2015); the work 
of Peter Senge (1990); the work of Baker, 
Costa, and Shalit (1997); and refinements by 
Dolcemascolo and McKanders (2014) we have 
adapted and updated this set of norms of 
collaboration as the tools for productive com-
munication between members of a working 
community. These are as follows:
1.	
Pausing;
2.	
Paraphrasing;
3.	
Posing questions;
4.	
Placing ideas on the table;
5.	
Providing data; 
6.	
Paying attention to self and others;
7.	
Presuming positive intentions.
Reflect on your typical behavior in some 
group with which you regularly work. Be-
fore reading the following descriptions of 
the norms of collaboration, do the follow-
ing self-assessment. In the list above put a 
checkmark after the norms to which you pay 
conscious attention in most meetings with the 
group you have in mind.
There is a marked difference between 
skills and norms. A skill is something that 
someone knows how to do. A skill becomes a 
norm when it is normal behavior in the group. 
When this occurs, the behavior becomes nor-
mative for new group members, who model 
their own behavior on the standards tacitly set 
by group veterans.
When the seven norms of collaborative 
work become an established part of group life 
and group work, cohesion, energy, and com-
mitment to shared work and to the group in-
crease dramatically. The seven norms serve as 
guides and benchmarks in groups, in hallway 
conversations, with parents and students, and 
in the staff room. As they become established 
within the working substrate, they teach and 
remind all members, both veterans and new-
comers, that this is the way we talk to each 
other around here.
In our follow-up work with clients, this 
phenomenon is reported time and again. An as-
sistant superintendent shared with us that when 
one or two people in a meeting practice the 
norms, the behavior of other group members 
becomes more effective.
A major tension is that all groups have 
more tasks to accomplish than time in which 
to accomplish them. Yet any group that is 
too busy to reflect on process is too busy to 
improve. The seven norms become goals for 
collective growth. In adaptive schools, indi-
viduals and groups select goals from among 
the seven norms. They practice, monitor, and 
reflect on the impact of the norms for them-
selves and for the group.
Each norm is deceptively simple. Most are 
skills that people regularly apply in one-to-one 
communications. The irony is that these seem-
ingly simple behaviors are rare in many meet-
ings. Inquiring into the ideas of others increases 
the capacity for group members to influence 
each other. Pausing and paraphrasing are of-
ten missing, especially when things get tense. 
Posing questions for specificity is forgotten 
when members presume to understand others’ 
meanings. This can lead to later confusion and 
complication. Presuming positive intentions 
prevents members from judging others. Inter-
personal judgments spawn blocked thinking 

Developing Collaborative Norms	
Chapter 4	
43
and negative presuppositions. See appendix B 
through E for self and group assessment inven-
tories. We offer the following explanations of 
the norms as a rationale for their importance.
Pausing
There is a vast research base on the posi-
tive effects of teacher pausing and silence on 
student thinking. The “wait time” research 
of Mary Budd Rowe (1986) has been repli-
cated around the world. Thinking takes time. 
High-level thinking takes even longer. This 
research indicates that it takes from three to 
five seconds for most human brains to process 
high-level thoughts.
Not all brains work the same way. This 
is especially evident in meetings and group 
work. Some people prefer to think out loud and 
construct their ideas externally; others prefer to 
process ideas internally and reflect and analyze 
before speaking. The external processors often 
get in the way of the internal processors. This 
can be an alienating experience for deliberate, 
internal thinkers. The meeting topics move 
by before the internal processers have had a 
chance to contribute.
The members of one middle school team 
with whom we worked began to laugh at them-
selves after completing the Norms of Collab-
oration Group Inventory (appendix C). When 
we inquired, they said they’d been working 
together for more than two years and had yet to 
make a decision. In their group, if you stopped to 
breathe while speaking, you lost the floor. Con-
sequently, they all had tremendous lung power 
and claimed they could each talk for hours on a 
single inhalation. What they recognized was that 
without a norm of pausing, meetings became a 
competition for air space. They soon learned to 
monitor pauses at several junctures to increase 
their productivity and satisfaction.
Groups become skilled at pausing at four 
places in the flow of their conversations. The 
first pause occurs after asking a question or of-
fering a paraphrase. This allows initial process-
ing time for those responding to the question or 
reflecting on the paraphrase. The second pause 
occurs after someone speaks. Human beings 
think and speak in bursts. With additional 
processing time, more responders organize 
thoughts into more coherent speech. The third 
place to pause is before paraphasing or ques-
tioning. A group in Istanbul told us that they 
initiated a five-second pause rule after each 
speaker. Meetings became less stressful, more 
respectful, thoughtful, and more productive. 
In the original wait-time research with 
students, when teachers paused after asking 
questions and after the students’ initial re-
sponses, the length of the responses increased 
from 300 percent to 700 percent, depending on 
the socioeconomic status (SES) of the child. 
The lower-SES children had the greatest gains.
The first two pauses require the questioner 
and other group members to monitor and 
control their own behavior. These are pauses 
to give other people time to think. This is 
personal reflection time in which that person 
waits before answering. Sometimes one says, 
“Give me a moment to think about that before 
answering.” At other times one acknowledges 
the question nonverbally, goes inside oneself to 
think, and then responds to the question. This 
is also a nice way to model thoughtfulness for 
others and can be an important normative be-
havior in groups.
A fourth place for pausing in meetings is a 
collective pause. This can be formally structured 
or can occur spontaneously. These shared pauses 
allow ideas and questions to settle in and allow 
time for note taking and reflection. The intent 
of these breaks in the action is to create shared 
cognitive space for the group and its members.
Pausing gets blood and nutrients to the 
neocortex and begins a pattern followed by 
paraphrasing and questioning. Groups give 
themselves a powerful gift when they establish 
this pattern as a norm; pause, paraphrase, and 
pose questions for a wider range of thoughts 
or for details; and pause, paraphrase, and pose 
questions about feelings.

Paraphrasing
Paraphrasing is one of the most valuable 
and least used communication tools in meet-
ings. It is the key practice in authentic listen-
ing. Even people who naturally and skillfully 
paraphrase in one-to-one settings often neglect 
this vital behavior in group settings. Groups 
that develop consciousness about paraphrasing 
and give themselves permission to use this re-
flection tool become clearer and more cohesive 
about their work.
Try this experiment. Paraphrase, then ask a 
question. Do this several times. Now ask ques-
tions without preceding them with paraphrases. 
Since a well-crafted paraphrase communicates 
“I am trying to understand you, and therefore 
I value what you have to say” and establishes 
a relationship between people and ideas, ques-
tions preceded by paraphrases will be per-
ceived similarly. Questions by themselves, no 
matter how artfully constructed, put a degree of 
psychological distance between the asker and 
the asked. Paraphrasing aligns the parties and 
creates a safe environment for thinking (Lipton 
and Wellman, 1998).
We refer to paraphrases that invite thinking 
and reflect the speaker’s content and the speak-
er’s emotions about the content as mediational 
paraphrases. These can acknowldge, organize, 
or frame a level of abstraction for holding the 
content. The paraphrase reflects content back 
to the speaker for further consideration and 
connects that response to the flow of discourse 
emerging within the group. Such paraphrasing 
creates permission to pose questions for details 
and elaboration. Without the paraphrase, some 
group members may perceive posing questions 
as interrogation.
Knowing when to paraphrase in groups is a 
gained skill. Acknowledging paraphrases often 
occur when emotion is detected and in response 
to initial statements to estalish expectations for 
listening. Organizing paraphrases are employed 
to capture contributions of several speakers on 
a topic or when individuals might have offered 
a series of ideas. As can be seen in table 4.1 
abstracting paraphrases support conceptual or 
“things” thinking.
The Structure and Flow  
of Effective Paraphrasing
Listen and observe carefully to calibrate 
the content and emotions of the speaker. Sig-
nal your intention to paraphrase. This is done 
by modulating intonation with the use of an 
approachable voice and by opening with a 
reflective stem. Such stems put the focus and 
emphasis on the speaker’s ideas, not on the 
paraphraser’s interpretation of those ideas.
For example, reflective paraphrases should 
not use the pronoun “I.” The phrase “What I 
think I hear you saying” signals to many speak-
ers that their thoughts no longer matter and that 
the paraphraser is now going to insert his or her 
own ideas into the conversation.
The following paraphrase stems signal that 
a paraphrase is coming:
You’re suggesting . . .
You’re proposing . . .
So what you’re wondering is . . .
So you are thinking that . . .
Hmm, you’re pondering the effects of . . .
So your hunch is that . . .
Principles of Paraphrasing
•	
Attend fully.
•	
Listen with the intention to under-
stand.
•	
Capture the essence of the message.
•	
Reflect the essence of voice tone and 
gestures.
•	
Make the paraphrase shorter than 
the original statement.
•	
Paraphrase before asking a question. 
Use the pronoun “you,” instead of “I.”

and Ellison, 2014)

Table 4.1.  Balancing Inquiry and Advocacy
The Structure of Inquiry
Ask others to make their thinking visible.
Use nonaggressive language and an approachable voice. “Can you help me understand your 
thinking here?”
Use a pattern of pause, paraphrase, pause, and probe or inquire.
Use exploratory language. “What are some of . . . ? How might you . . . ? What are your hunches 
about . . . ?”
Inquire about values, beliefs, goals, assumptions, examples, or significance. “How does this 
relate to your values, beliefs, goals, or assumptions? What are some examples of what you 
think might happen if we act on your proposal? In what ways does this relate to your other 
concerns?”
Explain your reasons for inquiring. “I’m asking about your assumptions here because . . . ”
Invite introspection. “What questions do you have about your own thinking?”
Compare your assumptions to theirs.
Investigate other assumptions. “Would you be willing to have each of us list our assumptions, 
compare them, and explore if there might be other assumptions about this issue?”
Check your understanding of what is being said by pausing, paraphrasing, and inquiring. “So your 
main concern is the way our team is interacting and you’d like to see more cohesion and focused 
energy. What are some of your thoughts about how this might look and sound in action?”
Test what others say by asking for broader contexts and examples. “How might your proposal 
affect . . . ? In what ways is this similar to . . . ? Please share a typical example of . . . ”
Reveal your listening processes. “I have been listening for themes. So far I’ve heard two. Are 
there others?”
The Structure of Advocacy
Make your thinking and reasoning visible.
State your assumptions. “Here is what I assume are the causes of . . . ”
Describe your reasoning. “I came to this conclusion because . . . ”
Describe your feelings. “I feel _______ about this because . . . ”
Distinguish data from interpretation. “These are the data I have. I’ll share them as objectively as 
possible. Now here is what I think the data mean . . . ”
Reveal your perspective. “I’m seeing this from the viewpoint of . . . ”
Frame the wider context that surrounds this issue. “Several groups would be affected by what
I propose.”
Give concrete examples. “To get a clear picture, imagine that you are in a new school and . . . ”
Test your assumptions and conclusions.
Encourage others to explore your model, assumptions, and data. “What do you think about what
I have just said? Do you see any flaws in my reasoning? What might you add?”
Reveal where you are least clear. “Here’s one area that you might help me think through . . . ”
Stay open. Encourage others to provide different points of view. “In what ways do you see it
differently?”
Search for generalizations, deletions, and distortions. “In what I’ve presented, do any of you 
believe that I might have overgeneralized, left out data, or reported data incorrectly?”

Choose a type of paraphrase with which 
to respond. There are three broad categories of 
paraphase types, each with a specific function. 
We have refined our thinking about these since 
the last edition. One discovery is that some-
times people infer that the three types should be 
used in sequence. This is not the case, though it 
is not unusual to begin conversations with the 
intention of acknowledging the speaker.
1.	
Acknowledging. If the paraphrase is not 
completely accurate, the speaker will offer 
corrections. “So you’re concerned about 
the budgeting process and ways to get 
input early.”
2.	
Organizing. Offer themes and “containers” 
to organize several statements or separate 
jumbled issues. This is an especially im-
portant type of paraphrase to use when 
multiple speakers contribute to a topic. 
“There appear to be two issues here. One 
is resource allocation and the other is 
the impact of those decisions on student 
learning.” In video 4.1, the faciliator poses 
a question, listens to the group, then re-
sponds with an organizing paraphrase.
3.	
Abstracting. Listen deeply for meaning 
then shift to a higher or lower level of 
abstraction. This paraphrase invites the 
speaker to think at levels either more ab-
stract or concrete in an manner congruent 
with the Ladder of Abstraction (Haya-
kawa, 1939). In video 4.3, the facilitator 
offers an abstracting paraphrase and “How 
to work with a person who is threatened.” 
paraphrase by naming the common ground 
in the four responses she has heard from 
the group.
“So a goal for you is . . .” or, “An assump-
tion you have is. . . .” Paraphrasing within 
a flow of discourse often moves through a 
starting point of acknowledging, then using 
each of three forms of paraphrase depending 
on intention in the moment. Paraphrases move 
to a higher level of abstraction when they name 
concepts, goals, values, and assumptions: “So a 
major goal here is to define fairness in the bud-
geting processes and compare those criteria to 
the operating values of the school.” “So you are 
valuing depth over breadth.” Paraphrases move 
to a lower level of abstraction when concepts 
require grounding in details: “So fair might 
mean that we construct a needs assessment 
form for each department to fill out and submit 
to the site council for public consideration.” 
Learning Styles and Paraphrasing
Paraphrases that summarize or shift the ab-
straction level of discourse support and stretch 
the thinking styles of different group members. 
Global thinkers appreciate paraphrases that 
separate and organize “thinking in progress.” 
At other times the shift down in level of ab-
straction grounds global thinkers in specific ex-
amples and concrete details. Concrete, highly 
sequential thinkers learn from the shift up to 
higher levels of abstraction. This helps them 
to explore a bigger picture and creates a wider 
context for thinking.
Posing Questions
Thes first two norms are the platform for 
inquiry. In practice, inquiry follows a pattern 
of pausing, paraphrasing, and questioning. The 
tonal and syntactical stucture of questions can

Developing Collaborative Norms	
Chapter 4	
47
amplify or reduce any perceived danger that 
the listener might hear in the inquiry. Deep 
in our biological wiring we have a finely 
tuned threat-detecting system. The molecules 
of emotion link to the molecules of cognition 
so strongly that the emotional processing cir-
cuits of the brain are the first centers to filter 
incoming messages. Perceived threats trigger 
emotional responses that can inhibit or in 
some way interfere with high-level thought. 
To reduce threat and to open thinking, persons 
skilled in posing questions apply the following 
template (Lipton and Wellman 2013).
Full Attention. The invitation to think begins 
with full attention to others in the group. This 
makes our complete presence available for this 
conversation, which also indicates that we intend 
no harm. This physical message meshes with 
several verbal elements to form an invitation to 
think together about the ideas being explored.
Approachable Voice. Using an approach-
able voice is the next element of the invitation 
to think. This voice tone is well modulated and 
tends to rise at the end of a statement, summary, 
or question (Grinder, 1997). This tonal package 
envelops questions and comments, indicating the 
intention to invite and explore thinking and not 
to interrogate or challenge. In video 4.2, listen to 
the faciliator pose a question in an approachable 
voice and respond to the group using the concept 
of hopefulness in an abstraction paraphrase.
Plural Forms. Two important syntactical 
choices invite colleagues to think with us. One 
is to use plural forms to increase options and 
possibilities for thinking. The use of plural 
forms sets aside the need for evaluation and the 
sorting of ideas. For instance, to inquire about 
someone’s goals instead of their goal opens the 
realm of multiple intentions and not just one 
course of action. Group members often need to 
hear their ideas aloud before they know which 
are most central to the issues before the group.
Tentative Language. The other syntacti-
cal element is the use of tentative phrasing in 
statements and questions. Words like some, 
might, seems, possible, and hunches widen the 
potential range of responses and reduce the need 
for the listener to respond with confidence and 
surety. Words like could and why can decrease 
the confidence of listeners by seeming to ask for 
premature commitment or a need to defend ideas 
and actions that might not be fully developed.
Open-Ended Forms. In addition to em-
ploying the elements noted above, mediational 
facilitators and group members frame their 
questions by using open-ended forms. These 
are questions that cannot be answered yes or 
no. For example, instead of asking a group, 
“Does anyone have any ideas to add?” they 
ask, “What are some additional ideas we might 
add to the mix?” By eliminating dichotomous 
stems such as, “Can you,” “Did you,” “Will 
you,” or “Have you,” skilled questioners invite 
more productive thinking that puts inquiry first 
within the group.
Posing Questions to Explore Thinking
Using the elements of invitation, we pose 
questions to explore thinking by asking about 
perceptions, assumptions and interpretations, and 
invite others to inquire into their own thinking.
Examples:
What might be some of the assumptions we 
have about . . . ?
Given our concern and knowledge of this issue, 
what might be some of the observations  
. . . ?
As we are considering the bigger picture, what 
might be some of the factors and . . . ?
How might you describe your feelings about 
. . . ?
What might be some reasons our four-year-olds 
ask more questions than our six-year-olds?

Posing Questions to Specify Thinking
Human brains are not designed for spec-
ificity. In a world swimming in details, brains 
form quick generalizations from fragments 
of information. Brains delete particulars from 
streams of data and distort incoming and outgo-
ing messages to fit deeply embedded models of 
reality (Bandler and Grinder, 1971). These are 
all natural processes; they do not willfully oc-
cur. Generalizations, deletions, and distortions 
are survival patterns hardwired into the human 
brain. They are adaptations to the challenges 
faced by our hunting and gathering ancestors. 
In modern times these same traits cause dif-
ficulties in human communication. Conver-
sations go haywire when the various parties 
make different assumptions about the meaning 
of words and concepts and neglect to verify or 
correct those assumptions. Problem definition, 
problem solving, and solution generation all 
rely on specificity for success.
Five categories of vagueness inhabit hu-
man speech; these are described below.
Vague Nouns and Pronouns
Someone named “they” makes most of the 
decisions in organizations. “They” are joined 
by “the central office,” “the administrators,” 
“the union,” “the parents,” “the students,” and 
a host of others as the source of mysterious 
messages, concerns, and directives. Unless 
group members know who “they” are, commu-
nication takes longer, and people do not always 
know how to treat the information.
When a speaker in a meeting says our 
students can’t write, someone in the group 
should paraphrase then pose a question asking 
for details. It might sound like this: “So you’re 
concerned about student writing. What’s your 
hunch about how many of our students have 
writing difficulties?”
After the speaker answers, the logical fol-
low-up question would be about which areas of 
writing are of most concern. If the group discov-
ers that a small number of students lacks specific 
skill, they can develop a remediation plan for 
this targeted audience. If the group discovers 
that a large number of students has fundamental 
issues as writers, this calls for a more in-depth 
look at the patterns of curriculum and instruction 
in the school. Without the details, the group does 
not know which problem to solve.
Vague Verbs
Planning and problem-solving sessions 
require specificity for targeted action. The verb 
plan itself means very different things to differ-
ent people. Some think that it means scratching 
ideas on a napkin; others imagine timelines 
and flowcharts with names and dates attached. 
Groups have to define their verbs. Words like 
improve, enhance, design, modify, and under-
stand are all examples of vague verbs used 
by working groups. Someone should begin by 
posing questions for specificity in order for the 
team to agree on concepts, plan for change, and 
act in concert.
Vague nouns and pronouns and vague verbs 
often go hand in hand. A statement like “We 
want our students to be on time and prepared 
for class” easily produces surface agreement in 
most groups of educators. It is only when we 
pose question about which students are not yet 
meeting these requirements and what the mean-
ings of “be on time” and “be prepared” are that 
the issue can even be discussed rationally.
Comparators
“This meeting was much better than last 
month’s session.” Unless the group discovers 
the speaker’s criteria for better, the members 
will not know how to repeat the improvement or, 
for that matter, whether the speaker’s “better” is 
even desirable. Words like best, larger, slower, 
more, and least leave out the point of compari-
son and the standard for the comparison.
When undefined comparators are used, 
pose questions about criteria. “So you’ve en-
joyed this meeting. What were some of the 
ways this was better for you?” The respondent 
here has been careful to ask the speaker for his 
or her criteria (“better for you”), which might 
not be important criteria to other group mem-

Developing Collaborative Norms	
Chapter 4	
49
bers. The intention is to draw the speaker out 
and expand the meaning of the statement.
Rule Words
People operate with conscious and un-
conscious rules about how the world works 
and how they are supposed to operate in it. 
These rules appear in language when people 
say things like “We have to,” “We must,” “You 
shouldn’t,” and “I can’t.”
To clarify these rules and the ways that 
they govern behavior, other group members 
should pose questions for the rules behind the 
statements: “What would happen if we didn’t?” 
“Who or what says we must?” “Shouldn’t? 
Who made up that rule?” “What stops you?” 
Intonation is important here. The voice car-
rying the response has to be well modulated, 
friendly, and nonthreatening.
Universal Quantifiers
“Everyone knows that this program is 
great.” Words and phrases like everyone, all, 
no one, never, and always are examples of uni-
versal quantifiers. Linguists use the term “deity 
voice” to describe this type of language. It is 
spoken as if the statement contains a universal 
truth of which “everyone” must be aware.
As most parents and middle school teach-
ers know, universal quantifiers are the lingua 
franca of teenagers. “I need to go to the mall; 
all my friends will be there.” The typical re-
sponse pattern is “All your friends? I can’t 
imagine that all your friends’ parents would 
permit them to go.”
By qualifying and clarifying a univer-
sal quantifier, group members ground their 
conversations in data and measurable de-
tails. When someone makes the statement that 
“These students never understand the assign-
ments the first time,” another participant can 
pose questions to learn the meaning of never: 
“Has there ever been a time when students 
understood the first time around?” This can be 
followed up with an inquiry into the qualities 
and conditions of the assignments that are an 
exception to the initial statement.
Placing Ideas on the Table
Ideas are the heart of group work. In or-
der to be effective, they must be released to 
the group. “Here is an idea for consideration. 
One possible approach to this issue might be 
. . .” When ideas are owned by individuals, 
the other group members tend to interact with 
the speaker out of their feelings for and re-
lationship to the speaker rather than with the 
ideas presented. This is especially true when 
the speakers have role or knowledge authority 
related to the topic at hand. To have an idea be 
received in the spirit in which you tell it, label 
your intentions: “This is one idea” or “Here is a 
thought” or “This is not an advocacy, I am just 
thinking out loud.”
Knowing when to pull ideas off the table 
is equally important. “I think this idea is block-
ing us; let’s set it aside and move on to other 
possibilities.” In this case, continued advocacy 
of the idea is not influencing other group mem-
bers’ thinking. This is a signal to pull back and 
reconsider approaches.
Providing Data
Productive group work is driven by data, 
both qualitative and quantitative. Data about 
student learning, school climate, teacher satis-
faction, parent satisfaction, and the like are im-
portant to ground ideas being put on the table. 
Collaborative work in schools requires data as 
well as impressions. In fact, important learning 
is possible whether or not the data align with 
the impressions of group members.
Knowing what data are worth paying at-
tention to is important. It is also important to 
know what collaborative practices will help 
people to engage with data in ways that in-
crease their ownership and willingness to act 
on conclusions. Data can be quantitative or 
qualitative. Schools are difficult places to moti-
vate and govern with numbers. A 6 percent rise 
in student reading scores is often not as com-
pelling as a teacher’s tale of the slow reader 
who makes a breakthrough. Reasoning by 
anecdote is often more common than reason-

ing with data. Interpreting and using data are 
learned skills that take time and practice to de-
velop. Knowledge, meaning, and commitment 
result from dialogue and discussion about what 
story is told by the data. Without organized 
story making, people in organizations make 
up their own explanations for events. Part of 
the reason for this is protection from unwanted  
truths. 
Paying Attention to Self and Others
For meaningful dialogue and discussion 
to occur, each group member needs to be con-
scious of themself and of others. Skilled group 
members are aware of what they are saying, 
how they are saying it, and how others are 
receiving and responding to their ideas. This 
includes paying attention to both physical and 
verbal cues in oneself and others. Since the 
greatest part of communication occurs non-
verbally, group members need consciousness 
about their total communication package (Go-
leman, 2006). This includes posture, gesture, 
proximity, muscle tension, facial expression, 
and the pitch, pace, volume, and inflection in 
their voices.
Paying attention to self and others draws 
on emotional and cognitive maturity. It requires 
mindfulness, sensory acuity, and reflective ac-
tion. Mindfulness focuses attention on sensory 
experiences, thoughts, and feelings without 
judgment. With sensory acuity, members in-
crease the levels of detail of what is happening 
internally and externally to themselves. Re-
flective action, utilizing the first two resources, 
capacitates one to act, observe reactions, and 
sustain action when results align with outcomes 
or modify actions when they do not (Prickett 
and Ravlin, 2015).
One important skill to develop is paying 
attention to and responding to the learning 
styles of others. The earlier section on para-
phrasing offers some tips for communicating 
with global and concrete thinkers. In addition 
to using those ideas, skilled group members 
match the language forms of others. This oc-
curs when the respondent joins in a metaphor 
offered by another. It also occurs when the re-
spondent matches the representation system of 
the speaker by using visual, kinesthetic, or au-
ditory words in response to hearing the speaker 
operate within one or more of those categories 
(Lankton, 1980). Here’s an example:
Speaker: I’d like to see us develop a workable 
action plan.
Respondent: So you have an image of prac-
tical process that we can apply to our work. 
What are some of the features you’d like to 
have on view before us?
Presuming Positive Intentions
Assuming that others’ intentions are pos-
itive shows respect for others and encourages 
honest conversations about important mat-
ters. Respect, from its Latin origin, respecere, 
means to look again. “Where once we saw one 
aspect of a person,” explains William Isaacs, 
“we look again and realize how much of them 
we had missed” (1999, p. 111). This is an op-
erating stance that group members must take 
if dialogue and discussion are to flourish; it is 
also a linguistic act for speakers to frame their 
paraphrases and inquiries within positive pre-
suppositions.
Positive presuppositions reduce the pos-
sibility of the listener perceiving threats or 
challenges in a paraphrase or question. Instead 
of asking, “Does anybody here know why 
these kids aren’t learning?” the skilled group 
member might say, “Given our shared concern 
about student achievement, I’d like to examine 
our assumptions about what might be causing 
gaps in learning.”
The first question is likely to trigger de-
fensiveness. The second approach will most 
likely lead to speculation, exploration, and 
collective understanding. This is especially 
true when a speaker has strong emotions about 
a topic and even more important when the re-
spondent initially disagrees with the speaker. 
Here’s an example:

Developing Collaborative Norms	
Chapter 4	
51
Speaker: I’m really ticked off about the lack 
of communication in this school. We never 
find out about the important things until ev-
eryone else knows about them. In fact, I get 
more district news from the local paper than I 
do from internal sources.
Respondent: So as a committed professional, 
you’d like useful information about our or-
ganization in a timely fashion and in a means 
convenient for you. As you think about such 
a system, what might be some important 
components?
In the example above, the respondent 
presumes that the speaker is a committed pro-
fessional who wants to solve a real problem. 
People tend to act as if such presuppositions 
are true. The emotional processors in the brain 
hear the positive intention and open up access 
to high-level thinking (Ledoux, 1996).
Working with Grace in  
a Culture of Advocacy
In working groups that have not yet 
embraced a spirit of inquiry, round-robin, or 
back-and-forth advocacy are often the prevail-
ing patterns of discourse. People who are not 
talking are not necessarily listening; in fact, 
they might just be waiting to talk or internally 
debating and are composing their thoughts 
and responses as they sit poised to pounce at 
the first opening. By applying the norms of 
collaboration, skilled group members, indi-
vidually or collectively, interrupt this nonpro-
ductive pattern and establish more thoughtful 
forms of discourse within their groups. To do 
so they must first break the pattern of balanc-
ing advocacy with their own advocacy. Flex-
ible group members and skillful facilitators 
learn to respond to advocacy with a pattern of 
pausing, paraphrasing, and inquiring.
We are influenced in this arena by the work 
of Peter Senge and his colleagues (1994) at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center 
for Organizational Learning. We have extended 
the concept and refined specific language pat-
terns for operating within this framework.
Matching advocacy with inquiry requires 
both emotional and cognitive resources. The 
balance is most necessary at the exact moment 
when many group members are least likely to 
want to inquire into the ideas of others. It is 
at the moment of greatest disagreement and 
discomfort that this pattern makes the biggest 
difference. To balance means to spend equal 
amounts of time and energy inquiring into 
the ideas of others before advocating one’s 
own ideas. The highest performing teams 
balance both (Losada and Heaphy, 2004). To 
do both equally well requires the resources 
of the seven norms of collaboration. Inquiry 
and advocacy are built on the linguistic and 
perceptual foundation described earlier in this 
chapter. Table 4.2 shows how to balance advo-
cacy and inquiry.
The power of this pattern became appar-
ent to us in an experience related to us by our 
friend and colleague Diane Zimmerman, who 
was enrolled in a doctoral program in organi-
zational development. At the time, she was also 
a principal in Davis, California. Diane and her 
staff had taken on the norms of collaboration as 
a shared learning goal. As a skilled and congru-
ent leader, Diane knew that she needed to apply 
the seven norms in her interactions with adults 
and students. To support her own learning, she 
continually sought opportunities to master and 
integrate these communication skills.
At an early stage in her graduate program, 
the professors organized a small-group learn-
ing experience. The students were placed in 
small groups and given a controversial topic 
to discuss. Most of the groups were soon at 
one another’s throats with rising emotions, 
much heated talk, and little listening. Diane’s 
group took a much different course. After a 
time, the professors gathered around in sur-
prise, because the activity normally evoked 
the responses present in the other groups. 
Unable to resist their curiosity, they asked her 
group what was going on. Diane explained 

The Adaptive School
52
that she had been practicing the habits of 
pausing, paraphrasing, and inquiring into the 
ideas of others before advocating her own 
ideas. Her behavior established this pattern, 
solely by example, within her group.
Skilled Advocacy
The intention of advocacy is to influence 
the thinking of others. Group members some-
times attempt to influence with volume, repe-
tition, and passion. Advocacy works through 
revealing logic and the chain of reasoning that 
supports assumptions and conclusions.
The power of advocacy increases when it 
is structured to influence multiple audiences. 
Global reasoners increase their impact when 
they learn to frame issues for concrete and 
sequential thinkers. Those who are driven by 
logic and facts increase their influence when 
they learn to frame their ideas within feelings 
and emotions. This ability to stretch one’s own 
thinking preferences often makes the differ-
ence in group members being able to hear one 
another and be persuaded by the positions and 
stances of others.
Developing Personal and  
Group Skills with the Seven  
Norms of Collaboration
Ballet dancers practice in mirrored studios 
to monitor posture and the subtleties of their 
movements. Groups also improve by reflec-
tion. The inventories in appendixes B, C, D, 
and E serve this purpose. Printable versions of 
these inventories can be found on the Thinking 
Collaborative Website (www.thinkingcollabo 
rative.com).
For personal skill development as both a 
facilitator and as a group member, appendix B 
serves as a starting point for self-assessment 
and goal setting. One useful approach is to 
select one skill at a time on which to work. 
Our basic mantra here is isolate, overlearn, and 
automatize. By seeking opportunities in daily 
communication experiences to practice a par-
ticular norm, you will be able to overlearn that

tool so that is available to you when you need 
it the most in a meeting. The rating scale in the 
appendix is a useful instrument for self-reflec-
tion after running or participating in a meeting.
With groups in the early stages of devel-
opment, we suggest that individuals assess by 
filling out the inventory located in appendix B. 
Once completed, the form becomes the basis 
for dialogue about skill development and base-
line data for goal setting for individuals and 
groups. We encourage groups to master one or 
two of the norms at a time rather than attempt 
to take them all on at once.
For intact groups with some history of 
working together, the form is best completed 
by subsets of the group. In twos and threes 
they can work through the form, rating the 
full group’s use of each norm. Each subset 
then compares its assessments with the other 
subsets. Most groups discover that all members 
do not perceive meeting behaviors in the same 
way. This conversation leads to goal setting for 
individuals and groups.
The rating scale provides a useful vehicle 
for ongoing group assessment. Regular mon-
itoring with reflective processing keeps the 
norms alive and motivates steady improve-
ment. In addition, the round-robin reflection 
pattern described in chapter 8 is a powerful 
tool for increasing personal and group con-
sciousness and skills.
The four group-member capabilities and 
the seven norms of collaboration are essen-
tial capacities and skills for high-performing 
groups. They operate within several practical 
frameworks that help groups to develop shared 
meaning and gracefully reach decisions. In the 
next chapter we describe two ways of talking 
among adults that make a difference for stu-
dent learning. Both ways, dialogue and dis-
cussion, draw on group-member capabilities 
and norms.

P
rofessional communities are born and nurtured in webs of conversation. 
What we talk about in our schools and how we talk about those things says 
much about who we are, who we think we are, and who we wish to be, 
both in the moment and in the collective future that we are creating for ourselves 
as colleagues and for the students we serve.

Two Ways of Talking That  
Make a Difference for  
Student Learning
Research on the social nature of learning 
and cognition proposes three central themes as 
frames for thinking about the construction of 
new ideas and perspectives (Penlington, 2006; 
Putnam and Borko, 2000).
(1) Cognition is centered in specific phys-
ical and social contexts. Creating communities 
of thought is the ultimate outcome of devel-
oping a high functioning team or department. 
Thinking together is both the expectation and 
the reward in such communities. As we pointed 
out in chapter 3 the word community itself 
is rooted in the word communicate. We hold 
things in common by attending to the form 
and function of collective talk. The physical 
organization of meeting rooms enhances these 
processes. For more details on managing space 
and the surround to enhance collaborative en-
gagement see chapter 6.
(2) Cognition is social in nature. Thought 
is a collective process. Our outer talk reflects 
internal thought patterns and in the process of 
language construction, we modify those same 
thought patterns. In this way, our external 
talking alters our inner speech. By listening 
to the perspectives of others, reflecting those 
thoughts back in the form of paraphrases, and 
inquiring into the ideas of others we shape both 
their thinking and our own. These same alter-
ations in the patterns of thought occur when 
others paraphrase us and inquire into our ideas.
(3) Cognition is distributed between in-
dividuals and tools. No one person has all the 
answers or all of the ideas. Collectively we are 
typically smarter than when working alone. 
Yet, working together is not always easy. It 
requires skills, dispositions, and a shared tool-
kit of maps and tools for talking to manage the 
cognitive and emotional load of productive 
collaboration.
Group talk is the organizing ingredient of 
shared learning, yet it is dangerous and often 
counterproductive to put people in a room 
without frameworks and tools for skilled in-
teraction. The group-member capabilities and 
norms of collaboration described in the previ-
ous chapter supply part of the equation. What 
is missing is a map for two kinds of talking that 
make a difference for student learning (Garm-
ston and Wellman, 1998).
An elementary school staff was struggling 
with the reduced budget for instructional aides. 
Although consensus and fairness were their 
goals, they reported that they felt like turkeys 
being asked to vote on the merits of Thanksgiv-
ing. No one really wanted his or her aide time 
cut. One first-grade teacher was adamant: She 
would agree to lose aide time “over my dead 
body.” Six months later, as part of a schoolwide 
effort to support development of literacy and 
reading skills, this same teacher volunteered 
to share her classroom aide with a third-grade 

The Adaptive School
56
tutoring program “if it will really make a dif-
ference in helping those students learn to read.”
What happened? In six months these 
teachers learned to distinguish and practice 
two different ways of talking: dialogue and 
discussion. They adopted the seven norms of 
collaboration, and individually reflected on 
their capabilities for professional discourse and 
openly reflected on these in order to improve 
personal and collective practice.
These capabilities form the core of a pro-
fessional community. Such communities talk 
about hard issues; they honor cognitive con-
flict and minimize affective conflict (Amason, 
Thompson, Hochwarter, and Harrison, 1995); 
and they make decisions based on objective 
data, shared values, and deep examination of 
mental models. They measure success by in-
creased student learning and adults’ satisfaction 
with their work.
Developing a staff’s skills for talking 
together professionally is no panacea, but it 
can represent one of the single most signifi-
cant investments that faculties can make for 
student learning.
To develop shared understanding and be 
ready to take collective action, working groups 
need knowledge and skill in two ways of talking. 
One way of talking, dialogue, leads to collective 
meaning making and the development of shared 
understanding. The other way of talking, discus-
sion, leads to decisions that stay made.
Both forms of professional discourse use 
common tools. The four capabilities described 
in chapter 4 guide group members in selecting 
tools and help them to monitor the effective-
ness of their participation.
Figure 5.1 shows the pathways of dialogue 
and discussion. First we will define the terms in 
the diagram. Then, we will describe how groups

Chapter 5	
57
use these concepts to guide their interactions. Fi-
nally, we will report the ways that we introduce 
groups to these maps, tools, and skills.
Dialogue honors the social-emotional brain, 
building a sense of connection, belonging, and 
safety. As a shape for conversations, it connects 
us to our underlying motivations and mental 
models. This way of talking forms a foundation 
for coherent, sustained effort and community 
building. In dialogue we hear phrases like “An 
assumption I have is . . .” and “I’d be curious to 
hear what other people are thinking about this is-
sue.” In the following video (5.1), some internal 
complexities of being in dialogue are revealed in 
this interview between Carolyn McKanders and 
Robert Garmston.
Discussion, in its more skillful form, re-
quires conversations that are infused with 
sustained critical thinking, careful consider-
ation of options, and respect for conflicting 
points of view. This way of talking leads to 
decision making that serves the group’s and the 
school’s vision, values, and goals. In a discus-
sion we hear phrases like “We need to define 
the problem we are solving before jumping 
to solutions” and “I’d like to see the data that 
these assumptions are based on before we go 
much further.” A school in Virginia reports that 
learning the distinctions between these ways of 
talking made a profound difference in their col-
laborative work. What they had to say did not 
change, how they said it did (Cunneen, 2015).
Conversation and Deliberation
When groups come together, they “con-
verge” and “converse.” These words’ respec-
tive Latin roots mean that group members “turn 
together” and “associate with one another.” 
Conversation is informal talking in which 
participants share information, anecdotes, and 
opinions to learn from one another or simply 
to enjoy one another’s company. When the 
conversation takes on an organized purpose, 
to either deepen understanding or make a de-
cision, a group that understands that there are 
two ways of talking acknowledges this point of 
deliberation and consciously chooses to engage 
in either dialogue or discussion. Deliberation in 
its Latin root, deliberare, means to weigh, as in 
to evaluate, assess, or ponder.
Group members have this choice point 
available to them only when they have road 
maps for ways of talking and consciousness 
about group processes and group purposes. A 
significant part of this awareness is recognizing 
that culturally embedded patterns shape be-
haviors—patterns from the larger surrounding 
culture and patterns from organizational and 
group culture. Many groups default into the 
Western cultural habit of polarized discussion 
and debate. Our media-saturated world bom-
bards us with arguments framed by commen-
tators as point-counterpoint, pro and con, left 
versus right, and other polarities, the regret-
table byproduct of the contentious Gore Vidal 
and William F. Buckley debates televised at 
the presidential conventions of 1968. These 
models transfer to conversations in working 
groups; they then frame how participants listen 
to others and how and when participants speak. 
If group members are not careful, they end up 
listening not to understand, but to hear gaps in 
the logic of other speakers, or they interrupt to 
make a point even before the current speaker is 
finished. Conversations then break down into 
verbal combat, with winners and losers.
All too often, valued colleagues become 
conscientious objectors, choosing not to partici-
pate in the fray. The group then loses perspective 
and potential alternative viewpoints. The loudest 
and most persistent voices become the policy-
makers, and in the worst cases, the process sows 
the seeds of passive noncompliance or sabotage 
in those who feel excluded or devalued.

The Adaptive School

When groups understand that they have 
more than one way of talking available to them, 
they can consciously choose to pursue the path 
of dialogue or to follow the path of discussion. 
Most important issues require explorations 
along both pathways. Many sensitive issues, 
especially those with high stakes for the partic-
ipants, call for separate sessions in which the 
dialogue and discussion are separated in time 
and sometimes space. One useful facilitation 
technique is to explicitly label agenda items 
as either dialogue or discussion and offer lan-
guage models to further mark the distinctions 
between the two forms of discourse.
As group members become more sophis-
ticated with the ways of talking, the pathways 
become more malleable. For example, during a 
dialogue, a group member senses an emerging 
consensus on an issue. He or she then inquires 
if this is so and frames a proposal to move the 
item to a decision. In another case, during a 
discussion, emotions rise and the details be-
come muddled. Someone then proposes that 
the group switch to a dialogue format for a set 
time to explore the feelings and underlying 
issues that are present.
The Path of Dialogue
Dialogue is a reflective learning process 
in which group members seek to understand 
one another’s viewpoints and deeply held as-
sumptions. The word dialogue comes from 
the Greek dialogos. Dia means “through” and 
logos means “word.” In this meaning-making 
through words, group members inquire into 
their own and others’ beliefs, values, and 
mental models to better understand how things 
work in their world. In dialogue, listening is 
as important as speaking. For skilled group 
members, much of the work is done internally.
Physicist and philosopher David Bohm 
(1990) described dialogue as a process of elic-
iting and altering the “tacit infrastructure of 
thought.” As a quantum physicist, Bohm draws 
an analogy between dialogue and superconduc-
tivity. Electrons that are cooled to extremely low 
temperatures dramatically change their behav-
ior, operating more as a coherent whole and less 
as separate parts. In supercool environments, 
electrons flow around barriers and one another 
without resistance, creating very high energy. 
The same electrons radically change behavior in 
a new environment. At higher temperatures they 
operate as separate entities, with random move-
ment and loss of momentum (Isaacs, 1993).
Dialogue creates an emotional and cog-
nitive safety zone in which ideas flow for ex-
amination without judgment. Although many 
of the capabilities and tools of dialogue and 
skilled discussion are the same, their core in-
tentions are quite different and require different 
personal and collective monitoring processes.
Monitoring Dialogue
Mindful group members pay attention to 
three essential elements during productive dia-
logue. They monitor themselves, the process of 
the dialogue, and the new whole that is emerg-
ing within the group.
Self
Dialogue is first and foremost a listening 
practice. When we “listen to our listening,” we 
notice whether we are internally debating with 
the speaker, reviewing our mental catalogue of 
related information and personal anecdotes, or 
composing a response. Noticing these common 
internal processes allows us to switch them off 
so that we can hear others without judging.
Dialogue requires choice making. Typical 
choices include how and when to talk. Do we 
paraphrase prior comments to check for under-
standing and/or synthesis? Do we inquire into 
the ideas and assumptions of others? Do we put 
a new idea or perspective on the table to widen 
the frame?
Listening set-asides (chapter 4) and suspen-
sion are essential internal skills in dialogue. To 
suspend judgment, group members temporarily 
set aside their own perceptions, feelings, and 
impulses and carefully monitor their internal 
experience. Points of personal conflict can eas-

Two Ways of Talking That Make a Difference for Student Learning  	
Chapter 5	
59
ily emerge when we believe that others are not 
hearing us or that they are distorting our point 
of view. Points of conflict also surface when 
our own values conflict with those of a speaker. 
These areas of discomfort influence our listening 
and our responses, which in turn influence the 
thoughts and behaviors of other group members.
Senge, Roberts, Ross, Smith, and Kleiner 
(1994) note that suspension also involves de-
veloping an awareness of our own assump-
tions and purposely “hanging them from the 
ceiling”—that is, suspending them in front of 
the group so that all can examine them. These 
assumptions are beliefs—often unexamined—
about why we think things work as they do. 
Our assumptions drive our perceptions, simul-
taneously opening and blinding us to possibili-
ties in the world around us.
Process
Dialogue as a process requires focusing on 
the goal of developing shared understanding. In 
our action-oriented work environments, this is 
often countercultural. Yet in every group with 
which we’ve worked, all the participants could 
recite examples of decisions that were poorly 
conceived, poorly communicated, simply ig-
nored, or, in the worst cases, violated by many 
organizational members without consequence. 
At the root of all these stories were group pro-
cesses that were not thought out, but rather of-
ten hurried and inappropriately facilitated. The 
rush to action pushed unclear decision-making 
processes and timelines onto the group with-
out sufficient attention to developing a shared 
understanding of both problems and solutions.
By going slow and honoring the flow of 
dialogue, groups can often go fast when they 
get to the choice points in decision-making. 
When the assumptions and the implications of 
those assumptions have been explored during 
dialogue, group members don’t second-guess 
the motives of others during discussions.
Meetings should be safe but not necessar-
ily comfortable. When a group confuses safety 
with comfort, it sacrifices productive tension 
for the ease of conviviality. Humor and banter 
can be avoidance strategies as much as they 
can be social lubricants. A lack of comfort with 
discomfort weakens dialogue and undermines 
the learning possibilities in that moment.
Whole
Thought is both a personal and a collective 
process. We influence and are influenced in 
turn by others. During dialogue, the line be-
tween self and others blurs when we open our-
selves to the possibilities within the communal 
thought space. This created whole is in itself a 
goal of dialogue. Communities move forward 
together. Collective understanding leads to 
shared goals and shared practices that tap the 
power of cumulative effect for student learning 
and for the adult learning community.
The whole is always greater than the sum 
of the individual parts. In many ways it is 
both process and product simultaneously. By 
learning to observe the processes, patterns, 
and results that emerge from our dialogues, 
we can more consciously participate and more 
consciously contribute to the whole of which 
we are the parts.
Understanding as the Outcome
Well-crafted dialogue leads to understand-
ing. This is the foundation for conflict resolu-
tion, consensus, and professional community. 
Decisions that don’t stay made are often the re-
sult of group members feeling left out or having 
their ideas discounted by the group. Dialogue 
gives voice to all parties and all viewpoints.
Misunderstanding lies beneath most in-
tragroup and intergroup conflict. Dialogue 
illuminates and clarifies misunderstandings 
when the underlying values and beliefs are 
brought to the surface for examination. There 
is often alignment at this level; it is at the 
solution level that opinions differ. Working 
from a foundation of shared understanding, 
group members can more easily and rationally 
resolve differences, generate options, and 
make wise choices when they move to the 
discussion side of the journey.

The Path of Discussion
Discussion, in its Latin root discutere, 
means “to shake apart.” It focuses on the 
parts and their relationships to one another: 
the causes, the effects, and the ripple effects 
of proposed actions and solutions. In its most 
ineffective forms, discussion consists of serial 
sharing and serial advocacy without much 
group-member inquiry into the thinking and 
proposals of others. Participants attempt to 
reach decisions through a variety of voting 
and consensus techniques. When discussion 
is unskilled and dialogue is absent, decisions 
are often low-quality, represent the opinions of 
the most vocal members or leader, lack group 
commitment, and do not stay made.
Three elements (chapter 6) shape skilled 
discussions: (1) clarity about decision-making 
processes and authority; (2) knowledge of the 
boundaries of the topics open to the group’s 
decision-making authority; and (3) standards 
for orderly decision-making meetings. Most 
meetings are, in fact, structured discussions.
Monitoring Discussion
Mindful group members pay attention to 
three essential elements during productive dis-
cussion. They monitor themselves, the processes 
of skilled discussion, and the details of the 
problem solving, planning, and decision-making 
processes in which they are engaged.
Self
Productive discussions require group mem-
bers to have emotional and mental flexibility. 
When our goal is to influence the thinking of 
others and we give up the model of winning or 
losing, we are more able to notice our thoughts 
and actions and the effects of those thoughts 
and actions on others.
Mentally, this requires taking a balcony 
view. This perceptual position is neither ego-
centric (I am intensely aware of my thoughts, 
feelings, and intentions and know my own 
boundaries) nor allocentric (I am aware of 
how something looks, feels, and sounds from 
the point of view of another). The balcony 
view is a third perceptual position, a macro-
centric perspective, in which, with compas-
sion and detachment, we try to understand the 
nature of the situation the group is in at the 
moment. It is with this view, looking down 
upon the group, that we gain the most knowl-
edge about our group, the group’s interactions, 
and ourselves.
From the balcony we can make the most 
strategic choices about how and when to par-
ticipate. Should I advocate or should I inquire? 
At what points should I press? When should I 
probe for detail or let go? How might I phrase 
an idea for greatest influence? These are the 
same internal skills that teachers employ when 
they monitor and adjust in their classrooms.
Process
Skilled discussion as a process requires 
mindfulness about focusing on one topic and 
applying one process tool at a time (chapter 
6). When topics and processes blur, group 
members lose focus. To maintain focus requires 
clear structure, purposeful facilitation, impulse 
control on the part of individual group mem-
bers, and recovery strategies if the group strays 
off course.
Effective group members share responsi-
bility with the facilitator for maintaining the 
flow of the discussion, for encouraging other 
group members to share knowledge and ideas, 
and for hearing and exposing points of confu-
sion or murkiness.
When working groups stray from skilled 
discussion, they often move to an unskilled 
form of debate. This occurs when group mem-

Two Ways of Talking That Make a Difference for Student Learning  	
Chapter 5	
61
bers overlook the useful advocacy of ideas and 
proposals and start listening for and challeng-
ing the fallacies in the arguments of others. 
Battuere, the Latin origin of the word debate, 
means “to fight or beat down.” When meetings 
descend to the level of street debate rather than 
academic debate, we focus on beating down 
the ideas of others. Scoring points becomes the 
goal, and winning comes from intimidation and 
intonation as much as from—or more than—
logic or reason.
Details
Whereas successful dialogue requires atten-
tion to the whole, successful discussion focuses 
on the details, both in isolation and in their 
interactions. The path of discussion is also the 
path of decision. As such, groups need to iden-
tify any constraints under which they might be 
working, such as timelines, deadlines, budgets, 
product standards, nonnegotiable items, task 
assignments, and, most important, who they are 
in the decision-making process. Groups skilled 
in discussion employ many intentional cognitive 
skills. There is no set sequence for these efforts. 
The task before the group determines the neces-
sary intellectual tool kit.
Groups need tools for the following:
•	
Generating ideas, including a repertoire of 
brainstorming and creative thinking strate-
gies and protocols;
•	
Organizing ideas, including both concep-
tual and graphic tools;
•	
Analyzing ideas, including a variety of 
tools for illuminating assumptions and 
clarifying particulars;
•	
Deciding among alternatives, including the 
clarification of decision-making roles and 
processes.
Decision as the Outcome
Decision, in its Latin root decidere, 
means “to cut off or determine.” In practice 
this means to cut off some options. The pur-
pose of discussion is to eliminate ideas from 
a field of possibilities and allow the stronger 
ideas to prevail. Groups must learn to separate 
people from ideas in order for this to work ef-
fectively. If ideas are “owned” by individuals, 
then to cut the idea away is the same as cutting 
the person away. Ideas, once stated, should 
belong to the group, not to individuals. In this 
way they can be shaped, modified, and dis-
carded to serve the group’s greater purposes. 
The next chapter will address decision-mak-
ing issues in greater detail.
Professional Community
Professional community is both a cause 
and an effect of the two ways of talking. As 
a cause, being in a community provides the 
motivation and vision of ways of interacting 
and working together. As an effect, a strong 
professional community results from both what 
is talked about and how people talk. Such talk 
requires courage, confidence in self and others, 
and skillfulness in applying the maps and tools 
for developing shared understanding and strate-
gic decision-making practices.
Consensus as the Holy Grail
Consensus is one form of decision making, 
but not the only form. Some groups get stuck 
trying to use consensus processes without a 
consciousness of the difference between dia-
logue and discussion.
There are two types of consensus: (1) 
opening consensus, which develops through 
dialogue, and (2) focusing consensus, which 
develops through discussion. Opening consen-
sus involves the consideration of perspectives 
and possibilities. Focusing consensus involves 
winnowing choices by clarifying criteria and 
applying these criteria to the choices. Focusing 
consensus for complex decisions depends on 
effective opening consensus.
Ultimately, consensus is a value and a be-
lief system and not simply a decision-making 
process. Unless groups are willing to hang 

The Adaptive School
62
out with the process for as long as it takes, 
they are not usually ready for full consensus 
decision making.
Most groups with whom we work are 
better served by “sufficient consensus.” This 
generally means that at least 80 percent of 
the group is willing to commit and act. It also 
means that the others agree not to sabotage. 
Sufficient consensus relies on both dialogue 
and discussion for its effectiveness. The prac-
tice of balancing advocacy and inquiry is 
essential. Any dissenting voices must be able 
to influence and persuade 80 percent of the 
group to carry the day. This also means that 
other group members can paraphrase and draw 
matters to a close when only a few voices line 
up on one side of an issue. Groups more easily 
come to common ground when they distinguish 
positions (divisive) from concerns.
Norms and Values
Professional community is built on the 
bedrock of norms and values, which are both 
honed by dialogue and discussion. Strong 
schools have core values about how children 
learn, what they should learn, and how faculties 
should work together. Some norms about fac-
ulty work are philosophical (e.g., everyone can 
be involved in decision making, or no one has 
to be involved, but once decisions are reached 
they are binding on everyone). Carl Glickman 
(1993) calls this a charter, or guiding rules of 
governance. This type of norm signals what is 
important to the organization.
Another type of norm specifies how the 
values of the organization can be achieved. 
Our work with schools emphasizes the use of 
the seven norms of collaboration described in 
the previous chapter. When school faculties 
make these seven tools into norms—that is, 
normal operating behaviors in formal and in-
formal interactions within the school—adult 
relationships improve, groups work skillfully 
to explore members’ mental models and as-
sumptions, and both dialogue and discussion 
are served. These norms also have a tremen-
dous payoff in the classroom for both teacher- 
student interactions and student-student inter-
actions. In many cases faculties take them on 
with the dual agenda of enhancing both faculty 
and student performance.
Getting Started
The collaborative norms of the group (chap-
ter 4) have more influence on the possibility of 
success than do the knowledge and talents of the 
group facilitator. Thus, our staff development 
energies must go to groups, not to designated 
leaders of groups. We have found this to be 
helpful in groups that achieve high levels of 
skills in the challenging talk that is required in 
professional communities.
Any group that is too busy to reflect on its 
work is too busy to improve. Every working 
group has many more tasks to do than time in 
which to do them and so is naturally reluctant 
to spend time monitoring and reflecting on 
its working processes. Many groups commit 
themselves to a task-process ratio to overcome 
this tendency; they budget a protected per-
centage of each meeting for examining how 
well the group is working and what it might 
do to improve.
Reflection can take many forms. Typically 
the least effective form involves a process ob-
server—a special role for gathering data about 
the frequency or distribution of behaviors that 
the group believes are important. Because this 
places the gathering of data outside the group 
members, they ultimately become less accurate 

Two Ways of Talking That Make a Difference for Student Learning  	
Chapter 5	
63
in gathering their own data and self-assess-
ments. A process observer can be useful when 
after gathering requested data, the data are 
shown without comment and members are 
invited to interpret them. The most effective 
form is through reflection on the four capa-
bilities described in chapter 4. This can occur 
through journal writing, round-robin reflection, 
and dialogue that is focused on personal and 
collective learning about the power of attention 
to process. For reflecting on discussions use the 
meeting inventory (appendix I) in which mem-
bers assess criteria for successful meetings.
Human beings are a social species. Living 
and working in groups is an important part of 
our genetic heritage. It is ironic, then, that in 
many schools, professionals who are charged 
with preparing students to be successful, col-
laborative citizens are themselves cut off from 
the rich resources offered by true collegiality. 
That we talk together in our schools is vitally 
important in these changing times. How we 
talk is just as important, for it is how we talk 
that influences the personal and collective sat-
isfaction that motivates us to effectively talk 
together in our schools.


65
Meetings can be and are successful in many 
settings. In working with countless schools 
on several continents over the years, we’ve 
seen good meetings get better and poor ones 
become satisfying and effective. In part III, we 
will reveal the surprisingly simple patterns for 
making this happen. These ideas are straight-
forward conceptually, but not always easy to 
implement. Many groups have unproductive 
patterns of behavior that require unsticking to 
make room for new habits.
Successful meetings are those in which 
a great deal of work is done in a minimum 
amount of time with a great deal of member 
satisfaction. Three factors contribute to produc-
ing such meetings. (1) Adopting five meeting 
standards, informed by research and proven 
effective in the field. (2) Working from sound 
agendas. Good agendas require planning, just 
as is true for good lessons. This section of the 
book offers principles for agenda design and 
samples of model agendas. (3) Applying skill-
ful meeting facilitation concepts, strategies, 
and moves. While many of the skills involved 
are similar to making presentations to groups, 
the facilitation role is more complex. This 
leadership role requires neutrality toward the 
meeting content, a process tool kit for helping 
the group get its work done, and the courage to 
intervene when needed to support task focus 
and group development.
PART III	
MEETINGS ARE  
TEACHERS’ WORK

I
n chapter 1, we described schools as complex or dynamic systems. So too 
are groups of educators working together, such as faculties, departments, 
grade-level teams, and administrative cabinets. What happens in these groups 
influences other gatherings of educators throughout the system and can instill ef-
fectiveness, efficacy, and meaningful effort within an organization’s DNA.

Enhance Social Capital
Human, social, and decisional capital are

Fullan, 2012). Together, they form professional 
capital. Human capital refers to highly quali-
fied teachers with knowledge of content, stu-
dent learning characteristics, sound preservice 
work, emotional intelligence, and capability 
in relationships. Social capital refers to trust, 
collaboration, collective responsibility, peer 
pressure and support, mutual assistance, and 
networks. Decisional capital refers to teacher 
judgment, experience, practice, and the ability 
to reflect alone and together on their practices 
and to adjust practice to improve students’ 
learning accordingly.
Well-run meetings produce specific benefits 
in social capital including norms of reciprocity, 
clear communication, and operationally sound 
information flow. At the heart of these meeting 
is professional discourse. It occurs informally 
within disciplines as well as across disciplines, 
grade levels, departments, and faculties. It oc-
curs in pairs, trios, and large groups. It occurs 
spontaneously and when planned. It happens in 
meetings. It is in meetings that teachers work 
together to improve instructional practice and 
performance. It is in meetings that teachers 
clarify policies, identify and address problems, 
assess standards, and modify schedules. It is in 
meetings that faculties respond to the changing 
needs of students, standards, and curriculum 
demands. It is in meetings that groups mature 
and manage differences, and it is in meetings 
that their working culture evolves—or stays 
the same.
Meetings have a greater effect on organi-
zational success than initially meets the eye. 
First, effective and time-efficient meetings pro-
duce work that is important to the school. Sec-
ond, well-conducted meetings promote mem-
ber satisfaction, the capacity to collaborate, 
and a willingness to conscientiously contribute. 
Third, the more successful groups are at getting 
important work done in meetings, the greater 
their collective efficacy, a resource that is un-
deniably linked to student success. (We will 
say more in the next chapter about designing 
for efficacy.) Finally, members of successful 
groups ultimately become members and leaders 
elsewhere and enrich the quality of work done 
by units within the school and the district. For 
these reasons, knowing how to produce work 
through meetings has become an essential part 
of a professional portfolio, regardless of an 
individual’s role.
This chapter describes what members need 
to know and be able to do to have meetings that 
are productive, time-efficient, and satisfying. 
As noted earlier, teachers acquire social capital 
in these meetings. They also develop decisional 
capital as they gain wisdom and discernment 
relating student assessment data to instruc-
tional decisions. As we described in chapter 4, 
two ways of talking support such learning in  

The Adaptive School
68
working groups: dialogue and discussion. Dia-
logue, which leads to understanding, is a nec-
essary precursor to discussion, which leads to 
significant decisions.
Talking to Decide
Inquiry into the craft of meetings is fun-
damental for effective meetings. This inquiry 
should include questions on (1) how to distin-
guish the urgent from the important; (2) how to 
stay on track, on topic, and focused; (3) how to 
use conflict constructively; (4) how to orches-
trate space and materials; and (5) how to make 
decisions that stay made. This is important 
for leaders and members, for, as we shall see, 
skilled members have more influence on meet-
ing success than good facilitators do.
Three organizing principles guide meeting 
productivity and satisfaction: a collaborative 
mindset, positive relationships, and collective 
energy sources. These are described below.
Collaborative Mindset
Meeting success is influenced more by the 
collaborative mindset of the group than by the 
knowledge and skill of the group’s facilitator. 
Schwartz (2013) reports that over 90 percent 
of teams have a unilateral control mindset, 
ascribing to the leader the right and respon-
sibility to make decisions for the team. An 
alternative mindset is collaborative, recogniz-
ing that “at any given moment, the insight and 
ability to move the team forward might come 
from anyone at the table” (p. 10). We refer to 
group members having this mindset as engaged 
participants. The overriding commitment of 
groups with a collaborative mindset is to work 
with others to achieve shared goals. For a 
committee, task force, department, or faculty 
to achieve this commitment, the members need 
to have the skills and knowledge for producing 
work in meetings. Counterintuitively, this is 
more important than the skills of a good facili-
tator. Imagine an athletic team playing without 
goals, knowledge of the rules of the game, an 
awareness of other positions, and some sense 
of common strategy. As much as a football 
team needs a coach, it also needs players who 
have a common understanding of the game and 
who are committed to achieving the goals and 
improving their individual and collective per-
formance. Whether or not a group knows that 
it is directing its own dynamics, this is the most 
determining factor in accomplishing work.
Positive Relationships
The power of a group to produce results is 
rooted in the quality of the relationships among 
the participants. The highest performing groups 
have far more positive than negative communi-
cations, with a positivity ratio of roughly six to 
one (Losada and Heaphy, 2004). Becoming a 
learning community that focuses on improving 
practice and developing shared accountabil-
ity is a goal for many groups. As evidence 
mounts that student learning is the result of 
such cumulative effort, teachers increasingly 
need the skills to conduct productive meetings 
in which they generate the know-how and the 
will to inquire into student learning, dialogue 
about data, assess and refine instruction, raise 
student achievement, and enhance professional 
community. To achieve this requires skillful 
collaboration. Collaboration is not easy, nor has 
it been previously required in most schools. It 
implies shared objectives, a sense of urgency 
and commitment, mutual trust and respect, in-
tellectual agility, and the application of diverse 
skills and knowledge. Achinstein (2002) notes 
the following:
When teachers collaborate, they run headlong 
into enormous conflicts over professional 
beliefs and practices. In their optimism about 
caring and supportive communities, advo-
cates often underplay the role of diversity, 
dissent, and disagreement in community life, 
leaving practitioners ill-prepared and concep-
tions of collaboration under explored. (p. 5)
Collaboration requires the development 
and exercise of social, emotional, and cogni-

69
tive skills. Inquiring into the views of others 
requires fluency in each of these skills sets and 
is essential to problem solving and working 
with conflict. High-performing groups are not 
only more positive than negative, but balance 
inquiry with advocacy on about a one-to-one 
ratio (Losada and Heaphy, 2004). To demand 
collaboration without providing training is like 
the government mandating a program without 
providing the money to implement it.
Collective Energy Sources
The third organizing principle comes from 
cognitive social theory. The culture of the 
workplace influences what teachers do and 
how they think more than their training, expe-
rience, or knowledge influences what they do. 
Cognitive social theory holds that robust social 
norms and behaviors exert an influence on 
the individual members of a group. The work 
culture inhibits or amplifies the learning of its 
members. Well-structured meetings are one 
way to influence working culture.
In our work we have noticed that five 
sources of collaborative energy become self-or-
ganizing values for high-performing groups: 
efficacy, flexibility, craftsmanship, conscious-
ness, and interdependence. We introduced 
these in chapter 4, and readers who are famil-
iar with “Cognitive Coaching” will recognize 
them as the five states of mind held by individ-
uals (Costa and Garmston, 1994, 2002, 2016; 
Costa, Garmston, and Zimmerman, 2014). 
How groups take on collaborative energy is an 
important question because collective efficacy 
is consistently and positively related to in-
creases in student achievement. Experts in any 
field look below surface behaviors to analyze 
the sources of successes and challenges. Paying 
attention to the flow and interchange of energy 
as much as to things is the key to successful 
school leadership. Chapter 10 describes how 
to detect the five energy sources and influence 
them. Here we describe their basic features.
Efficacy. Collective efficacy is consistently 
related to improved student achievement. Col-
lective efficacy beliefs seem to influence group 
performance by shaping the behavioral and 
normative environment of schools (Goddard, 
2001). Groups with efficacy judge themselves 
to have the knowledge, skills, and will to meet 
goals and overcome obstacles to learning and 
behave accordingly. Efficacious groups use 
more creative approaches to problem solv-
ing, persevere longer, work more diligently, 
and achieve outcomes more successfully than 
groups without efficacy. The greater the collec-
tive efficacy of a school, the more that teachers 
persist in their pursuit of excellence. If most 
teachers in a school believe that the faculty 
can successfully teach students, it becomes the 
norm for teachers to help the students achieve 
high levels (Goddard, 2001).
Flexibility. To inquire into data, to de-
velop theories of causation and solutions for 
academic challenges, requires an ability to set 
aside the first (too) easy answers and continue 
to delve from various perspectives. Groups 
who develop this energy source honor and 
value diversity inside and outside the group, 
attend to both rational and intuitive ways of 
thinking, collectively shift perspective, and uti-
lize a wide array of thinking and process skills. 
Such groups can also navigate the internal 
tensions that are related to confusion and ambi-
guity and open capacity for generating multiple 
ideas for moving ahead.
Craftsmanship. Like the mindsets of ex-
pert performers—musicians, artists, teachers, 
craftspeople, and athletes—groups with crafts-
manship take pride in their work and consis-
tently strive to improve current performance. 
Craftsmanship—the drive for elaboration, clar-
ity, refinement, and precision—is the energy 
source from which groups set demanding goals 
for themselves and ceaselessly work to deepen 
their knowledge, skills, and effectiveness.
Consciousness. To have consciousness is 
to be mindful—moving beyond habituated 
thinking to thoughtful choice. Consciousness is 
a prerequisite to self-control and self-direction. 
Groups that tap this energy source maintain 
an awareness of their values, norms, and iden-

The Adaptive School

tity; monitor the congruence of their espoused 
beliefs and their manifested beliefs; and stand 
outside themselves to reflect on their processes 
and products.
Interdependence. Interdependent groups 
value and trust the process of dialogue, have 
an awareness of their multiple relationships 
and identities with other groups, and regard 
disagreement as a source of learning and 
transformation.
Three Success Structures
We now turn our attention to three success 
structures. We use the term structure to describe 
a system of order and organization. Effective 
social structures honor the dynamic relationship 
of parts and bring them together into a workable 
whole. Since any group brings a variety of men-
tal models, cognitive styles, personal histories, 
and individual agendas to its work, the potential 
for chaotic interaction always exists. Providing 
structures permits a full and focused expression 
of these differences in a manner that is useful to 
the work and life of the group.
The following three structures, taken to-
gether, guide groups to continual success. Each 
addresses significant questions in the work life 
of groups.
1.	
Who decides? What topics are ours? What 
decsion-making processes will be used?
2.	
What meeting room features (the sur-
round) will support the work?
3.	
What are the meeting standards that sup-
port us in staying focused and effective?
Who Decides?
Is a decision to be made by certain individ-
uals within the group, by the group as a whole, 
by the person who convened the group, or by 
some person or group not present at this meet-
ing? Groups are most effective and productive 
when they are clear about whether their role is 
to inform, recommend, or decide.
Ask any group to describe instances in 
which a lack of decision-making clarity led to 
confusion and poor implementation, and you 
will hear many examples. We worked with a 
group once whose members discovered that 
they didn’t know who would make the decision 
on the topic they were discussing. Yet they vig-
orously continued to work on the issue within 
this conceptual vacuum.
Trust diminishes when a group is not clear 
about who is making the final decision and 
what decision-making processes will be used. 
When group members lose trust, second-guess-
ing, resistance, or lengthy and unproductive 
process arguments can occur. This steals time 
and, more important, saps group energy, effi-
cacy, and motivation to persevere on important 
agenda items.
When curriculum committees understand 
that a final decision will be made by the school 
board, they can strategically plan their time. 
Thus 80 percent of committee time might be de-
voted to becoming as clear as possible about the 
recommendations they will make to the board. 
The other 20 percent of the time might be used 
to study and implement ethical systems of influ-
ence. Many a curriculum committee has been 
dismayed to have its recommendations denied 
because it had not brought the board along in the 
deliberations. The following are possible levels 
of authority for decision making:
•	
An individual or group above you;
•	
An administrator unilaterally;
•	
An administrator with input;
•	
An administrator and staff by consensus;
•	
A staff with input from administrators;
•	
A staff by consensus;
•	
A staff by a vote;
•	
A subgroup of a staff with input from 
others;
•	
A subgroup of a staff unilaterally;
•	
Individual staff members, selecting from a 
menu of options.

Constituents will blame the process when 
unhappy with the outcome. One of us worked 
in a district in which a neighborhood school 
was to be closed. A representative community 
commitee met several times, examined data, 
formulated criteria and recommendations, and 
forwarded this work to the superintendent. He 
then examined the committee’s work with the 
administrative cabinet and made a recommen-
dation to the school board. When the board 
announced the school would be closed, all hell 
broke out. Why? The process was sound, but 
had not been overcommunicated, thus consit-
uents, both community and staff, assumed the 
decision had been in the superintendent’s desk 
since the start of the study. Mistrust clouded 
each new step in managing the transition.
Clarity about decision making is so crucial 
that we suggest that facilitators name the ulti-
mate decision maker(s) and decision process 
as many as four times. Why overcommunicate 
like this? When people are investing energy 
in topics important to them, they often forget 
that there might be other parties in the deci-
sion-making chain. Thus, while introducing an 
item, the facilitator could say, “On this topic, 
you will be making a recommendation to the 
curriculum committee, which has the final 
say.” During the conversation about the topic, 
the facilitator could say, “As you consider 
how to structure your recommendation to the 
curriculum committee. . . .” At the conclusion 
of the meeting, the facilitator could summarize 
the action taken on each item, again stating on 
which topics the group made a recommenda-
tion or decision. Finally, if there are minutes 
for the meeting, the language should convey 
the level of decision-making authority pos-
sessed by the group. One of us worked with 
a superintendent in an eastern state who was 
particularly adept at maintaining clarity with 
groups about decisions. On one occasion, he 
visited each school’s faculty to seek its input 
on a decision he had to make. He said to 
each group, “Your job is to give me the best 
information possible. Your job is to inform 
me. My job is to make a decision. When I 
do decide, you will hear it first from me.” He 
then asked questions and listened. When his 
decision had been made, he again visited the 
schools. He reported to each staff, “This is the 
decision I made. This is my rationale. Here is 
how your information influenced me.” He then 
responded to questions.
Several months later another issue emerged 
in which the superintendent wanted input from 
the schools. He sent a memo describing the 
situation and saying that if the faculty wished 
to inform him, please send a representative to 
the central office for a meeting at a designated 
time. The teachers said to one another, “He 
really means it.” They had learned to trust the 
process. Teachers went to the meeting and in-
formed the superintendent.
Remember the principle that meeting suc-
cess is influenced more by the collaborative 
mindset of the group than by a skilled facili-
tator? Members, too, share responsibility for 
group consciousness about decision making. 
They can ask naïve questions (appendix A) 
such as “Excuse me. Who makes the final deci-
sion on this?” or “Where does this recommen-
dation go after it leaves us?”
Asking a naïve question is one way that 
group members can effectively offer a correc-
tion to group work. To communicate naïvely 
is to speak with innocence. It is to be artless, 
unaffected, and natural. Naïve questions have 
an intonational quality of childlike inquiry in 
which the question being asked is truly open-
ended. “Who will communicate this decision?” 
and “Who will be informed about this?” are 
examples of naïve questions. They serve the 
group in developing awareness about process, 
and they sometimes serve leaders because the 
question has been overlooked in planning.
A principal from a large urban district 
complained about thirty years of attending dys-
functional meetings. After being introduced to 
naïve questioning, he realized that as a group 
member he could make a difference. He began 
to ask naïve questions and was amazed at the 
influence he held as a group member to get 
meetings on track.

The Adaptive School

One of the best guides for clarity about deci-
sion making is a seminal twelve-step model (fig-
ure 6.2) offered by Saphier, Bigda-Peyton, and 
Pierson (1989). They emphasize that the model’s 
effectiveness comes from making it public.
We advocate sharing and teaching this 
information to all members of an organization 
through modeling and explicit discussion; this 
goal is critical to school improvement. We do 
not do the process “to” or “on” people, nor is it 
a Machiavellian model for working one’s will 
on others. It is, rather, a set of guidelines for 
making good decisions that will stay made.
What Topics Are Ours?
Groups conserve precious energy by fo-
cusing their resources where they have direct 
influence. When the “sandbox” in which a group 
is to “play” is clear to all the members, group 
energy can be powerfully directed at the items it 
can affect. This structure works in tandem with 
the first structure, deciding who decides.

Figure 6.2.  Twelve Steps for Making Successful Decisions

As simple as these two decision-making 
concepts are, they become complex in orga-
nizations in which different groups have in-
tersecting interests. After much deliberation, a 
high school’s faculty members went on a school 
holiday believing that because they had voted 
for a change in the school schedule, it would 
be changed when they returned to school. They 
were stunned to learn that schedule adjustments 
could not be made until administrators consul-
tated with classified staff.
In another case, a teachers’ union spear-
headed a joint project with the administration 
for a site-based decision-making program. One 
provision was a district-level council to oversee 
the site work. The union published the respon-
sibilities and functions of each participating 
group, describing “sandbox” topics and deci-
sion-making authority on some topics. Despite 
good effort, insufficient specificity led to con-
fusion, which in each case required time and 
emotional energy to untangle.
School site councils are common in many 
states and have different but related respon-
sibilies with adminstration and the governing 
board. Councils are often composed of persons 
elected by teaching faculty, support staff, par-
ents and communty members, and the princi-
pal. Their work is complex, often encumbered 
with well-intentioned but burdendome state 
or district regulations. To foster success with 
these groups, districts often provide training 
in managing meetings. We encourage avoiding 
Robert’s Rules of Order for these groups. Rob-
ert’s was designed to protect potentially messy 
gatherings from chaos and disorder—a unilat-
eral control mindset. A collaborative mindset 
using information about meetings provided 
here has been found to be less threatening and 
more productive.
All groups have interests that intersect 
with other groups’ decision-making authority. 
Considerations of collegiality, politics, and ef-
fectiveness must honor these overlapping areas 
of concern. Individual and collective vigilance 
is an essential ingredient of group success. At 
some time in every group’s history, this struc-
ture becomes important to departments, curric-
ulum task forces, advisory groups, grade-level 
teams, site councils, and faculties.
An issue common to many schools is 
who should be responsible for decisions about 
schoolwide policy and practices on student 
discipline. This seems like a simple “sandbox” 
question. However, even the briefest conversa-
tion will reveal that several related questions 
must be explored. (We have labeled these naïve 
questions and listed examples in appendix A.) 
Student discipline is necessary in what areas 
(gum or guns)? Within what parameters (state 
law or district policies)? At what level of au-
thority (unilaterally or in consultation with the 
principal or parents)?
Suzanne Riley, a friend and colleague, was 
asked to consult with an elementary principal 
who was “under siege.” The school technology 
committee, composed of parents and teachers, 
had written and received a technology grant 
from a community business partner. The ini-
tial elation at receiving the funding had been 
replaced by frustration. The committee had 
submitted a list of desired equipment to the 
principal. The principal submitted the requisi-
tion for the equipment, but was then contacted 
by the district technology coordinator, who in-
formed the principal that the desired equipment 
was not compatible with the district master 
technology plan. The principal informed the 
committee. The committee was very upset. One 
of the parents, who was knowledgeable about 
computers, said that the district plan was totally 
outdated. The committee argued that since it 
had secured the funding, it should be able to 
purchase the best available equipment for the 
students. The committee accused the principal 
of wasting its time and ignoring its recommen-
dations. The disagreement escalated into a very 
unpleasant situation. Had the committee and 
principal clarified the “sandbox” issues at the 
beginning of the process, much unhappiness 
could have been avoided.
What decision-making processes will be 
used? Over time, intact groups learn a number 
of decision-making processes. Knowing what 

The Adaptive School
74
process is being used is as important as know-
ing who decides. Collective decision making 
is used to develop criteria for deisions, rank 
related values, or select within alternative ap-
proaches to achieve goals. Voting is the least 
useful approach, typically producing a set of 
“losers” without adequate opportuity to express 
opinions or influence others. Consensus is a 
concept, not a strategy. The most useful con-
sensus strategy we know is sufficient consen-
sus, a process in which 80 percent agreement 
is required to move a proposition forward. 
When a decsion requires implementation by 
group members, ranges of commitment must 
be expressed. Sufficient consensus provides 
this and differeing perpectives can be heard, 
and accomodated when possible. The faciliator 
is responsible for assuring that minority voices 
are heard. It is understood that while some may 
not be fully in agreement with the group’s deci-
sion, each has a professional obligation to carry 
it out. Chapter 8 on faciliation details a number 
of specific decision-making strategies.
What Meeting Room Features  
Will Support the Work?
Consider the ideal meeting room. It is 
probably quiet, comfortable (but not too com-
fortable), and free from distractions. David 
Perkins (1992) defines these and other fac-
tors as part of the surroundings that mediate 
thinking and behavior. Although psychological, 
emotional, cognitive, and physical elements 
contribute to the surroundings, the facilitator 
has the greatest control over the physical ar-
rangements in the meeting room.
Schwartz (2002) describes three principles 
for seating arrangements in meetings, and we 
have added a fourth. They are as follows:
1.	
All participants and the faciliator should 
be able to see and hear each other and 
any visual information presented (e.g., flip 
charts, projected images).
2.	
Arrange the seating to distinguish the par-
ticipants from the nonparticipants.
3.	
The seating arrangement should be spa-
cious enough to meet the needs of the 
group, but no larger.
4.	
The work-group space should accommo-
date physical movement, subgrouping with 
different partners, and personal ownership 
of the entire room rather than of a single 
chair or a table.
Arranging a room to accommodate the first 
principle is rarely a problem when the group 
size is about twenty or fewer. The semicircle, 
U-shape, or oval arrangements shown in figure 
6.3 will easily serve twenty to twenty-five par-
ticipants. As the group size expands up to forty 
or so in a council or decision-making group, ar-
range a series of tables in a herringbone pattern 
to allow all participants to see the facilitator 
and the flip charts. When the group size reaches 
eighty to three hundred people, as it sometimes 
does for community forums, facilitate from a 
set of risers. Position flip charts on the risers 
and use large markers like Washable Marker 
available online and in many office supply 
stores. Regardless of the size of the group, if 
the participants cannot hear one another at any 
time, they should call out, “Louder, please!” 
The facilitator should remind the group of this 
at the beginning of the meeting.
Specific tasks require conscious room ar-
rangement and provision of materials. The 
room arrangement communicates and struc-
tures the desired interaction.
Keep in mind that if eleven million bits of 
information are bombarding the participants 
each second, ten million come through the 
eyes, and only 40 percent of all that information 
is being processed consciously. Visual displays 
are more important for working groups than 
we have previously thought. Lightweight nylon 
banners displaying seven norms of collabora-
tion, two ways of talking, meeting standards, 
and group member capabilities are available at 
www.thinkingcollaborative.com for display in 
meeting rooms.
High-performing groups post charts that 
state outcomes for their tasks and charts that 

Well-Run Meetings Enhance Social Capital 	
Chapter 6	
75
remind the participants of the agenda, working 
agreements, and other central foci like collab-
orative norms. These groups chart for group 
memory during discussions. They choose strat-
egies that include a visual component.
Group memory and graphic processes sup-
port learning and retention. Charting materials 
such as markers, tape, pads, and easels should 
be readily available. Wall space should also be 
considered. Blank walls without other artwork 
are best for meeting rooms. This lets each 
group craft the space to its own needs. When 
groups become fatigued, auditory functions 
are the first to go. The very best markers we 
have found for facilitaton and presentations are 
Charters® Markers available at Grove Consult-
ing (store.grove.com). Another useful brand, 
not as expensive, is Mr. Sketch Markers avail-
able online and in office supply stores. In video 
6.1 the narrator describes room arrngment con-
cepts and materials.
Many public bodies and decision-making 
groups work in settings in which others are 
present to observe, inform, or advocate. It is 
easier for the facilitator to monitor the moods, 
interactions, and energy of the members when 
the seating arrangements distinguish them from 
nonmembers. We’ve seen several arrangements 
for this. For instance, a council of eight to 
twelve people is seated, facing one another, 
Figure 6.3.  Room Arrangement

around a large conference table. Behind them 
are seated staff members and resource persons 
who may periodically be asked to “come to the 
table” to give a report, offer an opinion, or give 
information on a topic.
In another arrangement, involving a group 
of about forty people, of whom fifteen are re-
source people and guests, the entire group is 
seated together at tables during the dialogue 
portions of the meeting. The reason for this is to 
get a rich interplay of ideas and information from 
different perspectives. “King Arthur knew what 
he was doing,” says Burleson (1990, p. 131). At a 
round table the distance across to another partici-
pant is less and the feeling of group involvement 
is heightened When the group shifts to a deci-
sion-making mode, however, the guests either 
leave or sit in a different part of the room. Policy 
boards sometimes formalize this in bylaws: “De-
cision making will be by 80 percent consensus 
of those present and voting. Only members shall 
advocate and vote in council meetings.”
Facilitators and recorders usually stand or 
sit in a location that physically distinguishes 
them from the other group members (see figure 
6.4). Like an orchestra conductor, the facilitator 
strategically uses space, tempo, posture, and 
gesture to keep the group moving together.
In figure 6.4 the facilitator’s role is indi-
cated by the figure in the center. The figure in 
the upper right indicates the position of the re-
corder. The arrow indicates an aisle giving the 
facilitator freedom to move within the group.

ticipants can easily access visual data; second, 
they can see the facilitator, recorder, and one 
another; and third, because this arrangement is 
for a decision-making meeting, participants are 
seated close together with no empty chairs to 
prevent “energy leaks.”
Two of the most important facilitator re-
sponsibilities are to focus the group on one topic 
at a time and one process at a time (see “De-
veloping Standards,” below). Space, flip charts, 
other visual displays, gestures, and the position 
of the facilitator’s body become valuable tools 
for focusing the group. In addition, all facilitator 
communications are enhanced when nonverbal 
signals are congruent with the purpose and 
the facilitation language. For example, people 
consciously direct their attention to an area at 
which someone points and unconsciously attend 
to where the person’s eyes are looking. Thus, 
recorders who point to a flip chart and direct 
their eyes to the same spot not only focus group 
energies there, but also ensure facilitator control 
of focus by not looking at the group.
Stand in one spot to give directions. Move 
to a new space to ask for clarification. This “vi-
sual paragraph” separates the intention of the 
two messages both verbally and nonverbally. 
Chapter 8 describes the facilitator role in detail 
and offers many nonverbal facilitation strate-
gies to direct. In video 6.2, a narrator describes 
a facilitors’s use of the visual paragraph as we 
observe the facilitator give instructions.
Skilled groups develop a variety of seating 
patterns and room arrangements to support 
different types of social and cognitive inter-
actions. Planning these setups is part of the 
meeting design process. Groups and meeting 
designers who lack this awareness can get 
trapped by the default furniture configurations 
of the rooms in which they work. Moving the 
furniture to support productive group work is 
an important part of a meeting’s success.
One vital consideration is to remove any 
empty chairs from the work area. In both di-
alogue and discussion settings, empty chairs 
draw energy from the group and increase both 
the physical and psychological divide among 
the participants. The actual physical removal 
of unused chairs sends a powerful message to 
the group about the need for connection. This 
is reinforced when latecomers have to move a 
chair to join the group.
When people in meetings sit where they 
always sit, they tend to see what they always 
see and say what they always say. Group 
members will initially sit where they are most 
comfortable; let them. However, people uncon-
sciously become territorial in meetings quite 
easily. You might have noticed that in groups 
that meet periodically, the members will take 
the same space that they occupied in the last 
meeting. There are two generic advantages 
for periodically changing the seating arrange-
ments. First, it produces energy to move and 
sit with someone else. Group deliberations can 
be deadening, and thinking deadened, without 
physical movement.
Second, subgroup conversations that are 
always held with the same person or small 
group impose limitations on thinking. Con-
ceptual boundaries are formed by these con-
sistent relationships, backgrounds, cognitive 
styles, and positions. Moving members into 
different conversational subgroups brings

fresh thinking. Occasionally, changing seat-
ing can serve other purposes as well, such as 
breaking up a clique or signaling a transition 
from one agenda item to another.
Certain tasks are done more effectively 
with special room arrangement and provision. 
For example, planning, problem solving, and 
decision making require access to multiple 
kinds of data. In addition to working with lap-
tops, tablets, and projector; writing on charts; 
and information posted on the walls become 
group memory devices. Many times we have 
witnessed a group fall silent while members 
scan what is on display, linking and relating 
information to the next task in their project.
Perhaps more important than serving 
memory, what is written becomes a visual 
voice—always in the room, never silent, in-
teracting with group-member thinking. Many 
high-performing groups post charts to clarify 
tasks and remind members of working agree-
ments. Some groups keep lists of collaborative 
norms, meeting standards, and group-member 
capabilities on permanent display. Further-
more, the act of composing language for pub-
lic recording interacts with thinking, forcing 
greater specificity, economy, and consensus. In 
video 6.4 the importance of markers, tape, flip 
charts, and wall space is noted.
Technology Use in Meetings
In meetings with or without technology, 
the facilitator’s functions remain the same: to 
focus energy and attention and to support the 
group in collaboratively attaining its goals. 
Central to this is maintaining the first two 
standards of effective meetings which are to 
manage one process at a time and one topic at 
a time which are described later in this chapter.
Technology can be both a boon and a bane. 
Digital devices offer access to information and 
tools that help groups focus on their work by 
increasing productivity and efficiency. Unfor-
tunately, in too many cases, such devices are 
the great distracter, removing group members 
from the task at hand and from their working 
relationships with the colleagues who are in the 
room. To mitigate this latter effect some groups 
develop working agreements to name appropri-
ate ways to respond to text and voice messages 
and clarify when and under what conditions 
this might be appropriate. Mindful teams also 
name the elephant in the room of people bring-
ing personal work to the meeting. Peeking at 
laptops and scrolling through screens on tab-
lets and smart phones has become the modern 
version of members distracted by correcting 
student assignments and grading homework 
during team meetings. Ultimately, if the group 
and its work are valued and intended to pro-
duce value, then full presence with colleagues 
is the price of admission.
Increasingly, working groups need ac-
cess to information held on school, district, 
and state or provincial Web sites. It is more 
productive to have participants share laptops 
or tablets to encourage collaboration with 
text and graphic information rather than work 
on their own devices. When simultaneous 
attention matters it is even better to set up 
a second projector with attached laptop to 
create a group focus for exploring such data. 
The screen for such a set-up should be located 
off to the side, establishing the “Third Point” 
pattern described in appendix A. This set-up 
leaves the main projector and screen available 
for the facilitator to project process directions 
that guide the group’s work.
A growing number of digital tools are 
emerging. Most groups are better off mastering 
and applying a few rather than trying to work 
with too great a variety. One basic toolkit is 
the Google Suite of online resources. Skillful 
groups develop, modify, analyze, and share 
documents, spreadsheets, and graphs using 
Google Drive tools before, during, and after 
Video 6.4.

work sessions. These shared objects encourage 
both synchronous and asynchronous collabo-
ration by keeping the group’s work products 
visible to all.
For larger groups, a second screen is 
sometimes useful for creating a shared space by 
connecting to Web sites such as TodaysMeet.
com. Group leaders can post prompts for small 
groups to consider and then have table groups 
huddle to craft their responses before posting 
them to the site. This pattern gives participants 
voice and provides a sense of the room to all 
involved. This then becomes a structured form 
of the collective pause, protecting time for 
thinking and reflection. The day’s work can 
then be archived and accessed later by inter-
ested participants.
New tools are undoubtedly being devel-
oped as we write these words. An interesting 
example of a recent find is the Post-it Plus 
App which allows users to snap a picture with 
a tablet or smart phone of a set of sticky notes 
and then rearrange the notes on the screen. 
Users can export the screen images to other 
screens and archive them at sites like Dropbox, 
Evernote, and OneDrive. The point here is not 
to become enamored with a specific tool, but 
to focus on the meeting, the tasks, the collab-
orative energy of the group and the group’s 
development as a group by tapping resources 
that serve these purposes.
Developing Meeting Standards
Standards are agreements for ways of 
working together. Although each group is 
responsible for deciding what standards will 
guide its work, we advocate starting with the 
following simple set of standards, because 
whenever we have seen these standards in 
place, we have witnessed successful meetings: 
(a) maximum product, (b) minimum time, and 
(c) maximum member satisfaction. In addi-
tion, when effective groups implement these 
standards, their levels of efficiency, efficacy, 
craftsmanship, and satisfaction soar. When 
ineffective groups adopt them, their produc-
tivity improves.
Doyle and Straus (1993) initially discov-
ered these standards for themselves in the form 
of success principles from attending and ana-
lyzing hundreds of meetings.
They noted that certain elements are com-
mon in all successful groups. A board of direc-
tors, a governmental task force, a student coun-
cil, a citizens’ committee, an administrative 
staff, [and] a radical political group may have 
different values and objectives, but they all face 
similar problems when they hold a meeting.
We have updated the principles to reflect 
current research. Our list of standards for this 
meeting structure is as follows:
1.	
Groups should address only one topic at 
a time.
2.	
Groups should use only one process at a 
time.
3.	
Meetings should be interactive and engage 
balanced participation.
4.	
Decision-making meetings should encour-
age cognitive conflict.
5.	
All parties should understand and agree on 
meeting roles.
Addressing One Topic at a Time
There is a limit to what any individual can 
attend to in the moment. Groups are limited as 
well. If more than one topic is being discussed 
at a time, a group will lack focus, and confu-
sion will reign. We often hear group members 
ask, “Which topic are we on right now?” Doyle 
and Straus (1993) named this a fundamental 
meeting process, a multiheaded animal, “the 
tendency to go off in all directions simultane-
ously” (p. 20).
Multiple-topic discussions start because 
many issues are linked with others or because 
one idea stimulates an associated idea in an-
other person. For example, a subcommittee 
is meeting to recommend new textbooks for 
adoption. One member says, “You know, I’m 

The Adaptive School
80
really pleased that we are working on this task 
because the old textbooks aren’t that useful. 
In fact, I was in the supply room the other day 
and I saw several books just sitting on the shelf 
with dust gathering. I think some teachers are 
not using them at all.” To this, another group 
member responds, “Supply room! I thought 
we asked that it be cleaned up. I was in there 
the other day; it’s still a mess!” Another group 
member says, “Has anyone seen my micro-
scope? I’ve been looking for it. It was in the 
supply room the last time I was there.”
For the linear-minded among us, this type 
of conversation drives us crazy. Here are a 
couple of facilitator moves that can redirect the 
group to one topic.
Relevancy Check. Offer a relevancy check 
by asking, “Please help us understand, Sam, 
how your comment relates to the topic that we 
are discussing.”
“Cape” comments. Use the flip chart like 
a bullfighter’s cape. Sam makes a comment 
(e.g., about cleaning the supply room), and 
the facilitator moves to the flip chart and 
writes “supply room” while saying to Sam, 
“Sam, I know there are several people inter-
ested in this. Let’s put it here so we don’t lose 
it. We’ll come back to it later.” See appendix 
A for this procedure.
Using Only One Process at a Time
Group processes are vehicles to collec-
tively apply cognitive processes to common 
tasks. To generate ideas, to clarify, to ana-
lyze, and to evaluate require different mental 
operations. In order to use one process at a 
time, all group members must know what the 
process is, how it works, and why it is being 
used. Appendix A describes many meeting 
strategies, including some alternatives and 
tips for each one. These can be of great help 
to meeting planners and facilitators. Doyle 
and Straus (1993) observe that facilitators 
who “go slow in order to go fast” can save 
meeting time by frontloading detailed instruc-
tions before they proceed.
Here are some facilitator moves that help 
groups be clear about and honor a process. See 
appendix A for details.
PAG/PAU ensures that members under-
stand the process correctly. It stands for Process 
as Given, Process as Understood. The facilita-
tor communicates each stage in three different 
mediums: space, voice, and language (figure 
6.5). See video 6.3.
Stop and Redirect is a facilitator move to 
correct deviations from a process.
Advertising executive Alex Osborn in-
vented brainstorming nearly a century ago. 
Today it remains one of the most common 
ways groups generate ideas, yet alternatives to 
brainstorming are emerging. They challenge 
the assumption that an absence of criticism is 
necessary for groups to generate a quantity of 
ideas, yet maintain the principle that meetings 
must be safe for members to partipate product-
vely. In a University of California at Berkeley 
experiment, 265 undergraduate female students 
were organized into teams of five and asked

to generate ideas to reduce traffic congestion. 
One-third were instructed to brainstorm, an-
other third received no process instruction, 
and a final third were encourged to debate. On 
average the debating teams generated nearly 
20 percent more ideas than the brainstorm-
ing group. The group receiving no process 
directions performed least well. Debate, in 
this situation, appeared to create more ideas 
because it encouraged greater engagement in 
the ideas of others and causes reassessment of 
one’s own ideas (Lehrer, 2012). It is important 
to note, though, that certain conditions are 
necessary for success in this approach. First, 
a collaborative mindset group with communi-
cation skills directed at constructive criticism, 
not discouraging criticism. Next, clarity about 
the goal and rationale for the process. Lehrer 
(2012) cites research finding that brainstorming 
groups come up with fewer ideas than groups 
in which members work independently and 
then share ideas.
Here are some classic and alternative 
strateies for generating ideas. 
Video 6.4 shows how a facilitator se-
quences responses from a group allowing 
members to listen to others and not worry about 
their turn to speak.
Holding Interactive Meetings  
With Balanced Participation
Groups can plan, share information, prob-
lem solve, evaluate, make decisions, and define 
their boundaries. When you think of these 
purposes for working groups, it is clear that a 
pattern in which one person talks and the rest 
of the people listen is not productive. If you 
have twelve individuals in a meeting, you want 
twelve minds engaged. If you have thirty indi-
viduals, you want thirty minds engaged. Partic-
ipants construct meaning and develop owner-
ship interacting with ideas and each other.
Here are some examples of facilitator 
moves to balance participation:
•	
“Take a moment and jot down your ideas 
on this before we begin sharing.”
•	
“Turn to your neighbor and generate a few 
more ideas. You’ve got thirty seconds.”
Facilitators can employ other strate-
gies and moves (all of which are described 
Brainstorm To Foster 
Quantity of Ideas
•	
Call out ideas. No judgment, criti-
cism or questions  allowed.
•	
One (or two) members record ideas 
on public charts as they are heard.
•	
Quantity is more important than qual-
ity during this phase of group work.
•	
Encourage out-of-the-box ideas.
•	
Build on ideas on the list when you 
can.
•

in detail in appendix A). In “Assumptions 
Wall,” groups bring up and and examine 
their assumptions. This requires recordable 
wall space for subgroups. “In and Out of the 
Frame” provides groups with opportunities to 
get outside their own perspectives to approach 
a topic. In “Corners,” members vote with their 
feet, moving to a place in the room that rep-
resents their position.
Too often we have heard the statement 
that the purpose of participation in meetings 
is for “buy-in.” We discourage the use of this 
phrase because it carries with it suppositions of 
manipulation and inferences that the leader has 
something to sell and the group has an opportu-
nity to buy it. We find, instead, that the purpose 
of participation is to develop ownership. When 
ideas are owned, when values are articulated 
and owned, when beliefs are admitted, when 
plans and programs and strategies are posed by 
the group, commitment is high and the likeli-
hood of successful implementation is great. As 
we shall see in the next principle, ownership 
does not occur without disagreements.
Balanced participation does not mean 
that every member must speak for an equal 
amount of time; it means that the door is open 
for member participation. There are two forms 
in which group members speak: to the entire 
group and to a partner or a small group nearby. 
Facilitate participation by asking individuals 
to share with a partner before speaking or to 
get together with a group of four and identify 
major criteria to be brought before the group. 
Partner talk is the safest form of member par-
ticipation. Moves like these richly engage ev-
eryone in thinking processes. They also offer 
a cloak of anonymity when voices do not wish 
to be identified.
Engage Cognitive Conflict
Meetings must be safe, but not neces-
sarily comfortable. When a group’s meetings 
are always comfortable, the group is probably 
not talking about the right things. Cognitive 
conflict—disagreements among group members 
about substantive issues like goals, values, and 
assumptions—tends to improve team effective-
ness, lead to better decisions, and increase 
commitment, cohesiveness, empathy, and under-
standing. Cognitive conflict occurs as teams ex-
amine, compare, and reconcile these differences.
The problem with encouraging cognitive 
conflict is that once it is aroused, it can be 
difficult to control. If cognitive conflict slides 
into affective conflict, then hostility, avoidance, 
cynicism, or apathy can result. Affective con-
flict focuses anger on individuals rather than 
ideas, and disagreement becomes personalized. 
It can occur when group members lack the 
skills to disagree gracefully. The greatest insur-
ance against affective conflict is group-member 
skills and practice of the seven norms of collab-
oration (see chapter 4).
Conflict about ideas improves decision 
quality but can also weaken the group’s abil-
ity to work together. Resolving this tension is 
especially important when consensus is valued 
and follow-through is required. Teams that 
encourage cognitive conflict without affective 
conflict are characterized by focused activity, 
creativity, open communication, and integra-
tion. They work close to the core of issues and 
are not distracted by trivial points. They en-
The purpose of Brainstorm and Critique 
is to enrich idea generation with psycho-
logically safe critiques.  In this protocol 
described in appendix A, a normal pro-
cess of brainstorming is the first step. 
Next provide some silence in which trios 
critique items on the list thinking of 
alternatives or downsides. Finally these 
ideas are made public and the group, after 
dialoging about this data, uses the rule of 
one-third to identify the top few ideas.
Groups needlessly waste brain cells any-
time a group sits beyond 20 minutes 
without a chance to process information

courage thinking beyond normal options, listen 
to the “minority voice,” encourage dissenting 
opinions, synergize the thoughts and perspec-
tives of different members, and approach prob-
lems from new perspectives. The outcomes of 
conflict are shown in figure 6.6.
Conflict can be an asset to maintaining 
open communication. Members in groups with 
productive conflict challenge each other’s as-
sumptions. They make the fullest possible use 
of all their members, whereas in less effective 
groups there is often a disproportionate contri-
bution from certain members. Good teams seek 
out the opinions of those who are less active 
and moderate the input of those who monop-
olize the conversation. See chapter 12 for how 
certainty, risk, and adaptivity can be unresolve-
able sources of conflict unless understood.
The conditions in which cognitive conflict 
exist without affective conflict call for cognitive, 
emotional, and social maturity. These attributes 
can be scaffolded with the understanding of 
meeting standards, the use of psychologically 
safe protocols (strategies), and the application of 
the seven norms of collaboration.
Understand and Agree on Meeting Roles
Any team works most effectively when 
its members know one another’s responsi-
bilities. The shortstop can anticipate the first 
baseman’s position in relation to first base; 
therefore his throw is effective. The second 
baseman knows that the center fielder will 
back him up on a long ball. Because he can 
count on his teammate, he stays close to sec-
ond base to guard it. The same principle works 
for group meetings. In meetings the group 
members are the utility infielders.
Although there are many possible meeting 
roles, we identify four that are most typically 
found in working groups. These are (a) en-
gaged participant, (b) facilitator, (c) recorder, 
and (d) role or knowledge authority.
Engaged Participant
Because meeting success is influenced 
more by the collaborative mindset of the group 
than by facilitator leadership, we call the people 
who occupy this role “engaged participants” to 
illuminate the active and essential contribution 
they make to the group’s work. Anyone, at 
some time, might be an engaged participant. 
Standing-committee members, participating 
guests at a special session, the recorder or fa-
cilitator before or after serving in those roles, 
and the building administrator can all at some 
time serve as engaged participants. What these 
group members know and do is critically im-
portant to group effectiveness.
In groups with a collaborative mindset, 
engaged participants monitor their personal 
adherence to meeting standards. They notice 
and set aside comments they are about to 
make if the comment would violate the “one 
topic at a time” standard. They also monitor 
the group’s adherence to standards with naïve 
questions. Engaged participants use the seven 
norms of collaboration, seek and provide data,

clarify decision-making processes and levels 
of authority, and perform gatekeeping func-
tions for others. When members are clear they 
have a role in communicating the meeting’s 
content to others, they are more likely to in-
sist on their own clarity (Heifetz, Linsky, and 
Grashow, 2009).
Gatekeeping. Malita might say to Sid, 
“Sid, I’m aware that you haven’t talked for a 
little while. Is there anything that you would 
like to add?” Notice in this interchange that 
Sid is not on the spot to respond. The gate, 
however, has been opened. Similarly, Leonardo 
might say to Aron, “Aron, I know you served 
on a committee like this last year. Do you have 
anything that you’d like to say?” Alejandra 
says to Ken, “Ken, from where I’m sitting, 
your eyebrows look furrowed. What are some 
comments might you like to add?”
Setting and testing working agreements. 
Engaged participants set and test working 
agreements. For example, Jose sets a working 
agreement by saying to the group, “I’m re-
questing that we make an agreement to start our 
meetings on time. I notice that some of us are 
here on time and others are not. Frequently, I 
have to wait fifteen minutes before the meeting 
starts.” Discussion ensues. The group decides 
to begin meetings on time. Several weeks later, 
Anhadh tests the agreement by saying, “I’d like 
to talk about the decision that we made several 
meetings ago to start meetings on time. I notice 
that this is not happening. What do we need to 
do to keep our agreement?”
Testing consensus. Engaged participants 
informally test consensus by summary para-
phrasing. Sometimes they say, “It seems that 
we may have agreement on this. Is that true?” 
or “Could we see a show of thumbs? Thumbs 
up if you are in agreement, thumbs down if not, 
thumbs sideways if you’re not sure or it’s not 
important to you.”
Monitoring internal processes. Engaged 
participants monitor their own internal pro-
cesses and listen to their own listening. They 
become aware of when they have stopped 
listening to others and are following a train of 
thought in their own minds. They recognize 
their emotional responses to other speakers. 
When they are irritated, they notice it, but in-
stead of giving in to the irritation, they locate 
the probable reason. Then they set the feeling 
aside so they can stay fully engaged in the 
conversation. When they are listening to un-
derstand, yet find themselves offering counter-
arguments in their own minds, they notice this 
and suspend the unproductive mental activity.
Finally, engaged participants are conscious 
of the assumptions they bring to a conversation 
and notice how these influence their listening, 
thinking, and speaking.
Facilitator
As you will see in chapter 8, the facilitator 
role requires a sophisticated set of skills. A fa-
cilitator is a third party to a conversation and is 
responsible for process. As a director of process, 
the facilitator knows what kind of structures and 
strategies will be useful in helping the group do 
its work. When the facilitator asks the group 
to use certain procedures or intervenes with 
counterproductive behavior, it is on the basis of 
this process knowledge. A facilitator must be a 
person who is acceptable to all members of the 
group, who is substantively neutral, and who has 
no decision-making authority about the topic.
Although a facilitator displays no prefer-
ence for any of the solutions the group consid-
ers, no facilitator is truly neutral. To be “sub-
stantively neutral” (Schwartz, 2002) means that 
facilitators give no verbal or nonverbal cues 
of their personal reactions to the ideas being 
discussed. Because the facilitator is serving 
the group, not certain members, this display of 
neutrality is important.
Facilitators often start by clarifying their 
own role with the group:
My job is to help you have a conversation 
about these topics in such a way that you 
understand one anothers’ views and the rea-
soning that leads people to those views. In 
this way you have the information with which 
to make informed decisions. I will not share 

Well-Run Meetings Enhance Social Capital 	
Chapter 6	
85
my own views on topics you discuss. How-
ever [this would sometimes be appropriate to 
add], as you know, I have some expertise in 
one of the topics on your agenda. Should you 
like information from me on that topic, let me 
know and I will step out of the facilitation role 
to provide that.
Schwartz (2002) suggests that facilitators 
add another statement to their self-introduction 
in order to reinforce the group’s understanding 
and proactive influence on roles: “Please let 
me know if at any time you think I am acting 
inconsistently with my role. Does anyone have 
any concerns?” With groups that have no his-
tory of working together, the facilitator may go 
on to describe other meeting roles.
Chapter 8 details facilitator functions and 
tools in a meeting and describes how the facili-
tator focuses group energy, keeps the group on 
task, and directs processes.
Recorder
As groups tire, auditory acuity is the first 
modality to fade. Because many meetings 
are long, members begin to tire, or because 
meetings are at the end of the school day and 
members are already tired, public recording is 
critically important for the group’s short-term 
memory. The later in the day the meeting or 
the more fatigued the participants, the more 
public recording is necessary. On average 
humans can manage three to four items of 
information in their working memories (Mos-
kowitz, 2008). Public recording keeps key 
data in front of a group.
Recorders, like facilitators, occupy a posi-
tion of purposeful neutrality. Their function is 
to support the group by maintaining a clear vi-
sual representation of important ideas and data 
and to support the facilitator in managing pro-
cesses as effectively and efficiently as possible. 
The recorder and facilitator also serve as be-
hind-the-scenes custodians, arranging displays, 
clearing out unnecessary data, and arranging 
the room for special activities.
Because you want the faciliator to direct 
the focus of the group, it is advisable that re-
corders look at the charts on which they are 
working, or at the faciliator, instead of at the 
group. Because members’ eyes go in the direc-
tion of the leader’s eyes, recorders looking at 
the group split the visual—and cognitive—fo-
cus of the group.
A great deal of knowledge is emerging 
about the techniques and tools of public re-
cording (Buckley, 2005). Following are sev-
eral basics:
•	
Print rather than write.
•	
Use uppercase and lowercase case letters, 
not all caps.

Use color—alternate green, blue, and 
brown for text. Never use red for text; it is 
hard to read. Reserve red for headlines and 
other organizers. Reserve black for boxes, 
arrows, or other organizers.

Border charts for formal appearance.

Keep your eyes on the chart when you are 
recording. See eye-hand coordination in 
appendix A for rationale and ways to use 
this principle in other settings.

Role or Knowledge Authority
Leaders lead. Principals lead through mod-
eling, and develop leadership in others. In 
the past, the principal has been expected to 
lead meetings, but this is changing. “Because

of their positional authority and control over 
school resources, principals are in a strategic 
position to promote or inhibit the develop-
ment of a teacher learning community in their 
school” (McLaughlin and Talbert, 2006).
Many people lead meetings. Leadership 
roles in meetings are called by many names: 
chairperson, convener, facilitator, leader, con-
sultant, specialist, manager, and others. Be-
cause we see a critical leadership role in meet-
ings that does not include running the meeting, 
we have been searching for a term that might 
be neutral, or at least unlike the other names we 
have for meeting leadership.
The most descriptive term we’ve found so 
far is role authority or knowledge authority. The 
role authority might be the principal in a staff 
meeting, the vice principal if the principal is 
not there, the superintendent in a district office 
meeting, or the assistant superintendent if the su-
perintendent is not there. The knowledge author-
ity might be the literacy coach, at a task force 
dealing with the reading program; the science 
consultant, in a committee addressing a science 
curriculum; or an external consultant charged 
with making recommendations to the group on 
improving organizational effectiveness.
When the role or knowledge authority is 
in a meeting without a facilitator, this person 
typically manages the group processes. He or 
she sets the agenda, decides when to move to 
the next topic, recognizes those who want to 
speak, writes meeting notes to assist remem-
bering, and summarizes actions to be taken. In 
managing all these procedural tasks, the role or 
knowledge authority limits, or at least diffuses, 
the attention given to meeting content and also 
limits group access to the special information 
resources that are part of this person’s particu-
lar role or knowledge expertise.
Without a facilitator, the value of the role 
or knowledge authority’s information is lim-
ited. First, because this leader has to balance 
attention between process and content, there 
is less time for interaction with the content. 
Second, it is extremely rare that a leader can 
maintain the neutrality required of the facili-
tation process give content information to the 
group, and be perceived as neutral. For this 
reason, leaders become more influential and 
the group matures and makes better decisions 
when a person other than the role or knowledge 
authority facilitates the meeting.
When leaders such as department heads or 
principals use the services of a meeting facili-
tator, they will often set meeting schedules, co-
ordinate topics with faculty and others, arrange 
to have department members rotate through the 
facilitator and recorder roles, and codevelop 
the agenda design with the meeting facilitator. 
The role authority will also follow through 
to see that subcommittee tasks are clear, that 
resources are available, and that evaluation of 
processes and products is provided.
In many ways, the role or knowledge au-
thority functions like any engaged participant 
in the meeting, but he or she is also available to 
inform the group about constraints, resources, 
and values related to the topic. Like other group 
members, the role or knowledge authority can 
advocate one’s own ideas as well as inquire 
about the ideas of others. Remember that until 
groups have attained a high state of interde-
pendence, actions in this role will speak louder 
than words.
Can the facilitator or recorder ever speak?
Under certain conditions. Periodically the 
person faciliating or recording may have im-
portant information for the group or may be 
asked for an opinion. In such cases, signal role 
change by asking if it is okay to change hats, 
ask a participant to take over the faciliation or 
recording role and sit as a member of the group 
until you have completed your input. Since 
people are influenced more by what they see 
than what is said, the physcial shift is essential. 
This is especially useful for team leaders and 
department heads who often need to wear two 
hats—faciliator and leader. In some settings, 
content specialists will often facilitate meetings 
in content areas other than their own and a 
special education consultant might periodically 
facilitate the superintendent’s cabinent. For 
principals, turning the meeting over requires

developing a collaborative mindset with the 
faculty and gradually grooming individuals to 
take over the facilitation role.
In one Arizona district that was influenced 
by the concepts and tools presented here, the 
superintendent working with her leadership 
team redesigned their monthly meeting to 
break the pattern of each major department 
head presenting to the whole group in serial 
fashion. As you can imagine, this common way 
of organizing a “meeting” did not energize high 
levels of participation among the group mem-
bers in attendance that were reluctant to raise 
points of confusion or offer alternative view-
points in front of their peers and supervisors.
In the revised scheme, major players, 
including the superintendent and the various 
associates and department leaders arranged 
themselves around the periphery of the room 
with chairs for participants to join them. Then, 
for a set amount of time each district leader 
presented essential information to their small 
group and engaged each group in dialogue and 
discussion about that month’s priorities. After 
a set amount of time, the small groups rotated 
to the next presentation. This format motivated 
district leaders to develop clear outcomes for 
the overall meeting and for their specific seg-
ments. They also reported much higher levels 
of engagement and a greater willingness on the 
part of participants to raise issues and concerns.
Using the Three Success Structures
Every working group needs a declarative 
knowledge of the three success structures. This 
means that members can describe the struc-
tures, their parts, and the principles on which 
they are based. As groups learn from their 
experiences, procedural knowledge will de-
velop, and members will become skillful at ex-
ercising, monitoring, and self-correcting both 
themselves as individuals and the group. One 
way to increase both consciousness about and 
skill in applying the three success structures is 
to use the meeting assessment inventory found 
in appendix I. Regular use of this inventory and 
reflective dialogue with group members about 
the results focuses attention on skill gains and 
sticking points for that group. 
Mature groups eventually acquire a degree 
of conditional knowledge, allowing them to 
recognize when to break the rules and achieve 
their purpose even more effectively. Such pow-
erful and cumulative knowledge can be, and 
is, developed with faculties, committees, task 
forces, cabinets, advisory boards, and other 
groups. It does not have to be lost because of 
changing membership or environmental crises. 
We have facilitated a statewide group respon-
sible for deciding how millions of dollars will 
be used each year to support technology. This 
group met for a full-day meeting three times 
a year. Because members were appointed as 
representatives from regions, membership con-
stantly changed. Yet after a year-and-a-half of 
facilitated meetings, the consensus of the group 
was that “we have become our values and op-
erating principles.” Effective groups develop a 
commitment to practice and monitor their use 
of the three structures.
In any session in which planning, reflect-
ing, or problem solving occurs, the engaged 
participants—that is, the group members—are 
the ones who do the work of the meeting. In 
fact, the meeting’s success is more dependent 
on their informed participation than on the 
skills and knowledge of a boss, a content ex-
pert, or a facilitator. This is especially so in 
small work teams. In large groups a facilitator 
is required to orchestrate and direct the con-
tributions of group members. Group members 
should be able to distinguish between data and 
inference; distinguish relevant from irrelevant 
information, claims, or reasons; identify un-
stated assumptions; and interpret data.
Conclusion
In this chapter we’ve explored foundation 
knowledge for the art and science of meetings. 
Our definition of success for meetings is that 
they take minimum time, produce maximum 
work, and generate a maximum amount of

member satisfaction. The ultimate goal is that 
meetings serve as vehicles to protect and support 
the primary mission of the school, which is stu-
dent learning. At schools and in special district 
committees—McLaughlin and Talbert (2006) 
say this as well—the goal is to study data on 
teaching and learning, and then agree to the next 
steps for changing instruction and for examining 
the effects of change on student learning.
Meetings are becoming as important a part 
of teachers’ work as lesson design. For this 
reason, knowing how to produce work through 
meetings has become an essential part of a 
professional portfolio, regardless of one’s role.
In the next chapter, we explore in detail the 
principles of facilitation, facilitator functions, 
and facilitation tools.
Postscript
While this book was still in development, 
Google released the results of a multi-year 
study of 180 Google teams. The results confirm 
and extend ideas in this book and chapter. Goo-
gle’s approach to the development of teams and 
team leadership applies findings from MIT’s 
Human Dynamics Laboratory.
Psychology safety, more than anything 
else, produces effective group work. Psycho-
logical safety, they found, was based on group 
norms in which individuals set aside their 
personal proclivities during group work and 
honor team norms. Two essential attributes: 
equity of turn-taking and social sensitivity, 
create a climate of interpersonal trust and mu-
tual respect that foster task success. There was 
nothing in the research supporting the idea 
that a certain mix of personalities, skills or 
backgrounds contributes to higher performing 
teams. (Duhigg 2016).
We propose that the seven norms of collab-
oration (chapter 4), two ways of talking (Chapter 
5) and three success structures (chapter 6) forge 
a resilient foundation for psychological safety.

eetings that are well-planned and executed—and the planning is pre-
requisite to the execution—promote one of the most valuable energy 
sources for groups, and the one most consistently related to school 
success: efficacy.
Chapter 7	
Time-Efficient Meetings
Agenda construction is, first of all, a way 
of thinking. There is simply no other activity 
that can economize time and maximize success 
and satisfaction as much as a well-formed 
agenda. The problem, of course, is that it re-
quires time to develop one.
“Prepare more and meet less” is a motto 
for successful groups and effective leaders. 
By making a personal investment in agenda 
design, leaders reduce wasted time by tenfold 
and overall meeting time by as much as 30 per-
cent. This in turn produces dramatic increases 
in productivity and group-member satisfaction.
When leaders value agenda design, de-
partment meetings become better run, ad hoc 
committees function more smoothly, and task 
forces and advisory groups feel better about 
their work and get more done. Being smart 
and proactive about meeting design pays off 
throughout the school and the district.
Smart leaders and facilitators value meet-
ing planning in the same way that high-per-
forming teachers value planning for instruc-
tion, because it influences the success of what 
follows.
Groups meet for many reasons in schools. 
Each meeting provides opportunities to both 
manage the work of the group and the school 
and to increase the group’s capacity to do richer 
and deeper work. Once again, both things and 
energy matter. Smart agendas help groups that 
meet for planning and problem solving get 
better at planning and problem solving. This 
happens when the meeting design provides 
both task focus and opportunities to reflect on 
the process and personal and collective learn-
ing in these arenas. Smart agendas help groups 
that meet to explore and refine teaching strate-
gies also learn how to learn as colleagues and 
professionals. Smart agendas help groups that 
meet to support the learning needs of individ-
ual students also learn ways to collaboratively 
learn from and with data and from and with 
one another.
How to Use This Chapter
We will describe the remarkable benefits 
of meeting design in complex nonlinear sys-
tems, such as schools. Although protecting time 
to design meetings produces some tensions, 
and time-pressed leaders occasionally have 
to work extemporaneously, the majority of 
meetings, planned well, will produce benefits 
by the hundredfold. This chapter elaborates on 
ways to achieve these benefits. You will find 
principles of agenda construction, samples of 
agendas, and a template for delegating tasks to 
groups. Finally, we offer some general design 
and planning tips.
The sequence in which you will want this 
information depends on your prior information, 
personal history, present needs, and urgency. 
If you have an immediate need for agenda 
samples, move ahead to the section “Agenda 
Templates” or to the list of tips within it. If you 
want a rationale with which to persuade oth-
ers to invest in design work, go to the section  

The Adaptive School

“Design Matters.” If you are interested in de-
sign principles that capacitate you to teach oth-
ers and to develop effective agendas in any set-
ting, read “The Principles of Design.” Should 
you want to delegate a problem to a group for 
its recommendations, go to the section “Posing 
Problems for Groups to Work On.”
Design Matters
Consider the time you spend in meetings. 
At a modest two hours per week, you are 
spending more than three thousand hours in 
meetings throughout the life of your career. 
If you translate that to a team of twelve, then 
4,500 eight-hour days are being spent in meet-
ings. That’s more than twelve years! All profes-
sions and industries tend to malign meetings as 
time wasters. This doesn’t have to be so.
Poorly organized meetings incur abysmal 
costs. Morale suffers, venting and other coun-
terproductive exchanges move to the building’s 
parking lot, and members grow less and less 
willing to invest their time in projects, commit-
tees, and teams. Frustration reigns in department 
meetings and ad hoc groups and insinuates its 
presence into school activities, including teach-
ing. Many of us have experienced this and yet 
know that it does not have to be so. In many 
settings, meetings are well-organized; what 
emerges there are well-run meetings, optimisim, 
efficacy, successful results, and an increasing 
willingness to particpate in collaborative work.
What’s talked about matters. One district 
collected and analyzed agendas from faculty 
meetings, school leadership teams, department 
meetings, and grade-level groups. From 60 
percent to 80 percent of the meetings were 
devoted to “administrivia”—scheduling, an-
nouncements, event organization, discipline, 
compliance issues, or disputes—leaving only 
a small percentage of time for the discussion 
of teaching and learning. In other districts 
announcements and other “administrivia” are 
handled through other forms of communica-
tion. The only reason an announcment or event 
details should appear on an agenda is if mem-
bers need conversation in order to understand 
and uniformly apply it.
Agendas, too reveal the dynamical systems 
principle that both things and energy matter. 
When meeting topics are matters of substance 
and the conversations are well-organized, the 
intangible products of meetings translate to 
mindsets and behaviors. These must not be 
underestimated, for when the intangibles are 
positive, they provide the energy for productive 
work. Well-planned and executed meetings 
promote collective efficacy, found to be a foun-
dation for success even in low socioeconomic 
schools (Hoy et al., 2006).
Principles of Design
Because principles are generalizations, not 
rules, they offer elasticity, which rules do not. 
We will explore five agenda-design principles: 
(a) allocentrism, planning with the group in 
mind; (b) relevance, connecting to the mem-
bers and unit goals; (c) information, ensuring 
that groups have the information they need to 
do their task; (d) interaction, keeping minds 
and voices active; and (e) congruence with 
organizational values and beliefs.
Allocentrism
Design with the users in mind. Put your-
self in their place. Imagine how you will feel 
entering the meeting. Are there special needs 
that require attention? Will the group be tired 
or distracted? Are the participants informed 
about the purpose of the session? What knowl-
edge do they bring to the table that does not 
have to be repeated? What would they need to 
know to encourage participation? What skills 
might have to be introduced or reinforced for 
them to do good work on the issues that will 
be addressed? Are there issues of mood that 
might run counter to receptivity? What seating 
is going to be comfortable, psychologically 
and physically? When attitude or low energy 
is an issue, design an opening that alters this. 
Consider using banned words, acknowledge re-

sistance or check-in or other inclusion activities 
found in appendix A to shift mood.
We once conducted a meeting in a kinder-
garten room that was not going well. Finally, 
we realized the discomfort that people were 
feeling sitting in those itty-bitty chairs, so we 
corrected the seating and the quality of the 
meeting improved. A simple matter of furniture 
placement can make an enormous difference in 
meeting success. We described practical mod-
els for room design and materials in chapter 6.
Relevance
The principle of relevance concerns mem-
bership, the internal fit of the agenda items, 
and the degree to which the agenda has some 
bearing on the larger contexts and goals within 
which the group works.
When an item is relevant to only part of the 
group, schedule it last and dismiss those who 
are not involved. Nothing is more frustrating 
and disrespectful of time than to make some-
one sit through agenda items that are irrelevant 
to them. Selective dismissals honor the group 
members and become part of a norm of appre-
ciating their energies and time.
To what degree do the agenda items relate 
to one another? Cluster those that relate. Orga-
nize others using transitions activities that are 
described in chapter 8. Finally, and perhaps 
most important, what bearing does this meeting 
have on the larger contexts of the group’s exis-
tence and work? Cognizance of this allows an 
opening in which the meeting is perceptually 
framed to help the participants make sense of 
the work. Groups often need a sense of their 
history to understand and embrace the work of 
a particular meeting.
Information
Three questions guide agenda construction 
related to information. The first of these is de-
ciding what information is needed for the group 
to do its work. As mentioned above, sometimes 
this information is history and context so that 
the group members can start from the same 
place together. Groups might occasionally need 
policy information or research summaries on a 
topic in order to do informed work; the agenda 
planner can then provide for a paired reading 
activity from an appropriate journal. Second, 
it is often important to know which players 
outside the group, or which other groups, have 
say on the topic so that consciousness can be 
brought to the question of defining the “sand-
box,” one of the four structures for successful 
meetings described in chapter 6.
Third, and most important, groups need 
to know who they are in the decision-making 
process. Are they to inform, recommend, or 
decide? Third, if they are to inform or recom-
mend, to whom are they relaying information 
and what are the next steps in the process? 
Display this information directly on the agenda 
next to the items.
Interaction
Assuming that the purpose of a meeting 
is for members to think, deliberate, or take 
action, interaction is essential. Any group that 
spends the majority of its time in full-group 
mode is keeping its brain activity surpressed, 
encouraging lethargy, and reducing meeting 
achievement and the value for participants. 
Two essential questions must be addressed to 
plan for the degrees and types of interaction. 
What tasks will be asked of the group: compre-
hending, exploring, informing, recommending, 
or deciding? What cognitive actitvities will be 
required: generating, categorizing, analyzing, 
synthesizing, or extrapolating?
The thoughtful use of “conversation con-
tainers” fosters success. These essentially pro-
vide scaffolds for the talk. Skillful designers 
consider ways to start, structure, and sustain 
thinking in their meetings.
Just because people are sitting together 
does not mean that they are a group capable of 
working together. Recognize that groups do not 
arrive primed for work; they need to transition 
physically, socially, cognitively, and emotion-

The Adaptive School
92
ally into the work space and topic. Wellman 
and Lipton (2004) refer to strategies that per-
fom this function as conversation starters.
Well-chosen activators are psychologically 
safe conversation starters that are pertinent 
to the task. Safety is important; it allows the 
risk of stating ideas when you are not sure, 
disclosing that you do not know, disagreeing, 
or being able to talk and not be overridden by 
highly verbal participants. Overcoming this 
risk is at the heart of effective meeting partic-
ipation. What happens early in a meeting sets 
the tone for the session. By encouraging full 
participation at the outset, participants then 
expect to contribute throughout the session. 
When group leaders talk at the group in the 
opening minutes, participants become passive 
consumers of information with varying degrees 
of engagement. See inclusion activities in ap-
pendix A for ideas.
Protocols (both starters and structures) can 
be designed to minimize risk and maximize 
critical thinking. Avoid, at all costs, opening 
with “feel good” activities in which partici-
pants see no connection to their work.
Although safety is necessary to access 
the neocortex and the members’ best thinking, 
comfort is not a requirement in meetings. In 
fact, if a group is always comfortable, it is 
probably talking about the wrong things.
Structures
Structures are strategies, or protocols, that 
shape and organize conversations, again provid-
ing psychological safety and maximizing time 
efficiency. Almost any strategy can be designed 
as a protocol that sets rules or instructions for a 
conversation. Many are listed in chapter 8, re-
lated to facilitator tasks during different meeting 
stages; others can be found in appendix A.
We are using the terms strategy and pro-
tocol somewhat interchangeably. In diplomacy 
a protocol governs who greets whom first; in 
technology it governs the rules for two pieces 
of equipment to talk together. A meeting pro-
tocol provides a “container” for conversations 
that defines what is to happen and how it will 
occur. In meetings, protocols have the follow-
ing three functions:
1.	
Establish topics, time for the activity, who 
speaks, and the sequence of the speakers, 
if any.
2.	
Provide challenge and limit discomfort.
3.	
Designate the thinking skills to be used.
Without a structure, conversations can 
meander, go off course, and take valuable 
time away from the meeting objectives. The 
thoughtful selection of strategies supports the 
efficient use of time by defining the total 
amount of time for a conversation and the time 
for each component. Protocols can also deter-
mine the type of thinking that is required, such 
as separating data from inference, analyzing, 
evaluating, or developing theories.
Some examples of structures are the 
paired-reading activities of “Say Something,” 
or the strategies “Key Concepts/Key Ideas,” 
“Assumptions Wall,” and “Card Stack and 
Shuffle” (appendix A). Brainstorming is a 
structure because it specifies the thought pro-
cesses to use and the order in which to use 
them, and because the facilitator is calling on 
people, determining who speaks when. It is 
our view that the steps in the brainstorming 
protocols always have to be reviewed and that 
facilitators should intervene immediately when 
violations or mutations occur.
Sustainers
Sustainers are strategies and tools that are 
used to maintain longer, focused conversations. 
How people talk to one another will either 
sustain or dampen communication. Sustainers 
are verbal and nonverbal tools used by group 
members to enhance their ability to deliver 
psychologically safe thoughts to one another 
even when they disagree. The seven norms of 
collaboration described in chapter 4 serve as 
the starting point for this set of skills. Learn-
ing the tools for inquiry described in chapter 
4 represents an ongoing curriculum for many 
groups. Group size is an important sustainer. 

Time-Efficient Meetings	
Chapter 7	
93
Paired activities require the least amount of 
time, compared to trios, quartets, or sextets. 
Pairs are psychologically safer units than larger 
groups are. Trios bring the valuable tension 
of three sets of experiences. It is also harder 
in a trio than in a pair to leave the task and 
enter social talk. Quartets are diverse yet small 
enough to be in the early stages of learning as 
they apply new communication skills. Quartets 
are an ideal size to dialogue about data posted 
before them on the wall. Groups of six are a 
good size for protocols like “First Turn/Last 
Turn” or “Grounding” (see appendix A) and for 
activities that synthesize findings.
Individual reflection is the safest size unit 
of all. Many strategies begin with private re-
flection, either mentally or in writing, giving 
members a chance to gather their thoughts 
before participating in a group.
Offer the What, Why, and How  
of Strategies and Structures
A wise facilitation practice is to offer 
the what, why, and how of any strategy and 
structure you are about to use with a group. 
Offering the “Why” is especially important 
when applying new meeting tools that break 
pattern for the group. For example, using pairs 
and trios instead of operating as a committee of 
the whole may be disconcerting for some group 
members. In this case the facilitator might say: 
“We’re going to use a paired reading strategy 
so that you can engage with the text and with a 
partner to clarify your understanding and gain 
the perspective of another set of eyes.” The 
“Why” is a statement of purpose and intention. 
The why speaks to both the intention of a par-
ticular strategy or structure and to the deeper 
group development outcomes for that group.
Keep in mind that these are principles, not 
rules, and that the strategies named here are 
not limited to the group size suggested. Sue 
Presler, a colleague and friend, while working 
with a full faculty in Hawaii, once took a step 
from the “Focusing Four” (see appendix A) 
and used it with the full group to have them 
advocate lunchroom solutions that had been 
generated the week before. We never would 
have considered doing that, yet after just a few 
people talked, it became clear to the group 
which solution would serve best.
Degree of structure is another sustainer. 
The planners decide when to select a tight or 
a loose protocol as a matter of scaffolding for 
success. A tight protocol is one in which mem-
bers have little choice about when and how 
to participate and have maximum scaffolding 
for success. Examples are “First Turn/Last 
Turn,” “In and Out of the Frame,” and “Futures 
Wheel.” Designers will plan for tight protocols 
when the topic is complex or emotionally 
loaded or when the group does not have much 
experience working together effectively.
Loose protocols provide less scaffolding 
and leave more decisions in the hands of mem-
bers. Examples are “Paired Verbal Fluency,” 
“Around the Room and Back Again,” and 
“Most Important Point.”
Group maturity, another sustainer, refers 
to the collective effectiveness of a group as 
it works together. A long-standing group can 
be immature; a recently formed group might 
be mature. The more immature a group is, the 
more need there is for tight structures and for 
carefully describing the reasons for and the 
structures of the strategies. Mature groups can 
work with either tight or loose protocols and, 
in fact, will sometimes ask for a tight protocol 
because they recognize that the topic is hard to 
talk about.
Congruence
Congruence with organizational values 
and beliefs is the fifth principle of agenda 
design. What happens in meetings is a mani-
festation of the degree to which the group is a 
learning community and will be a force for or 
a force against developing collective efficacy. 
Thoughtful design can help unify faculty per-
spectives and experience. Many schools expe-
rience too much fragmentation. Good meeting 
design can express and reinforce deeper orga-
nizational values and beliefs about learning and 

The Adaptive School

are opportunities to model effective learning 
designs. Well-planned meetings link the project 
to the initiative, the immediate to the important, 
the short range to the long, and the greater com-
munity to its subsets.
Drafting a Design
We now move from design principles to the 
hands-on activities of drafting an agenda you 
will use. We will explore whether a meeting is 
even necessary. If the answer is yes, what type of 
meeting will it be? To help answer this question, 
we present a planning template and samples of 
agendas that serve different purposes.
Is a Meeting Necessary?
Your first consideration is whether a meet-
ing is even necessary. Ask yourself what you 
want to accomplish and if meeting together 
is the best possible use of your group’s time 
on this topic. Are there alternatives, such as 
surveys, memos, focus-group interviews, or 
phone or video conferencing that might serve 
just as well?
If you decide that a meeting is appropri-
ate, examine the potential agenda topics. Does 
each item on the agenda concern at least three 
members of the group? If not, deal with it one-
to-one. Is it clear what type of action the group 
is to take on the item? If not, clarify it. Can it 
be dealt with either initially or fully at a lower 
level? If so, reroute it to the appropriate group 
or subcommittee. Has the item for discussion 
been thoroughly prepared—researched, docu-
mented, and defined? If not, hold it over until 
the preparation is complete.
Once you’ve decided that a meeting is the 
best alternative and have screened the agenda 
items to determine which ones must be ad-
dressed, consider who should be there. Do the 
agenda items pertain to the entire staff or just 
some of them? As mentioned earlier, if some 
are for all but others pertain to just a couple of 
departments, schedule two adjournment times, 
releasing those who are not involved before 
starting on the final items. Are the items under 
consideration important or urgent enough to be 
on the next agenda? If not, reschedule them for 
a later meeting.
Always reserve the last five to ten minutes 
of discussion or dialogue meetings for the 
members to reflect on the meeting process. De-
veloping other processes is one of the highest 
callings of leadership. Using a meeting assess-
ment inventory reinforces paying attention to 
the success structures and meeting standards 
described in chapter 6 and helps groups to grow 
more skillful with each meeting.
Use the rule of one half: List the agenda 
topics, then cut the list by half. One reason 
meetings can be a source of dissatisfaction 
is that they attempt to cover too much. Slow 
down. Allow the time that the topics and the 
members deserve.
What Type of Meeting Will It Be?
The type of meeting will influence the type 
of outcomes that can be reached. Four meeting 
types common to working groups are musters, 
assemblies, discussions, and dialogues. Chap-
ter 5 presented the purposes of dialogue (to 
understand) and discussion (to decide) as well 
as the structures for these meeting functions. 
Grade-level teams, department meetings, cur-
riculum-council leadership groups, and full-

facility meetings carry most of the important 
conversations about teaching and learning in 
dialogue or discussion formats.
Assemblies are routine meetings of very 
large groups like high school faculties, in 
which the large number of members limits the 
outcomes to receiving and clarifying “pass 
down” information and sanctioning or rejecting 
proposals presented by a leader or a subgroup. 
Another example of an assembly is union ral-
lies, in which the purpose is to give information 
and get people excited. One exception to the 
limitation of assemblies is the 1-2-6 strategy 
(appendix A), in which even a group as large 
as two hundred can generate, clarify, advocate, 
and select a few items as most important to 
pursue. It should take no longer than an hour to 
accomplish this.
Musters are the regularly scheduled meet-
ings of a department, an elementary faculty, or 
a special unit of workers such as bus drivers 
or principals. The function of musters is to 
communicate up, down, and sideways and to 
feel positive about the experience. They are 
a time for making announcements, coordi-
nating calendars, and clarifying “pass down” 
information. Never use a muster meeting for 
“pass down” information in a group when 
a memo would do, unless members need to 
ask questions, raise issues, or agree to com-
mon approaches for effective implementa-
tion. Musters, like regularly scheduled faculty 
meetings, often reserve time for discussion 
or dialogue. We’ve occasionally held muster 
meetings with chairs removed, to have stand- 
up meetings signaling this is brief, to the point 
with a quick dismissal.
Clear Outcomes
We like to say that the three most im-
portant considerations in drafting an agenda 
are clear outcomes, clear outcomes, and clear 
outcomes. Creating clear outcomes is simple 
but not easy. Like a finely crafted lesson, a 
successful meeting will have outcomes that are 
behaviorally observable for each agenda item. 
Well-formed outcomes describe a product, not 
a process; a destination, not a journey.
Agenda Templates
We’ve had much success in designing meet-
ing agendas within our own organizations and 
for groups with whom we consult by asking 
ourselves, or the group, the following questions:
To further complicate the issue of having 
clear outcomes, we offer two final consider-
ations. One is that high-functioning, intact 
groups should pay attention to their develop-
ment as a group. Therefore, outcomes should 
be thought about not only in terms of cognitive, 
affective, and product goals for the meeting, 
but also in terms of how the meeting can be

conducted in such a way that the group gets 
better at being a group.
Finally, regardless of your role within a 
meeting, or even the nature of the meeting, 
what, specifically, are your desired outcomes? 
As a group member, do you desire greater clarity 
about an issue, or is it your intent to influence 
the group on an item? If the latter, how will 
you know you’ve succeeded, and what might 
some strategies be? Mentor teachers often report 
to us with surprise that being clear about their 
outcomes has transformed one-to-one meetings 
with the teachers they are supporting.
In our own practice we often begin a 
consultation conversation with the following 
questions: “What do you want as a result of 
this meeting? How will you know if we have 
achieved that? What topics should be discussed 
for that goal? How much time should we al-
lot, and in what sequence should we discuss 
them?” Helping the other party to think in 
outcome terms, whether the meeting is a parent 
conference or the start of a thirty-minute ses-
sion with two other colleagues helps to focus 
time and strategies to get results.
The more one practices, the easier agenda 
construction becomes. Here are some final 
planning tips:
•	
Engage design help. In fact, part of de-
veloping your group is to increase group 
consciousness and skill in this area.
•	
Post outcomes in the meeting rooms. This 
forces you to construct clear language and 
observable goals and aids all members in 
knowing the reason for this meeting and 
how to best focus their energy. In addition, 
should group members get off topic, it 
allows the facilitator to gesture toward the 
posted outcomes and ask, “Please help us 
to understand how your comments relate 
to this outcome.” Sometimes they will tell 
us; sometimes they will monitor their own 
contribution, saying, “I’ll save it for later.”
•	
Determine how much content and how 
much process will be required to achieve 
outcomes related to the agenda items. 
How much discussion, exploration, or di-
alogue might be necessary? How much 
information will be required? Remember 
that when goals are related to attitude and 
behavior change, more process time is re-
quired, not less.
•	
Estimate the time that each agenda item 
will take. Remember that if processes are 
involved, it takes time to explain them and 
to check for understanding.
•	
Place divisive items early on an agenda 
to minimize the possibility of members 
leaving at the end of the meeting in a funk.
•	
If the meeting purpose is singular and 
brief, remove the furniture. This signals 
a stand-up meeting—quick, focused, and 
everyone out in fifteen minutes.
•	
When you are a meeting leader, keep the 
first hour after the meeting to write min-
utes and memos and do the necessary fol-
low-up. Sending out a written follow-up to 
a meeting within twenty-four or forty-eight 
hours signals that you value people’s time.
•	
Consider what commitment will be made 
in the meeting to group development. 
What time, processes, and areas of group 
development will be addressed? At times, 
one of the seven norms of collaboration 
(see chapter 4) will emerge as important 
to strengthen; at other times, raising con-
sciousness on the five standards for suc-
cessful meetings (see chapter 6 will be use-
ful. This attention to group development, 
often overlooked, is the secret to getting 
better and is the focus of the next chapter.

Posing Problems for  
Groups to Work On
Much time can be saved when councils or 
other groups delegate tasks to subcommittees. 
Our experience is that three hours spent care-
fully posing the problem has saved literally 
hundreds of hours of committee work, elimi-
nated false starts, and helped to keep morale 
and communications at healthy levels.
To delegate without clear directions, con-
straints, and other details often produces un-
satisfactory results. Both parties feel bad, and 
sometimes the committee that developed the 
report is directed to repeat the work. It is in this 
type of work that clarity about decision author-
ity needs to be at its most precise.
Decide which ones are most appropriate 
for a problem you are posing for a group to 
work on.
Well-constructed agendas are an essential 
part of successful meetings. An excellent facil-
itator, informed and capable group members, 
and sufficient time and space alone are not 
enough to create meetings that get a lot of qual-
ity work done in a short amount of time with a 
great deal of member satisfaction.

Figure 7.6.  Leaders Pose Questions for Delegated Assignments
Step 1. Leaders define the problem:
	 (a)	 What is the problem or challenge?
	 (b)	 Who is affected directly?
	 (c)	 Who and what are affected indirectly?
	 (d)	 What feelings may exist about the problem?
	 (e)	 What time, personnel, and fiscal limitations apply to resolutions or resolving processes
Step 2. Leaders develop resolution criteria:
	 (a) 	 What is the desired outcome?
	 (b) 	 What criteria must the outcome meet in order to reach a satisfactory resolution?
	 (c) 	 In what ways will the resolution contribute to organizational values or goals?
	 For example:
	 	
•	
The management team achieving and maintaining a common focus • Employees 
knowing that they are cared about and can contribute to the organization’s 
directions
	 	
•	
Development of five energy sources (efficacy, flexibility, craftsmanship, 
consciousness, and interdependence)
	 (d) 	 In what ways will the resolution procedures and processes contribute to the 
organization’s reflection, continued learning, and systematically managed change?
Step 3. Leaders phrase the assignment for the task force or ad hoc group:
	 (a) 	 Determine the level(s) of decision-making authority the group will have
	 (b) 	 Decide if the group is to present one resolution or three, with advantages and 
disadvantages for each.
	 (c) 	 Phrase the task with language such as “What might we do in order that. . .” or “In what 
ways might we provide the widest latitude to the task force and maximize potential for 
creativity?”
	 (d) 	 List the resolution criteria with language such as “In ways that increase group efficacy, 
sharpen the management team’s focus, and do so within existing budget guidelines.” 
This informs the group of organizational values and/or resolution restraints.
Step 4. Leaders present the assignment to the group and initiate processes for clarification 
and understanding of the task: 
	 Example: This committee’s task is to present to the superintendent of schools, by March 
1, a recommendation regarding the issue stated below. The superintendent will take under 
advisement the committee’s recommendation and will draft and recommend policy to the 
board of trustees. The board, after holding public hearings, will make a final decision at 
their June 8 meeting. Issue: In what ways might we develop teachers’ capacity to teach for 
culturally proficient standards and authentically interact with families of minority cultures. 
The committee’s recommendations must do this in ways that will:
	 (a) 	 Bring us into full compliance with the law
	 (b) 	 Maximize individual choice
	 (c) 	 Work within the allocated budgets for professional and organizational development
	 (d) 	 Contribute to collective efficacy

acilitation is the group’s instrument for making the most of its time and 
resources. Perhaps no role is as significant to developing social capital 
and producing self-directed groups that effectively plan, problem solve, 
and make decisions as the facilitator. This chapter offers definitions of facilita-
tion work, addresses the requirements for facilitators, the tasks during the various 
stages of facilitation, ways to develop confidence and competence, and ways facil-
itators intervene when things go wrong in meetings. A special section is included 
on facilitation practices in groups of three or four members.
Chapter 8	
The Confident and  
Skilled Faciliator
Because meetings are inherently messy, 
facilitation is essential. A person serving as 
facilitator makes complicated conversations 
manageable, manages energy and focus, pro-
vides structure and protocols, accommodates 
differences in cognitive style, equalizes the 
influence of new and veteran teachers, and ac-
commodates the vocal and the shy.
Facilitators make a group’s work eas-
ier, clarify outcomes and manage processes, 
make sure all views are considered, ask the 
right questions, create safe environments, and 
strengthen the fabric of community. Effective 
listening is embedded in all of this (Davis, 
2013). Listening, manifested by attentive para-
phrasing, lets the speaker know he or she has 
been heard, connects one person’s contribution 
to another’s, summarizes group conversation, 
and often allows people to hear one another, 
even if their mind was somewhere else during 
the original statement. Paraphrasing is but one 
of several language tools the facilitator uses.
A great facilitator is like an accomplished 
dancer. One notices the dance, but not the 
dancer. She directs process, yet is supremely 
flexible. She follows principles, not rules. She 
improvises. She is comfortable with who she 
is and sets aside judgments about others. And, 
changing genders for balance, he is clear in 
the moment about his intentions. He thinks 
beyond activities to outcomes. He is reflective 
and learns from experience. He can direct or 
request, be firm or soft, serious or light, focus 
on task or on relationships. Male or female, 
the skilled facilitator has abundant knowledge 
about processes and groups and is effortlessly 
competent with many facilitation moves.
Above all, the facilitator is an observer 
who helps groups mediate tensions. Every 
system is influenced by demands that present 
mixed messages. The principal who responds 
to the demands of the central office without 
considering impacts on staff can unwittingly 
contribue to teacher reluctance, resistance, or 
rebellion. Teachers, driven by concern for 
student learning needs, sometimes collectively 

The Adaptive School

work in opposition to excesses of standardized 
testing. Parents and teachers look at a system 
through different eyes. Each day, there are 
different interpretations of the same data, and 
stakeholders respond from different perspec-
tives. A facilitator serves the system by bring-
ing the different perspectives to consciousness.
Facilitation Compared to  
Other Leadership Roles
As mentioned in chapter 3, facilitation is 
similar to but different from three other leader-
ship roles: presenting, consulting, and coaching. 
Groups need clear role definitions because the 
name of a role influences people’s expectations. 
The most common error we’ve noticed is for the 
presenter and facilitator titles to be used inter-
changeably. This has become so pervasive that-
the spell-check on one of our laptops automat-
ically changes the word facilitator to presenter. 
Just as a Ford is not a Honda, a facilitator is not 
a presenter, and a presenter is not facilitator. In 
one case both are vehicles, in the latter, both are 
leadership functions with important differences.
In a professional community dedicated to 
adaptive change leadership is shared. All par-
ticipants develop the knowledge and skills to 
manage themselves and lead others. Leadership 
is a function shared in teams, in professional 
development, in research, and in projects. 
Recognizing what we have called the four 
hats of leadership (see chapter 3) and knowing 
when and how to change them becomes shared 
knowledge within the organization. When val-
ues, roles, and work relationships are clear, 
decisions about appropriate behavior are easy. 
Because the terms presenter and facilitator are 
sometimes used interchangeably we repeat key 
distinctions made in chapter 3.
Facilitators Make Work Easy
Facilitate comes from the Latin stem fac-
ilis “easy” and from the French faciliter “to 
render easy.” Groups convene to solve prob-
lems, make decisions, develop plans, or clar-
ify information. Facilitators direct processes, 
choreograph energy, and maintain a focus on 
one content and one process at a time. The 
facilitator may not be the person in charge of 
the group. More ideas are generated and better 
decisions made when a facilitator serves groups 
than when no facilitator works with a group
Because presenters use many instructional 
methods, including facilitating learning in pro-
cesses that actively engage adult learners, the 
roles are easily confused. While facilitators are 
neutral to content, presenters are responsible 
for the content. When facilitators have essen-
tial information about a topic, it is difficult 
to stay within the neutrality boundary (Bens, 
2012). We periodically witness meetings in 
which colleagues ask the group member who 
is facilitating to add to the conversation. Want-
ing to know the facilitator’s ideas is under-
standable, but it is a disservice to the group to 
lose a content-neutral facilitator. The strategy 
Signal Role Change permits the facilitator to 
step out of the role to comment and yet protect 
the integrity of the role. See appendix A for 
thirty-seven moves facilitators use to manage 
energy, focus, and information.

work, requiring a foundation of knowledge 
and skills, a clear sense of purpose, a juggler’s 
Signal Role Change
•	
When facilitating a meeting and 
wanting to contribute content, ask, 
“May I add something?” The group 
usually will concur.
•	
Move off to the side of the group or 
be seated. From this space, make a 
contribution in a credible voice.
•	
Without speaking, return to the facili-
tation space. In an approachable voice 
say, “OK. Let’s move on,” or “How 
does that add to your thinking?”

gift of attending to everything at once, and 
knowing what to do when you don’t know 
what to do. You don’t have to be flashy to be 
a good facilitator, but you do need to be de-
veloping consciousness, clarity, competence, 
credibility, and confidence.
Consciousness
Facilitators are simultaneously aware of 
multiple events in the external environment 
and in their internal world. They work to hone 
their sensory acuity. Of the eleven million bits 
of data bombarding a person every second, ten 
million come through the eyes. Facilitators 
pick up cues that group members are engaged, 
socializing, fatigued, impatient, apathetic, curi-
ous, excited, or just going through the motions. 
With auditory senses, facilitators detect nu-
ances in voice tone even when they are turned 
away from the group. They pay attention to 
breathing, room temperature, and sight lines. 
They shuttle from looking outward to looking 
inward. Facilitators maintain their own re-
sourcefulness, take stock of their energy, notice 
when they might be making poor judgments, 
remind themselves of context, and assess their 
relationship with the group. The facilitator’s 
internal focus complements, not dominates, the 
external awareness.
Facilitators stay aware of multiple out-
comes and contexts. Most meetings are nested 
inside other circumstances or initiatives. Perhaps 
most important, facilitators are aware of their 
point of view at any given time, and they press 
themselves to understand interactions from var-
ious perspectives. Facilitators know that success 
often depends on their ability to see things in 
new ways, gain new understandings, and pro-
duce new patterns of group interactions.
Clarity
Facilitators are clear about their role, its 
boundaries, and its responsibilities, and they 
communicate this unambiguously to groups. 
They know to whom they are ultimately re-
sponsible. (See appendix F for the distinctions 
among a contact, intermediate, or primary 
client.) Facilitators know the importance of 
language and strive for precision. The follow-
ing are examples of clear facilitator language:
•	
To get attention. “Look this direction.”
•	
To clarify purpose. “Today’s task is to 
____ [approve, generate, select, identify, 
explore, resolve].”
•	
To give directions. “Identify some ideas 
you would like to explore as a team. Pre-
pare to share your two most important 
ideas.”
•	
To encourage participation. “Here are 
some suggestions for how to get the most 
value out of today’s meeting. Be responsi-
ble for your comfort and learning. Don’t 
wait for a break to make yourself com-
fortable. Be responsible for your learning. 
If you can’t hear someone, say ‘Louder, 
please!’ If someone is speaking too ab-
stractly and you need a concrete example, 
please ask for it.”
•	
To enlarge perspective. “Who is not in 
this room and can’t speak for themselves 
on the topic? What do you imagine their 
concerns might be?”
•	
To invite group awareness. “How is the 
group doing on its agreement about listen-
ing to one another? Tell your partner.”
•	
To foster understanding. “Who can offer 
an organizing paraphrase?”
•	
To encourage agreements. “Are you ready 
for a decision?”
Language obscures or clarifies. Precise 
language is a gift to the facilitator and the 
group. It saves time and frustration, eliminates 
ambiguity, conveys respect for the group, and 
fosters facilitator credibility. Facilitators strive 
to be organized, brief, and specific. They use 
words and phrases that have one meaning. Use 
nouns more than pronouns. Tell the group what 
it is to do, why or how that relates to the bigger 
context of its work, and the specific intention 

The Adaptive School
108
to be achieved at each stage. Use advanced 
organizers like “There are three steps. Number 
one is. . . .
Competence
Competence develops with continuous 
learning, experience, and reflection on experi-
ence. Facilitators’ competencies are grounded 
in a basic knowledge of effective meetings. 
This includes the distinction between discus-
sion and dialogue (chapter 5), a set of facili-
tation strategies (see appendix A), and three 
structures for successful meeting (see chapter 
6). Additional competencies include designing 
an agenda (chapter 7), reading a group, para-
phrasing, asking invitational questions, being 
comfortable with silence, and using a host of 
nonverbal strategies and moves. Competence 
also means realizing that a plan is only a map 
of the territory and having the wisdom to know 
when the plan is not working. You may also 
want to see a book on resolving problems in 
meetings and workshops to self-assess yourself 
on a facilitator proficiency scale (Garmston and 
Zimmerman, 2013).
Credibility
Credibility is a byproduct of clarity, com-
petence, and confidence. Credibility does not 
live inside the facilitator; rather, it is a percep-
tion the group forms about the person. When a 
group believes that a facilitator is competent, 
confident, neutral, trustworthy, and fair, the 
group can say that this person is credible.
Credibility, like trust, can temporarily be 
lost. Being less than honest, not owning mis-
takes, or speaking disrespectfully about those 
who are not in the room will drive a wedge of 
discomfort between you and the group. One 
essential facilitator capacity is learning how to 
recover from mistakes. As a friend of ours says, 
if you step in it, know how to step out of it.
The strongest element of a recovery move 
is to step away from the place you made the 
error. (“Did I say that?”—Pointing to the space 
you just left), or direct some humor at yourself 
(“I always wanted to be skillful, now I realize 
I should have specified at what”). To regain 
credibility for errors of greater magnitude use 
four steps. (1) Acknowledge whatever you 
did that evoked discomfort (“I brought you 
incorrect information that resulted in confusion 
and upset”); take responsibility (“I’m sorry, I 
was supposed to bring that to you today, and I 
forgot”); (3) Apologize (“That was insensitive, 
please accept my apology”); and (4) self-dis-
close (“I will make it my intention to not make 
that error again”).
The Facilitator as Manager
Facilitators manage four vital currents to 
maximize the value of meeting time: attention, 
energy, information, and logistics. Facilitators 
monitor and stimulate energy when necessary. 
Information flow must be clear, multidirec-
tional, relevant, and comprehensible, and lo-
gistics for room arrangements, schedules, and 
announcements must be clear.
Attention is first. In chapter 6 we presented 
five principles for developing meeting stan-
dards. The first two were to stay on one topic 
at a time and use only one process at a time. 
Facilitators use language, space, flip charts, 
and their bodies to manage these two standards. 
Whether standing or seated with a small group 
these four tools are vital.
Energy, the second current, is an essential 
resource of groups if they are to accomplish 
work. Productive energy is a side effect of 
positive human relationships. A facilitator’s pri-

mary task is to amplify and direct emotional, 
cognitive, and physical energy to group goals. 
Researchers have found that some groups are 
“smarter” than others—that is they collectiveley 
have higher performance or greater success in 
solving problems than comparison groups (Fred-
rickson and Losada, 2005; Losada and Heaphy, 
2004; Woolley et al., 2010). The researchers 
found substantial evidence for collective intelli-
gence as real and measurable. Factors like turn 
taking, balancing inquiry with advocacy, higher 
positivity ratios, and social sensitivity were 
attributes of the more accomplished groups. 
Studies also find that collective efficacy, one of 
the five energy sources, is consistently related 
to high performance across subject areas, across 
locations and using multiple instruments (Eells, 
2011; Goddard, Hoy, and Woolfolk-Hoy, 2004).
Information is the third essential current. 
Groups consume and construct information in 
order to plan, decide, solve problems, and take 
action. Information comes in a variety of pack-
ages: abstractions, examples, generalizations, 
details, thoughts, feelings, research, numbers, 
history, and dreams. There is typically too much 
data and too little time. Facilitators assist groups 
to select some data to study and others to ignore. 
They guide groups to know when to look for de-
tails and when to examine themes and patterns.
The fourth and final current is logistics. 
“This is the ‘ground’ of group process—the 
most constrained and, when mastered, the most 
enabling flow because it frees up attention and 
energy for other things” (Sibbit, 2002, p. 55). 
This current carries the management of the 
meeting-room environment, equipment, mate-
rials, time allotments, schedules, and reporting 
procedures (chapter 6).
Give instructions for room arrangement 
and materials (see chapter 6 for ideas on orga-
nizing the room for different purposes). Arrive 
at least thirty minutes early to make whatever 
adjustments are necessary. Get any clutter out 
of the room. Often there are too many tables or 
chairs to work effectively.
Visuals are indispensable for focusing 
attention. Most of our sensory information 
comes through the eyes. One major value 
of charts over images on a screen is their 
potential for permanence. People know that 
a screen image will disappear and therefore 
experience a muscular tension they don’t have 
when looking at a chart. On a chart, infor-
mation stays visible throughout the meeting, 
allowing the participants to know where they 
are on the agenda and the facilitator to refocus 
them on goals or norms. Charts are especially 
valuable if information is being presented that 
makes members uncomfortable. A facilitator 
can use the strategy Third Point to direct 
attention to the data and away from him- or 
herself, providing a separation between the 
message and the messenger. Place the charted 
agenda where it can be easily referred to 
throughout the meeting.
Color-code charted agendas or other data 
that has been prepared in advance. Use red for 
headlines; brown, blue, and green for text; and 
yellow and black for organizing or graphics. 
Always print in block letters, never in cur-
sive—and, despite what some books advise, 
never use all caps. Any teacher will tell you that 
printed upper- and lowercase block letters are 
the most readable.

Color-coding is not advisable when you 
are recording during a meeting, because it can 
slow the flow of talk. Graphics aid memory 
and communicate complex concepts metaphor-
ically. ChartArt (Buckley, 2002) is a series of 
images that can be traced onto a chart; they 
are considered useful by both experienced and 
novice facilitators. Buckley (2002) describes 
how to work with charts and graphics.
Facilitation Functions
The facilitator’s work begins before the 
meeting does and continues after the meeting. 
During a meeting, there are many facilitator 
functions with unique purposes and tools. Meet-
ing work is cyclical. The same functions—gen-
erating, organizing, and analyzing—can repeat, 
and complex strategies often have embedded in 
them several smaller ones. Focusing attention 
will be repeated many times throughout a ses-
sion, along with framing the work and activating 
relevant knowledge.
Here we describe tips, strategies, and over-
arching goals for each function.
Preparing
Is this part of an initiative in which the 
group has already worked? Will there be meet-
ings to follow? Are other groups involved? 
Learn the leader’s perception of meeting goals. 
You might have to be a coach or consultant be-
fore you can be a facilitator, in some situations. 
Often the meeting outcomes have not been con-
sidered at the level of detail necessary to design 
an effective session. Explore specifics. Find 
out if anything is happening in the group, or to 
the group, that could bring counterproductive 
energy into the room. Occasionally you might 
arrange to meet with a small planning commit-
tee or conduct a phone conference to get mul-
tiple perspectives. This is essential when you 
have been asked to facilitate conflict-related or 
problem-solving meetings. See appendixes F, 
G, and H for tips on contracting for facilitation 
services. Ask to see the meeting announce-
ment; you want to know what information the 
participants have about the meeting.
Opening
An opening might take as little as ten min-
utes or as long as thirty minutes, depending on 
your desired outcome, available time, group 
size, level of group maturity, and experience in 
working together. The first three to five minutes 
are critical in developing expectations, recep-
tivity, and relationship with a group. During 
the opening the facilitator must get people’s 
attention, focus their energy, acknowledge any 
resistance that might be present, be especially 
careful about pronoun use (your meeting, not 
mine), provide for a public display of informa-
tion and group memory, and clarify roles—the 
facilitator’s, the participants,’ and the record-

er’s. Members want to know the topic, its 
relevance to them, if it will be worth their time 
(Is it well organized?), and the credibility of 
the person facilitating. All these questions must 
be addressed in the first few minutes. In video 
8.1 we see the facilitator open a meeting and 
address these points.
Focusing
Everyone knows the importance of atten-
tion, yet it is not unusual for a facilitator who is 
stressed or pressed for time to begin talking be-
fore attention is fully gained. This will backfire 
and become a cumulative problem, indicating 
to the group that full attention is not expected.
Grinder (2007) describes twenty-one non-
verbal tools that people unconsciously use to 
enhance their speech. Many of these appear 
in appendix A. Since humans are influenced 
more by nonverbal communication than by 
the spoken word, it is necessary for facilitators 
to develop a nonverbal vocabulary. We have 
incorporated many nonverbal tools of commu-
nication in training facilitators and have had re-
markable success in helping them amplify their 
effectiveness. See appendix A for descriptions 
of over thirty facilitator moves.
Clarifying Role
Take time to specify that your role is to 
guide the process and stay neutral to the con-
tent. Encourage group members to tell you if 
they think that you are stepping out of role. 
Have them direct you about the type of facilita-
tion they desire: tightly directed by you or with 
greater allowance made for the group to guide 
the process. Facilitation is essential to maintain 
focus, efficiency, and energy as well as to con-
serve time and achieve results.
Ultimately groups allow themselves to be 
facilitated. If it has not given its tacit permis-
sion, a group will resist or subvert the facil-
itator’s efforts to serve them. A group grants 
psychological permission to the facilitator to 
manage the meeting process and to place issues 
before the group to consider. Permission is 
based on a number of intangibles. Among these 
are a perception of confidence, trust, and a be-
lief that the facilitator can remain neutral and 
nonjudgmental. Confidence and credibility are 
perceived by congruent language—that is, the 
body says what the words describe. Confident 
facilitators breathe from the abdomen. Facilita-
tors whose breathing is high and shallow signal 
their own discomfort, which affects the group’s 
sense of ease. Wellman and Lipton (2004) de-
scribe a permission-getting process that signals 
responsiveness and permits the group to pro-
vide direction to the facilitation services:
One approach to empowering a working 
group, whether it is at a novice level of per-
formance as a group or at a more expert level, 
is to negotiate your stance as a facilitator. 
Stances may vary from hard to soft facilita-
tion. An effective way to offer these options 
is to describe a physical continuum organized 
by metaphors, then ask group members to 
point to the spot on the continuum they be-
lieve will be most effective for that session. 
Some metaphors that we have used include 
facilitation stances that range from Rambo to 
Mr. Rogers; from Xena the Warrior Princess 
to Mary Poppins; or from a lion to a lamb. 
Presenting choices helps the group to gain or 
regain the power to control its own direction 
and purposes. This is especially true if in-
dividual group members are dominating the 
group’s time and energies. Such a group will 
tend to select harder forms of facilitation and 
facilitator permission to intervene with prob-
lematic situations. (p. 15)

Framing the Work
As a noun, frame marks the boundaries 
within which an entire picture is displayed. As 
a verb, frame means to create a mental struc-
ture, or frame, through which people interpret 
or make sense of a situation. Facilitators frame 
tasks to set a tone for participation and produc-
tivity—to describe the purposes of the work, 
how it relates to a larger context, and how it 
benefits participant interests.
Groups perform at their best when they 
have clearly defined outcomes. You might 
start with an artfully vague statement such 
as “Today you will explore ways to save 
the after-school program.” Broad outcomes 
maintain momentum because people relate to 
the intent and don’t get bogged down by the 
details. Later, after framing and an inclusion 
activity, you should be more specific: “The 
purpose today is to identify what resources 
we could make available for the program. You 
will recommend some to consider. Next you 
will assess the costs to other school programs 
and, based on that, make a go or no-go rec-
ommendation on continuing the after-school 
activities.” Working outcomes employ a verb 
that specifies what action is to be taken, such 
as decide, recommend, inform, assess, explore, 
advocate, inquire, or identify.
Acknowledging Resistance
Some of the people, some of the time, will 
want to resist, oppose, refrain from participa-
tion, or push back against proposals, programs, 
ideas, and even resist being in a meeting. Keep 
in mind that their resistance is just a way of 
taking care of themselves and is not about you. 
The resistance often has nothing to do with the 
meeting. One of the authors met with a group 
of principals and sensed apathy and fatigue. He 
asked what was going on. He learned that this 
was the fourth day that week that the principals 
had been out of their buildings. In addition, they 
had delivered reductions-in-force notices the 
day before. Given these circumstances, the pro-
posed agenda made little sense, and as the group 
modified its task, energy returned to the room.
To resist resistance is futile. To resist resis-
tance is to have it persist. One cannot be rea-
soned out of resentment, hurt, anger, betrayal, 
blame, or discouragement, the typical sources 
of resistance. Only if you acknowledge the 
validity of the perceptions and feelings (which 
is different from agreeing with them) will the 
group have the choice to set them aside.
For extended resources see Garmston and 
Zimmerman’s (2013) strategies for resolving 
twenty types of problems facilitators face. 
Here we will identify three approaches to work 
with resistance. Each is a form of reframing. If 
resistance is present or anticipated, it must be 
addressed immediately at the start of a meeting. 
The three approaches are as follows:
•	
Pace and lead. The facilitator acknowl-
edges (by pacing) the legitimacy of feel-
ings a group is having, then (leading) sug-
gests the temporary suspension of those 
feelings in order to make the best use of 
this time. (Costa and Garmston, 2016)
•	
Use strategies that acknowledge the resis-
tance as natural and that generate humor, 
such as Banned Words (appendix A.).
•	
Choreograph an opening. Imagine you are 
conducting a before-school meeting with 
teachers. They are attending because it is 
a workday at the beginning of the school 
year. Last year, scores went up across the 
district. They were promised a classroom 
day, but the district office decided to send 

The Confident and Skilled Faciliator 	
Chapter 8	
113
you to work with them instead. In choreo-
graphing an opening, the facilitator could 
describe the resistance in respectful terms 
and suggest that there are higher interests 
and benefits to come from the meeting. See 
Choreograph an Opening in appendix A.
Language precision is important. The re-
sistance must be stated in vague terms so that 
people can identify with it. The following lan-
guage forms offer ways you can modulate the 
resistance description: all of you, some of you, 
or a few of you (Zoller and Landry, 2010).
Developing Inclusion
The first four opening activities—focusing 
attention, clarifying your role, framing the 
work, and acknowledging resistance—can take 
very little time. These tasks do not have to be 
done as separate entities but can be blended.
Developing inclusion, the seventh activity, 
can also be blended with focusing attention, 
framing the work, and activating relevant in-
formation. Occasionally it can also be used in 
acknowledging resistance. People always come 
to meetings from somewhere else—geographi-
cally, emotionally, and cognitively. While bod-
ies may be in the room, often heads are not, but 
are attending instead to the last class, concern 
with a student, or social needs. Therefore, it 
is essential that you provide experiences that 
help them to make a transition into the new 
space and group. Plan for either full group 
or subgroup inclusion activities. Full-group 
activities set norms, focus attention inside the 
room, generate energy, and help people to an-
swer the question of who they are in relation to 
the group. They begin the process of moving 
from a focus on self to the group. Groundings 
or synectics activities shown in appendix A are 
full-group activities. Groundings are particu-
larly useful for groups experiencing conflict, 
for merging members of different groups, or 
preparing groups for difficult conversations.
Synectic activities reveal knowledge and 
attitudes about a topic and engage the met-
aphoric brain. As an example, groups might 
respond to a question like “assessing student 
learning is like what household object because 
. . .” if that is the focus for the meeting. We 
used that inclusion activity once, in an eastern 
state, related to a session on supervision. The 
majority of responses had to do with toilets. 
The group clearly communicated its attitude. 
Subgroup activities also set a norm of active 
engagement and focus attention to the content 
of the meeting’s work. Participants take turns 
speaking to a prompt. Prompts might be expec-
tations for the meeting, or naming a positive 
occurrence of the week, or hopes and appre-
hensions for an upcoming event. See appendix 
A for other inclusion activities.
With all strategies, it is desirable to name 
the purposes of the activity. This is especially 
so at the beginning of a session, when, if you 
are not already known, you are still establishing 
your relationship with the group.
Virtual Inclusion Activities 
for Remote Teams
Virtual inclusion activities are as im-
portant as face-to-face inclusions. They 
get voices “in the room,” serve as role 
calls, help members learn about one 
another, or challenge thinking about the 
topic to be explored. Keep them short. 
As in all activities, be clear about your 
goals. One goal set might be to get 
people’s voices (or faces) in the room, 
represent a virtual role call, and get own-
ership of the agenda. Another might be 
to stimulate creativity, and yet another 
might be reveal to perceptions from dif-
ferent time zones.
•	
Each person, in turn, says their 
name, role, organization, and hopes 
for this meeting.
•	
Each member posts a picture of their 
shoes or item on their desk, then 
explains how that item represents 
their interests.

Activating Knowledge
Just as teachers engage students by helping 
them to elicit prior knowledge, the facilitator 
does this to generate energy and activate in-
formation that is relevant to the group’s task. 
Doing it at the beginning of a meeting and each 
time new topics are introduced has multiple 
benefits. First, particularly at the beginning 
of a meeting, a norm for engagement is rein-
forced. It energizes the group members as they 
work and frees the facilitator to observe the 
group. Second, the relevant knowledge that 
is activated is instrumental in accelerating the 
pace of the meeting, for it brings information 
into play that is necessary to work on a topic. 
Sometimes this information is as simple as re-
membering what happened at the last meeting. 
Many meetings take unnecessary time getting 
started because group members do not recall 
what happened in earlier sessions.
Third, eliciting prior knowledge levels 
the perceived playing field within the group. 
This is especially true with mixed-role groups 
when the activity is preceded by a quick writ-
ing activity so that each group member has 
something to contribute. Finally, any initial 
task has to be structured so that group mem-
bers feel psychologically safe, confident that 
they will not be demeaned, attacked, or rid-
iculed. The “Sort Cards” strategy serves this 
purpose nicely. Members privately respond to 
a prompt on 3 × 5 cards, then they display and 
organize the cards according to criteria that 
they invent (appendix A).
Other strategies in appendix A that activate 
relevant information while maintaining psy-
chological safety are “Paired Verbal Fluency”; 
“Know, Think You Know, Want to Know”; 
“Four-Box Synectics”; “Three to Get Ready 
and Card Stack and Shuffle”; and “Give One 
to Get One.” Keep in mind that members must 
always feel safe but as the meeting progresses, 
not necessarily comfortable. Discomfort is of-
ten a doorway to learning.
Giving Directions
Precise directions conserve time and en-
ergy. Confusing directions make members feel 
dumb. When people feel dumb they lose ef-
ficacy, energy, and commitment to task. The 
thinking-processes supporting direction-giving 
are clear. At the simplest level, they include 
guidelines such as using declarative statements 
and a minimum number of words. As we will 
see later, personal pronouns can be problem-
atic with this function and others. By saying 
things like “Here’s what I want you to do 
next” or “Listen carefully to me as I describe 
this process,” a facilitator conveys the idea 
that the group is serving him or her rather than 
the group’s goals. Instead, use phrases such as 
“Your next steps are . . .” or “This process has 
three stages . . .” or “Turn to your neighbor and 
name your concerns about this topic.”
These forms maintain focus on the group 
and on the task rather than on the facilitator. 
Directions, like framing statements, can be 
scripted. Charts and slides that hold directions 
visually aid retention. In the case of particularly 
difficult tasks, they focus participants’ atten-
tion on the process-task interaction—which is 
where it is supposed to be—rather than on the 
person guiding the work.
Adopt the syntactical pattern of “What,” 
“Why,” “How” when giving directions. The 
“What” is the name of the strategy, structure, 
or pattern you are proposing for engaging the 
group. The “Why” is the intention or purpose 
of that choice. The “How” includes the details 
and procedures involved in the process.
Video 8.3.

The Confident and Skilled Faciliator 	
Chapter 8	
115
The “Why” is the most essential element 
for enlisting group member respect for the pro-
cess and commitment to following the assigned 
pattern with integrity. “Why” statements offer 
principles of practice such as: “This strategy 
presents opportunities for hearing and consid-
ering multiple viewpoints without judgment or 
comment.” Or, “This paired interaction allows 
partners to engage with the text and each oth-
er’s perspectives in a time-efficient manner.”
Notice that this last “Why” statement also 
embeds a subtle pacing for those participants 
who value time efficiency and may not always 
value their colleagues’ contributions. For those 
participants who enjoy collaborative interac-
tions, the embedded message for them is that 
the strategy will be time bound so they should 
respect the protocol and time frames and 
not get lost in any meandering conversations 
during the process.
“Why” statements have both immediate 
and longer-term intentions. The immediate 
impact is framing the purpose for the task 
at hand. The longer-term intention is where 
facilitation overlaps with group development 
goals. For groups to be ready to engage with 
increasing cognitive and relational challenges, 
the skilled facilitator paces both the strategy 
choice and “Why’s” to at first meet, and then 
stretch, the learning capacities of group mem-
bers. For novice groups, the “Why’s” will 
be mostly about the intention of the strategy 
to help those groups develop basic habits of 
following directions and working successfully 
with colleagues.
Use a credible voice to give directions—
one in which the tonal pattern is flat and tends 
to curl down at the end of sentences. This 
voice pattern universally is received as “this 
is important information, please attend.” Stand 
upright with head and body still in a posture of 
calm and centeredness with feet aligned under 
the shoulders. Drama teachers tell us this is 
called a neutral position. If there are subsets 
to the directions, use a visual paragraph for 
maximum congruence. In this pattern the fa-
cilitator gives the first direction, pauses, breaks 
eye contact by dropping his or her head, moves 
to a new spot, looks up, and gives the next 
direction. This pattern can be used for up to 
four steps in direction giving. Imagine the fol-
lowing statements (with expanded information 
for each) delivered with the visual paragraph 
after each of the first three directions. Table 8.1 
shows what might be said while giving direc-
tions in a meeting and in a sixth-grade class.
A facilitator’s language choices will greatly 
influence success in giving directions as well as 
in offering guidelines and leading the process.
An often-overlooked yet powerful attribute 
of clear directions is pronoun use (Wellman, 
2006). Pronouns are substitutes for names. 
They label the speaker’s place in any relation-
ship and convey expectations of that relation-
ship, such as compliance, affection, and whose 
group it really is. When a facilitator named 
Sarah says, “Please give me your attention,” 
she might as well have been saying, “Please 
give Sarah, not somebody else in the group, 
your attention.” One of the authors once heard

a principal in a meeting refer to “our work this 
year,” to which a teacher muttered, “No, it’s not 
‘our work’; she’s going back to the office, and 
we’re going to be doing it.” On another occa-
sion a superintendent new to the job thanked 
one of us for coming to the district to work with 
“his people.”
Who you are by position and relation to the 
group should influence your choice of pronouns. 
If you are a group member who has stepped up 
to facilitate a session, the work very well might 
be “ours.” If you are external to the group in 
any way, referring to the work as “ours” can 
generate inferences that actually interfere with 
the group’s work or its development.
It is usually wise to carefully plan and 
script your comments. For an upcoming fa-
cilitation session, consider whether it is “our 
work today,” “your work today,” or “the work 
today.” For work that is emotionally charged 
in any way, it is usually safest to apply the 
most pronoun-neutral forms and talk about 
“the work,” “this task,” “the data,” or “the out-
come.” Neutral forms, which use articles and 
pronouns such as the and this, depersonalize 
the task and make it psychologically safer for 
group members to engage with the issue and 
not the person before them.
The neutral pronoun pattern can be sup-
ported by the use of charts and visuals that hold 
important technical, and perhaps emotionally 
laden, information off to the side (Grinder, 
2007). This approach removes the emotion of 
the message from the facilitator, guiding the 
group’s emotional energy to the information 
rather than toward the facilitator. Be sure to keep 
your eyes on the chart as you use neutral pro-
nouns. If you revert to making eye contact with 
group members while framing difficult tasks, 
you run the risk of repersonalizing the task and 
drawing the emotional energy to the messenger 
rather than leaving it with the message.
Suggesting Process
Fluent facilitators are able to anticipate 
bottlenecks and common points of confu-
sion. At these points, they succinctly propose 
targeted procedural tips and offer additional 
technical resources to move the group ahead. 
Again, these are situations in which careful 
pronoun choice can be important to the group’s 
productivity. Given the wisdom of prior experi-
ence and an implicit desire for credibility with 
the group, you might be tempted to say things 
like “In my experience the best thing to do is.  
. . .” Such phrasing has the effect of personaliz-
ing the advice or suggestions that follow.
The alternate approach is to drop the 
personal pronoun and cultivate a repertoire of 
phrases such as “Groups typically get stuck 
here and need to . . .” and “At points like this, 
productive groups tend to . . .” These more 
pronoun-neutral forms frame the notion of 
expertise as a capacity of some ideal group, not 
as a “gift” from the facilitator. In all facilitator 
functions, the intention must be to place the 
spotlight on the group, its development, and its 
task accomplishment—not on the facilitator.
Facilitating Work
Facilitators facilitate—that is, they make 
work easier. Your awareness of the group com-
bines with your repertoire of facilitation skills 
and knowledge to serve you as you maintain a 
neutral stance and guide the group through strat-
egies and transitions. Appendix A describes over 
thirty facilitator moves (often nonverbal) and 
one hundred and thirty strategies or protocols.
Very small groups cannot afford the luxury 
of having one person stay in a neutral facilita-
tion role, yet facilitation can still be present. We 
will discuss the concept of facilitating a small 
group shortly.
Transitioning
A transition is a process of change from 
one state to another. Managing the shifts be-
tween activities or topics or between content 
and breaks is part of the art of facilitation. 
Without any warning, momentum can be bro-
ken. Group members can be so invested in the 

The Confident and Skilled Faciliator 	
Chapter 8	
117
current activity that they feel resentment if the 
activity is suddenly broken off (Sibbit, 2002). 
Near the end of a process, help the group to 
anticipate a transition by announcing that you 
are beginning to move toward closure or are 
turning to a different stage in the process. To 
manage energy and attention, give people time 
warnings when they are engaged in self-man-
aging activities. The move “Yellow Light” 
(appendix A) serves as a warning. Another 
strategy is to move quietly around the group 
and indicate the remaining time. Timers on the 
screen will also let people track the time for 
themselves.
“Closing the Window” is a nonverbal strat-
egy that signals that a full-group conversation 
is about to end. This often brings out those who 
have something to say before the time is up. In 
video 8.4 we watch the facilitator use “closing 
the window,” a facilitator move learned from 
virtuoso Suzanne Bailey.
Because the group has not internalized the 
agenda sequence as you have, reminders about 
where they are now in relationship to the full 
agenda can be useful. Saphier, Haley-Speca, 
and Gower (2008) offer the metaphor of sta-
tion naming—as if riders are being reminded 
of what they are leaving and where they are 
going—to help members know how what they 
are doing relates to what is completed and the 
next topic or process. “Now that you’ve iden-
tified concerns, the next step will be to explore 
related assumptions. That will be the first task 
after a short break.”
Some form of transition is also useful to 
signal a shift in activity (“OK, that’s it for brain-
storming, the next stage is clarification”), pace 
(“The pace is going to slow down to open an 
opportunity for reflection”), and level (“Now the 
task moves from naming assumptions to explor-
ing what inferences they might lead to”).
Use transitions to have participants orga-
nize and integrate the work just completed when 
the ideas have to be carried to a next stage of 
thinking or when the content should be remem-
bered for a future meeting. Some strategies 
(appendix A) that accomplish this are “Journal,” 
“Most Important Point,” “Partners Report,” and 
“Matchbook Definitions.” Strategies that engage 
the full group are “Walk About” and “Stir the 
Classroom.” “Sound and Motion Symphony” 
brings physical expression to the integration of 
information (see appendix A).
Closing the Meeting
At the conclusion of the work, the group is 
ready to close the meeting.
High on the list of frustrations that peo-
ple express to us is the feeling that at the end 
of a meeting, nothing was accomplished. A 
proper closing will eliminate this complaint. 
The following tasks should be accomplished at 
this stage: clarify who is to do what by when, 
test commitments, clarify communications and 
finally assess the meeting and arrange for the 
next.
Clarify Who Does What by When
In the heat of conversations, the action-
able part of decisions is often overlooked. Left 
overlooked, they are the cause of confusion, 
incomplete follow-up, and poor morale. The 
facilitator is responsible for seeing that this 
question is asked: Who is to do what by when? 
If no one else asks, the facilitator must. Names 
of the responsible parties should be recorded on 
charts and made a part of the meeting minutes.
Test Commitments
Everyone is busy. In the enthusiasm of 
the moment, some people overcommit. “I 
know you would never do this,” the facilita-
tor might say with a smile, “but under what 
conditions might you be tempted to violate 
Video 8.4.

118
these agreements?” Although it could be fairly 
easy—perhaps to go along with the group—to 
agree to a course of action during a meeting, 
real pressures can evolve later when one must 
choose between conflicting commitments. The 
facilitator’s question brings an awareness of the 
realities and tensions associated with commit-
ments. When these realities and tensions are 
articulated, the group has an opportunity to ex-
plore strategies that can overcome any barriers 
to the agreements.
Clarify Communications
“What we have here is a failure to com-
municate” is a line from the movie Cool Hand 
Luke. When people are surveyed about the 
problems in their organizations, one of the 
top items mentioned is poor communication. 
Because work life is so hectic and individuals 
have interests and responsibilities in so many 
areas, it is critical to have a communication 
plan before people leave the meeting.
For leaders, it is desirable to have a meet-
ing summary in group members’ hands within 
twenty-four hours. This signals that the group’s 
work is important. Some facilitators and group 
leaders reserve fifteen to thirty minutes after 
the meeting to develop a summary draft from 
the notes on the charts.
Other forms of after-meeting communica-
tion include scheduling reports at other meet-
ings, e-mailing summaries to the entire staff, 
posting minutes in the staff room, or having 
each member speak to a few colleagues about 
what transpired. In some schools, grade-level 
teams or departments post agendas and min-
utes on the Internet to keep everyone abreast of 
what is occurring.
Assess the Meeting
Any group too busy to reflect on its work 
is too busy to improve. Taking a small amount 
of time at the end of each meeting to fill out a 
meeting survey is a responsible form of profes-
sional development. Group members take three 
to four minutes at the end of a meeting to anon-
ymously complete appendix I, a Likert scale 
questionnaire about meeting effectiveness. The 
data are collated by the facilitator or group 
leader and brought back to the group at the next 
meeting, with frequency distributions for each 
item. Small groups look at the data and then 
engage in a full-group discussion around the 
question “Given what we said about ourselves 
last time, what do we want to work on today?” 
This is a remarkably effective way to elicit con-
cerns and rapidly improve group functioning.
Arrange for the Next Meeting
Many groups rotate the facilitation role so 
that all the members have a chance to develop 
strength and an understanding of meeting dy-
namics. This is the time to select a next facil-
itator wanting to develop skills, and, ideally, 
arrange for this person to work with the group 
leader to design the next agenda.
Facilitating In Small Groups
Three members comprise a team. If one 
stands to facilitate, one stands to record, the 
seated member can make all the decisions. 
Right? Obviously this does not work. The essen-
tial concept for small groups is that facilitation is 
needed, not a full-time facilitator. The following 
problems are common to small groups:
•	
In small meetings everyone is usually 
seated. Who is facilitating often gets lost 
in this arrangement.
•	
Two of the meeting standards, one topic 
at a time and one process at a time, are 
frequently violated.
•	
In a group of three, achieving sufficient 
consensus (80 percent) is artificial with 
two to one splits. (Try rating an item from 
one to one hundred to see distinctions in 
perception.)
•	
It is difficult to manage a third meeting 
standard, balanced participation, if one is a 
dominator and incessantly talks.
•	
The urgent often displaces the important.

What follows next are ideas to manage the 
tensions above. Then we will introduce a spe-
cial role we call the “Citizen Facilitator.”
When all are seated in a group of three to 
eight people, it is a greater challenge to manage 
the group’s energy and focus. One solution is 
for the designated facilitator to position a flip 
chart or chalkboard nearby. To regain attention 
stand, pointing to the visual display behind 
you, and say something like, “Here is where 
we are now,” or “Are we ready to move to this 
next item?” or (writing something on the visual 
display) “This seems to be the sticking point. 
Talk with a neighbor for a moment and gener-
ate some ideas.” A teacher in Mumbai told us 
she has her group do lots of partner work to 
keep energy high. After she stands to redirect 
group energy, she returns to her own partner to 
engage in the conversation.
To clarify a topic or process in a large 
group, “TAG/TAU” (topic as given/topic as un-
derstood) and “PAG/PAU” (process as given/
process as understood) are used. Voice and the 
visual paragraph are employed. Both can be 
used in small groups in this manner.
“Next we (now the inclusive pronoun is 
appropriate) need to ask ourselves the question, 
‘What might we be missing?’ Take a moment, jot 
down names of groups that might be affected by 
this and prepare to share.” The facilitator makes 
a discernable shift—leaning to one side, forward 
into the group, leans back in the chair, or re-
moves eyeglasses—and asks in an approachable 
voice—“So what’s your understanding of what 
we do now?” The facilitator shown in video 8.5 
uses space and voice variation in three stages to 
check the group’s understanding. 
Sufficient consensus is mathematically 
challenging in a group of three or in a two-
to-two split. Make a working agreement that 
disagreements based on principles will be 
explored; disagreements based on preferences 
will give way to values-based choices. Use a 
values matrix on important decisions. Name 
values important to protect when making the 
decision. Rate each choice as high, medium, or 
low in meeting each value. Most often this will 
clarify the decision-making process.
High talkers often have limited conscious-
ness of their behavior and its effect on others. 
Two ideas might help. Anonymously ask mem-
bers to respond to questions on post-it notes. 
Each should list three to five aspects of the 
group’s work they value, and three to five prac-
tices that make the group less effective. Use the 
wall of silence strategy (appendix A) in which 
members place the post-it notes on a flip chart or 
wall, and silently rearrange them placing them 
into categories. Allow time for reflection. Now 
ask, “What are you seeing? What surprises are 
there? What might we keep doing? What might 
we change?” Another approach is to use the 
round-robin reflection strategies in which mem-
bers silently respond to this prompt. “What are 
some of the decisions you were making about 
when and how to participate and what were 
some of the effects of those decisions on you and 
the group?” After a minute or so, have members 
take turns reporting, with no interruptions.
The urgent is always present. Schedul-
ing a special event, determining a response 
to an emotional event, or responses to an 
unexpected change in schedule, are some 
examples. Two approaches help groups keep 
their major energy on the important items. 
First post an agenda. List estimated times 
for each item and what the group is to do. 
Name each item as a product: develop, assess, 
decide, understand. Name who is to lead the 
conversation on each. Place the urgent last on 
the agenda because if it is first it will consume 
available time. List hard to talk about topics

early, so members have a chance to recover 
equanimity. See agenda samples in chapter 7.
The Citizen Facilitator
How can small groups, such as those with 
only three or four members, retain facilitation 
functions even without a designated facilitator 
who stays outside the conversation?
One of the authors worked with an elemen-
tary school in which grade-level teams met one 
hour a week to focus on instructional improve-
ment. In each team, one teacher was designated 
to be the facilitator. Each team’s charge was 
to set annual grade-level goals, develop units, 
plan lessons, and assess student work results. 
Yet by midyear, the teams were struggling. 
Many teachers were frustrated. Some teams 
had developed three goals for the year; some 
had none; some had just one. They were good 
people, smart teachers with time and resources, 
yet they were floundering.
The school in this example began its 
collaborative work without clear intentions. 
Of course, student improvement is a goal, but 
how does collaborative work help the group to 
achieve this? The school leadership established 
structures, roles, times for the group to collabo-
rate, and a menu of tasks on which to work. Yet 
tools were not provided. Time without tools is 
counterproductive.
In conversations with facilitators, other 
administrators, and one of the authors, the prin-
cipal began to articulate her intention in having 
groups work together to make systematic inqui-
ries into the relationship between teaching and 
student learning. Strategies for collaborative 
work were learned.
The notion of a citizen facilitator emerged, 
one who may be designated for any amount of 
time (i.e., from one meeting to one semester 
to the life of the group), and has three respon-
sibilities:
•	
To serve as a two-way conduit between the 
team and the principal, informing the team 
of the principal’s priorities and requests, 
and informing the principal of the group’s 
ideas and recommendations.
•	
To serve as professional developer to the 
group—providing foundation knowledge 
about group processes, an awareness of 
the distinction between dialogue and dis-
cussion, and the tools for conversing, 
planning, and problem solving.
•	
To be the person in the group who main-
tains a macro perspective, using “helicop-
ter” viewing to anticipate and assess when 
members are stuck or fatigued, and to be 
the person who initiates the processes to 
get energy and information flowing again.
Rather than having a neutral facilitator, 
the intention in citizen-facilitated meetings 
is to have facilitated conversations. If the 
designated facilitator will be an active voice 
within the room, then the group itself must 
take on the knowledge and skills base of the 
facilitator. It is imperative that group members 
acquire this knowledge, for in a small group 
led by a citizen facilitator, group members 
will want to suggest approaches to the group’s 
work, take on charting responsibilities, or re-
mind the group to get on task.
The following is a list of duties performed 
by a citizen facilitator.
•	
Develop the agenda either before the meet-
ing or with the group.
•	
Open the meeting.
•	
Achieve role clarification so that members 
can periodically and informally rise to 
facilitate or record “I will sometimes want 
to comment, so will ask someone else to 
facilitate. While I am facilitating, if some-
one goes on for too long, what would you 
like me to do?”
•	
Describe the task as a product—what the 
group will see or hear when done.
•	
Call on others to start the conversation.
•	
Engage in conversation as appropriate.
•	
Protect processes, especially one topic and 
one process at a time.

Developing Confidence  
as a Facilitator
Extensive literature supports the idea that 
beliefs about oneself translate into actions and 
results. Facilitator self-confidence is a dimen-
sion of efficacy applied to the specific work 
of conducting meetings. As previously noted, 
efficacious persons believe that they have 
knowledge and skills that, when applied to a 
goal, will overcome obstacles.
Such self-confidence derives from reflec-
tion on experiences, conversations with col-
leagues, and support from coaches or leaders. 
This chapter closes with the topic of ways to 
develop confidence. No one who is beginning 
to facilitate is a blank slate. Each person 
begins the journey to increasingly effective 
facilitation with unique strengths and unique 
things to learn.
Because there are fewer opportunities to 
facilitate than to teach, teachers invent ways to 
increase their facilitation skills. Gather infor-
mation about conducting meetings. Isolate and 
over-practice essential skills like paraphrasing, 
pausing, probing, and inquiring. Use these any-
where and everywhere. The more you practice, 
the sooner these skills will move to a level of 
unconscious competence, so that you don’t 
need to think about them anymore when you 
are facilitating.
Isolate and practice other skills as well. Lis-
ten to a group when your back is turned to them 
and record what you hear on a chart. Observe 
the group with diffused vision to get a sense of 
the group as a unit, to monitor breathing, and 
to assess energy levels. Select a small group of 
moves and strategies from appendix A and use 
them repeatedly until you are comfortable with 
them. If you are a teacher, most of the strategies 
can be used in the classroom. Use a “Proficiency 
Scale” to assess your current level of facilitation 
effectiveness and plan steps for improvement 
(Garmston and Zimmerman, 2013).
Practice in classrooms, in shopping malls, 
in conversations, in any settings in which 
you are interacting with other people. Of all 
the verbal skills, we encourage overpracticing 
paraphrasing. Use it when you need it least, 
then you will have this skill available when you 
need it most.
Enlarge your repertoire. Pay attention to 
others’ facilitation styles and language. Jot down 
phrases they use. Isolate certain language forms 
to practice. Jot down in advance any phrases 
you would like to incorporate into your next fa-
cilitation. Practice facilitation phrases when you 
are working with students. Keep in mind that 
knowing is different from understanding.
Seek vicarious experiences. It’s been 
demonstrated that one way to personal efficacy 
is to watch someone who performs well (God-
dard, Hoy, and Woolfolk-Hoy, 2004) Talk with 
Forget the Apple:  
Two Minutes a Day  
Brings Confidence  
Your Way
Confident postures (taking more 
space and open stances) increase tes-
tosterone and decrease cortisol leading 
to feelings of confidence and high toler-
ance for risk in both men and women. A 
simple two-minute power-pose manipu-
lation was enough to significantly alter 
the physiological, mental, and feeling 
states of participants (Carney, Cuddy, 
and Yap, 2010). Measurements included 
electrocardiogram, saliva, and interview 
data. The daily practice implications are 
great for mental health. Facilitators could 
assume a superman (or woman) pose for 
two minutes before a meeting or import-
ant event. Admission: it works. Hint: do 
this in private.

such people; explore their reasons for certain 
moves. Ask them to offer you ideas, sugges-
tions, and support.
Hold an object such as a pencil in your 
hand. For some reason, that helps many people 
to stay grounded. Focus on the group, not your-
self. Focusing on yourself is a sure ticket to dis-
comfort. Know that mistakes are your teacher.
Finally, inquire into your own inferences 
about others. “The challenging internal work 
of facilitation,” Roger Schwarz reminds us, 
“is to identify and explore the core values and 
assumptions that guide your actions, to rigor-
ously reflect on how they increase or decrease 
your effectiveness, and to develop a new set 
of values and assumptions that you can use 
to increase your effectiveness and that of the 
groups you work with” (2002, p. 66). Presum-
ing positive intentions, the last of the seven 
norms of collaboration, influences good work 
with groups. However, using the language 
of positive presuppositions (“Given your in-
terest in resolving this . . .”) is not enough if 
your nonverbal behaviors belie what you say. 
Presuming positive intentions is a matter of 
respect for others. Its Latin origin, respecere, 
means to look again, highlighting the active 
nature of respect. Developing as an effective 
facilitator requires reflection and inquiry into 
your own attitudes, assumptions, and beliefs 
about others and the potential of group wis-
dom in a facilitative environment (Ravlin and 
Prickett, 2014).
According to Ravlin and Prickett (2014) 
the workings of positive presuppositions are 
grounded in expectancy theory, first pro-
posed as a model by Victor Vroom (1964), 
and brought into the twenty-first century by 
Redmond (2010) and others. Positive presup-
positions convey expectancy, in the theory’s 
terms: the belief that one’s effort can or will 
indeed result in attaining the stated outcome 
or stance. We know a facilitator who some-
times starts with a new group by saying. 
“I’m pleased to be here as I only work with 
smart groups,” with a gesture drawing the full 
group into this definition. The group will live 
up to the expectancy of the facilitator just as 
teacher expectations influence teacher behav-
iors, which influence student achievement.
Conclusion
Facilitators manage group energy, focus at-
tention, and manage information. They give di-
rections, clarify tasks, frame group perceptions, 
encourage participation, test assumptions, syn-
thesize ideas, encourage participation, and sup-
port the group in its own development. At times 
they intervene to help groups work more effec-
tively and develop collective potential.
Stakeholders have different perspectives. 
A facilitator serves the system by bringing con-
sciousness about the different perspectives. As 
we depart from unproductive school cultures, 
the facilitation role takes on even more value 
than it did in the past. It is one of four lead-
ership roles played by all players in adaptive 
schools, yet it is still the role least occupied by 
teachers and classified staff. Developing as a 
facilitator is challenging, because it entails high 
levels of several skill sets. Improvement re-
sources include self study, modeling, attending 
workshops, and self assessement with profi-
ciency scales and facilitian rubrics are helpful.
Finally, great facilitators help their groups 
see themselves not as they are but as they might 
become. As we shall see in the next chapter, 
both design and facilitation play important 
roles in developing groups.

the surface of group phenomena to seek the 
underlying drivers of these observable be-
haviors. This section continues by presenting 
an intervention model for directing energy

groups as systems. Finally, we describe struc-
tures and tools for facilitating inquiry-driven 
data teams.

PART IV	
RESOURCES FOR INQUIRY
Adaptive leaders disturb the system for 
positive change. They see the group’s potential 
for working effectively and efficiently on the 
right work by providing support for steady per-
formance improvements. These leaders move 
beyond tinkering with surface practices by 
pushing their groups to work at deeper levels 
that engage the beliefs and values that motivate 
collective learning and growth.
Part IV offers a description of six domains 
of group development leaders can target to 
assess and modify their practices. These in-
clude: “Getting Work Done,” “Doing the Right 
Work,” “Working Collaboratively,” “Manag-
ing Systems,” “Developing the Group,” and 
“Adapting to Change.”
In addition we will explore group energy 
as a powerful resource for this type of work. 
Here we present a model for looking below

eveloping groups is one of three jobs assumed by leaders and profes-
sional developers. The other two are the task of getting work done and 
developing process skills. This chapter describes principles of group 
development and provides a way for groups to diagnose themselves on six funda-
mental aspects of group maturity. Chapter 10 provides a systems view of changing 
groups and reveals ways of working for long-range, sustainable change by assess-
ing and intervening at the level of energy sources driving group performance.
Chapter 9	
Six Domains of  
Developing Groups
All groups work at less than full potential. 
The best groups regard this not as a deficiency 
but as a healthy dissatisfaction with their cur-
rent performance. They consistently commit 
their resources to working together more ef-
fectively. This is the way that research teams 
become better at researching, that basketball 
teams win more games, and that theater casts 
improve from performance to performance. 
All groups become better at their tasks when 
they reflect on their work, acquire new knowl-
edge and skills, and practice the fundamentals 
of their craft. As stated previously, any group 
that is too busy to reflect on its work is too 
busy to improve.
All groups are unique. All groups are com-
plex systems in which everything affects every-
thing else, tiny events make major disturbances 
in which you don’t have to touch everyone to 
make a difference. Adaptive leaders of groups 
and within groups—no matter what their title—
realize that developing a group is an ongoing, 
third agenda in their work; the first is getting 
work done, and the second is improving the 
processes of accomplishing work.
The Premises of  
Group Development
Each Group Is Unique
History, cognitive styles, setting, mental 
models, and tasks all contribute to developing 
a group personality. Each group is not only 
unlike other groups, it is also different from the 
sum of its individuals. For example, a group 
might be composed of efficacious individuals 
who nevertheless believe that collectively they 
have little chance of making a difference.
Some Groups Mature
Some groups will mature along a contin-
uum from novice to expert performance. Not 
all groups make this journey, just as not all 
teachers achieve a state of expertise. David 

The Adaptive School
126
Berliner (cited in Calderhead, 1996) specu-
lated that the novice stage in teaching usually 
lasts for the first year and that most teachers 
reach the third stage (competence) within three 
or four years. Only a modest percentage of 
teachers moves to the next stage of profi-
ciency, and an even smaller percentage, says 
Berliner, achieves the expert stage. Contempo-
rary teacher education programs are placing a 
greater emphasis on metacognitive knowledge 
and metacognitive regulation. This monitoring 
of one’s own progress in achieving learning 
goals may abbreviate the novice to expertise 
journey. This is especially important as pro-
grams aim to develop “adaptive expertise” the 
ability to engage in lifelong learning, especially 
from others (Darling-Hammond and Bransford, 
2005; National Research Council, 2000).
We believe that much the same is true for 
group development and that groups with col-
laborative cultures, groups in which members 
practice group member metacognitive skills 
will advance faster than groups with cultures 
of individualization. Expert groups can do in-
creasingly more in less time. They differ from 
novices in these ways:
•	
Have more practical knowledge of the 
social, political, and systems context in 
which their work occurs.
•	
Plan, monitor, and revise their approach to 
problems more effectively.
•	
Spend more time trying to understand a 
problem before generating solutions and 
are more likely to monitor their solution 
attempts.
•	
Are more likely to be reflective and contin-
uously learn through experience.
•	
Do better at distinguishing relevant data 
from nonrelevant data in problem solving.
Attrition Does Not Have  
to Block Development
With intention and attention it is possible 
to minimize and overcome the disruptive ef-
fects of attrition on group dynamics. Groups 
that emphasize developing group-member ca-
pabilities and norms of collaboration infor-
mally provide induction experiences for new 
members (see chapter 4). We work with many 
international schools. In these settings staff 
turnover is high and frequent. Yet, in teams 
that regularly apply collaborative norms and 
meeting standards as a matter of course, new 
members quickly adopt the behaviors of their 
new school.
Variables Affect Performance  
and Performance Capacity
“Soft” variables, such as morale, work 
culture, and trust not only influence the perfor-
mance of a group but also influence the group’s 
ability to learn from its experience (Hennessy, 
1998). As we shall see in the next chapter 
also, the collective energies of efficacy, in-
terdependence, consciousness, craftsmanship, 
and flexibility affect a group’s performance. 
In data-driven climates, it may appear that 
only student-related metrics such as test scores 
and graduation rates have value in guiding 
important efforts. Not so, say a number of 
organizational developers in the private sec-
tor, sociology, and education (Harner, 2015). 
Variables like trust are being measured (exem-
plified in the Chicago school research, such as 
Bryk and Schneider, 2002), work climate, and 
teacher efficacy contribute to understanding 
and improvement.
Learning Organizes Itself  
in Unique Domains
Learning occurs through different pro-
cesses, some centering in the neocortex, others 
at the limbic system, some a combination of 
both. Depending on the model one adopts (all 
models are incomplete) you would say that it 
is nested in hierarchical levels of environment, 
behaviors, capabilities, beliefs, identity, and 
mission. For two decades we have applied 
concepts from this model with success. A

Chapter 9	
127
newer model (Garmston in Costa et al., 2015), 
described in the next chapter, regards these 
domains as interactive within a complex sys-
tem, in which, as we have explored, everything 
affects everything else and tiny events cause 
major disturbanances. The greatest benefits of 
group development efforts come from strategi-
cally intervening in the different domains.
Metacognition and Style Diversity 
Accelerate Learning
Groups that reflect about their experiences 
develop the executive consiousness necessary 
to self-organize and manage the processes 
used to do their work. In other words they 
take time to learn about themselves and how 
they do their work. When diversity in cogni-
tive style exists in groups, such learning is 
accelerated. Teams that manage the style ten-
sions between experiencing, reflecting, think-
ing, and acting achieve the greatest growth 
and greatest accomplishments. Knowledge of 
the six domains of group develoment, below, 
is particularly useful for such groups (Kolb 
and Kolb, 2009).
Maturity Manifests in Six Domains  
of Group Development
Group maturity manifests in the ways that 
a group manages its day-to-day work in order 
to deal with its external environment. How 
well it performs in six interacting domains 
determines the group’s achievement. Each field 
is informed by the application of domain-spe-
cific knowledge, skills, and structures as well 
as unique combinations of efficacy, flexibilty, 
craftsmanship, consciousness, and interdepen-
dence. Each of the chapters in this book 
highlights the resources for developing these 
domains. Readers may wish to turn to the end 
of the chapter now for a description of each 
field and a diagnostic instrument.
The Six Fields of  
Group Development
The six domains of group development 
are (1) getting work done; (2) doing the right 
work; (3) working collaboratively; (4) manag-
ing systems; (5) developing the group; and (6) 
adapting to change.
All groups struggle to achieve a successful 
balance between managing and adapting to 
external relationships and maintaining har-
monious and effective internal relationships 
(Schein, 2004). In each dimension, the issues 
of task accomplishment and process skills de-
velopment compete for attention. Although it is 
useful for groups to realize this macroview of 
their work, it is difficult to assess and intervene 
with group development at this level. To effec-
tively build strong groups capable of maintain-
ing their own identity and adapting to external 
environments, groups must be able to function 
skillfully within each of the six fields. Know-
ing the knowledge bases, skills, and structures 
of each is an essential first step. Knowing the 
assumptions held by the group about each of 
these theaters of operation reveals the mental 
models and drivers of group choices.
Before reading this section, think about a 
group with which you work, and ask yourself 
the following:
1.	
What are our strengths as a group?
2.	 What difficulties do we encounter as we 
work?
3.	
How ready are we to take on increasingly 
complex or emotionally charged tasks?
4.	
What are some potential growth areas for 
us as a group?
Getting Work Done
Leaders and groups understand the dy-
namic relationship between task accomplish-
ment and process skills development. The 

The Adaptive School
128
prevailing mental model in this domain is that 
the group assumes that its work is manageable. 
Essential knowledge includes mastering dia-
logue and discussion (chapter 5), conducting 
successful meetings (chapter 6), designing effi-
cient and effective meetings (chapter 7), using 
facilitation skills (chapter 8), and facilitating 
data teams (chapter 11).
Doing the Right Work
Leaders and groups plan work to realize 
their vision, values, and emerging goals (chapter 
2). The organizing presupposition of this domain 
in that vision, values, and goal clarity focus 
group energy as well as when and how to talk 
about each (chapter 5). The necessary knowl-
edge includes understanding adaptivity (chapter 
2), facilitating data teams (chapter 11), living ef-
fectively with conflict (chapter 12), developing 
the capacities for change and adaptivity (chapter 
13), and creating community (chapter 14).
Working Collaboratively
Leaders and groups work to create and 
maintain an effective environment for collab-
oration and interdependence. The dominant 
presupposition in this domain is that diversity 
is a necessary resource and that subcultures 
must connect with and value one another. The 
knowledge that is necessary to effectively work 
collaboratively and interdependently includes 
focusing on both things and energy (chapter 
2), the four group-member capabilities and the 
seven norms of collaboration (see chapter 4), 
the mastery of dialogue and discussion (chapter 
5), successful meeting management (chapter 
6), time efficient meeting (chapter 7), facilita-
tion skills (chapter 9), facilitating data teams 
(chapter 11), and the ability to work effectively 
with conflict (chapter 12).
Managing Systems
Groups develop new ways of looking at 
the world. An organizing presupposition here 
is that as systems become more complex, the 
ability to think systematically and know when 
to set aside linear logic is important. Critical 
knowledge includes understanding dynamical 
systems (chapter 2), working effectively with 
conflict (see chapter 12), developing the ca-
pacities for change and adaptivity (see chap-
ters 1, 2, and 10), and creating community 
(see chapter 14).
Developing the Group
Whatever the degree of accomplishment, 
groups can become better at their work. Indi-
viduals and groups need to develop resources 
for generating ideas and adapting to change. 
An important presupposition in this domain 
is that both individual and group orientations 
are necessary to produce innovations and im-
plement them. The necessary knowledge in-
cludes information about two ways of talking 
(chapter 6), norms of collaoration (chapter 5), 
about group development (as described in this 
chapter), the ability to work effectively with 
conflict (see chapter 12), the importance of 
professional community (see chapter 4), and 
the principles of creating that community (see 
chapter 14).
Adapting to Change
An effective group relates to multiple 
communities that are external to the group. 
The agendas and resulting demands of these 
communities are often in flux and inconsistent 
with one another. The prevailing presupposi-
tion within this domain is that for groups to 
function effectively, they must constantly adapt 
to external environments. The more turbulent 
the environment, the more the energy must be 
focused outward. Critical knowledge includes 
recognizing schools as complex systems (chap-
ter 2), asking three focusing questions (chapter 
2), working with conflict (see chapter 12), 
developing the capacities for change and adap-
tivity (see chapter 10), and creating community 
(see chapter 14).

Assessing the Six Fields
The six domains are inextricably inter-
twined; woven together, they make a whole. The 
knowledge for one domain is also necessary in 
another. As in all dynamic systems, what affects 
one variable affects the others. Because of this 
interactive nature, an assessment instrument that 
seeks detail about either the “things” or “the 
energy” in each domain would contain redun-
dancies. Mastery of discussion and dialogue, for 
example, are requirements in the first and third 
domains. To be effective at dialogue, individuals 
must internalize the group-member capabilities 
and the norms of collaboration; these elements 
are also a prerequisite for managing conflict in 
the fourth, fifth, and sixth domains. To maximize 
discussion effectiveness, successful meeting 
skills are required, which is a focus in the first 
and third domains.
In contrast to the energies involved in 
assessing “hard data,” the energies in system 
dynamics have traditionally been harder to 
measure, more prone to measurement error, and 
therefore less relied upon as a data source for 
group development. Nevertheless, “the impor-
tance of measurement error diminishes when 
the investigative focus shifts from concern over 
the system’s current state to understanding the 
system’s behavior over time, which is often 
the purpose of a systems dynamics model” 
(Hennessy, 1998, pp. 6–7). Measurement-error 
importance also declines when data are used 
to promote conversations about how a group 
might strengthen itself rather than being used 
for external evaluation.
We have found that a simple rating scale 
such as the following is useful for group 
self-assessment: 1 = Beginning; 2 = Emerg-

ing; 3 = Developing; 4 = Integrating; and 5 = 
Innovating.
Organize a faculty group into subgroups 
of three or four members each. Have them dis-
cuss each domain using the descriptions above. 
Have them rate their group by loose consensus 
on each domain, using this scale. Suggest that 
a way of calibrating their place on the scale 
might be to locate, in general, where the group 
functions along a continuum of unconscious in-
competence (they don’t know they don’t know) 
to unconscious competence (performing with 
effortlessness). Rate the major knowledge areas 
in each domain as follows:
Beginning
Unconscious incompetence: We don’t know what we don’t know.
Emerging
Unconscious incompetence to conscious competence: We are  discovering 
areas in which we want to learn.
Developing
Conscious competence: We are applying skills but with much effort, requiring 
more attention to how we are using a skill than to the results we are getting 
and possible needs for modifying our  approach.
Integrating
Conscious competence to unconscious competence: We are beginning to be 
able to focus on results and the skill we are  employing.
Innovating
Unconscious competence: Our skills are so internalized we can put our full 
attention on the realtionship and the results we are getting, allowing us to 
effortlessly modify our approach if necessary.
Adapting
Reflective competence: Having gained unconsious competence, we routinely 
reflect, learn from, and modify future interactions.
Now have the subgroups report their as-
sessments to the entire group. Search for agree-
ment among subgroups and set those aside. 
Locate areas of disagreement and seek to un-
derstand the differences in perception. Come to 
an accommodation in ratings. From this analy-
sis, have the group select a domain for further 
study and development (figure 9.2).

A Systems Approach for 
Developing Groups
Like birds lifting off from far reaches in a 
meadow and flocking together in flight, ideas 
emerge from a variety of sources in a group, 
suggestive of a systems approach to developing 
groups. Within the literature on organizational 
development and school change, it is now taken 
for granted that teacher work and learning is 
largely influenced by socialization and that the 
culture of the workplace is significant in deter-
mining how teachers think, what they do, and 
how they express themselves (Hargreaves and 
Fullan, 2012; Newmann and Wehlage, 1995; 
Rosenholtz, 1991). From anthropology, cyber-
netics, psychology, and organizational science 
(Dilts, 1996) come conceptions of nested lev-
els of learning in which learning at one level 
influences learning at another. In this model, a 
sense of identity organizes and informs other 
levels of learning. In another model, learning 
domains are parts of complex systems (Costa 
and Garmston, 2016). In this model, too, the 
sense of identity is dominant.
In the following chapter, group identity 
is identified as a catalytic entity, changeable 
through circumstances and time, that when 
selected as a focus of intervention, can dramati-
cally affect group performance. Like individual 
identity, organizational identity is also fluid. 
This instability is regarded as an asset to adapti-
vite change (Gioia, Schulz, Corley, 2000). Orga-
nizational idenity can be clarified in patterns of 
self-reflection. Four essential questions promote 
this line of inquiry: Who are we? What do we 
take to be central to our work? What do we 
believe makes our group distinct from the per-
ceptions of other groups? What is perceived by 
us to be an enduring quality of our organization? 
Additionally, five collective energy sources—
efficacy, flexibiity, craftsmanship, consiousness 
and interdependence are described as potential 
places of intervention to support stuck groups in 
moving toward their potential.
The newer sciences—quantum physics, 
cognitive anthropology, complexity theory, and 
the study of fractals—portray a view of life or-
ganizing itself. Margaret Wheatley and Myron 
Kellner-Rogers (1996), articulate translators of 
the new sciences for leadership agendas, write 
the following:
Identity, then, is another essential condition 
for organization. It is the self of the system 
that compels it toward particular actions 
and behaviors. . . . Organizational structures 
emerge in response to these imperatives of 
identity. Identity is at the core of every organi-
zation, fueling its creation. (pp. 85–86)

on’t fix it until it shows. Disappointing test scores, airline arrival records, 
or accidents due to improper seat belt use spur policymakers to action. 
Action too often involves applying fixes to surface events to stimulate 
changes in the data. Such approaches rarely do much but modify data points, and 
fail to address the root problems that led to the undesirable results. Also, it is rare 
that such changes are sustainable. The American saying, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix 
it,” in practice is really, “If it doesn’t show, don’t fix it.”
Chapter 10	 Developing Groups for 
Sustainable Change
Efforts at change often focus more on 
things than energy. Modifying schedules, mak-
ing curriculum changes, and adding new in-
structional materials lead the list. While energy, 
too, is addressed, it may be in the form of 
inservice training programs directed at teach-
ers who are seen as workers needing to be told 
what and how to teach rather than profession-
als who make decisions about teaching and 
learning. Thankfully, we see an increase in 
professional development programs that treat 
teachers as professionals. These long-term ap-
proaches focus on creating collaborative work 
cultures with attention to follow-up, practice, 
and coaching.
This chapter examines group develop-
ment through the lenses of intervening not at 
the surface practices of groups, but rather at 
their source. Policymakers, novice groups, and 
leaders of silo organizations value individuality 
over interdependence and analyze data in a 
vacuum. Experts seek patterns and look be-
neath the surface, seeking driving forces. Nat-
ural systems such as schools, departments, and 
family units cannot be directed, only disturbed. 
After decades of absence, the reintroduction of 
disturbances, like the meteorologist’s butterfly 
metaphor or the reintroduction of the grey wolf 
to Yellowstone National Park, affect everything 
else in their systems (Yellowstone Wolf Proj-
ect, 2013). Maturana and Varela (1987) write, 
“Systems choose what to notice and how to pay 
attention.” Leaders disturb systems by bringing 
attention to what’s being overlooked.
In this chapter we explore a way of inquir-
ing beneath visible behaviors and detectable 
patterns to search for potential sources of what 
groups do. Readers will find first, a description 
of an “iceberg” model (figure 10.1), second, 
a defintion of terms in the lower parts of the 
model, and finally, ideas for intervening at 
sources of behaviors, rather than on what is 
seen and heard.
Later, we examine another model for in-
fluencing change below the surface, bringing 
forward a version of Robert Dilt’s conceptual 
treatment of nested levels of learning. Dilts 
organized his thinking in vertical form, like the 
deep to surface model, and positioned identity 
as the variable responsible for the greatest 
change in beliefs, values, and behaviors. We 
have modified this in keeping with our sense 
that humans, too, are complex dynamic sys-
tems and their developmental processes are 
subject to the same system principles described 
in chapter 2.

Figure 10.1.  Moving from Deep to Surface Structure
Deep to Surface Structure
Figure 10.1 has its genesis in the work 
of Noam Chomsky. In the 1950s Chomsky 
created a transformational linguistics model 
that was later elaborated on for work in 
therapy (Bandler and Grinder, 1975). Since 
then, applications of this “iceberg” model 
have been developed in such diverse fields as 
cognitive-behavioral therapy and architecture. 
In the 1990s, Costa and Garmston adapted 
it to their work in “Cognitive Coaching” 
(Garmston and Von Frank, 2012). It is broadly 
accepted that humans (and groups) act on in-
ternal maps, models, beliefs, and perceptions 
of the world, rather than what could be con-
sidered real. The iceberg figure illustrates how 
inquiries into the sources of surface behaviors 
reveal, and can stimulate, changes to core as-
pects of deep structure.
Figure 10.1 depicts the relationship be-
tween the surface structure of what is seen and

Chapter 10

heard from groups and their members (words, 
behaviors, norms, policies) and the underlying 
factors that inform and shape them—the deep 
structure elements of beliefs, values, identity, 
and mental models. Below that, reference struc-
ture refers to emotionally laden events—like a 
tornado-ravaged school, or a teacher strike. In 
this model, anything in surface structure could 
theoretically be traced to origins below.
By shining the light of consciousness on 
essential inner structures, skillful leaders help 
groups identify the underlying mental models 
that might be limiting perspectives and possi-
bilities. When facilitators or group members 
pose questions like “Who are we?” “Why are 
we doing this?” or “Why are we doing it this 
way?” as described in chapter 2, mental models 
held in deep structure are revealed. Addition-
ally, the practice of dialogue and certain facili-
tation strategies can illuminate mental models, 
identities, beliefs, and values. Groups may pose 
questions to themselves referencing manifesta-
tions of the five energy sources:
•	
“What is it we do not know, that if know-
ing it, would increase our chances of 
success?”
•	
“What might need to happen for us to in-
crease our collective consciousness?”
•	
“What appear to be our assumptions about 
this matter?”
•	
“Whose thinking has not yet been tapped?”
•	
“What ideas might help us stay the course 
even through frustration and ambiguity?”
Some groups get stuck in limiting beliefs 
such as “The administration is unresponsive to 
our needs,” “These kids can’t learn because of 
their home environments,” or “We value our 
autonomy and don’t need to coordinate our 
efforts with others.” Leaders who listen be-
low the surface, pausing, paraphrasing, posing 
questions, and presuming positive intentions, 
structure dialogues that permit group members 
to inquire about their own assumptions, beliefs, 
and values. These dialogues explore driving 
behaviors and choices appearing in the surface 
struture. One cannot influence what is invisible.
Reference Stucture Content
The word “reference” is derived from 
the Latin referre, “to carry back.” It means to 
link back, and in the iceberg model denotes 
that this is the source for what lies above. The 
reference structure houses emotionally vivid 
experiences. A divisive teacher strike and its 
aftermath affect emotional responses for many 
years—long after the school board members 
and the administrative teams have left or re-
tired. Other reference structures might include 
the closing of a cherished program or school, 
feelings of betrayal related to continuing 
misunderstandings in decision making, or a 
sudden influx of a different type of student. 
Individuals also carry reference structures 
that inform meaning making. Some of these 
storage and interpretive processes begin be-
fore speech develops. The reference structure 
informs collective mental models, beliefs, 
values, and identities. Of course individual 
reference structures also exist, making leader-
ship messy enough to be interesting.
Deep Structure Content
It is here that the “rules” for how the 
world works or is supposed to work are 
encoded. Some of these meanings are held 
consciously, and some are outside conscious 
awareness, yet all inform and direct choices 
and behaviors. Responses to change initia-
tives, problem-solving models, and the criteria 
for effective solutions are all rooted in the 
deep structure of the group.
The actual workings and influences of 
the deep-structure elements are not always 
apparent to group members. Like an iceberg, 
seven-eighths of which lies hidden below wa-
ter, special tools are necessary to illuminate and 
mediate what is there. Remarkably, the simple 
paraphrase is such a tool, and all forms of in-

The Adaptive School

quiry will disclose portions of this underworld. 
Examining discrepancies between espoused 
beliefs and actions often reveals unconscious 
sources of tension and inconsistent choices. 
Schools that champion inclusive cultures can 
undermine their efforts with awards programs 
that recognize only a few high achievers.
Five Sources of Energy  
as Places to Intervene
Our premise is that the five energy sources 
of efficacy, flexibility, craftsmanship, con-
sciousness, and interdependence influence 
states of performance and are modifiable by 
mediated experience. They are related to stages 
of cognitive, moral, and ego development. 
Skilled leaders take a developmental view in 
working with individuals and groups.
Consciousness
Consciousness is depicted in figure 10.1 as 
giving access to what lies below a group’s be-
havior. Language is the medium for revealing 
deep structure content. To be conscious is to be 
Figure 10.2.  Group Performance and Energy Sources

Developing Groups for Sustainable Change	
Chapter 10	
137
aware of one’s thoughts, feelings, intentions, 
behaviors, and the effects they have on others. 
Consciousness is a prerequisite to self-control 
and self-direction for both individuals and 
groups. Although all groups are capable of 
reflective consciousness, many do not practice 
this. Stevens and Campion (1994) refer to this 
energy source as a group’s “executive con-
sciousness,” required to self-organize and man-
age its work. Groups that use this energy source 
maintain an awareness of their values, norms, 
and identity; monitor the congruence of their 
espoused beliefs and their manifest beliefs; 
and stand outside themselves to reflect on their 
processes and products. Such groups are also 
aware of their criteria for decision making and 
of how their own assumptions and knowledge 
might interfere with their learning.
Efficacy
Perceived collective efficacy refers to 
the judgment of teachers in a team that the 
group as a whole can organize and execute the 
courses of action required to have a positive 
effect on students. The choices groups make 
are influenced by the strength of their efficacy 
beliefs. Goddard, Hoy, and Woolfolk-Hoy 
(2004) find that to have a high degree of 
collective efficacy group members must be-
lieve that they and others, individually and 
together, are capable of producing increased 
student success and of overcoming obstacles 
to that goal. Participating in decision-making 
contributes strongly to teachers’ beliefs in the 
capabilities of their peers, fosters commitment 
to school goals, and promotes gains in student 
achievement. The RAND change-agent study 
(McLaughlin, 1990) found a staff’s collective 
efficacy to be the most consistent variable 
related to school success. Bandura (1986, 
1997) proposes three sources of efficacy- 
shaping information relevant to groups: ac-
complishments in which the group attributes 
its achievements to its own decisions, skills, 
and hard work, rather than fate or luck; vicari-
ous experiences; and social persuasion.
Efficacy is particularly catalytic because 
it is a determining factor in the resolution 
of complex problems. If groups feel little 
efficacy, blame, withdrawal, and rigidity are 
likely to follow. Teams with robust efficacy, 
however, are likely to expend more energy 
in their work, persevere longer, set more 
challenging goals, and continue in the face 
of failure. Efficacious groups regard events 
as opportunities for learning, are motivated 
by and committed to achieving shared goals, 
learn from experiences, focus resources where 
they will make the greatest difference, know 
what they know and do not know, and develop 
strategies to learn what is needed (Goddard, 
Hoy, and Woolfolk-Hoy, 2004).
Flexibility
As groups develop cognitively, they value 
and more consistently view situations from 
multiple perspectives. Piaget called this over-
coming egocentrism. Cultivating group mem-
ber flexibility helps them to see others as more 
than their roles and not be trapped by constantly 
checking for agreement with personal views. In 
this way they form broader perspectives by see-
ing themselves and others as players in a larger 
drama in which they all simultaneously play 
central and secondary parts.
The peak performers Garfield (1986) stud-
ied displayed an ability for flexible attention 
that he called microattention and macroatten-
tion. Microattention involves logical analytical 
computation and seeing cause and effect in 
methodical steps. It is important in problem 
analysis or curriculum planning. It encom-
passes attention to detail, precision, and orderly 
progressions. Macroattention is useful for dis-
cerning themes and patterns from an assort-
ment of information. It is intuitive, holistic, and 
conceptual. Macrothinking is good for bridging 
gaps, and it enables one to perceive a pattern 
even when some of the pieces are missing.
Groups that develop this energy source 
honor and value diversity within and outside 
the group, attend to both rational and intuitive 

The Adaptive School
138
ways of thinking, can collectively shift per-
spective, and utilize a wide array of thinking 
and process skills. Such groups can also nav-
igate the internal tensions of confusion and 
ambiguity and become unstuck by generating 
multiple actions for moving ahead.
Flexibility is a prerequisite to demonstrat-
ing respect for diverse perspectives. Flexible 
teachers are empathetic. Flexible groups listen 
with their ears, eyes, heart, and mind. They are 
cognitively empathetic with students, which 
enables them to predict misunderstandings and 
anticipate the most useful learning experiences. 
Flexibility, like efficacy, is related to risk tak-
ing. Creative groups live close to the edge, 
pushing frontiers, generating new knowledge, 
experimenting with new ways, and constantly 
growing into new abilities.
Craftsmanship
Data from the League of Professional 
Schools (Glickman, 1991) found that in schools 
where teachers are the most successful, they 
have the highest dissatisfaction with the re-
sults of their work. Success, for craftsmanlike 
groups, produces self-imposed higher stan-
dards in an ongoing cycle of improvement. In a 
study using cognitive coaching with university 
professors, Garmston and Hyerle (1988) found 
that as craftsmanship increased, the professors 
grew in their ability to be critically self-reflec-
tive and effective in producing self-analysis 
and evaluation.
To appreciate this energy source, consider 
the mindset of expert performers such as mu-
sicians, artists, teachers, craftspeople, race car 
pit crews, and athletic teams. They take pride 
in their work and consistently strive to improve 
current performance. Craftsmanship—the drive 
for elaboration, clarity, refinement, and preci-
sion—is the energy source from groups who 
ceaselessly learn and deepen their knowledge, 
skills, and effectiveness. Groups that access 
this resource invest energy in honing and in-
venting better ways to do their work, honor 
in themselves and others the arduous journey 
from novice to expert, manage time effectively, 
and continually improve inter- and intra-group 
communications. They create, hold, calibrate, 
and refine performance and product standards 
for their work.
Interdependence
Interdependence is a recognition of the 
interconnections among individuals, other 
groups, the school, distrct, the community and 
all aspects of cultures in their setting. Inter-
dependence is a key value in communities of 
practice; groups that share a common interest 
and meet to extend their learning together to 
refine their crafts. Teams that have grown in 
interdependence manage individual differences 
and trust the group enough to voice dissimilari-
ties (Kolb and Kolb 2009). Sergiovanni (1994) 
tells us that the German sociologist Ferdinand 
Tonnies called this way of being gemeinschaft. 
Gemeinschaft is a community of mental life. 
Gemeinschaft contrasts with gesellschaft, in 
which community values have been replaced 
by contractual ones. The more policies a group 
has, the less the sense of community. This is 
the case in most modern organizations. Inter-
dependent peoples’ sense of self is enlarged 
from a conception of me to a sense of us. They 
understand that individuality is not lost as they 
connect with the group; only egocentricity is.
Interdependent groups value and trust 
the process of dialogue, have an awareness 
of their multiple relationships and identities 
with other groups, and regard disagreement as 
a source of learning and transformation. They 
regard knowledge as fluid, provisional, and 
subject to new interpretation with additional 
experience. Perhaps most important, interde-
pendent groups see the group not just as it is 
but also for its potential.
Surface Structure Content
Behaviors, placed at the surface structure 
in the iceberg model, are what individuals or 
groups do. They represent what is visible, yet 

Developing Groups for Sustainable Change	
Chapter 10	
139
offer few cues as to the sources of actions. 
Language is used to describe behaviors, and the 
paraphrase is supremely qualified as the first 
move in intervention. First, it is not as intrusive 
as an initial question might be, it generates elab-
oration and clarification, and is a natural bridge 
to futher understanding through questions. One 
cannot intervene with the invisible. Opening a 
window to deep structure content permits even 
further understanding and mediation.
Kegan and Lahey (2001) propose that 
work settings are language communities and 
that group leaders are leading language com-
munities: “[Al]though every person, in any 
setting, has some opportunity to influence the 
nature of language, leaders have exponentially 
greater access and opportunity to shape, alter, 
or ratify the existing language rules” (p. 8). 
By attending to the verbal and nonverbal com-
munication cues of group members, skilled 
group leaders frame their own communication 
patterns to positively influence the perceptions, 
choices, and decisions of their groups.
Deep Structure Content
Mostly unarticulated in deep structure are 
five influential entities: identity, beliefs, values, 
mental models, and energy sources. Others, 
too, reside there and will be described later.
Identity. This is a group’s sense of itself; 
it is related to beliefs and values. Albert and 
Whetten (1985) characterized organizational 
identity as a self-reflective question: Who are 
we as an organization? They concluded that 
organizational identity could be summarized 
in three major dimensions: (a) what is taken by 
the organization to be central to its work; (b) 
what insiders believe makes the organization 
distinct from other organizations; and (c) what 
is perceived by members to be an enduring 
quality of the organization.
Melucci (1995) describes collective iden-
tity as a shared definition generated by a num-
ber of individuals. This collective perception 
shapes communication models and interactions 
with outside groups. More recently Polletta and 
Jasper (2001) defined collective identity as the 
cognitive, moral, and emotional connections 
individuals have with the practices of a broader 
community or institution.
Groups interpret experiences and choose 
behaviors that are intended to maintain the 
continuity of self-generated self-concepts over 
time. Self-concepts are also maintained by 
comparisons with others. Groups seek posi-
tive differences between themselves and other 
groups as a way of enhancing their own self-es-
teem. Like individuals, they see themselves as 
distinct and act as if they are unique.
Beliefs. Beliefs are what a group is emo-
tionally invested in based on assumptions 
and convictions regarding people, concepts, or 
things. Groups that believe they are effective 
(efficacy) act that way and actually are. Groups 
that feel powerless to influence decisions within 
the school act that way. Behaviors driven 
by beliefs reinforce beliefs which reinforce 
behaviors in an endless cycle. School commu-
nities who share a sense of collective efficacy 
provide students with instructional experiences 
that contribute to higher learning than school 
groups who do not share this belief. They are 
more effective and likely to be more effective 
(Hoy, Tarter, and Woolfolk-Hoy, 2006).
Values. Values are about right and wrong, 
professional or unprofessional, good or bad and 
most often have a strong emotional component. 
“We are all in this together,” “Cultural differ-
ences are to be valued,” or “Critical thinking is 
the most essential disposition for students,” are 
examples of values. They are often grounded 
in universal “truths” like dignity, compassion, 
or independence.
Mental Models. Mental models can be 
conceived as “small-scale models” of reality 
used to explain how things work, anticipate 
events, and to reason. Mental models are gen-
erally founded on unquantifiable, obscure, or 
incomplete facts. As a result, all mental mod-
els are incomplete; they contain distortions, 
deletions, and generalizations. They serve as 
perception filters, interpreting the behavior of 
all people to “see” what they want to. People 

The Adaptive School
140
make decisions based on their mental models, 
not on objective reality.
Intervening at Deep Structures
All linguistic expressions are incomplete 
from their total meaning. “Atyaf is a bright 
student” is incomplete in many ways. The word 
bright is undefined. Also undefined is student. 
“Is,” might also bear elaboration as Mr. Clinton 
once observed. The speaker, often below con-
scious levels, has elaborate and detailed models 
for what is meant by the five words in the sen-
tence. It is only in deep listening that the speaker 
can articulate meanings, beliefs, or values inter-
nally held. The greater the simplicity of a mental 
model, the less it represents things as they actu-
ally are. To become more effective, groups must 
refine and add the unstated complexity.
Resources for making explicit deep struc-
ture content largely rely on the skill sets related 
to the seven norms of collaboration. These are 
employed in dialogue posed around penetrating 
questions—“What might be some evidence we 
are growing in collective efficacy?”—and strat-
egies like “Card Sort” and “Shuffle” or “First 
Turn Last Turn” found under the discourse 
heading in appendix A.
Identity Interventions
Identity is not fixed, but rather it is a mov-
ing target according to neuroscientist Damasio 
(2010). Group development approaches that 
refine collective identity include constructing 
metaphors that expand senses of identity, and 
questions designed to stimulate reflection at 
this level (“In what ways are we a teaching 
school and in what ways a learning school?”), 
and meeting practices that shift the spotlight 
from group members as information receivers 
to group members as constructors of meaning.
Beliefs and Values Interventions
Ask groups to compare their espoused be-
havior to acted behaviors. They gain clarity and 
sharpen practice to more clearly align with their 
values. Conduct a dialogue on group values, 
then make a criteria matrix with group values on 
one side and program choices on the other. Con-
duct the “Assumptions Wall” strategy described 
in appendix A. In this activity, group members 
nonjudgmentally illuminate and examine their 
assumptions about sources, rationale, values, 
and consequences. This develops a greater un-
derstanding of the presenting issue and of one 
another. Another way to challenge mental mod-
els is to hold a values challenge seminar. Best 
done in a retreat setting, this is a conversation 
in which the group’s core values are identified 
and then tested against a variety of increasingly 
complex scenarios. Other options are the” Card 
Sort and Shuffle” strategy, “In and Out of the 
Frame,” “Issues Agenda,” and “Causal-Loop 
Diagram” (see appendix A).
Capabilities Interventions
Capabilities are not described in the iceberg 
model, but inferred in mental models, and are 
the metacognitive activities related to behaviors. 
To know one’s intention and choose congruent 
behaviors is an example of a capability. Engage 
members in a study of the four group-member 
capabilities from chapter 4. To start, invite con-
scious application of one capability at a time 
with periodic reflection and reports.
Improving Collective 
Effectiveness
Groups cannot improve behaviors of which 
they are unaware. In this section we offer sev-
eral lenses and approaches for helping group 
members to see themselves as a group. Group 
development is a responsibility shared with 
each group member. Ultimately it is the group’s 
group, and leaders support groups in owning 
the intentions and processes of improvement.
At least five intervention strategies can be 
used to illuminate and enhance the five energy 
sources: mediating, structuring, teaching, mod-
eling, and monitoring.

Mediating
Mediating any of the five energy sources 
brings them into view for groups and offers 
platforms for improvement. The intent of medi-
ating is self-directed learning. To mediate is to 
shine a judgment-free “flashlight” on internal 
or external data in order to lead to self-directed 
learning. While invitational questions may be 
the initial entry into an energy source, other 
tools of mediation include many of the norms 
of collaboration. Mediation most often occurs 
in relation to reflecting on prior experiences, 
planning, or problem solving. Costa and Garm-
ston (2015) offer detailed maps for how to 
coach in these three dimensions.
Figure 10.2 describes behaviors of effec-
tive groups as they relate to each energy source. 
You might hear members posing these ques-
tions to themselves, or as a group developer, 
you might ask similiar questions of groups.
Efficacy
“How might we focus our resources to 
make the biggest difference?”
“When are some times when our persever-
ance led to great success?”
Consciousness
“Who are we?”
“Why are we doing this?”
Flexibility
“How might we incorporate some of the 
diverse ideas on the table?”
“What other perspectives might we take 
on this?”
Craftsmanship
“What parts of our values should inform 
our criteria for deciding X?”
“So the first draft is good. How can we 
make it better?”
Interdependence
“Who might be some of our allies on this 
topic?”
“What could we be doing to align our en-
ergies with team 6?”
Structuring
To structure is to manage the physical 
environment, the agenda, the tasks, and the 
grouping of participants in ways designed to 
promote certain levels of learning. This inter-
vention acts on the level of environment in the 
Dilts model below. Stategically modifying the 
environment can increase the likelihood of ex-
tending capacities, perspectives, and behaviors 
related to any one of the energy sources. Some 
examples follow:
•	
Arrange the room so that the visual focus 
of members is on a chart, not one another, 
during problem-solving conversations. 
This helps to put problems “out there” 
and not in the participants (flexibility and 
interdependence).
•	
Use the Learning Partners strategy (see 
appendix A) to break up cliques (flexibility 
and interdependence).
•	
Use role diversity as a criterion for form-
ing subgroups. On a school site council, 
for example, place a parent within each 
small cluster of teachers to list experiences 
on a topic. One typical byproduct is a 
respect for one another’s experiences that 
leads to universal perceptions of being a 
valued member of the group and being 
able to contribute (flexibility, interdepen-
dence, and efficacy).
•	
Organize the agenda so that subgroups 
work on specific tasks during the meeting 
(craftsmanship, efficacy).
Teaching
The intervention of teaching is best suited 
to behaviors and capabilities. When combined 
with mediated experiences, exposition and 
story can influence learning at the levels of 
belief system and identity. Ultimately, this 
form of intervention includes the entire reper-
toire of good instruction: assessing, explain-
ing, giving examples, scaffolding, practicing, 
reading, and so on.

The Adaptive School

Self-assessments provide a starting point 
for an adult learning experience. This notion is 
very much in line with the growing literature 
on the influence of formative assessments as 
guides to student learning (Stiggins, 2007). 
To focus on specific energy sources, group 
developers might share descriptions of the five 
energy sources and ask group members to share 
their impressions of which ones are strength 
areas and which ones are stretch areas for this 
group. These impressions are starting points for 
planning group growth goals.
A group inventory has been developed by 
our colleagues Carolee Hayes and Jane Ellison. 
(See www.thinkingcollaborative.com/tc-apps/.)
Modeling
Leaders and group members practice mod-
eling when they display exemplars of specific 
skills (like paraphrasing) or complexes of 
skills (like balancing inquiry and advocacy) in 
work settings with colleagues. Two refinements 
add to the potency of modeling as a learning 
device. First is to talk out loud about one’s 
rationale in order to have metacognition about 
the particular behavior being modeled. Second 
is to practice public modeling, in which for ex-
ample you announce to a group that in today’s 
meeting you are going to work on improving 
your use of pausing. Reveal your reasons and 
ask the group members to be prepared to share 
their perceptions on the effectiveness of your 
application of the behavior.
Monitoring
Monitoring involves collecting data on a 
dynamic of interest to the group and reflecting 
on how this informs the group of its working 
patterns and how the group might improve its 
effectiveness. A critical mindset is that the group 
is gathering and examining data to improve, not 
prove or judge, a level of performance. Groups 
may gather information on their use of the norms 
of collaboration, the degree of congruence with 
meeting standards, an assessment of the operat-
ing energy sources, the inclusion of members, 
the value placed on diverse perspectives, and 
other subjects that interest them.
We have learned that the use of a process 
observer, a member who gathers data on par-
ticipant behaviors while the group is working, 
might generate more negative effects than 
positive ones. A pattern of externally provided 
data will often lead a group toward a greater 
dependence on outside assessment, reduce 
the capacity for accurate self-assessment, and 
diminish the capacity for self-directed learn-
ing. Work with both students and adults has 
confirmed this (Sanford, 1995). Observers can 
effectively support learning when they follow 
a pattern in which the data are displayed with-
out interpretation and the group is invited to 
interpret it.
A strategy that employs both monitoring 
and mediation involves asking two questions 
of group members for their private reflection: 
“What are some of the decisions you made 
about when and how to participate in the pre-
ceding conversation?” and “What are some of 
the influences of your decisions on yourself and 
others?”/ “How did your decisions influence 
yourselves and others?” After silent reflection, 
the members might write a response, share 
and interact with a neighbor, or practice a full 
round-robin reflection.
Expert groups are more likely than novice 
groups to be reflective. The more reflection, 
the greater the learning from experience. Non-
reflection dooms a group to repeat the same 
behaviors over and over, regardless of whether 
they are producing desired results.
Every working group has far more task 
than time. This contributes to a natural reluc-
tance to use any precious time to monitor or 
reflect on the group’s working processes. Some 
groups resolve this tension by committing 
themselves to a task-process ratio. They bud-
get a certain portion of each meeting to their 
own learning, exploring how well the group is 
working and what it might do to improve.

A Second Intervention Model
In a quantum world, everything influ-
ences everything else. Anthropologist and 
cyberneticist Gregory Bateson was fond of 
saying that all beings exist within holonomous 
systems. That is, each person is part of several 
greater systems (e.g., families, teams, schools) 
yet maintains a unique identity and palette of 
choices, both as an independent agent and as 
the member of a group. Each system influ-
ences the individual, and, to a lesser degree, 
the individual influences the system. Based 
on work by Bateson and conceived by Robert 
Dilts (1994, 1996), this model shows identity 
as influencing all other aspects of learning. 
Dilts describes four operating principles in 
this model:
1.	
Any system (of activity) is a subsystem 
embedded inside another system. Each 
system is also embedded in an even larger 
system.
2.	
Learning occurs in each subsystem in a 
manner specifically related to that sub-
system.
3.	
Learning at each level organizies and con-
trols the information on levels below.
4.	
Learning something on an upper level will 
change things on lower levels, but learning 
something on a lower level might or might 
not influence the levels above it.
Dilts borrowed the “levels” metaphor from 
Bateston’s work on learning to learn and as-
sumed learning as cascading from one level to 
the ones below. He identified the levels as fol-
lows: identity; beliefs and values, capabilities; 
behaviors; and environment. We have applied 
this model to our work with groups for over a 
decade and found great value in using it as an 
intervention model, not only with groups but 
with individuals. Today our agreement with 
Dilts is that identity influences all the other 
elements. However, based on our continuing 
learning about complex systems, our exam-
ination of Bateson’s work, and critiques of 
the Dilts model we are replacing the “levels” 
metaphor in our thinking with something more 
congruent with our knowledge of complex 
systems and holons, refering to the Dilt’s lev-
els, instead, as domains (Armour 2015; Tosey 
2006; and Dilts 1994, 2003, 2014).
In Garmston’s view (figure 2.3) of the ele-
ments of learning, we see the elements as 
dynamical in which everything affects every-
thing else. Yet there are two dominant players 
within this system. Identity, we believe, is the 
major influence on all the elements within 
the system, informing beliefs, values, capa-
bilities, and behavior. Next, environment can 
modify the expressions of identity. To show 
this idea, we have placed environment as the 
surround and note that one’s environment 
has a modifying effect on the expression of 
beliefs, values, capabilities, and behaviors. 
Changing the environment—say, from one in 
which mediation is a primary leadership ac-
tivity to one in which command and control is 
more common—modifies not only behaviors 
but also the potential for learning. (Costa and 
Garmston, 2015)
Our thinking is influenced by Arthur Koes-
tler’s (1972) introduction of holons. A holon 
is a system in which everything is at the same 
time a part of something else and a whole in 
and of itself. In this view a school is a whole 
and simultaneously part of a district. The 
district also is part of a larger system. Wilber 
(2001) extended this idea by introducing the 
concept of “holorchies,” which are hierachies 
of holons.
Dilts held that the levels are embedded in 
one another and called them nested levels of 
learning. In his view each level is more abstract 
than the next and has a greater degree of impact 
on the individual or group. We agree with Dilts 
that identity is the most influential of all the 
domains in this model.
From the psychological point of view there 
seem to be five levels that you work with 
most often. (1) The basic domain is your 
environment, your external constraints. (2) 
You operate on that environment through 

The Adaptive School
144
your behavior. (3) Your behavior is guided by 
your mental maps and strategies, which define 
your capabilities. (4) These capabilities are 
organized by belief systems. . . . (5) Beliefs 
are organized by identity. (Dilts, 1994, p. 1)
Instead of levels, our view is that each do-
main interacts with each of the others.
In our current practices, we are finding it 
useful to regard Dilts’s model not as a hier-
archical, linear map that assumes clocklike 
operation in which the same inputs will con-
sistently produce the same result. Rather, we 
are seeing it as describing a complex system 
made of many moving parts operating within 
environmental systems that are constantly 
changing. Complex systems are those in 
which everything affects everything else, tiny 
inputs cause major disturbances, more data 
are not a greater predicator of results, and 
both things and energy matter. (Costa, Garm-
ston, Ellison, and Hayes, 2015a, p. 31)
Figure 10.3 below shows the Dilts el-
ements as conceptualized by Garmston as 
operating within a dynamical system (Costa, 
Garmston, Ellison, and Hayes, 2015b p. 33).
Two factors in figure 10.3 have the greatest 
influence on group development: identity and 
environment. Identity, as in the Dilts model, 
influences all elements within a system except 
environment. Equally important, environment 
can modify the expressions of identity. We 
have witnessed work cultures transitioning 
from authoritarian structures to collaborative 
settings modifying not only behaviors, but also 
potentials for learning.
Collective shifts in identity, we believe, 
primarily occur through experiences rich 
enough to rattle mental models if opportunities 
are provided for extensive reflection. A com-
munity coming together to support one another 
in response to a tragedy comes to mind. Disrup-
tive events like labor conflicts can also create 
profound identity shifts for several parts of a 
school community. More hopefully, processes 
that challenge or examine assumptions, beliefs, 
or values—processes similar to the two-hour 
identity intervention described on page 146—
can also be effective.
How to Work with Dilts
Here we offer a few perhaps overly simple 
ideas for seeking change through elements of 
the Dilts model—identity, beliefs/values, ca-
pabilities, behaviors, and environment. Keep 
in mind that these elements interact with one 
another and additional elements in complex 
systems. The image opposite shows the front 
office “environment” of the Creative Science 
K–8 School in Portland, Oregon. As one can 
imagine, this open office environment evokes 
reactions of openness rather than barriers, 
friendliness rather than distance, and partner-
ship rather than authority.
Kate Bennett, the CSS Principal’s Sec-
retary, noticed that the original layout of the 
front office created confusion and tension. 
The solid U-shaped counter was a barrier to 
communication. Adults were uncertain how to 
communicate with staff, with some waiting be-
hind the counter to interact while others walked 
around it. In addition, students were required 
to record tardiness on a sheet that resided on 
this high counter. Approaching it with the staff 
on the other side, left students feeling scolded.

of School’s cabinet in a small room with lots 
of wall space on which to write. Here is the 
process we used.
1.	
Individuals listed myths people have about 
their group; this is the container in which 
they work and in some ways contributes to 
the identity they work from.
2.	
Pairs worked on four flip charts about 
their responsibilities, purposes, culture, 
and resources.
3.	
The full group made refinements and 
achieved agreement.
4.	
The group was asked, “Given all this, who 
are you?” and a list of ideas was brain-
stormed, then summarized into one tight 
statement.
5.	
The group was asked, “What needs to 
happen next?” Following the admonition 
in chapter 8, we asked who will do what 
by when and four specific action steps 
were identified. The group’s identity was 
reshaped into that of a proactive leadership 
team.
Beliefs/Values
The “Card Stack and Shuffle” and “As-
sumptions Wall” strategies in appendix A both 
require participants to examine beliefs and as-
sumptions. Groups must articulate beliefs and 
values in order to examine them. These two 
strategies and asking groups to compare their 
espoused and actual beliefs take members into 
this territory.
Capabilities
Have members read about group mem-
ber capabilities described in chapter 4. With 
others, ask them to identify which are most 
important and how they will remember to 
employ them. Periodically pose the self-re-
flective question, “What decisions did I make 
about how and when to participate in that con-
versation and what effect did those decisions 
have on me and others?”
Behaviors
Consistent with the Dilts model engaging 
persons in examining capabilities improves the 
related behaviors. The “What decisions did I 
make?” question above is one form. Another 
is to invite members to describe the mental 
processes involved in a behavior. Participants 
that identify metacognitive processes refine the 
behaviors driven by those processes.
Environment
William Isaacs (1999) tells a story of 
presenting to a group of Silicon Valley execu-
tives. After the presentation, instead of having 
a question and answer period, he suggested 
the twenty-five people put their chairs in a 
circle and say whatever thoughts or feelings 
were present at the time, a common activity in 
dialogue. The first few made some comments 
and then one man said this reminded him of a 
camping trip with his two sons when he was 
not sure how they were experiencing the event. 
From that point forward, each person told a 
story of heart and meaning. Educators too, in-
fluence behaviors and emotions through similar 
environmental changes. As another example, 
the third point strategy in appendix A directs 
disagreements to topics rather than persons. 
Most importantly, however is affecting the 
emotional environment by the form of leader-
ship one employs.
The next chapter describes ways teams 
proactively seek and explore potential chal-
lenges to student learning.

ata have no meaning. Meaning emerges from collective sense-making 
by well-structured and skillfully facilitated collaborative groups. Work-
ing with data to improve practices and student learning outcomes is a 
common expectation for grade-level teams, departments, Professional Learning 
Communities (PLCs), and school leadership teams. Yet, many groups struggle 
with this essential task. Relational tensions, feelings of vulnerability and the 
cognitive demands of collective analysis, problem finding, and action planning 
often overwhelm groups. Given these pressures many groups stumble toward 
the quick fix for the poorly defined dilemmas in front of them. Groups operating 
in this fashion lurch from problem to program, slapping remedial bandages on 
issues and concerns.
Chapter 11	 Facilitating Data Teams
Thoughtfully applying many of the con-
cepts, tools, and ideas that precede this chap-
ter helps groups avoid the pitfalls mentioned 
above. Seeing the system that is producing 
learning gaps or behavioral issues (chapters 
1, 2, and 9), developing group member capa-
bilities, norms of collaboration, and two ways 
of talking (chapters 3 and 4), and conducting 
well-designed and skillfully facilitated meet-
ings (chapters 5, 6, and 7) all contribute to 
better run and more satisfying data team work. 
In this chapter we will add specific protocols 
for structuring data-based collaborative inquiry 
along with tips and tools for facilitating these 
processes. Collective efficacy (chapter 10) in-
creases when groups learn to manage their 
external and internal challenges as they come 
to trust the process and one another.
Districts, schools, and teams have to learn 
how to improve. This requires looking deeply 
at the systems that are producing any perfor-
mance gaps that are of concern to staff and 
community members. Anthony Bryk and his 
colleagues (2015) offer three core improve-
ment questions:
1.	
What specific problem are we trying to 
solve?
2.	
What changes might we introduce and 
why?
3.	
How will we know whether the changes 
are actually improvements?
Problem finding is an essential capacity for 
data teams. Two potential pathways guide teams 
in this endeavor. One is to start with an issue or 
concern expressed by some group or other mem-
ber of the school community and frame this topic 
in wording that leads to purposeful data gather-
ing. The other approach is to start with available 
data and query it for the stories they might tell. 
Both pathways are equally productive.
Starting with an issue or concern
Problem finding exercises sometimes de-
velop into “Reality Wars” (Lipton and Well-

The Adaptive School
148
man, 2012). These occur when participants 
have conflicting mental maps of their worlds. 
These maps influence what we see, how we 
see, and how we interpret information in our 
environment. Since all data are subject to 
interpretation, the same information that en-
gages some group members may be dismissed, 
diminished, or denied by others depending on 
their frames of reference.
Starting with an issue calls for careful 
framing. This requires skillful facilitation and 
thoughtful process design. Public recording 
(chapter 6) is a vital part of the process. There 
are three basic ways of framing an issue (Lipton 
and Wellman, 2012). These are (1) constructing 
a problem statement; (2) crafting an inquiry; and 
(3) generating a hypothesis. The context, group 
resourcefulness, and the nature of the specific 
issue at hand are some of the factors that influ-
ence the final choice of the problem frame. It is 
important that the facilitator avoid imposing his 
or her preferred frame on the group.
Constructing a problem statement
Constructing shared problem definitions 
is crucial to success. The patterns of both dia-
logue and discussion support groups in generat-
ing and honing thoughtful problem statements. 
Without these processes problem definitions 
can be challenging to develop. Completing the 
stem “The problem is________” seems decep-
tively simple on the surface, but in reality this 
requires precise thinking and attention to spec-
ificity in language. We’ve had the experience, 
on more than one occasion, of spending for-
ty-five minutes to an hour helping groups sort 
through their perspectives and coalesce around 
a statement that all could agree to. This is time 
well spent since the problem statement greatly 
influences the data quest. There is a significant 
difference between “The problem is that many 
students are floundering when presented with 
nonfiction texts in the content areas.” And “The 
problem is that many of our students lack the 
technical reading skills for comprehending and 
analyzing nonfiction texts in the content areas.” 
The first problem statement leads the group to 
focusing on student performance in the content 
area. The second problem statement leads to an 
exploration of the specific skills that students 
need for grappling with the assigned texts and 
to the teaching repertoire teachers need to learn 
to develop these skills. It might also lead to an 
exploration of successful students and the ways 
in which they have acquired these essential 
reading skills.
Crafting an Inquiry
Framing concerns, anecdotes, and obser-
vations as inquiries opens thinking and widens 
the potential solution set. The trick here is to 
avoid either/or thinking and craft open-ended 
questions that have multiple appropriate an-
swers. A variety of question-generating strate-
gies might be used (see appendix A for exam-
ples). Some typical questions include: “What 
are some essential differences between . . . and 
. . . ?” “How are we doing with . . . ?” “What 
are some of the reasons for . . . ?” and “What 
are the most productive ways to . . . ?” In the 
reading example shared above, a driving ques-
tion might be, “What are the essential reading 
skills that students need to successfully engage 
with content reading?”
Generating a Hypothesis
Anecdotes and observations often lead to 
proposals for solutions. In the worst cases, this 
develops into a competition between advocates 
causing group members to struggle with one 
another in unproductive conversations. Fram-
ing these proposed solutions as hypotheses 
opens pathways to problem solving. The very 
construction and labeling of these ideas as 
hypotheses often reduces tension in the group 
and invites group members to embrace a spirit 
of inquiry and discovery. Hypotheses typically 
follow an if/then format. In our example this 
might sound like, “If we directly taught reading 
comprehension and textual analysis skills in the 
content areas then more students would master 
the course material.”

Chapter 11

Many groups find that framing their issues 
with all three approaches is helpful. By crafting 
inquiries and generating hypotheses they fre-
quently discover that they need to refine their 
problem statement. Also, offering a group three 
different ways of framing an issue offers choice 
that leads to greater ownership and deeper 
commitment to problem solving
Starting with the Data
Starting with the data requires a thoughtful 
survey of the hard and soft data available in the 
school (James-Ward et al., 2013). (See table 
11.1 for examples of hard and soft data.) Hard 
data are data that are quantifiable and expressed 
in numbers and percentages. These data types 
lend themselves to statistical analysis. Soft data 
are qualitative and anecdotal resulting from 
surveys, questionnaires, and observations. The 
goal is to gather relevant information to trian-
gulate the issues of concern. Once sufficient 
data have been gathered, groups search for 
patterns of both strengths and needs. This leads 
to developing theories of causation and when 
these are confirmed, clarified, or disconfirmed 
the group can then move on to crafting theories 
of action and action planning. The Collabora-
tive Learning Cycle described next elaborates 
specific steps in this process.
Productive data-driven inquiry requires 
structure and attention to process. “Thought-
fully designed processes increase focus, min-
imize distractions, and deepen exploration and 
analysis of data” (Lipton and Wellman, 2012). 
Group members that lack process attention and 
process monitoring habits get lost in story-
telling, side-talk, and jump quickly to selling 
solutions to one another.
The Collaborative Learning Cycle es-
tablishes a forum for collective exploration 
of data. By embracing a learning orientation 
within carefully applied protocols, group mem-
bers engage in collaborative inquiry that leads 
to problem finding, problem-solving and fo-
cused planning for action.
Each phase of the Collaborative Learning 
Cycle is driven by questions that organize and 
direct specific cognitive processes. The first 
phase, “Activating and Engaging” surfaces 
prior experiences, background knowledge, and 
frames of reference for thinking about the 
issues at hand. The second phase, “Explor-
ing and Discovering” structures the group’s 
inquiry into the data in a search for pop-outs 
and patterns that will then influence the search 
for deeper causations. The third phase, “Orga-
nizing and Integrating” is a two-stage process 
with an initial drafting of theories of causation 
and a search for confirming and clarifying data.

When the group is confident it is on the right 
track they move to the final stage of drafting 
theories of action and identifying processes, 
plans, goals, and monitoring systems for mov-
ing ahead. Continuous improvement is a cycli-
cal process so as new data emerge the group 
then applies the Collaborative Learning Cycle 
to this information.
Phase 1: Activating and Engaging
A central intention of the Collaborative 
Learning Cycle is to develop a stance of shared 
curiosity that avoids premature certainty and 
locking in on the first proposed course of 
action. This initial phase, Activating and En-
gaging, sets the scene for exploring the data 
without the data being present. It starts with di-
alogue about what group members predict that 
data will look like and a sharing of assumptions 
about why people think these predictions are 
likely. The norms of collaboration (chapter 
4) are a vital resource during this phase. The 
goal is to establish conditions of low threat 
and full participation so that all group mem-
bers feel free to contribute their thinking and 
ideas. When done well, this creates conditions 
of psychological safety for group members, 
especially if they are uncertain about the con-
tent, the data, or the group processes of inquiry. 
Psychological safety ultimately means that 
individuals feel safe enough not to know in the 
presence of their peers.
When the data to be explored will be pre-
sented as tables of graphs the facilitator offers 
blank copies of the graphic forms upon which 
to record predictions. These predictions are 
what people think the data will look like—
specifically how high the bars on the graph 
will reach for specific standards or specific 
subgroups or what data they think will appear 
in the cells of the table. As predictions emerge, 
the facilitator pushes group members to name 
the assumptions that are informing these pre-
dictions. Working with the blank templates 
also orients group members to the actual data 
displays they will be working with during the 
next phase. At times, group members have 
similar predictions and different assumptions. 
At other times, group members have similar 
assumptions but varying predictions based on 
those same assumptions.
Individuals surface their frames of ref-
erence by articulating their predictions and 
assumptions. These interactions help group 
members to better understand the mental mod-
els that are guiding the teaching practices and 
instructional thinking of their colleagues.
Distinguishing between assumptions and 
predictions is difficult for some group members 
and it can take up to three experiences with the 
Collaborative Learning Cycle for participants 
to appreciate the value and importance of this 
phase. For example, a team member might say, 
“My prediction is that there will be a 40 percent 
difference on the writing assessment between 
the girls and the boys. This is driven by my 
assumption that the girls are better readers 
than the boys which shows in their writing.” 
Activating and Engaging provides the safety 
of dialogue to encourage participation in data 
tasks that might be intimidating for some group 
members. This phase fans the flame of curiosity 
so that group members want to look at the data 
and are ready to do so knowing in advance how 
their colleagues are thinking about the issues 
involved in a specific inquiry cycle.
Facilitation Tips for Success
•	
Listen for ways that group members are 
distinguishing between predictions and as-
sumptions. Paraphrase and label predictions 
as they occur and inquire for the underlying 
assumptions if they are not provided. Para-
phrase and label assumptions and inquire 
for the specific predictions that these as-
sumptions might produce in the data.
•	
Use public recording to capture predic-
tions and their related assumptions for all 
to see. Use separate recording sheets or 
charts for this purpose.
•	
Publicly record predictions on a facsimile 
of the data display. Use a graph or chart 
that reflects the actual format of the data 
display. This serves as an advanced orga-

nizer and orients the group for viewing the 
data at the next phase.
•	
Record more than one set of predictions and 
their related assumptions. The goal during 
this phase is to seek to understand, not to 
persuade. When members struggle for con-
sensus or think they need consensus, group 
work bogs down. Recording the diversity 
of predictions increases curiosity, especially 
when the facilitator encourages clarification 
of the different driving assumptions that are 
informing the predictions.
Phase 2: Exploring and Discovering
This phase is the heart of collaborative 
inquiry. Productive Exploring and Discovering 
require collective focus, discipline, and group 
members who are as interested in the observa-
tions of others as they are in their own obser-
vations. The goal is to create a shared learning 
experience in which group members can learn 
from the data and from one another. In many 
ways this is a special form of dialogue with 
data at the center.
Skillful facilitators promote a spirit of 
purposeful uncertainty during this phase. The 
goal here is to help group members remain 
open to possibilities and multiple viewpoints. 
By exploring several storylines in the data, 
group members discover patterns and trends 
that might otherwise remain hidden from view. 
Cognitively, this is the phase of observing, no-
ticing, distinguishing, sorting, comparing, and 
contrasting.
Managing working group size is an im-
portant consideration. Group sizes of three to 
four work best. Each data team needs a shared 
data display and recording materials. This 
is an essential third point for structuring the 
exploration (see chapter 4). The data display 
establishes the third point with group members 
and the facilitator forming the other two points. 
When working groups are too large, partici-
pants may disengage; this occurs when the data 
display is difficult to see or there are too many 
voices in the crowd for shyer members to cut 
through. An additional barrier to success in this 
phase occurs when there is too much data pres-
ent. This leads to overload and fragmentation 
of group energy.
Facilitation Tips for Success
•	
Provide time to orient to the data displays 
before encouraging group members to 
share their initial observations. Two to 
three minutes of silence allows individual 
group members to orient to the data dis-
plays and provides a space for the varying 
processing needs of individuals in the 
group. This leads to fuller participation 
and increased confidence on the part of 
group members. This is especially so for 
the “data shy.” The purposeful pause also 
slows down the “data enthusiasts” who 
may inhibit or intimidate others in the 
group. One way to do this is to provide in-
dividual thinking and writing time before 
people start talking to ensure opportunity 
for each group member.
•	
Propose a sequence for exploring the data 
and designate a starting point. Agreement 
on initial talking points saves time and 
energy and establishes focus. This is espe-
cially important when multiple data sets or 
complex displays are on view.
•	
Apply structures and protocols to balance 
participation. Structuring group work in-
creases engagement, increases focus, and 
increases time efficiency. Some possible 
group member roles include: recorder, 
process checker, materials manager, and 
timekeeper.
•	
Use public recording. Create common 
charts or recording space for observations. 
Keep a separate chart for questions or 
comments that are “outside the phase.” For 
example, should conclusions or explana-
tions emerge, it is helpful to record them 
and set these aside, rather than debate them 
in that moment. This recording and setting 

Facilitating Data Teams	
Chapter 11	
153
aside process is also effective for questions 
that are not directly relevant to the data.
•	
Chart observations in language that is 
concise, specific, and quantified. Each ob-
servation statement should communicate a 
single idea clearly and numerically. These 
statements should focus only on observ-
able facts contained in the data without 
interpretation or inference. Less and more, 
greater than, and smaller than are concepts. 
Quantifying these observations reveals the 
magnitude of differences. Using relevant 
data terminology, such as mean, median, 
mode, range, and distribution increases the 
precision of observations.
Phase 3: Organizing and Integrating
The third phase of the Collaborative 
Learning Cycle Organizing and Integrating 
guides the transition to formal problem find-
ing and problem solving that establishes a 
foundation for thoughtful and detailed plan-
ning processes. During this phase, the group 
makes the transition from dialogue to discus-
sion to decision making.
This phase is divided into two stages: 
causation and action. Here the facilitator guides 
the group in the transition from observing to un-
derstanding and then to action planning. During 
the causal stage of thinking, group members 
generate multiple interpretations for why the 
data look the way they do. Generating these 
theories of causation and then deciding on the 
most likely avenues of inquiry marks the tran-
sition from dialogue to discussion. Here again 
skillful application for the Norms of Collabora-
tion (chapter 4) supports the group in this quest. 
Paraphrasing and posing questions for specific-
ity are especially important during this process.
Issues tend to fall within one or more of 
five causal categories (Lipton and Wellman, 
2012). These are:
1.	
Curriculum: The design and implementa-
tion of units of study.
2.	 Instruction: Teaching methods and ma-
terials.
3.	
Teachers: Knowledge, skills, and dispo-
sitions.
4.	 Students: Knowledge, skills, and dispo-
sitions.
5.	
Infrastructure: Schedules, programming, 
space, and resources.
Most data sets are incomplete and do not 
tell the full story. This stage of the Organizing 
and Integrating phase includes the collection 
of additional data that may be indicated by the 
theories of causation that emerge. By using 
these new data to confirm, disconfirm, or clar-
ify the selected causal theories, group members 
increase their understanding of the deeper 
causal factors underlying the issue they are 
exploring. This increases confidence and com-
mitment to any ultimate implementation plans.
When groups have sufficient confirming or 
clarifying data they then make the shift to de-
veloping theories of action. This stage embeds 
the use of skillful discussion and decision-mak-
ing language tools and protocols. “Theories of 
action lead to problem-solving, planning and 
action research guided by the ongoing use of 
formal and informal data, thus continuing the 
learning cycle started by a given round of da-
ta-driven collaborative inquiry” (Wellman and 
Lipton, 2004, p. 49).
Confident facilitation of the Organizing 
and Integrating phase of the Collaborative 
Learning Cycle helps groups own their chal-
lenges and increases collective responsibility 
for student learning. Effective plans require 
specific outcomes, clear criteria for measuring 
progress and success, necessary action steps, 
monitoring strategies for determining progress 
and goal achievement, assignment of responsi-
bilities, and projected timelines.


155
Leadership is a function, not a role. Adap-
tive leaders orchestrate conflict by initiating 
conversations about hard to talk about topics 
central to student success. Conflict is “good” 
when it centers on ideas, values, and ways of 
doing things. It is “bad” when it swims in seas 
of emotion, distrust, and personalization. We 
present practical tools for dealing construc-
tively with conflict, offer ways of insulating 
yourself from negative energies, and suggest 
methods for teaching staffs and teams ways to 
disagree with grace and respect.
This section frames six capacities for or-
ganizational development and six capacities for 
professional development as lenses for analysis 
and intervention. We also explore ways to ad-
dress wicked problems—those that seem to be 
ongoing, complex, and for which there seem 
to be no easy, or in some cases good, answers. 
Finally, we return to the finding that interaction 
among teachers and administrators that focus 
on student learning makes large and measur-
able differences in student achievement and 
reveals practical methods for energizing and 
supporting such communities.
And in conclusion, we note that commu-
nity does not last forever. Yet communities 
do recover, clarify values, and reengage in the 
quest for continuing student improvement. We 
close with a metaphor intended to help each 
group find their own beat, their own rhythm in 
the continuing quest for joy in serving others.

CONFLICT, CHANGE,  
AND COMMUNITY

onflict and collaboration are two faces of community. Previous chapters 
have led us to this point. Getting the right work done and learning to fight 
gracefully about important things require the capabilities, skills, and tools 
described earlier in this sourcebook. This chapter offers frames, approaches, and 
additional tools for seeing and using conflict as a resource for group and personal 
development. We describe the workings of conflict in complex nonlinear systems 
such as schools, and present ways to increase your conflict quotient (CQ) and learn 
to see and avoid energy traps.
Chapter 12	 Constructive Conflict
As the current generation of teachers and 
administrators struggles with the cultural shift 
from working in isolation with norms of au-
tonomy and independence to working in more 
collaborative ways, conflicts are inevitable. 
The most important of these are values con-
flicts, engagement in hearing views different 
from one’s own, exploring what a cocreated 
future might look like, and facing difficult 
truths about current situations. Obstacles for 
such work include conviviality and surface 
harmony that mask underlying tensions and 
differences about the purposes and processes 
of learning and teaching. Amplifying these 
differences are accountability pressures, so-
phisticated data management systems, and 
rewards for student performance (Newman, 
King, and Rigdon, 1997).
Individuals approach conflict informed by 
personal history, and the culture in which they 
work. Four orientations are common: being 
passive, aggressive, passive-aggressive, or as-
sertive. Only the last is healthy and effective 
for individuals, families, and organizations. 
The passive individual avoids conflict. It is not 
surprising that fear and resentment might be 
a part of this person’s internal world. Passive 
persons accommodate others, placing their own 
interests last. In aggressive approaches, how-
ever personal desires are placed above those of 
others. Persons acting aggressively often ex-
press and stimulate intense emotion in others: 
sometimes striking out, blaming, belittling, or 
boisterously demanding their own way.
Of the four approaches, the passive-ag-
gressive is the most destructive. This person 
throws a rock through your window, then hides 
the hand that threw it, as if to say, “Who me?” 
This person uses negative presuppositions, 
“Even a department head should know that,” 
leaving the other wounded while not being sure 
what produced the injury.
Finally, the assertive person is clear about 
personal outcomes, personal boundaries, and 
the right to protect his or her values and self. 
This person engages others with a nondefen-
sive attitude, verbally confident responses, and 
is open to collaboration. Clinical-experimental 
psychologist Manuel Smith’s (1975) seminal 
book on assertiveness included theory and 
learnable phrases for a range of situations and 
is still a valuable resource today. The seven 
norms of collaboration provide assertive lan-
guage patterns.
What are your own tendencies? Are 
you most likely to be passive, aggressive, 

The Adaptive School
158
passive-aggressive, or assertive? In a study 
of workplace culture, Ames and Wazlawek 
(2015) found that we might not perceive our-
selves as others do. Test your own perceptions 
by gathering anonymous assessments from 
peers and colleagues.
Conflict within groups is made messy 
because often each of the four orientations 
is simultaneously present. Additionally, how 
groups work with and learn from their conflicts 
is related to their work culture and says much 
about who they are and who they wish to be. 
Betty Achinstein (2002) notes the following:
Communities that can productively engage in 
conflict have a greater potential for continual 
growth and renewal. Conflict is a critical 
factor in understanding what distinguishes a 
generic professional community of teacher 
colleagues from a learning community en-
gaged in ongoing inquiry and change. (p. 11)
Four types of information are needed to be 
at your most effective in situations with con-
flict: (a) understanding self; (b) understanding 
of trust; (c) understanding conflict, its dynam-
ics, its dangers, and its opportunities; and (d) 
knowledge of a variety of conflict tools and 
ways to use them skillfully.
The sequence in which you will want this 
information depends on your learning style 
(abstract or concrete), urgency (are you think-
ing about conflict in general, or are you in the 
middle of one), and personal history. If you 
have an immediate need for learning new tools, 
move ahead to the section “10 Energy Traps 
and the related tools.” If you aren’t hurting at 
the moment, begin here searching for personal 
descriptions and read on.
Understanding Self
“The challenging internal work of facili-
tation” (and we would add being an adaptive 
educator) Roger Schwarz (2002) reminds us, 
“is to identity and explore the core values and 
assumptions that guide your actions, to rigor-
ously reflect on how they increase or decrease 
your effectiveness and to develop a new set of 
values and assumptions that you can use to in-
crease your effectiveness and that of the groups 
you work with” (p. 66).
In the spirit of reflection, you might ask 
what is your pattern of explaining things to 
yourself? Seligman (2006) notes that people 
have explanatory styles that can lead them to 
pessimism or optimism and that with awareness 
and attention they can change these orientations. 
What are your own patterns? In general, we 
create what we perceive, which, in turn mirrors 
back to us what we see. Disaster is occasionally 
in the eye of the beholder. School yourself to 
positively presume the intentions of others. 
Remember that in doing so, you don’t need to 
know why the other person is choosing certain 
behaviors, just be willing to believe that in some 
way this person is taking care of themselves.
The seventh norm, presuming positive 
intentions, is a matter of respect for others. 
Its Latin origin, respecere, means to look 
again, highlighting the active nature of respect. 
“Where once we saw one aspect of a person,” 
explains William Isaacs, “we look again and 
realize how much of them we had missed” 
(1999, p. 111).
What do you anticipate from others? Ex-
pectations of others often become a self-fulfill-
ing prophecy. One’s perceptions, assumptions, 
and expectations have a lot to do with the pres-
ence or absence of affective conflict.
Be the Best You
The best of who you are comes from 
overcoming your biology and taking action 
based on self-examination. Adaptive leaders 
are “open to their own growth and learning that 
eventually infuse larger change efforts” (Senge, 
Hamilton, and Kania, 2015, p. 29). The human 
brain is guided by an overarching survival prin-
ciple. So, its job is to classify the world around 
us into two categories: those that hurt you or 
help you to stay alive (Rock, 2009).
Given the self-protective drive for sur-
vival, without conscious awareness, our brains 

Constructive Conflict	
Chapter 12

automatically process all new input for both 
physical and emotional risk. The brain’s re-
ticular activating system (RAS) automatically 
controls whether the cerebral cortex (thinking) 
or the limbic system (feeling) acts on the new 
input. As perceived risk or threat rises, the RAS 
routes input to the limbic system, the home of 
our freeze, flee, fight, or befriend responses. On 
the other hand, when risk and threat are low 
and new input offers challenge, the RAS acti-
vates the prefrontal cortex, where our resource-
fulness as data analyzers and decision makers 
is at its maximum. During the Pleistocene era, 
frequent and dramatic environmental changes 
occurred, requiring humans to be adaptive and 
wary within their environment. Our inherited 
brain has a hard-wired defensive orientation, 
which first presumes negative intentions. The 
best of who you are overcomes this biological 
tendency in order to manage disputes with 
common sense.
Feeling is first. When emotional needs 
are not addressed in problem solving, tensions 
persist at a subterranean level, affecting ev-
erything else. People have emotional needs for 
influence, approval, inclusion, justice, self-es-
teem, autonomy, and affirmation of personal 
values. Rock (2009) calls these social needs of 
the brain: status, certainty, autonomy, respect, 
and fairness. Studies of the brain, according 
to Rock, are revealing that much of human 
motivation in social intercourse is driven by 
the principle of minimizing threat and maxi-
mizing reward.
Adaptive educators are agile, seeking to 
be effective, not comfortable. To be effective 
each needs to challenge one’s own tendencies. 
Each of us can modify what we discover to be 
unproductive within ourselves. Adaptive lead-
ers, in fact, are committed to their own learning 
and growth.
Finally, what is your risk quotient? To what 
degree do you feel secure in your present envi-
ronment? What is your assessment of personal 
risk in speaking out as a member of a group or 
disagreeing with an authority figure? Run a pun-
ishment-reward assessment. If you find you can 
live with the realistic extremes of either, you’ve 
given yourself permission to speak up. Addi-
tionally, to what degree have you automated 
the norms of collaboration, especially the para-
phrase, the pause, paying attention to self and 
others, and presumption of positive intentions? 
We regard the paraphrase as verbal aikido, mov-
ing with rather than blocking the other person’s 
energy. A paraphrase is probably the most effec-

tive tool in conflict. It embodies the admonition 
of St. Francis Assisi, “Seek first to understand, 
then to be understood.” To this we would add 
harvesting the emotional resources to lead with 
inquiry when you most disagree.
Trust Matters
Trust is essential. Trust has a direct impact 
on productive conflict resolution (Tschannen- 
Moran, 2004); standardized test scores (Bryk 
and Schneider, 2002; Tschannen-Moran, 
2004); teacher collaboration (Meier, 2002); 
participation in decision making (Hoy and 
Sweetland, 2000); and collective teacher ef-
ficacy (Goddard, Hoy, and Woolfolk-Hoy, 
2004; Tschannen-Moran, 2004). Bryk and 
Schneider’s (2002) longitudinal study of four 
hundred Chicago Elementary schools stunned 
the educational community when they docu-
mented the direct role relational trust had on 
mathematics and reading gains. They con-
cluded that an interrelated set of mutual de-
pendencies are embedded within the social 
exchanges in any school community among 
teachers, parents, students, and principals. 
These create a feeling of vulnerability as each 
party relies on the others to fulfill their respon-
sibilities (Bryk and Schneider, 2003). They 
used the term “criteria for the discernment of 
trust” to describe the dynamics of the social 
interactions that occur in the school environ-
ment. Relational trust, they determined, was 
composed of four factors: respect, personal 
regard, competence, and integrity. In a school, 
teachers, parents, students, and principals are 
mutually dependent on each other to achieve 
their goals. This mutual dependence creates a 
feeling of vulnerability as each party relies on 
the others to fulfill their responsibilities. Satis-
faction results when the parties have a shared 
understanding of their roles and believe each 
other to be acting with good intentions (Bryk 
and Schneider, 2002).
Understanding Conflict
The definition of conflict varies, and each 
variation illuminates a different and useful 
understanding that provides a framework for 
constructive conflict. Here are five definitions 
of conflict:
1.	
Conflict is the condition in which people’s 
concerns appear to be incompatible.
2.	
Conflict is energy in the system—nothing 
more, nothing less. People bring meaning 
to conflict. The ways they do so is influ-
enced by personal history, cultural norms, 
family patterns, and the practices of the 
group within which they work.
3.	
Conflict is a situation that presents both 
danger and opportunity. The Chinese char-
acter for crisis combines these symbols 
and, like conflict, draws attention to each 
dimension. Danger emerges with the vi-
olation of personal needs. Opportunity 
emerges when clarifying the issues and 
generating workable solutions.
4.	
Conflict stems from a perceived competi-
tion for limited resources: budget, power, 
status, respect, time or more universally—
air, water, land, or food.
5.	
Conflict has different meanings to different 
individuals; therefore, multiple meanings 
exist within a conflicted group.
The truth about conflict lies somewhere 
in the vortex of these definitions. Becoming 
smart about conflict and having it work for 
you requires an understanding of conflict from 
all these perspectives as well as understanding 
yourself and schools as complex nonlinear 
systems. It also requires being clear about your 
personal goals and values.
Groups need cognitive conflict—task 
conflict—to produce good work. The absence 
of any conflict often leads to apathy, with 
decisions defaulting to leaders or those with 

Constructive Conflict

161
the loudest voices. Yet, cognitive conflict is 
a slippery slope. What starts as disagreement 
about ideas will sometimes slip into affective 
conflict—relationship conflict—when people 
lack the skills for distinguishing and man-
aging productive disagreements (Rafferty, 
2012). Affective conflict is “disagreements, 
either person-to-person or group-to-group, 
that involve antagonism. Such interactions 
sap energy, derail tasks, and block much group 
work” (Ensley, et al., 2002, p. 369). One major 
goal of group development is to amplify cog-
nitive conflict and minimize affective conflict. 
Accomplish this with the seven norms of col-
laboration and the many strategies referenced 
in this book that provide psychologically safe

structures with which to address hard-to-talk 
about topics (see appendix A).
Learning from  
Social Psychology
Social psychologists study efforts to re-
solve human conflict. Advice found in the 
popular press often has its origins in social psy-
chology. In our explorations of conflict from 
the perspective of this field, we have identified 
the following three principles to be of value to 
educators who work with any form of conflict:
1.	
Define fairness.
2.	
Identify and label the social norms for pre-
venting conflict, regulating conflict, and 
finding solutions to conflict.
3.	
Address the sources of conflict.
Defining Fairness
Agreement is more likely and can be 
reached more quickly when a single standard 
of fairness applies than when a group uses 
multiple standards or no standards. It is best 
to negotiate the fairness criteria early in the 
process. Groups usually select from three 
definitions. Test the working definition of each 
with “what if” scenarios.
Equality
Everybody benefits or contributes equally. 
Three variations of this criterion have been ob-
served: (a) equal outcomes, (b) equal conces-
sions (i.e., all parties make the same degree of 
movement toward the middle), and (c) outside 
precedent (e.g., What are other districts paying 
their teachers?).
Equity
Benefit is proportional to contributions or 
work done. Merit-pay systems operate with 
this principle. Ideally, such systems should be 
based on student learning data and on a teach-
er’s contribution to the greater good through 
skillful collaborative engagement.
Needs
Benefit should be proportional to need. 
Federal funding formulas for grants to schools 
with high populations of low-income children 
represent this line of thinking. It is striking 
to us that most local and state governments 
have left it to the federal system to apply this 
definition and have chosen not to do so with 
local funding.
Centering is First:  
What, Why, How
What: To be the most effective you 
can be during conflict, use the ancient 
Aikido visualization art of centering. 
Centering brings you into the here and 
now, takes power away from concerns 
and negative thoughts, and helps you re-
main stable and grounded. Aikido Mas-
ter Thomas Crum brought this to our 
attention recently when he wondered if 
centering might not be taught in Adap-
tive Schools seminars (2015). “Center” 
refers to a relaxed yet focused state of 
mind and is a productive way of being in 
conflict or not.
Why: The concept of “ki” holds that 
all physical and mental power comes 
from the flow of energy around your 
body. Energy is lost when you are tense.
How: In a delightful story about 
how harried businessman Angus breaks 
negative habits leading to anger, exhaus-
tion, and poor performance, Crum (2009) 
describes three profoundly effective and 
learnable steps. First, focus on breathing 
in the present moment with balance and 
energy; next, breathe in the “me I want 
to be” with power and purpose; and 
finally, let go of judgment, breathing in 
the mystery.

163
Identifying and Labeling Social Norms
People will often attack the process when 
they are not happy with a resolution. Prevent 
this by identifying and labeling ahead of time 
the norms that the involved parties will agree 
to use.
Norms for Preventing Conflict
The norms for preventing conflict are 
either productive or destructive. Destructive 
patterns include being excessively polite, 
avoiding issues, using humor as a distraction, 
and emphasizing congeniality (i.e., making 
nice) over professional collegiality. Overreg-
ulating the process for resolving issues with 
an avalanche of policies, forms, and detailed 
chains of command is a counterproductive ap-
proach used by some large organizations. We 
know of a school overseas in which conflict 
is “managed” by banning all employee orga-
nizations. Such approaches drive expressions 
of conflict underground, affect relationships, 
and ultimately destroy personal and collective 
efficacy and morale.
Productive patterns for preventing conflict 
include assigning resources and responsibilities 
on the basis of some agreed-upon definition of 
fairness (e.g., all teachers rotate yard-duty re-
sponsibilities except Mrs. Lopez, who runs an 
after-school tutorial clinic). Interactive patterns 
for conflict prevention include the seven norms 
of collaboration and an agreement to trace ru-
mors back to their sources.
Norms for Regulating Conflict
To talk first with one’s adversary before 
going to a third party is an example of a norm 
for regulating conflict. Groups define what 
constitutes fair fighting. Agreements to address 
issues, not personalities, speak about the future, 
not the past are examples of ways in which 
groups might define fair fighting. Agreements 
to discuss the undiscussable, personal feelings, 
values, or student achievement in the math 
department constitute norms for regulating 
conflict. Groups make regulatory agreements 
about language. Instead of saying, “You’re 
wrong,” they agree to say, “I see it another 
way.” (See the strategy “Disagreement Grid” 
in appendix A.)
Norms for Finding Solutions
Agree first about solution criteria and 
solution processes (Who will decide?). Identify 
and explore the assumptions that underlie the 
different positions. Raise questions like the fol-
lowing to help groups confront conflict:
•	
What is the worst possible outcome of 
addressing this?
•	
What is the best possible outcome of ad-
dressing this?
•	
What are the worst and best possible out-
comes of not addressing this?
•	
What outcome do you imagine that your 
adversary has?
•	
Would it be OK if your adversaries 
achieved their outcomes?
The Context in  
Which Conflict Occurs
The traditional working culture of schools 
challenges the effectiveness of much of the 
established knowledge about conflict. Adaptive 
leaders know that schools are living paradoxes, 
operating simultaneously as thing models and 
energy models. In the spirit of “thingness,” 
schools have been organized for more than a 
century as machines, a collection of smaller 
units making a part-to-whole universe: ob-
jectives to lessons and units to curriculum, a 
racecourse of relatively standardized ground 
that students must cover in their journey to the 
finish line (Tyler, 1949; Wiggins and McTighe, 
2005; Zais, 1976).
In this model, principles of cause-and-
effect prevail, values are formalized into con-
tracts, event-level thinking is the norm, and 
tacit rules govern daily behavior. Transactions 
tend toward formality and politeness (Ser-
giovanni, 1994). A teacher once told us that 
each year students were coming to her without

requisite skills, but that she would be hesitant 
to bring up the problem with the students’ prior 
teachers for fear of offending them.
Schools are also quantum systems—“bun-
dles of energy in motion,” more like communi-
ties than businesses. Drawing from the science 
of chaos and complexity theory, we get a dif-
ferent picture of the organizing energies of the 
planet (Gleick, 1987). Using sophisticated math-
ematical modeling, scientists who study com-
plex systems provide us with images of different 
and often nonlinear patterns of organization. 
Such systems are best understood by studying 
the behavior of the complex whole rather than 
the behavior of the parts (Gharajedaghi, 2006).
Complex systems organize around “strange 
attractors.” For schools, some of these strange 
attractors are the core values, vision, and mis-
sion of the school or district that draw people 
together like magical magnets in a common 
purpose. In these schools, the staffs energet-
ically work to provide children and young 
adults with more than a sense of artificial be-
longing; the principles, passions, and conflict-
ing energies of living systems apply.
Our central premise is that schools are en-
terprises of both things and energy, yet “thing” 
mental models dominate most approaches to 
conflict. When educators learn to see their 
schools as dynamic systems of energy and 
information, they are liberated to practice 
more effective ways of working with conflict. 
To understand how behavior operates in these 
systems, we have identified ten energy traps 
that serve as lenses for analyzing and respond-
ing to conflicts.
Energy Traps
Certain ways of perceiving conflict limit 
possibilities and constrain energy in increas-
ingly destructive loops. Energy traps establish 
counterproductive, recursive patterns through-
out a system. Microphone feedback is an 
example: The closer the microphone is to the 
speaker, the louder the squeal as the signal cy-
cles repeatedly through the sound system, grat-
ing on the nerves of the listeners. The summer 
sun beating down on Death Valley, California, 
produces waves of energy that heat the rock 
walls of the valley, trapping energy that builds 
up throughout the day. A similar phenomenon 
occurs over cities on warm days and nights 
with cloud cover; heat is trapped beneath the 
clouds, making the air sticky and uncomfort-
able. One person who is being grumpy sets 
up an energy trap if other people respond by 
matching the grumpiness. A teacher who talks 
above the volume of the class to get attention 
simply leads to the students increasing their 
volume so they can hear one another.
Recognizing traps in order to release en-
ergy is the first step in problem resolution. 
When they detect energy traps, skilled group 
leaders can open emotional and cognitive space 
by establishing new frames for viewing situa-
tions for themselves and for other group mem-
bers. “Frames are mental structures that shape 
the way we see the world. As a result, they 
shape the goals we seek, the plans we make, the 
way we act, and what counts as a good or bad 
outcome of our actions” (Lakoff, 2004, p. xv).
Contention
Contention occurs when disagree-
ment is poorly dealt with. Four condi-
tions create contention. (1) The natural 
desire to explain one’s own side first. 
Instead, paraphrase first. This, keeps 
one from being defensive, causes one to 
consider more carefully what the other 
person is attempting to communicate. 
(2) The first condition relates to the sec-
ond, our general ineffectiveness as lis-
teners. Listening requires attention and 
energy. Thought takes place at about the 
same rate as visual recognition but hear-
ing takes place about four times as fast. 
(3) Fear that we will not get our way is 
the third condition leading to conten-
tion. Finally, (4) is the assumption that 
one of us has to lose.

These frames, or mental maps, have two 
critical features that apply directly to working 
with conflicts (Kelly, 2006): (1) Faulty maps 
lead us to faulty actions, and (2) it takes pur-
poseful effort to modify or change a map once 
it has been established.
Ten common traps, which can be reframed 
to provide fresh perspectives and additional 
solution options, are as follows:
  1.	 Operating metaphors, like the “war on 
drugs.”
  2.	 Time orientations that confuse past, pres-
ent, and future.
  3.	 Time horizons that are too short or too long.
  4.	 Nominalizations: naming processes as 
things.
  5.	 The illusion of human separateness.
  6.	 A focus on production to the detriment of 
production capacity.
  7.	 Fixing what shows, not what is broken.
  8.	 The myth that problems require solutions.
  9.	 Personalization of conflict.
10.	 Being emotions rather than having emo-
tions.
We were once asked to consult at what we 
will call the Unhappy Elementary School. The 
school’s difficulties had reached such propor-
tions that the school board had threatened to 
remove the principal unless she could “turn the 
school around” before the end of the year. We 
were contacted in March.
The previous principal had been at the 
school for eighteen years and was a lais-
sez-faire leader. The current principal had been 
there for eighteen months, bringing a strong 
background in curriculum and instruction and a 
more directive leadership style to the role. We 
decided to conduct information interviews with 
each staff member in preparation for a full-day 
staff meeting.
Our private interviews revealed that the 
teachers were not only complaining about the 
principal, they were also complaining about 
each other. We learned that many individuals 
made disparaging remarks about fellow teach-
ers to colleagues, certified staff, and parents. 
Privately, a stream of vicious communication 
existed. “We’re shooting at our wingman in-
stead of working together,” one teacher con-
fided. Publicly, the staff wore polite faces to 
one another and discharged their negative feel-
ings on a common irritant, the principal. Some 
staff members had pipelines to board members 
and regularly reported their versions of events 
at the school.
Several classical features of conflict are 
present in this example. First, conflict was 
perpetuating itself, ricocheting around in the 
energy traps of time orientations, nominal-
izations, fixing what shows, and personaliz-
ing conflict amid a labyrinth of underground 
communications. Second, conflict is always 
contextual. In this case, the school’s history, a 
hands-off principal, and a building organized 
into pods contributed to separate and discon-
nected units of teachers, with each unit unique 
in identity, norms, and team leaders. Third, the 
teachers were bright, highly verbal, and pas-
sionately committed to action. The mix worked 
reasonably well with a laissez-faire principal 
who left each pod free to do its own thing, but it 
became an obstacle when the school was faced 
with a common crisis.
To release trapped energy, first you must 
identify the trap. Understand it as a conceptual 
shape that holds energy within certain configu-
rations. One way to identify the frames through 
which you are viewing a conflict—whether you 
are directly involved or simply on the periph-
ery as an observer—is to free-write for a set 
amount of time about the conflict. Resist the 
temptation to analyze as you write; keep your 
pen moving until the time is up. Then read 
through the descriptions of the ten traps below 
to see which ones might be operating in your 
situation. Consider ways to release the energy 
by changing the frame and opening the trap, 
allowing the possibility of new resolutions into 
the situation.
Strategies and tools in the “What to Do” 
column below can be found in appendix A.

THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL 
Ten Energy Traps 
166 
The Trap 
1. 
Operating Metaphors 
The human conceptual system is primarily 
metaphorical in nature. Concepts structure what 
people perceive. Language labels concepts and 
directs perception. A group's metaphorical 
language provides containers for thinking that 
hold unconscious assumptions, beliefs, goals, 
and values. 
The "reading wars" or the "war on drugs" are 
examples. Listen to groups or leaders in groups. 
Those thinking in war metaphors will use words 
like fight, position, shoot down, bomb, attack, 
and defend. 
Sports metaphors drive group into "winning" 
against an adversary. Others, like golf, challenge 
each person to do his or her individual best. 
But what if we never had a war on drugs, and 
instead had a rally for health? Changing language 
puts energy in new containers and opens fresh 
possibilities for resolution. 
You can either extend concepts within a 
metaphor or change the metaphor. All metaphors 
illuminate some portions of reality and hide 
others. Search for unstated images within a 
prevailing metaphor to reframe group thinking. 
F or example, if a committee is intent on "battling 
illiteracy," focus attention on "training the 
soldiers" rather than "gathering weapons." Or 
change the metaphor. Why not a ship instead of a 
war, a journey instead of an attack, a garden 
rather than a field or battle? 
What people name a thing determines their 
perception of it and hence their choices and 
behaviors. 
What To Do 
• Listen to the language that group 
members and group leaders use. 
• Illuminate and extend unstated images 
within a metaphor-war ... supply 
lines ... training the troops. 
"If we're a team, what sport are we 
playing? Who is the quarterback? Who is 
the coach? What kind of coach do we 
have?" 
"If the faculty is a family, who is the 
mommy, the daddy, the little brother, or 
the eccentric uncle?" 
"If parents are our customers, what are we 
selling?" 
• Change the metaphor. 
"A rally for health instead of a war on 
drugs." 
"Conducting an orchestra instead of 
giving orders to the troops." 
• Surface and label assumptions, values, 
and goals within the metaphors the 
group is using. 
"Y ou frequently use the term autonomy, 
what are some of your assumptions about 
the ways that this value influence choices 
and behaviors in this organization?" 

Constructive Conflict 
The Trap 
2. 
Time Orientation (past, Present, Future) 
"We've always done it that way" identifies a 
speaker who is focusing on the past. Energy gets 
stuck when groups focus exclusively on either 
past, present, or future or when conversations 
jump randomly across all three time dimensions. 
Free energy by addressing one temporal zone at a 
time. In general, we find that in problem-solving 
conversations energy is most freed when it is 
directed towards the future. Help groups to 
describe the desired state. Then back up to the 
present or the very near future to determine what 
must be done to achieve the envisioned future. 
Some groups get stuck in the past. Free them by 
providing a vehicle to tell their stories. Our friend 
and colleague, Suzanne Bailey, teaches a timeline 
strategy to help groups get themselves unstuck. The 
group designates "eras" in history: the year the new 
superintendent came, the years of declining or 
increasing enrollment, the period of a major 
reorganization. Chart paper is hung on walls in the 
form of a time line and icons used to illustrate 
different eras and the significant events that 
occured. Groups of people complete the timeline 
with words, icons, and their memories delivered to 
one another as verbal histories. As a result, people 
hear about the same event from different 
perspectives, forming a more complex history with 
greater understanding of conflicting perceptions. 
What is expressed and understood is released. 
Time confusions occasionally cause meeting 
energy carom off the walls like the rubber ball in 
a racquetball court. In such cases, a skilled 
facilitator directs the conversations to one time 
zone at a time. 
CHAPTER 12 
What To Do 
• Focus group members on one temporal 
zone at a time. 
In meetings say, "First, we will address 
what outcomes we want and then we will 
explore strategies that might help us to 
achieve those outcomes." 
• Adhere to the meeting standards of one 
content and one process at a time. 
• Use facilitator interventions to 
maintain energy focus in the group. 
By focusing and directing energy, the 
facilitator maintains one content and one 
process at a time. 
• Introduce the Existing State-Desired 
State Map. 
This tool brings the future into the room 
and links it to present actions. 
• Teach and apply Outcome Mapping to 
the situation. 
This tool links the present to the future. 
• Teach and apply The Futures Wheel to 
the situation. 
This tool provides images of possible 
future effects of issues and innovations. 
• Teach and apply a Histomap with 
groups that are stuck in the past. 
This tool honors the past and brings it 
forward to the present.

3. 
Time Horizons 
The unit of time within which parties plan to 
resolve a conflict limits solutions options. 
Negotiations literature advises that everything is 
negotiable, including deadlines. Our friend and 
colleague Laura Lipton intuitively knows this 
and frequently moves to extend deadlines on 
projects. In return, she gets release from deadline 
stress, more time for reflection, fmer detail in her 
work, and better products. 
Many time horizons are taken for granted 
because of past practices. Take, for example, the 
practice of assigning teachers to students for a 
single year. The moment a teacher decides to 
follow a class from second to third grade or from 
fifth to sixth grade, everything changes. 
Perceptions of student development burst from a 
9-month window of growth to 2 years; diagnostic 
and relationship-building time at the beginning 
of the second year is practically eliminated; 
social norms of the class are understood and can 
be more effectively utilized; and parents' 
relationships with the teacher carry on into the 
second year. 
Either lengthening or shortening time horizons 
modifies energy. A group of parents in a 
Colorado school wanted a principal removed. 
Stretching out the time period for seeking 
resolution to this controversy would have stirred 
up more problems as more people became 
involved and rumors multiplied. Keeping the 
processing time tight, kept attention focused on 
facts and issues and not on hearsay. 
Extending time horizons also provides benefits. 
Plotting a multiyear curriculum revision allows 
full communication with all parties, reliable 
baseline data, and judiciously set expectations. 
What To Do 
• Assess the consequences of a longer or 
shorter time line. 
• Lengthen time lines when deeper 
dialogue will allow group members to 
work through options, emotions, and 
obstacles to change. 
Provide a year for a faculty to dialogue 
about block scheduling instead of a month 
before making a decision. 
• Shorten time lines when issues are of 
lower order importance. 
For the question, "What color should we 
paint the staff room?" take exactly one 
meeting with the principal making the 
decision based on what she has heard if 
group members cannot come to 
agreement. 
• Teach and apply Outcome Mapping to 
the situation. 
Carefully calculate time requirements for 
implementing the strategies required for 
goal achievement. 
• Teach and apply The Futures Wheel to 
the situation. 
This tool offers images of possible futures 
related to the issue or innovation under 
consideration. 

Constructive Conflict 
The Trap 
4. 
Nominalizations 
Speakers nominalize when they talk about a 
process as a thing or an event. Teachers at one 
school said that the principal didn't "respect" 
them. Respect is a noun and is static, or 
unchanging; respecting is a process that is active 
in time with observable manifestations. Verbs are 
process words and imply active participation by 
persons or elements. As such, they imply choice 
and point to behaviors. 
Some groups tell us that "trust" is missing in 
their organization. Groups cannot improve trust, 
they can only increase trusting behaviors. We've 
learned to ask what people will be doing and 
saying when they are trusting. 
"Conflict" is another nominalization. With 
conflict-as with love, anger, happiness, fear, or 
any emotion we tend to nominalize-there is a 
starting point, varying levels of intensity, a 
cooling off, and transition into another emotional 
state. In each case, the language that labels these 
processes as things freezes these dynamic 
flowing activities into static conceptual 
abstractions. When groups act on the abstraction 
instead of the real issue, they experience failure 
and frustration. 
Conversely, the more groups use the language of 
logic, emotion, and process, the greater their 
awareness and ability to direct and control 
conflicting energies. 
CHAPTER 12 
What To Do 
• Notice nominalizations in oral and 
written language. 
• Trust 
• Team 
• Department 
• Conflict 
• Relationship 
• Attitudes 
• Friendship 
Ask group members to freewrite about the 
issue to surface potential nominalizations. 
• Denominalize the language. 
"What would they be doing when they are 
respecting you?" 
"What might you see and hear when they 
are showing you respect?" 
"How will you know when they are 
trusting you?" 
"What is it about the way that they are 
relating that is troubling you?" 
• Create See and Hear T -Charts to 
publicly denominalize critical terms.

The Illusion of Separateness 
During intense periods of Middle Eastern shuttle 
diplomacy, then Secretary of State Henry 
Kissinger used to say that he would remind 
himself of three things. First, he would remember 
to forget his culture; second, he would remember 
to forget his agenda; and third, he would 
remember his humanness. From such 
perspectives, conflicts remind people that they 
are irretrievably connected and that any sense of 
separateness is illusion. 
Randy Swigert, an astronaut in the Apollo 
program, tells this story about one mission. For 
several days, they orbited the Earth until 
conditions were right for reentry. With relative 
leisure, he now had time to gaze from the 
spaceship to the Earth below. Hurtling over the 
Pacific Ocean, the West Coast of the United 
States suddenly appeared below them. He was 
aware of a visceral reaction, a sense of joyful 
belonging as he recognized his "home." Then a 
little later, Cape Canaveral appeared, and he had 
another gut reaction of connection as he viewed 
the place from which the spaceship had been 
launched. Soon, he noticed, that he began to 
anticipate the view of the West coast and the 
launching site, and his sense of connection grew. 
Around and around the globe he orbited, each 
time anticipating the joy of recognition a little 
earlier, until finally he realized that he was 
connecting with the entire planet. He came to 
realize that all the lines that separate us on Earth 
are artificial. 
What To Do 
• Use inclusion activities to help group 
members learn the ways that they are 
connected, such as: 
• First job 
• Ajob I might have taken ifI had not 
become an educator 
• Cross interviews among group 
members to discover "some things you 
might not know about __ " 
• Use fishbowl conversations­
administrators in the center, teachers 
outside listening. The inner group 
describes desired outcomes, the outer 
group listens. Then, the groups switch 
positions and tasks. 
• Share stories such as the examples in 
the left hand column. 
• Share information about another 
group, such as single parents who are 
just making ends meet, have two jobs, 
and are intimidated about coming to 
school to deal with issues there. 
• Use In and Out of the Frame to surface 
and label the frames of reference 
through which group members are 
viewing an issue. Then surface and 
label frames of reference through 
which others might be viewing the 
situation. 
• Parent 
• College graduates 
• Veteran staff member 
• Administrator 
• Male / female 
• Local tax payer 
• Newcomer to town 
• Elected official

Focusing on Production to the Detriment 
of Production Capacity 
Schools operate in demanding environments. 
Faculties sometimes press so hard for 
achievement that they forget to take care of 
themselves. A school in California was recently 
in crisis. Overnight the school population had 
doubled. Flooded with new students and staff, 
conflicting program demands, and inadequate 
facilities, the faculty worked hard to address 
these issues. They ran communication skills 
courses after school for two semesters in which 
90% of the staff participated. The skills that were 
learned there helped the group to manage tough 
conflicts with the board, the teachers' union, 
themselves, and a few years later, a district wide 
strike. This staff recovered faster and better from 
the trauma of the strike than any other unit in the 
district. 
Groups avoid this trap when they honor and 
protect time for reflection. Since adults do not 
learn from experience, any group too busy to 
reflect about its work is too busy to improve. 
Knowing this, some groups set task/process 
rations. For every 60 minutes of meeting time, 
for example, 10 minutes is spent on reflecting 
about meeting processes. 
Some school boards and at least one state 
(Missouri), have policies establishing that a 
certain percentage of funding go to staff 
development efforts. Offer schools use the first 
5-10 minutes of faculty meetings for journal 
reflections. 
CHAPTER 12 
What To Do 
• Teach, apply, monitor, and reflect upon 
two ways of talking. 
• Introduce, inventory. and develop the 
seven norms of collaboration. 
• Introduce, adopt, and self monitor five 
meeting standards. 
• Train and rotate facilitator and 
recorder roles within meetings. 
• Institutionalize processes and programs 
that support self-directed learning­
Cognitive Coaching, mentoring, peer 
coaching, data-driven dialogue, lesson 
study, action research. 
• Develop a process toolkit. 
• Design meeting agendas with both topic 
and process outcomes. Protect time for 
reflection on both types of outcomes.

Fixing What Shows, Not What is Broken 
One common energy trap is a tendency to fix 
what shows rather than what is broken. Ours is a 
quick fix culture. Television mysteries are solved 
in 30 to 60 minutes, minus time for commercials. 
Daily newspapers headline new solutions for 
school improvement, poverty, and crime. 
Legislative bodies adopt simple fixes for 
complex problems, and in many cases the 
answers have nothing to do with the problem. 
Teacher evaluation systems are another case in 
point. As a profession, we've spent millions of 
dollars and as many hours learning and applying 
teacher evaluations systems, yet there is no clear 
evidence that such efforts improve instruction. 
When groups fix what shows, it often leads to 
new problems. Fixing the new conflict that then 
shows merely leads to another. Since work is 
being done only at the level of appearances, the 
underlying tensions are left unattended and will 
erupt again at the next fissure. 
The airlines' decision to monitor and report on­
time schedules resulted in air carriers padding 
their flight times between cities to produce 
higher percentages of on-time arrivals. Air traffic 
efficiencies, group crew tum around procedures, 
baggage handling, and the like could then be 
ignored. What showed was the on-time arrival 
data. 
Fixing what is broken requires a deep 
understanding of the interacting energies that are 
creating the undesirable conditions. Experienced 
problem solvers spend the bulk of their time on 
problem finding not on solution generation. 
What To Do 
• Paraphrase to understand and clarify 
how others in the group are framing an 
issue. 
• Teach and apply the Assumptions Wall 
process. 
• Create an Issues Agenda 
• Develop Causal Loop Diagrams 
• Craft a Desired State Map 
• Create a Fishbone Diagram 
• Structure conversations about data 
• Assess group Energy Sources

Accepting the Myth That Problems 
Require Solutions 
After a century of movie watching, most of the 
world uncritically assumes that most problems 
have solutions. However, many situations exist 
in which no clear resolution is possible. In these 
cases, the wise person seeks the counsel of St. 
Francis's prayer, "God, grand me the serenity to 
accept the things I cannot change, courage to 
change the things I can, and wisdom to know the 
difference." 
Turf issues in departmentalized settings are 
examples of problems that never go away. They 
are a deeply rooted manifestation of territoriality, 
self-interest, and survival. The most useful 
question to ask is, "How can we work together 
compatibly, holding service to students as our 
first priority while recognizing and honoring the 
needs of individual departments?" 
Conflict within and between groups will always 
be a problem. We cannot wish it away, avoid it 
away, or pretend that there is some ideal 
organization that experiences no conflict. 
And, there will never be enough time or 
resources to do all of the things schools are asked 
or want to do. 
All of these problems have no permanent 
solutions. They are conditions of life in 
organizations, the problem to solve is how to live 
with them with grace and dignity. 
CHAPTER 12 
What To Do 
• Structure dialogues to explore, "What 
do we need to do to get the best of the 
upside of this situation and least of the 
downside?" 
• Teach and apply a Futures Wheel to 
forecast the ripple effects of actions or 
inactions the group might take. 
• Recite the St. Francis Prayer (facing

• Develop and explore a Polarity Map. 
• Teach and apply a Fishbone diagram.

Personalizing the Conflict 
A wise person once said that you will never grow 
up until you stop thinking that your parents' life 
was about you. To ruminate on childhood 
memories, pretending that we were the central 
character in the play, is natural but is only one 
version of the story. 
Conflicts are hardly ever about you. They most 
often arise from some surface interference with 
another person's needs or desire. To release 
yourself for the personalization trap, step onto a 
mental balcony and regard the conflicting 
interactions as part of a system. What might 
possibly be going on for that other person that 
could open up a feeling of threat, uncertainty, or 
anger? Ask yourself what is the most generous 
interpretation of the outcome. Would it be OK 
with you if the person were to achieve that 
outcome? 
What To Do 
• Allow your self-regard to be stronger 
than your critical self-voice. 
• Adopt a body posture of calm and 
centered ness. Remember to breathe. 
• Go to the balcony. Look at the 
interaction as a system. What needs 
does the other person have? What is 
the other person feeling? 
• Paraphrase to diffuse the emotional 
tension for yourself and others. 
• Ask yourself what is the most generous 
interpretation of the other person's or 
group's behavior. 
• Ask yourself it would be OK with you if 
the other person or group achieved 
their outcomes. 

Constructive Conflict 
The Trap 
10. Being Emotions, Not Having Emotions 
Recall a recent experience of intense feeling. 
Were you happy, or feeling happiness? Were you 
angry, or feeling anger? Were you upset, or 
feeling upset? Language can decoy us into the 
energy trap of being at the cause of another 
person's behaviors. All emotions spring from 
choice. "The board makes me angry" is an 
inaccurate perception of reality. You get angry 
all by yourself The board has better things to do 
than to irritate you. 
When you shift language from I am to I am 
having or I am feeling, you notice that you are 
not your feelings, you are not your thoughts, and 
you are not your point of view. Rather, you have 
feelings, thoughts, and points of view. It is 
freeing to discover that whatever you are 
conscious of, you can direct and control with 
consciousness, we can become more resourceful 
and draw on a range of coping strategies. 
We are wired from birth to respond with primary 
emotions to certain features in our environment 
such as sounds, types of motion, and physical 
pain. These physical factors trigger automatic 
emotional reactions in the limbic systems of our 
brains which release chemicals that alter 
cognition in response to the stimulus. 
Our brains and bodies also respond to the content 
of our thoughts, triggering secondary emotions. 
Both primary and secondary emotions create 
surges of electrochemical response throughout 
the body. Each type of emotional response uses 
the same neural pathways. In other words, 
perception is reality. 
CHAPTER 12 
What To Do 
• Recognize and label your feelings as 
you are having them. 
• Listen for "makes me" language in 
yourself and others. Replace "makes 
me" with "I am choosing," or "I have." 
Instead of "he made me angry," say, 
"When he does that, I feel anger." 
Instead of "They upset me," say, "I feel 
upset when they do that." 
• Take two deep breaths to restore 
oxygen to your brain. 
• Adopt a body posture of calm and 
centeredness. 
• Walk or vigorously exercise to burn off 
excess adrenaline. 
• Learn about your body's responses. 
Respect its physiological functions. 
Walk away from the conflict when you 
are too tired, too hungry, or too 
provoked to be flexible and resourceful.

How to Double Your CQ
When you are presented with conflict, 
you bring your entire personal history to the 
stage. You also bring consciousness, the hu-
man capacity to overcome conditioning and 
to work effectively with your physiological 
responses to fear, anger, disagreement, dis-
comfort, and discord. When you notice that 
your response to conflict and your strategies 
for dealing with it change according to whom 
you are in conflict with, it is a reminder that 
conflict begins inside you.
We’ve experienced tremendous value by 
freeing ourselves from energy traps. Groups 
can easily learn to apply these ideas in order to 
learn from discord. By honoring deeper princi-
ples they will double their capacity to live and 
work more gracefully with conflict.
Principles are important because maxi-
mum success in any enterprise is guaranteed by 
clear outcomes and by applying principles—not 
rules—to achieve them. Rules are principles in 
chains. Rules restrict; they are useful some of 
the time, but disastrous at other times. To start 
and end meetings on time is a rule. To honor a 
group’s time and energy is a principle. Some-
times you must break the rule to maintain the 
principle. At a community meeting in a western 
state, for instance, a parent raised an import-
ant concern, about the district’s effort to set 
student learning standards, ten minutes before 
the announced closing time for the meeting. 
The superintendent wisely asked the group’s 
permission to stay and engage this topic for 
the next forty-five minutes. By doing so, she 
averted three months of potential community 
upset and untold hours of communication and 
conflict-resolution efforts.
Both the literature and our own experi-
ences provide several important principles for 
using conflict as a resource within groups. 
Betty Achinstein (2002), building on the work 
of Louis and Kruse (1995), reminds us of the 
importance for leaders to do the following:
1.	
Develop forums for teachers to explore 
their differences.
2.	
Reinforce community values to set the 
frame for what to talk about and how to 
talk about issues and differences.
3.	
Demonstrate a willingness to live with 
ambiguity and reinforce the idea that all 
problems don’t have neat solutions.
4.	
Model critical self-exploration and vul-
nerability.
5.	
Foster openness to different perspectives.
6.	
Don’t become the final authority; support 
teachers in resolving conflicts themselves.
7.	
Provide structures, resources, professional 
development, and practice in the skills of 
inquiry and shared decision making.
The ultimate principle for seeing and using 
conflict as a resource is to listen well to your-
self and others. By calming down and calming 
others, we develop empathy for both ourselves 
and them. Then we can maintain our own re-
sourcefulness and develop shared capacities for 
graceful fighting about the important issues that 
are at the heart of true community in schools.

T
he essential notion of adaptivity (see chapters 1 and 2) frames the work of 
developing the underlying capacities for school change. To be adaptive, 
schools and school personnel must continually clarify their identities and 
not be attached to form. Earlier chapters examined fundamental strategies for 
carrying out this work. In this chapter we expand on the what of adaptivity—the 
twelve capacities for school change. The first six capacities are organizational, and 
the last six are professional. They are as follows:
Chapter 13	 Capacities for School Change
  1.	 Vision, values, and goal focus;
  2.	 Systems thinking;
  3.	 Initiating and managing adaptation;
  4.	 Interpreting and using data;
  5.	 Developing and maintaining collaborative 
cultures;
  6.	 Gathering and focusing resources;
  7.	 Collegial interaction;
  8.	 Cognitive processes of instruction;
  9.	 Knowledge of the structure of the disci-
pline;
10.	 Self-knowledge, values, beliefs, and stan-
dards;
11.	 A repertoire of teaching skills;
12.	 Knowledge of students and how they learn.
The twelve capacities for school change 
interact with one another and cannot be ad-
dressed in isolation if schools and profession-
als are to become increasingly adaptive in 
response to the changing needs of the students 
they serve. These capacities are living exam-
ples of the dynamical principle that everything 
influences everything else.
The six organizational capacities and the 
six professional capacities form a synergistic 
whole that must be continually addressed. It 
is never a case of either–or, but always a case 
of both–and. We are persuaded that all the 
staff development in the world, and all the 
knowledge and skill building that we provide 
to individuals, will have only minimal impact 
if districts and schools do not also put energy 
and resources into altering the deep structure of 
the organization.
At the beginning of this book (see chapter 
2) we introduced three focusing questions: 
Who are we? Why are we doing this? Why are 
we doing this this way? The answers to these 
questions are the short response to the how of 
adaptivity in schools. The twelve capacities 
make up the long answer.
Steven Covey (1989) reminds us of the 
need to balance production and production ca-
pacities. His retelling of the fable of the farmer 
who killed the goose that laid the golden egg 
points to the ongoing need to develop the ca-
pabilities to do important work as much as the 
need to do the work itself. If we are not careful, 
the “goose” of school improvement will die 
from a lack of food and water.
This is a perennial problem in schools that 
are starved for time: to do the important work 
for students and to support continual adult 
and organizational learning. We will make the 
case here that time is just one element in the 

The Adaptive School
178
puzzle. Many factors organize time choices; 
the clock and the calendar are only two of the 
elements at work.
Schools are living organisms, and like all 
healthy living organisms they are characterized 
by continual flow and changes in their metab-
olism that involve thousands of biochemical 
reactions. Stable systems are dying systems 
(Capra, 1996). In scientific terms, chemical 
and thermal equilibrium leads to death. Vital 
schools, like all living organisms, continually 
maintain themselves in a state far from equilib-
rium. This is the state of life. Stability emerges 
through the average, over time, of the ebb and 
flow of energy through the system. Attention to 
the six organizational capacities for adaptivity 
and the six professional capacities for adaptiv-
ity helps this energy flow.
As you read this chapter, please have in 
mind some of the persistent problems you 
see in the schools around you. As with the 
languishing high school profiled earlier (see 
chapter 3), you may notice particular capac-
ities that are underdeveloped. We hope that 
you also notice specific capacities that are 
well-developed in your settings. The essential 
question, then, is: Where should leaders now 
focus the system’s attention to make a differ-
ence in the situation?
The Organizational Capacities 
for Adaptivity
Schools do not develop organizational 
capacities as abstractions. They do so by ad-
dressing meaningful problems. Skilled leaders 
use problems as opportunities for learning. This 
approach meets both production and produc-
tion capacity needs. Working alongside leaders 
who understand this informs our learning as 
well. Recently we spent time with a school that 
addressed the six organizational capacities (fig-
ure 13.1) in the manner described below.
A school that we will call Sea View Ele-
mentary tackled the issue of low scores on a 
statewide fourth-grade writing assessment. The 
test was new to both this school and others in 
the state. It emphasized expository writing and 
using evidence from the text to support one’s 
argument. Although the fourth-grade teachers 
were not happy about the scores, they were not 
terribly surprised. When they first saw the test, 
they realized that the school’s writing program 
had some gaps, given the expectations embed-
ded in the examination. As a clearer picture of 
student writing performance began to emerge, 
the principal organized a series of meetings. 
We were fortunate enough to participate in 
some of them. Chapter 11 offers some practical 
approaches to engage others in collecting and 
analyzing data and ways to structure conversa-
tions about data.
The first two organizational capacities—
vision, values, and goal focus, and systems 
thinking—forge the context for the other four.
Vision, Values, and Goal Focus
When we learned about the writing prob-
lems at Sea View Elementary, our first question 
was “In what way is this issue about raising 
test scores, and in what way is it about long-
term improvements in student writing and in 
the writing program?” The principal assured 
us that the change effort was aimed at long-

term systemic improvements in the teaching of 
writing. In fact, she was willing to take some 
political heat from parents and central office 
administrators, if necessary, to keep the focus 
long-term and not just fix what was showing.
Several other values contributed to the 
project’s success, such as a belief in the 
power of cumulative effects for learners. As 
we describe in the systems thinking section, 
collective efforts matter. September of the 
fourth grade is much too late to start a con-
centrated writing program. The assessment 
of the system at that point was viewed by the 
school as an assessment of the whole, not that 
specific part.
The other operating value and vision was 
an image of continual improvement for all 
students. The emerging writing-skills matrix 
was seen as a developmental road map, not as 
a curriculum to be covered by each grade level 
in turn. If a third grader had difficulty crafting 
simple sentences, that is where the teacher 
started. Paragraphs could wait until founda-
tional skills were in place.
Systems Thinking
The writing problem at Sea View Elemen-
tary was soon seen by the teachers as a systems 
problem. A fledging sense of collective respon-
sibility for student learning motivated the work 
of vertical teams. K–3 staff members were 
openly supportive of their fourth- and fifth-
grade colleagues and agreed to work collabora-
tively on an improvement plan and effort.
One of the vertical teams produced a draft-
skills matrix for the teaching of expository 
writing and reasoning with textual evidence. 
This systems view was developed through 
rotating two-hour planning sessions, with each 
new team adding to and filling in the gaps in the 
work of previous teams. Several teachers even 
came back during their lunch breaks to partici-
pate with colleagues on other teams.
One byproduct of this work was increased 
confidence on the part of the lower-grade teach-
ers that their efforts in developing fundamental 
writing skills would be appreciated by their 
upper-grade colleagues. When they could see 
the system of which they were a part displayed 
in matrix form on the wall of the meeting room, 
they could see where their efforts led and view 
with ease their part in the whole.
Upper-grade teachers also benefited when 
they spotted the gaps in the writing instruction 
on the grid. One glaring example was the lack 
of emphasis on expository forms. The state 
assessment first pointed this out, and the skills 
matrix reinforced it. This also inspired changes 
in another part of the system, because the dis-
trict writing rubric did not provide guidance 
or standards in this area. Several Sea View 
Elementary teachers volunteered to be on the 
revision committee to tackle the rubric. With 
their draft-skills matrix in hand, they greatly 
influenced the process. In the course of this 
work, they shared their efforts informally with 
several other schools and engineered a resource 
swap with teachers in other buildings who were 
working on different parts of the writing and 
literacy-development puzzle.
Systems thinking is a critical skill in a 
world of messy problems. In this emerging 
field, practitioners model systems using math-
ematics, complex diagrams, and rigorous anal-
ysis of variables. Ultimately, such work leads 
to leverage points in the system that can be 
modified or perturbed enough to positively in-
fluence systems change. One challenge here is 
that both thing and energy models apply to the 
same system. Finding and modifying systems 
requires ways of both seeing and acting.
Initiating and Managing Adaptation
The principal at Sea View Elementary 
intuitively knew that shared dissatisfaction is 
the first step in initiating change. This, along 
with shared vision and knowledge of practical 
tools and strategies, must be strong enough to 
outweigh the cost of any change.
The following simple formula (adapted 
from Beckard and Harris, 1997) captures these 
factors:

The Adaptive School
180
Change = (A × B × C) > X
X = the cost of change
A = shared dissatisfaction
B = shared vision
C = knowledge of practical tools and strategies
Without shared dissatisfaction, all the 
vision and strategies in the world do not pro-
mote a desire to change. Too much dissatis-
faction without practical tools will shut down 
the system. Vision that is neither shared nor 
connected to the other two resources sputters 
out into inspirational vagueness. All change 
has a cost for both individuals and organiza-
tions. The left side of the change formula must 
overcome the right side.
The work of William Bridges (1991) is 
a useful guide in this area. He points out that 
change in organizations is not the problem; it 
is transitions that are bewildering. Transitions 
are the psychological readjustments to change. 
They have three phases: (1) endings; (2) a neu-
tral zone; and (3) new beginnings. Each phase 
has special characteristics and special require-
ments if it is to be navigated successfully.
Endings must be marked concretely and 
symbolically. Many change processes stall 
because the people in the organization have not 
let go of the old. Curriculum changes in schools 
often meet this difficulty. Teachers cling to the 
tried-and-true, and in some cases they hope to 
leap to the new like a trapeze artist high above 
the crowd. They are often unwilling to let go 
and hang suspended in midair with one hand 
on each trapeze.
At Sea View Elementary, the writing meet-
ings that were initiated marked a transition 
from old ways of working to new ones. They 
were symbols of a new order and at the same 
time marked the ending of isolation and scape-
goating. The principal did not have to explain 
this. Freeing teachers for these meetings with 
substitutes symbolically and practically con-
veyed this message.
During an ending, a group needs to ask, 
“Who is losing what in this change?” and 
“Who needs what support to work through the 
transition?” At Sea View Elementary this took 
the form of a change in curriculum materials 
for the language arts program. Although it 
was widely recognized that the textbooks were 
outdated and falling apart, some teachers still 
needed an opportunity to express their con-
cerns about the new materials and the need for 
greater planning and lesson preparation time. 
Early meetings provided the opportunity for 
these conversations and the emotional support 
that was needed by these staff members.
The neutral zone is a time of anxiety and 
discomfort for many participants, but it is also 
a time of great creativity. At Sea View Ele-
mentary, dialogue, reflection, and the sharing 
of practical materials and tools organized this 
phase. The principal was always supportive and 
nonjudgmental, allowing teachers to express 
their feelings and concerns about increased ac-
countability and their work in progress.
Bridges (1991) reminds us that new begin-
nings require an acknowledgment of the prob-
lem, not a solution. At Sea View Elementary, the 
writing issue was owned by the staff. In fact, as 
the teachers began this project, they knew much 
more about the shortfalls in student writing per-
formance than they did about the solutions.
Bridges (1991) also admonishes readers to 
remember the marathon effect. Thousands of 
runners compete in the Boston Marathon each 
year. The world-class runners, with their faster 
qualifying times, line up at the start of the pack. 
By the time the runners in the rear cross the 
starting line, these leaders are several miles up 
the course.
In school-change processes, early adapt-
ers must remember and pay attention to those 
who follow. To produce cumulative effects in 
schools, these people must pace themselves 
and support the learning of their reluctant col-
leagues. The race is not fully under way until 
everyone crosses the starting line.
Interpreting and Using Data
The assessment results from the state had 
merely confirmed the fourth-grade teachers’ 

Capacities for School Change	
Chapter 13	
181
expectations of low performance by their stu-
dents. Thus, rather than discounting the results 
or questioning the validity of the test, these 
teachers began an informal dialogue with the 
principal and other teachers. Part of this dia-
logue explored comparisons between the state 
assessment and writing samples collected from 
the fifth-grade students. This in turn led to 
conversations with the third-grade teachers and 
an examination of writing samples from their 
students. These explorations motivated teach-
ers’ desire to learn and apply more consistent 
formative assessments with their students.
As this example illustrates, data can be both 
quantitative and qualitative. The number of Sea 
View Elementary students in each performance 
quartile carried some meaning for the teachers. 
Actual samples of student writing carried other 
meaning. In these ways, teachers with a variety 
of mindsets had the opportunity to engage with 
the problem in the manner that was best suited 
to their preferences. Numbers spoke to some 
people, whereas artifacts of learning spoke to 
others. See chapter 11 for tips about structuring 
conversations about data and engaging others in 
collecting and reporting data.
Developing and Maintaining 
Collaborative Cultures
A sense of collaboration governed this 
project from the beginning. A leadership team 
composed of a cross-section of teachers and the 
principal organized the project and monitored 
its progress. This team steeped itself in the 
norms of collaboration (see chapter 4). They 
kept communication open among grade levels 
and provided a bird’s-eye view of the school 
and the project.
Vertical teams attended the meetings. In 
this way, each group had information about 
K–5 writing approaches and access to knowl-
edgeable practitioners from every grade level.
At one point it became obvious that all 
the teachers in the school were not teaching 
and using the same proofreading marks. Group 
members said, “You know, we all don’t need 
to talk about this.” So we asked them to name 
three people in the school whom they all re-
spected and who had the technical knowledge 
to handle this task. They quickly named three 
people, who agreed to develop a simple set of 
grade-level appropriate proofing marks for fac-
ulty approval at the next whole-group meeting.
Gathering and Focusing Resources
This project demonstrates the power of 
the capacity to gather and focus resources. Our 
contract with the district and the school empha-
sized the development of collaborative skills 
and process tools. Schools need an engaging 
vehicle to carry this work. At Sea View Ele-
mentary, the principal and leadership team used 
the writing issue as their mode of transport.
Time and money were budgeted for meet-
ings, for some staff members to attend in-depth 
training in expository writing, and for new 
curriculum materials. Other issues in the school 
that could be set aside were set aside. A bulletin 
board in the hallway near the office proudly 
displayed an ever-changing sampling of stu-
dent work in this area. The parent newsletter 
provided updates and progress reports.
One of the innovations that most contrib-
uted to project success was the use of substitute 
teachers and a careful scheduling of the verti-
cal-team meetings to best align with teacher 
preparation periods. In this way the teachers 
were free, while school was still in session, to 
participate in two-hour sessions for planning 
and problem-solving purposes. On most project 
days this required the services of six to eight 
substitutes.
The district staff-development director un-
derstood the nature of this work and readily 
agreed to cover the cost of substitutes. District 
staff-development practices are moving beyond 
the notion of course-based training as the only 
means of professional development. Time with 
peers in focused work sessions contributes to 
learning for all participating adults and simul-
taneously supports direct payoffs for student 
learning.

The Adaptive School
182
The Professional Capacities  
for Adaptivity
The professional capacities for adaptivity 
(figure 13.2) work in tandem with the organi-
zational capacities. In the example from Sea 
View Elementary School, improvements in the 
writing program arose from attention to both 
areas. Within this arena, individual teachers 
and teams of teachers set out to become smart 
about both writing and the teaching of writing.
Collegial Interaction
Who teachers are to one another matters. In 
a sometimes lonely profession, isolation in the 
individual cells of an “egg-crate” school does 
not promote personal or professional growth. 
Parallel play might socialize youngsters in sand-
boxes, but it limits learning for adults.
To be a colleague requires sharing one’s 
knowledge and sharing when one does not have 
knowledge. It means sharing and creating ma-
terials together. It means teaching one another 
about the craft of teaching. We are still some-
what surprised when we find out how many 
teachers in a given school have never seen 
another teacher teach. Their experiences of the 
other teachers consist mostly of passing in the 
hallways, with or without students in tow.
Study after study (e.g., Little and Mc-
Laughlin, 1993) stresses the importance of 
collegial interaction for growth in teaching 
and growth in student achievement. Adult 
learning, like all learning, is both an individ-
ual and a collective act. Where collegiality 
is strong, communities of practice bloom 
(Brown, 1994). These communities support 
distributed cognition, which means that peo-
ple become smarter together.
At Sea View Elementary School, it was 
safe not to know everything there was to 
know about teaching writing. Several teachers 
immersed themselves in learning to teach ex-
pository writing. As they tried out these ideas 
in their classrooms, they shared their successes 
and shortfalls with other teachers and encour-
aged them to adopt the techniques that seemed 
to be working.
A new kindergarten teacher brought a 
wealth of experience in language development 
for early childhood programs. The first- and 
second-grade teachers opened up a dialogue 
with her as they eagerly awaited the next 
school year(s) and the arrival of these young-
sters in their classrooms.
The hallway bulletin board, with its rotating 
display of student work, became a focal point for 
conversations about student writing and teach-
ing students to write. These conversations led to 
lesson swapping and more conversations.
Collegiality is different from conviviality. 
The teachers at Sea View Elementary had both, 
but they didn’t confuse lunch-table chatting 
with professional dialogue. Mindfully talking 
about one aspect of the instructional program 
allowed the school as a community to focus its 
energy and use talk as a vehicle for learning 
and productive change.
Cognitive Processes of Instruction
Teaching is a cognitively demanding pro-
fession. Decisions made in quiet moments and 
decisions made on the fly influence success and

183
failure in the classroom. Many variables add to 
the complexity of the thinking tasks that con-
front teachers every day. Planning and reflect-
ing skills energize and organize good teaching.
In planning, teachers consider the follow-
ing (Borko, Livingston, and Shavelson, 1990):
1.	
Information about students—who they are, 
what they know and can do;
2.	
The nature of the instructional task—sub-
ject matter, activities, materials;
3.	
The context of the school—class size, 
scheduling, grouping;
4.	
Their own beliefs—their conception of 
learning, of teaching, and of the particular 
subject or topic.
In reflecting, skilled teachers consider 
three areas: the technical, the practical, and the 
critical (Calderhead, 1996). Technical reflec-
tion focuses on whether the objectives were 
met, based on specified criteria for success. 
Practical reflection focuses on the effectiveness 
of the actions and the ends to which those 
actions led. Critical reflection focuses on the 
purposes of education and the assumptions that 
underlie practice.
The “bookends” of planning and reflecting 
frame lesson execution. It is here that additional 
cognitive resolving power pays off for students 
and teachers as learning comes into focus. A 
teacher’s “with-it-ness” supplies the necessary 
cognitive and emotional flexibility for main-
taining concentration on the big picture while 
modifying and adjusting along the way. One 
of the early and ongoing challenges for the Sea 
View Elementary writing project was to not 
get hung up on a lesson plan during the actual 
lesson. Learning to write is a messy business. 
Following the students and their needs is much 
more important than following the plan.
Sea View Elementary teachers are still 
hard at work learning to plan, teach, reflect 
on, and apply new understanding from their 
writing-skills matrix. Becoming better teachers 
of writing calls on all their cognitive processes 
of instruction.
Knowledge of the Structure  
of the Discipline
What teachers know and can do greatly 
influences student learning. A teacher’s knowl-
edge of the structure of a given discipline 
translates directly into daily instructional deci-
sions, curriculum choices, and lesson designs. 
Individual teachers teach different subjects 
differently (Shulman, 1987). An elementary 
teacher’s math lesson will be structured and 
conducted in a manner different from the same 
teacher’s literature circle.
Expert teaching calls for an understanding 
of the subject matter that is thorough enough to 
organize the topics so that the students can cre-
ate meaningful cognitive maps (Darling-Ham-
mond, 1997). Teachers with such a level of 
knowledge can use it flexibly to address ideas 
as they come up in the course of teaching. Real 
learning is messy. Students do not always stay 
within or even fit within the boundaries of a 
lesson plan. Teachers’ knowledge of content 
topics and of fields of learning must therefore 
always be wider and deeper than that of their 
students. This enables fluid movement within 
subject matter and enables responsiveness to 
student questions and perceived student needs.
Shulman (1987) breaks down knowledge 
of the structure of disciplines into several im-
portant subsets. One is content knowledge it-
self. If the teacher does not know a subject, the 
students will not come to know it. Another area 
is knowing the structure of the subject matter—
the organizing principles and concepts.
A second grader sorted out an important 
idea in mathematics one day when he observed 
with excitement, “Numbers are made up of other 
numbers—you can take them apart!” Many sec-
ond graders never reach this conclusion on their 
own. It is more likely to happen if their teachers 
understand this big idea themselves.
It is also important to know the habits of 
mind in a given field. The principles of inquiry 
are different in literature than they are in the 
physical sciences. How are ideas developed in 
social studies? Who is a valid source in liter-

The Adaptive School
184
ary criticism? How do mathematicians solve 
problems? These are all examples of this idea 
applied to different content areas. This supports 
students in understanding how new ideas are 
added to a field and how deficient ones are 
dropped by those who produce knowledge in 
a domain.
Students, too, have habits of mind. Each 
content area is a minefield of misconceptions 
and error patterns. Knowing these allows the 
expert teacher to anticipate, carefully structure 
lessons and units, and respond appropriately 
to the fragile half constructions of their novice 
learners. Shulman (1987) calls these adapta-
tions pedagogical content knowledge. This 
blending of content knowledge, learner knowl-
edge, and teaching knowledge binds the subject 
matter to specific learning devices. Expert 
teachers draw from a rich menu of analogies, 
models, and explanatory devices that support 
them and their students in representing ideas 
and understanding in a variety of ways.
The writing project at Sea View Ele-
mentary struggled with all these issues. The 
teachers’ knowledge of writing and writing 
processes grew alongside that of their students. 
A practical developmental continuum for the 
stages of student writing began to emerge, 
and the teachers forged important connections 
between student writing and other areas of 
literacy, such as student reading difficulties. 
This triggered an inquiry into the structure of 
the reading program as the teachers wondered 
aloud about the most appropriate balance of fic-
tion and nonfiction books to use with students 
at all grade levels. They are still exploring the 
connections between exposing students to qual-
ity nonfiction through guided reading experi-
ences and translating that into writing lessons.
Self-Knowledge, Values,  
Standards, and Beliefs
Little children playing school vividly 
demonstrate beliefs about teaching that shape 
the rules of this play and the power relation-
ships among the players. When some of these 
children grow up and become real teachers, 
their beliefs, values, and personal standards 
will implicitly and explicitly guide their deci-
sions about what and how to teach.
Values and beliefs influence the per-
ceptions and judgments that carry teachers 
through their days. They are not always 
consciously understood or named by individ-
uals, but their presence simmers beneath the 
surface of a teacher’s practice. Values shape 
the standards that teachers hold for their own 
work and for that of their students. Values are 
filters for what elements of the vast subject 
matter are emphasized and reinforced. Ulti-
mately, they are each teacher’s true curricu-
lum and true lasting lessons.
One of the central issues at Sea View Ele-
mentary was—and is—What is good writing? 
This standards issue is an interactive construc-
tion forged by individual teachers and their 
collaborative colleagues. The ebb and flow of 
changes in their students’ writing focuses this 
clarification process while challenging their 
beliefs about teaching and learning. This clar-
ification process is the deepest level of inquiry 
at Sea View Elementary. Teaching writing is a 
vehicle for exploring the ways and means of 
learning about learning, both for students and 
for adults.
Repertoire of Teaching Skills
Teaching is a craft skill built on action—
knowledge honed by trial and error. It begins 
with the teacher’s own understanding of what 
is to be learned by students and how this learn-
ing is most appropriately orchestrated for the 
population that is being served. Understanding 
teaching is a lifetime journey. There is always 
something new to learn about oneself, one’s 
students, the content, the process, and the dy-
namic interactions of these elements.
Master teachers, like concert artists, con-
sciously expand their performance repertoires. 
They develop and assemble microroutines 
that can be combined and reconstituted to fit 
a variety of settings. These experts automa-

tize many routines to free cognitive space for 
more complex perceiving and more sophis-
ticated instructional problem solving. This 
unconscious competence is the hallmark of an 
expert in the classroom.
One of the tensions and energy drains 
for the novice writing teachers at Sea View 
Elementary was this very lack of automaticity. 
Daily writing tasks demanded that conscious 
attention be placed on seemingly mundane les-
son details. When everything is important, sen-
sory overload sets in. Peripheral vision, both 
literal and metaphorical, was not a sufficient 
resource for managing the physical, emotional, 
and cognitive demands of high-quality writing 
instruction at this stage of teacher learning.
Knowledge of Students  
and How They Learn
Learners and teachers need each other. 
Each is incomplete without the other. Who 
they are in this relationship forms a delicate 
balance of minds, hearts, and souls. The desire 
for smaller class sizes and smaller schools is 
a response to the need to know each other. 
In an increasingly diverse world, direct and 
personal knowledge is even more necessary as 
old assumptions and operating rules lose their 
guiding power.
All the teaching repertoire in the world 
is wasted if it is not well-matched to the 
needs of learners (Saphier, Haley-Speca, and 
Gower, 2008). The exploding knowledge about 
learning styles, multiple intelligences, devel-
opmental differences, and cultural variation 
supports Shulman’s (1987) notion of the need 
for pedagogical learner knowledge on the part 
of all teachers.
Developmental differences do not end in 
the third grade. Grade by grade, the span, in 
Piagetian terms, widens. Many learners in mid-
dle school and high school operate at a solidly 
concrete operational level. They often stumble 
when they bump head-on into a curriculum 
organized by abstraction and taught through 
symbol systems. When flexible teachers start 
with the concrete and scaffold learning to the 
abstract, these same students grasp complex 
ideas and perform at high levels.
Developing culturally respectful teach-
ing approaches is an increasing need in many 
schools. Methods and materials that work with 
one population might confuse or offend another. 
Language differences play an important role 
here. One often unnoticed variable is the dif-
ference between students’ social discourse and 
their knowledge of the structure and norms of 
academic discourse. Lee and Fradd (1998) refer 
to this sophisticated matching as instructional 
congruence. This means that teachers mediate 
the nature of academic content with students’ 
language and cultural experiences. This makes 
content accessible, meaningful, and relevant.
Learning about student writers at Sea View 
Elementary energized and at times terrorized 
the teachers. The more they looked, the more 
differences they spotted. This led to dialogue 
and discussions about the best ways to inter-
vene with individuals—when and how do you 
coach young writers, and when and how do you 
consult with them in a more directive manner? 
Other conversations explored alternative ways 
to group students for instruction. One direction 
this took was to experiment with cross-grade 
groupings for targeted mini-lessons.
A World of Both–And
Neither the organizational nor the pro-
fessional capacities for adaptivity would have 
sufficed on their own to make a difference at 
Sea View Elementary School. In this world of 
both–and, the twin goals reinforced one an-
other. Developing each capacity within a spirit 
of collegiality and inquiry led to a natural flow 
within and among the areas.
These twelve capacities frame the win-
dows through which we can look at schools and 
districts. Current project successes can usually 
be located here. Current logjams in the system 
also have their roots in these areas. This, then, 
is a diagnostic tool and a curriculum for organi-
zational and professional development.

Through community character is built. The schools that do it best “are those that cultivate intense, 
think community. Most of the time, character is not an individual accomplishment. It emerges 
through joined hearts and souls. And in groups.”
—Brooks, 2015
C
ommunity doesn’t just happen in schools. It is simultaneously a fragile 
resource and a state of being. “Community is an outward and visible sign 
of an inward and invisible grace, the flowing of personal identity and in-
tegrity into the world of relationships” (Palmer, 1998, p. 90). These networks of 
relationships bind people to one another and to important ideas and work.
Chapter 14	 Community Doesn’t Just Happen
The modern sense of schools as com-
munities is relatively new. Not long ago, the 
individual teacher was the center of most 
attempts to improve the quality of teaching 
and learning in schools. Today, new promise is 
held in the growing recognition of the power 
of school-based professional communities to 
support teacher development and improve 
student learning. Louis, Marks, and Kruse 
(1996) found that professional communities 
in schools are characterized by a shared sense 
of purpose, a collective focus on student 
learning, collaborative activity, deprivatized 
practice, and reflective dialogue. Such com-
munities develop collective responsibility for 
student learning, producing schoolwide gains 
in student achievement.
Rosenholtz (1989) found that a major 
difference between stuck schools and moving 
schools is teacher talk and teacher efficacy. 
Studying secondary schools, Little and Mc-
Laughlin (1993) found that teacher member-
ship in a learning community is strongly related 
to student learning in specific subject areas and 
at entire schools, significantly exceeding the 
learning of control groups. However, Elmore 
(1995) cautions that efforts at school restruc-
turing do not necessarily result in student learn-
ing. In fact, he finds only a weak relationship 
between the two. Reorganizing the school by 
modifying schedules, grouping patterns, and 
teaching arrangements does not automatically 
ensure a collaborative climate.
True collaboration arises from beliefs and 
skills. In this dynamic, teachers are reinvent-
ing instruction and cocreating responses to 
educational dilemmas. We have stressed that 
for professional community to exist, teachers 
must talk. Equally important, however, is what 
they talk about. We have identified the sources 
for professional conversations that lead to 
improved student learning. It seems that when 
teachers talk about real students, real student 
work, and ways to reinvent instruction to 
support greater student learning, achievement 
soars.
Developing school communities is even 
more complex, because all group members 
belong to other groups as well. The site-based 
decision-making team has members who think 
of themselves as primary teachers, special ed-
ucation teachers, parents, administrators, tax-
payers, and many other roles. To be a member 
of a given group, each individual must sort 

The Adaptive School

out and resolve conflicting loyalty and identity 
issues. This is a central “Who am I?” question 
that each group member must clarify.
David Brooks (2015) notes that commu-
nity contributes to character development for 
students and cites the Denver School of Sci-
ence and Technology (where one of us has a 
niece) and the Leaders School in Bensonhurst, 
Brooklyn, as exceptional examples. Patterns 
we have described in Adaptive Schools forge 
similar benefits. Just a few of these are allo-
centrisim, working for the benefit of the whole, 
valuing differences, norms emerging not from 
rules but from shared understandings of one an-
other, and effective ways of working together.
The Principles of Community
Creating communities requires vision, val-
ues, perseverance, hard work, and time. Com-
munity doesn’t just happen. Sergiovanni (1994) 
notes that schools are more like a functional 
family than a fast-food chain. Like any healthy 
family, a community requires work to develop 
it and keep it together. We offer the following 
seven principles in this important journey:
1.	
Community doesn’t just happen.
2.	
Community is the other face of conflict.
3.	
Diversity enriches community.
4.	
Both things and energy matter.
5.	
We cannot not be connected.
6.	
Community lives within.
7.	
Community doesn’t last forever.
Community Doesn’t Just Happen
If values are the heart of a community, 
communication is the pulse, bones, and phys-
iology. Most teaching groups, isolated from 
peers for so many years, need to learn ways of 
talking together. The task is complicated, be-
cause it requires at least four languages. First is 
the language of emotion and passion, providing 
speech for what moves us. After nearly two 
thousand years in Western civilization, the role 
of emotion in professional life and its necessity 
for sound decision making is finally being le-
gitimized by Goleman (1995), Damasio (1994), 
and others. Second is the language of logic 
and analysis, to apply a variety of perspectives 
in reasoned reflection and planning. Third is 
the language of dialogue, to develop shared 
understanding; and fourth is the language of 
discussion, to make decisions that stay made. 
Dialogue and discussion are ways of talking 
that are fundamental to the success of any com-
munity (see chapter 5).
Developing community also requires pay-
ing attention to the environmental aspects 
described in chapter 8. Teachers need space 
and time to collaborate. Darling-Hammond 
(1997) describes how “push-in” efforts in a 
number of restructuring elementary and high 
schools allow more time for collaboration, 
involve staying with the same students for two 
or more years, and provide teaching teams 
with distributed expertise. These schools are 
eliminating “pull-out” services to students, and 
special staff members are reassigned to reduce 
teacher–pupil classroom ratios. Darling-Ham-
mond describes an elementary school in Chi-
cago in which the teachers teach four full days 
of academic classes each week and spend the 
fifth day planning in multigrade teams as the 
students rotate to resource classes in music, fine 
arts, computer lab, physical education, library 
science, and science lab.
At an elementary school in South Carolina, 
the teachers have eighty minutes per day for 
planning. In Cincinnati, an elementary staff re-
organized the schedule to free up five and a half 
hours per week for planning time and reduced 
the pupil-teacher ratio to fifteen to one by us-
ing push-in strategies. We’ve even heard of a 
school in the central valley of California where 
an impenetrable fog sometimes delays the start 
of school. Buses are delayed until visibility is 
safe. School leaders realized that if fog could 
keep the kids home, so could the teachers’ need 
for collaborative work time. Once a week, now, 

Community Doesn’t Just Happen	
Chapter 14	
189
the schools in the district have a “teachers’ fog 
day.”
Only 32 percent of instructional-staff time 
in traditional high schools is spent teaching, 
compared to 60 percent to 85 percent of 
staff time in elementary schools, intermediate 
schools, and alternative high schools, accord-
ing to Cooper, Sarrel, and Tetenbaum (1990). 
Yet high schools, too, are creating more time 
for the school’s major purpose: teaching. The 
same study finds that nonteaching time in tradi-
tional high schools is not spent on collaborative 
planning and curriculum work, which is the 
case in other countries. Changing this is not 
easy, yet restructuring high schools are modi-
fying these realities, most often at a great cost 
in terms of the psychological effects of change.
Darling-Hammond (1997) describes Inter-
national High School, in which the principal, 
the assistant principals, and all the other staff 
work with students in advisory councils. Guid-
ance counselors are attached to teaching teams. 
The librarian is a teacher with classes. Full-
time teachers constitute 67 percent of the staff. 
At Central Park East Secondary School, vir-
tually everyone works with students, and full-
time teachers constitute 73 percent of the staff. 
Darling-Hammond observes the following:
Shared time for planning, professional de-
velopment, and governance is much more 
extensive in the restructured schools. In Inter-
national High School, cluster teachers share 
70 minutes of planning time daily and a half 
day each week for staff development and 
collective work while students are in clubs. 
(1997, p. 185)
To accomplish the structural changes de-
scribed above requires more than communica-
tion skills. Communities must keep their values 
clear and continue developing the resources to 
see themselves and their students through rough 
times. Not the least of these resources are the 
five energy sources for high performance that 
we have discussed: efficacy, flexibility, crafts-
manship, consciousness, and interdependence.
Community Is the Other Face  
of Conflict
Community and conflict are intertwined. 
Conflict is a manifestation of interdependence; 
without people’s need for one another, there 
would be no conflict. Conflict is necessary in 
order to have community. Conflict forges new 
lifeforms. Canyons, beaches, and mountains 
are created from conflicting energies. Because 
human conflict is uncomfortable, groups often 
seek to avoid it. When they do so, they live in 
a state of community building that Scott Peck 
(1987) calls pseudocommunity. This is a stage 
of extensive politeness. Being comfortable 
is the goal. Members of pseudocommunities 
ignore or make light of problems, withholding 
their true feelings. They ignore individual dif-
ferences and avoid people or issues that make 
them uncomfortable.
Groups move from this stage by asking 
transition questions: “Who are we?” “Why are 
we doing this?” “What is our purpose?” Chal-
lenging nominalizations and generalizations 
will also move the group to the next stage of 
development: chaos.
Peck’s use of the term chaos is different 
from, but not totally unlike, the meaning of the 
term in quantum physics: a dynamic system in 
which many variables are constantly interact-
ing—each affecting another, which affects an-
other, and so on. In Peck’s model, chaos is a time 
of fighting and struggling. Differences move into 
the open. Most often the fighting at this stage is 
neither respectful nor skillful. Members try to 
convert others to their views. They demonstrate 
fix-it behaviors and try to heal. Others resist the 
attempts to change. They look for someone to 
blame and develop cliques and alliances.
Groups have two choices at this point: 
to move toward community or away from it. 
Many groups and leaders attempt to achieve 
peace by overregulating potential problems. 
Organizations attempt to resolve differences by 
developing policies, structuring committees, and 
establishing chains of command, but these treat 
only the surface manifestations of conflicts.

The Adaptive School
190
The way toward community at this point 
is through engaging conflict and embracing it 
with special tools. Peck calls this stage empti-
ness. Members empty themselves of the need 
to convert or fix others. They empty themselves 
of the need to control, of the sense that there is 
one right way, of ideologies, and of prejudices 
against other people. Members empty them-
selves of barriers to communication and work 
to make a transition from rigid individualism 
to an acceptance of interdependence. Individu-
alism is valued, but so is collegiality. Ways are 
sought to achieve the best of both worlds. Si-
lence is an asset. Also prominent in the toolkit 
are the metacognitive strategies of suspension 
and the balcony view (see chapter 5). Concepts 
about and tools for conflict (see chapter 12) are 
also helpful.
At Peck’s next stage, groups realize true 
community. Here people are open, lucid, vul-
nerable, and creative. They bond together 
across their differences for common purposes.
Diversity Enriches Community
Healthy biological cultures are diverse. 
Monocultures are at greatest risk for disease and 
trauma. If only one type of pine tree grows in 
the forest, then one species of insect, fungus, or 
other parasite can destroy all the trees. Botanists 
cross-pollinate, splice genes, and graft stems to 
different root stocks to increase the resistance to 
pestilence and disease. On the edges of ecosys-
tems, at points of transition between habitats, 
lifeforms are the most profuse and evolving.
As long as the group and its subgroups 
know that they are a system, diversity of cog-
nitive style, educational beliefs, ethnicity, cul-
ture, gender, role, and age increase the quality 
of group decisions and offerings to students. In 
fact, there are some indications that a staff that 
is too heavily weighted with males will have 
greater difficulty working collaboratively than 
a group that has more gender balance (Louis 
and Kruse, 1995).
Diverse ideas help groups to form rich re-
sponses to educational perplexities. Disagree-
ments that focus on substantive, issue-related 
differences of opinion actually improve team 
cohesiveness, commitment, and effectiveness. 
Disagreements that become expressed as per-
sonal attacks or judgments about others, how-
ever, insert a destructive energy flow into group 
work. What groups need to know and be able to 
do in order to engage in cognitive conflict with-
out affective conflict includes the collaborative 
norms (see chapter 4), dialogue and discussion 
(see chapter 5), and using conflict as a resource 
(see chapter 12).
Both Things and Energy Matter
Throughout this book we have advocated 
building the energy resources of schools; yet 
energy is not enough. Prairie Ridge High 
School in the Crystal Lake District in Illinois 
was designed as an adaptive facility, capable of 
supporting independent and interdependent ac-
tivities within the building (Saban et al., 1998). 
Constructed to operate as an 1,800-student high 
school, the building can also be transformed 
to work as two 900-student schools or four 
450-student schools. The thoughtful placement 
of special spaces, such as science labs, and the 
flexibility of interior walls that are not weight 
bearing make this so. Prairie Ridge was de-
signed to serve the relationships among the 
mind (classroom and academic areas), the body 
(physical education and athletic areas), and the 
spirit (the theater and art area).
Each of these areas is zoned to be able to 
act independently from the others, yet in the 
course of a normal school day the three areas 
interdependently form a total learning com-
munity. In addition, each area contains design 
elements to support the staff and the students in 
developing the five energy sources of high per-
formance: efficacy, flexibility, craftsmanship, 
consciousness, and interdependence. A prime 
example of this is the lack of separate offices 
for each academic department. Teachers share 
a well-provisioned common preparation area.
Although this example is exceptional in 
its scope and execution, things do matter in 

Community Doesn’t Just Happen	
Chapter 14	
191
achieving educational aims. The “surround,” as 
David Perkins (1992) terms it, is tantamount to 
being a thinking member of the human commu-
nity, interacting in countless ways to influence 
human learning.
One of the authors is reminded of his first 
year as a fully credentialed teacher. The princi-
pal met him outside the building on the first day 
of school and asked, “Are your desks in rows?” 
Trembling with anger and anxiety, the young 
teacher asked if the conversation could be con-
tinued in the principal’s office. Once there, he 
asserted that he understood his role to be the 
responsibility for learning in that class, and if 
that was the case, he would decide the furniture 
arrangement that would best suit that purpose.
Values matter. Values have life as energy. 
Statements of mission and beliefs are things 
that are printed, framed, and hung on the 
wall. Things without energy are not enough; 
the things must support the energy. To focus 
group energy we offer the following tips—
based on our work over the last decade with 
many seminar participants and group leaders 
in a variety of settings—for setting and main-
taining goal focus:
1.	
Adopt the meeting standards (see chapter 6).
2.	
Rotate the facilitator and recorder roles 
(see chapter 6).
3.	
Select one or two of the collaborative 
norms to develop (see chapter 4).
4.	
Decide what is nonnegotiable.
5.	
Teach the essentials of group development 
(see chapter 9).
6.	
Provide space, tools, and time.
7.	
Lighten up: Laugh a lot, learn from expe-
rience, and locate power within the group.
We Cannot Not Be Connected
If there is no other, there will be no 
self. If there is no self, there will be 
none to make distinctions.
—Chuang Tzu, Chinese philosopher
Wherever we look, we find only ourselves. 
This appears to be true at every level of organi-
zation of which we can conceive.
Physicist Fritjof Capra (1982), writing 
about quantum theory, explains that subatomic 
particles are not isolated grains of matter. 
Rather, they “are probability patterns, inter-
connections in an inseparable cosmic web 
that includes the human observer and her con-
sciousness” (pp. 91–92).
Albert Einstein disclosed that even space 
and time are products of our five senses. We 
see and touch things and experience events in 
sequential order.
Depak Chopra (1993) advises that the 
atoms of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitro-
gen that you exhale were, just a moment ago, 
locked up in solid matter. “Your stomach, liver, 
heart, lungs and brain are vanishing into thin 
air, being replaced as quickly and endlessly as 
they are being broken down” (p. 9).
Scientists and sages seek to understand a 
universal connectedness in which individual 
entities exist but have no separation. About the 
process of self-creation, Wheatley and Kell-
ner-Rogers (1996) say the following:
Differentness comes into the world, a desire 
to be something separate. From a unified field, 
individual notions of self arise. This process, 
like all those that describe self, is enticingly 
paradoxical. First, something appears for 
which there is no known antecedent. Where 
does the self that is organizing originate? Or 
why does it attempt to separate itself from 
the unified fields? Why does this movement 
toward differentiation even start? (p. 51)
Aikido master Thomas Crum recommends 
that personal boundaries not determine our 
identity. Boundaries are misperceived if we 
interpret them as separations from others. If 
the self does not remember its connectedness, 
it will expire. Each act of ours creates the con-
ditions for other lives.
Capra (1996) reminds us that to under-
stand our essential interdependence is to under-
stand our relationship to other people and other 

The Adaptive School
192
things. “It requires the shifts in perception that 
are characteristic of systems thinking—from 
parts to the whole, from objects to relation-
ships, from contents to patterns” (p. 298).
Community Lives Within
As a friend of ours used to say, “This 
one is an inside job.” Being in community 
involves a tension, nearly always present, be-
tween self-assertion and integration. It requires 
an acceptance of the self as both whole and 
part, a dichotomy described by Arthur Koes-
tler (1972) as holonomy. The word holonomy 
comes from the Greek holos, meaning “whole,” 
and on, meaning “part.” This conveys a combi-
nation of opposites, functioning autonomously 
while working interdependently. Although all 
five energy sources contribute to consciously 
holonomous living, interdependence makes the 
most direct contribution.
Ultimately, the success of individuals 
depends on the success of the community as 
a whole, and the success of the community 
depends on the growth and development of 
each member.
There seems to be no objective reality; 
perception combined with intention creates 
reality. As you see a thing, that is what you will 
have. As you describe a thing, that is what you 
will see.
Community Doesn’t Last Forever
Of one thing we are certain: Things change. 
Experiences accumulate; learning occurs at 
different rates in different areas for different 
people. Life stages bring new developmental 
challenges to the young adult, the middle-age 
professional, and the person near retirement. 
Although community is robust and can prevail 
for long periods, it is also fragile and subject to 
changing conditions. Groups that lose their ca-
pacity to work effectively with conflict plunge 
back into chaos. They can recover, move back 
toward organizing conflict away, or move into 
pseudocommunity. Wheatley and Kellner-Rog-
ers (1996) ask the following questions:
As we act together in the world, our orga-
nization’s identity grows and evolves. It 
helps periodically to question what we have 
become. Do we still love this organization? 
Do we each organize our work from the 
same shared sense of what is significant? 
We return to the place where our community 
took form, where we first became inspired by 
what we could be in the world. From remem-
bering that place, together we can decide 
what we want to be now. (p. 62)
Widening Our View
We’ve been talking about collaboration 
and being in true community as the cutting 
edge of our work, the leading edge of pro-
fessional learning. Yet it might be the oldest 
story of all human stories. Our ancestors on the 
plains of Africa lived in collaborative commu-
nities: the hunters and the gatherers, the fishers 
and the cooks, the weavers and the spinners, all 
working together and sharing a life.
What are the organizers for community? 
For West African cultures, it is the drum. It is 
from these cultures that drumming music has 
become an essential element in the music of 
much of the world: In South America, Central 
America, and North America, the beat is pres-
ent. The Afro-Cuban rhythms sound through 
salsa, blues, jazz, rock, and country music. The 
essential difference in the music of the villages 
of West Africa is that the beat is polyrhyth-
mic—twos, threes, and fours, interacting, inter-
twining, setting the rhythms for the dance. As 
West African women pound corn, the children 
don’t mimic the beat, they clap and pat counter 
rhythms, seeking their voice within the village.
To be a drummer in this culture is to be 
a person of distinction. For the drummer not 
only keeps the rhythm but also knows the his-
tory of the people. The drummer calls people 
to the dance by naming their ancestors: Bring 
all of who you are to the center and dance. 

Community Doesn’t Just Happen	
Chapter 14	
193
The tradespeople are called to the dance with 
their own signature rhythm—the carpenter, the 
potter, the weaver, the shepherd. The dancers, 
too, play off the beat, adding their own rhythm 
to the mix. The African dancer picks up and 
responds to the rhythms of one or more drums, 
depending on his or her skill. In the best danc-
ing, the dancer, like the drummer, adds another 
rhythm, one that is not already there. The danc-
er’s ear is tuned to hidden beats, responding to 
gaps in the music (Chernoff, 1981).
You don’t have to dance on the beat to 
be part of the village, but you are expected 
to honor the beat and blend your movement 
with the movements of others. In fact, to dance 
with disregard for the beat is considered to be 
mentally disturbed, because this represents a 
breakdown of communication, awareness, and 
community. The goal is to find the beat, honor 
the beat, add your voice, and dance. Welcome 
to the dance!

Appendix A Facilitation Strategies 
and Moves 
Introduction 
Readers of this section will find two sets of protocols for leading groups. One set we will call 
"Facilitation Moves" and they are labeled as: 
Focus and Maintain 
Attention 
Manage Energy 
Grouping 
The 35 moves are distinguished from strategies in that they are often, once learned, used 
intuitively to support a group, and usually have not more than two parts in contrast to the several 
steps necessary in most strategies. 
Another set we are labeling Facilitation Strategies and includes 125 entries in the 
following categories: 
Activate 
Process Text & 
Generate 
Discourse

Infonnation

Clear intentions, the ability to read groups, and flexibility are keys to selecting processes to 
facilitate groups. This compilation of 160 protocols is a resource for varied and flexible approaches 
to situations encountered by groups: bonding, information processing, marking transitions, giving 
directions, dialoguing about data, converting negative energy, making decisions, surfacing assump­
tions, problem solving, starting sessions, and much more. An ultimate goal for facilitators is to 
invent their own strategies, and familiarity and application of processes in this collection should 
help build this capacity. 
A Word about Moves 
Facilitators make a number of subtle "moves," perhaps not noticeable unless one is looking 
for them, that increase or deflect group energy, direct attention, affect information flow, promote 
memory, communicate respect, and create psychological safety. These are largely nonverbal. We 
classify them as moves in contrast to a strategy when they are unplanned, executed spontaneously 
and have no more than one or two parts to them. "Choose Voice," "Visual Paragraph," "Finger 
Minutes," and "Most Important Twenty Seconds" are examples in this appendix. These, and the 
majority of nonverbal ideas in this collection emanate from the work of our friend and mentor 
Michael Grinder (Grinder, 2007).

The Adaptive School

What–Why–How
The fundamental format for offering directions is to use the syntactical pattern of “What,” 
“Why,” “How.” The “What” is the name of the strategy, structure, or pattern you are proposing 
for engaging the group. The “Why” is the intention or purpose of that choice. The “How” in-
cludes the details and procedures involved in the process. These directions are offered visually 
whenever possible.
The “Why” is the most essential element for enlisting group member respect for the process 
and commitment to following the assigned pattern with integrity. “Why” statements offer princi-
ples of practice such as: “This strategy presents opportunities for hearing and considering multiple 
viewpoints without judgment or comment.” Or, “This paired interaction allows partners to engage 
with the text and each other’s perspectives in a time-efficient manner.”
Notice that this last “Why” statement also embeds a subtle pacing for those participants who 
value time efficiency and may not always value their colleagues’ contributions. For those partici-
pants who enjoy collaborative interactions, the embedded message for them is that the strategy will 
be time bound so they should respect the protocol and time frames and not get lost in any meander-
ing conversations during the process.
“Why” statements have both immediate and longer-term intentions. The immediate impact is 
framing the purpose for the task at hand. The longer-term intention is where facilitation overlaps 
with group development goals. For groups to be ready to engage with increasing cognitive and re-
lational challenges, the skilled facilitator paces both the strategy choice and the “Why’s” at the first 
meeting, stretching the learning capacities of group members. For novice groups, the “Why’s” will 
be mostly about the intention of the strategy to help those groups develop basic habits of follow-
ing directions and working successfully with colleagues. For emerging groups, give the “Why’s” 
to offer opportunities to stretch collaborative skills so that the group can engage confidently with 
cognitively and emotionally challenging content.
Finally, all highly evolved processes reoccur in simpler, repeating processes. It is better to 
know a few processes well than attempt many poorly.
Strategies
Strategies provide structures for conversations that might otherwise meander, cost unnecessary 
time, and are less productive. Effective strategies provide four functions: focus, efficiency, devel-
opment of social skills, and psychological safety. Participants need a certain sense of safety to risk 
putting one’s ideas on the table, to acknowledge when they do not know, and to participate. Safety 
is different from comfort. Members should occasionally be uncomfortable in work conversations; 
if they are not, they are probably not talking about the right issues. Discomfort is the expression of 
disequilibrium experienced when current knowledge and conceptions give way to new perceptions 
and solutions. It is a doorway to learning. Yet conversations must be safe enough to learn, contrib-
ute, decide, and plan.
To cognitively engage with others, especially in hierarchical groups, requires psychological 
safety. For some this means an opportunity to talk and not be overridden by others. It means having 
a sense that one’s contributions are recognized. It means being free of losing face, embarrassment, 
and feelings of inequality. Very importantly, it also means freedom from having to be certain. To 
speak always with certainty is one of the greatest barriers to deeply understanding situations and 
generating informed theories of causation and solution. These four attributes and the simple pattern 
of turn-taking are characteristic of high-performing groups.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A

Selecting a Strategy
Two considerations are important in selecting strategies. First is the degree of tightness or 
looseness. Facilitators develop a repertoire of tight to loose structures. When hard-to-talk-about 
topics are on the table, the facilitator tightens the degree of structure to provide greater emotional 
safety and more focused thought. Cognitive complexity, high emotion, or new content may call for 
tight structures. “First Turn/Last Turn” in this appendix is an example of a tight structure. It gives 
shape to the conversation by providing a focus for talking, naming processes to be used, indicating 
the cognitive skills required, and setting boundaries for behavior and topic.
When the topic is easier to discuss, less restrictive strategies are used. “Tell the person next to 
you one of your experiences with this idea.” This is a very loose structure, in which the only musts 
are the topic and with whom to talk.
Group size also influences safety. In general, pairs are safer than trios, which are safer than 
quartets and so on. The least safe is the full group conversation.
Task, Relationship, or Process
A second consideration is the degree of focus on task, relationship, or process. Wellman and 
Lipton (2004) offer a metaphor of a street entertainer spinning plates. In selecting processes facil-
itators may choose to give more support to one of three “plates”: task, process, or relationship. As 
in a vaudeville act, all plates do not require constant attention. The facilitator notices which plate 
is wobbling and gives that one a little more spin, noting the spin by saying something like, “This 
interaction has been structured so that you can appreciate the views of others at your table. Notice 
how others at the table give you ideas you did not have on your own.”

Walk About 
This set of strategies provides psychological safety and facilitates member’s engagement in new groups or discourse topics in one or both of two ways—feeling included and being present in the room. One function is to help a person feel included in a 
working group. When groups convene, bodies are present, but heads may need to be encouraged to attend. Activities intended to provide inclusion are used to: 
•  Focus mental energy into the room and ideally on the topic,
•  Establish norms for interactive, not passive participation,
•  Begin the shift from focus on self to becoming a member of the group and 
•  In large assemblies, help answer the question, “Who am I in relation to others in this group?”
Processes that activate and engage are used at the beginning of a new topic. As friend and colleague Laura Lipton says, “Everything is in your head, but not in alphabetical order.” These processes get information into working memory to provide 
organizers for retaining new information, level the playing field and articulate frames of reference about the topic. They are inherently respectful of participants assuming that members are not empty slates but do have data about the subject. Activating is 
not enough, ideas must be engaged in interaction with others to achieve these results. Each strategy below will be labeled as to its primary function, inclusion or activate, and engage recognizing that some processes do both.

Focus First Moves
Outcome: Members attend to speaker
Michael Grinder was the first to formulate the focus attention moves. He called this concept atten-
tion first. The concept is supported by the following moves: stance, freeze gesture, credible voice, 
and then break and breathe described below. The first three occur simultaneously.  While it is com-
mon sense to wait for a group to attend, other considerations sometimes improperly override this 
function. Facilitator fatigue, feeling pressed for time, or having a number of subgroups conversing 
all at once will sometimes lead to poor practice.
Break and Breathe✓
PROCESS
•	
When over 90 percent of the group is attending, momentarily break eye contact, perhaps by 
looking down, then step to one side, engage eye contact again and say “Thank you” in a cred-
ible voice.
Choose voice✓
PROCESS
•	
Use a credible voice. This is congruent with messages that give information and increases the 
“authority” of what is said.
NOTES
•	
A credible voice has a limited range of modulation and tends to drop at the end of a phrase or 
sentence. This voice communicates information. An alternative voice is the approachable voice 
with a higher range of modulation. The approachable voice is somewhat melodic and tends 
to rise at the end of sentences. This voice is used to elicit responses rather than for gaining 
attention. 
Stance✓
PROCESS
•	
Assume a credible stance, with an erect posture, arms to the side and straight legs—knees 
slightly bent--in alignment with shoulders. 
•	
Freeze Gesture✓
PROCESS
•	
Hold one gesture still as and after making a call for attention. A gesture might be one or two 
hands pointing to self, accompanied with the words, “Look this direction, please,” (or words 
of the faciliator’s choice) delivered in a credible voice. 
•	
Other gestures could include pointing to a chart while maintaining the frozen body. The only 
principle for selecting a gesture is that the gesture should be above elbow level.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
203
Manage Attention
Outcome: Members maintain focus on topic or process
Above, Pause, Whisper
OUTCOME
Members return attention to facilitator
PROCESS
•	
“Above” in this context means the faciliator’s voice briefly starts above the volume level in 
the room.
•	
Listen to the collective voice volume in a group rise and fall.
•	
As the volume begins to drop from its loudest point, speak a partial phrase in a voice just louder 
than what you are hearing. Examples are: “As you stop…” or “This next stage…”
•	
Pause as a momentary hush fills the room, than in a whisper finish your statement. For exam-
ple, “As you stop….and look this way, the next step will be to locate a new partner and share 
what you are learning.”
TIPS
•	
The volume of voices in a group cycle every 8 to 10 seconds from high to low. Listen until 
you can identity these ranges. Timing is essential to achieve the desired effect. The pause in 
this sequence provides a break in pattern, which brains are hardwired to detect, causing the 
momentary silence into which you interject directions.
Applause
OUTCOME
Break rapport in subgroups, bring focus to full group
PROCESS
•	
At the close of small group work, ask participants to give themselves a hand.
•	
Model by clapping your hands.
TIPS
•	
Collective applause generates electro-chemical energy in the brain that contributes to a re-
sourceful learning state.
Cape
OUTCOME
Member returns to topic under discussion
PROCESS
•	
Should a member offer an idea unrelated to the topic being discussed, the facilitator records 
the idea on a chart and says, “That’s an important idea.  Let’s come back to it when we can 
give it full attention.”

The Adaptive School
204
VARIATIONS
•	
Facilitator directs the recorder to record.
•	
Some may know this strategy by the name “Parking Lot”.
•	
Encourage self-directed recording.
TIPS
•	
It is important to return to this item in some way. Options include: at the end of the meeting, 
in a subgroup after the meeting, or on the next agenda.
Eye Hand Coordination
OUTCOME
Members’ eyes go to where facilitator points
PROCESS
•	
Presenter looks in the direction (s)he points.
TIPS
•	
Member’s eyes look in the direction in which the facilitator looks. Facilitators err when they 
look at the group while pointing to a chart. This becomes especially important when a facilita-
tor/recorder team is at work.  Recorders avoid eye contact with the group so as not to split the 
group’s attention between the facilitator and recorder.
Finger Minutes
OUTCOMES
1.	
Subgroup awareness they are part of the full group
2.	
Facilitator has data with which to announce additional time to be allotted the activity
PROCESS
•	
During an activity, ask the group to pause.
•	
Participants in a group decide how many minutes they need to finish and designate one person 
to raise his/her hand indicating how many minutes the group needs to finish the activity. Set 
a limit by indicating a fist (0) to the maximum number of minutes you want to allow (e.g., 0, 
1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).
•	
Name the finger numbers you see so the large group is aware of variation.
•	
Estimate an average time that you think will allow most groups to finish without frustrating 
those groups already done.
•	
Report the remaining time to the group.
VARIATIONS
•	
Without giving a time range, ask groups how much more time they need.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
205
Hand Signal
OUTCOME
Members return attention to facilitator
PROCESS
•	
With frozen body and a frozen gesture, and with eyes downcast, the facilitator raises one hand 
at right angle to the body and waits until the room is quiet.
•	
Members raise their hands, finish their current thought, then silently attend to the facilitator.
•	
The facilitator breaks and breathes, says “Thank you” and makes a transition statement to the 
next order of business.
TIPS
•	
Explain this is the most respectful signal you know, as it allows adults to finish their thought 
before attending to full group business.
•	
Using the same spot to do this will begin to anchor the space as a signal to fall quiet and attend.
•	
Visually oriented members are first to notice the hand signal, begin to quiet, and then the more 
auditorily oriented members notice the decrease in volume, and also fall quiet.
Relevancy Check
OUTCOME
Member adjusts behavior to match topic
PROCESS
•	
A group member says something unrelated to the group’s topic.
•	
The facilitator, with an approachable voice, says, “Name, help us understand how your com-
ment relates to the topic being explored?”
•	
Speakers will either explain the relevance, in which case the conversation proceeds, or takes 
it off the table.
VARIATIONS
•	
The facilitator records the item on chart paper announcing the group will return to it at an 
appropriate time.
•	
See the strategy Cape elsewhere on this list.
TIPS
•	
A topic delayed must be returned to at some stage. Options include: subgroup after the meeting, 
added to this or next meeting agenda, or a subgroup drafts a statement about the topic to be 
talked about at the next meeting.

The Adaptive School
206
Stand and Share 
OUTCOME
Members self-organize group reporting: Rather than depend on the facilitator to choose who speaks 
next, members look to who else might be standing and adjust reporting sequences accordingly 
PROCESS
•	
The facilitator explains that when members hear the direction “Stand and Share,” the group 
manages the order in which members report.
•	
When a member stands, if no one else is standing, the member shares. If others are standing, 
by verbal or non-verbal communication they arrange the order of reporting. 
TIPS
•	
Any move that releases member dependency on a facilitator contributes to self-directed learn-
ing and the reality that it is the “group’s group”. Facilitators reinforce this by assuming mem-
bers will read page numbers on slides and not need to hear the facilitator’s voice. 
Show, Don’t Say
OUTCOMES
1.	
Attend to facilitator’s instructions or 
2.	
separate facilitator from data 
PROCESS
•	
The facilitator holds two fingers in the air and says, “You have this many minutes.”
•	
Hold the posture and gesture until members have visually acknowledged the signal and have 
gone back to work.
VARIATIONS
•	
Stand to the side of a chart (or whatever the visual focus is to be) so that you, the chart, and the 
group form a triangle. Swing your shoulders and arm into a pointing gesture toward the chart. 
Keep your eyes on the chart. Be silent.
•	
Use in a conference when presenting difficult to accept data (e.g., with a parent to document 
student’s late assignments).
TIPS
•	
Use the variation when you want to direct energy away from you or toward important information 
the group can read by itself. Look at the data, not at the group. The group’s eyes will go where 
yours are focused; you want them to be examining the data toward which you are pointing.
Visual Paragraph✓
OUTCOME
Increased understanding as members unconsciously match content with space

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
207
PROCESS
•	
Stand in one space and speak.
•	
Without speaking, break eye contact, move to a new space, pause and resume speaking.
VARIATIONS
•	
If seated, change position in chair by leaning forward, to one side or backward.
Yes, Start
OUTCOME
Members confirm they are ready to start
PROCESS
•	
After giving directions for an activity, the facilitator remains standing, motionless, and visually 
scans the group for about 20 seconds.
TIPS
•	
When the facilitator remains motionless after giving directions, members get the message that 
they are to start the activity. Should members glance at a facilitator who is moving during the 
first 20 seconds, the message is that it is not necessary to start yet. Michael Grinder discovered 
this and named it The Most Important 20 Twenty Seconds.
Focus and Maintain  
Attention
Manage Energy
Grouping
Airplane Stacking
OUTCOMES
1.	
Reduce or eliminate member anxiety when facilitator calls on speakers
2.	
Members hear ideas of others because they’re not worried about their place in a queue
PROCESS
•	
Explain metaphor related to control tower at airport directing the order in which planes are to land.
•	
Assign numbers to those with raised hands. Advise them to remember their number.
•	
Call on #1, then #2 and so on.
•	
Do not comment on participant responses. If a question is posed, list on a flip chart for later 
attention.
•	
When more hands are raised, add these to this list or start another list.
Choreograph an Opening (Kendall Zoller)
OUTCOMES
1.	
Acknowledge resistance 
2.	
Members achieve states of neutrality or acceptance

The Adaptive School
208
PROCESS
•	
“Thank you for coming.” High eye contact with group. Use credible and approachable voice. 
Open, palms up gesture.
•	
“On the agenda are four topics.” Credible voice, look at agenda, pause after reading each topic. 
Turn to the group, freeze body, and count internally 3,2,1.
•	
“Before we start.” Walk a few feet from the flip chart (presentation space).
•	
“I imagine some of you would rather be in classrooms today. And for good reason. Rooms need 
to be set up, final touches done for opening day and materials need to be organized.” Gesture 
outside, toward classrooms. Pause periodically. Use credible voice, pause, and internally count 
3,2,1. Then move halfway back to the flip chart.
•	
“At the same time, given your passion for serving students in the most complete ways possible, 
you may be wondering what can happen here that can make this worth your while.” Approach-
able voice. Palms up gesturing to group. Inclusive language.
•	
“The first topic today is _________.” Walk back toward flip chart. Look at and point to flip 
chart. Credible voice.
VARIATIONS
•	
Language choices: some of you, all of you, a few of you, many of you.
TIPS
•	
Language for reasons for being in classrooms and passion for students needs to be artfully 
vague. If it is too specific, you will lose some listeners, as they say to themselves, “That is not 
me.”
Closing the Window
OUTCOMES
1.	
Alert group time is ending
2.	
Members know time for process is ending
PROCESS
The facilitator says, “You have this much time left on this topic,” while moving hands closer to-
gether starting at shoulder width apart.
TIPS
•	
Move hands slowly together while scanning the group for any signals someone wants to speak.
•	
This strategy may stimulate contributions from people who have been sitting on an idea but 
have not yet said it.
Decontaminate Problem Space
OUTCOMES
1.	
Regain positive energy
2.	
Members regain resourcefulness, often evidenced by posture, facial expressions, etc.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
209
PROCESS
•	
Locations evoke memory. When a negative or counterproductive statement has been made, the 
location from which it was made evokes emotional recall.
•	
Step away from any location in which a statement distressing to the group was made by anyone.
VARIATIONS 
•	
If the person introducing you is disliked by the group, or says something that causes distress, 
begin your work in any space other than the space occupied by the introducer.
•	
If you say something clumsy or offensive, step out of the space in which it was said, point back 
to the space and say, “Did he say that?” Or “That was wrong, I apologize for that.” 
•	
Rooms also evoke memories. If required to work in a room in which participants have negative 
reactions, redesign the workspace and change furniture arrangements.
TIPS
•	
The stronger the emotional message, the greater the decontamination effort. Move to the back 
of the room to decontaminate the effect of intense negative messages.
Foreshadow
OUTCOMES
1.	
Signal a transition 
2.	
Members anticipate next events
PROCESS
•	
Before a break, name the next topic or activity to occur.
VARIATIONS
•	
Build suspense by not naming the topic but suggesting that the information will be surprising.
TIPS
•	
Anticipation serves the function of an advance organizer.
PAG/PAU (Process as Given, Process as Understood) (Doyle and Strauss)
OUTCOMES
1.	
Check for understanding 
2.	
Members are clear about the next process(es)
PROCESS
•	
With a credible voice, the facilitator gives directions for the next activity.
•	
Next, the facilitator pauses, breaks eye contact, silently moves to a new space and in an ap-
proachable voice says, “Just to be sure that I stated that clearly, what are you about to do?” 
VARIATIONS
•	
Ask specific questions such as “What will you do first, next, etc.?”
•	
Invite pairs or table groups to clarify directions.

The Adaptive School
210
TIPS
•	
This strategy respectfully places any failure of communication with the facilitator.
•	
The effectiveness of the message is enhanced because it is communicated in space, voice and 
language.
Satisfy, Satisfy, Delay (Michael Grinder)
OUTCOMES
1.	
Recover positive energy
2.	
Members attention are diverted from distressing member
PROCESS
•	
The facilitator notices that when one particular group member speaks, the group appears an-
noyed. The signals might be eye rolling, deep sighs, or facial expressions.
•	
Noticing this is a pattern, at the third time this member asks to be recognized, the facilitator 
does NOT call on the member, but calls on another, or closes the conversation. 
•	
Later, make an attempt to rehabilitate this member’s status in the group by calling positive 
attention to a later contribution.
VARIATIONS
•	
Move to another part of the room and ask if anyone from that area would like to add something.
•	
Direct pairs to talk on a related topic. 
TIPS
•	
The facilitator’s relationship is with the group, not an individual.
Signal Role Change
OUTCOMES
1.	
Role clarity
2.	
Members know the person facilitating has left that role
PROCESS
•	
When facilitating a meeting and wanting to contribute content, ask, “May I add something?”  
The group usually will concur.
•	
Move off to the side of the group. From this space, make a contribution in a credible voice.
•	
Without speaking, return to the facilitation space. In an approachable voice ask. “OK. Let’s 
move on,” or “How does that add to your thinking?”
VARIATIONS
•	
Instead of moving off to the side of the group, ask a participant to stand in your place while 
you occupy that seat and make your contribution.
•	
If seated, signal the change by broad changes in posture, e.g., leaning back, removing glasses, 
briefly standing.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
211
TIPS
•	
Physical signals are essential. Without them, some will not realize you are temporarily stepping 
out of the role and feel the processes are less than honest.
Stop. Redirect 
OUTCOMES
1.	
Maintain one topic at a time
2.	
Member off topic will save comment for more appropriate time
PROCESS
•	
In a credible voice say, “Name, please hold on to that idea. We will return to it in a moment”.
•	
Accompany words with slight move toward the participant with arms hugging opposing arms 
as in “holding on”.
VARIATIONS
•	
See Caping and Relevancy Check.
•	
Vary language and non-verbal expressions to match the culture of the group.
TIPS
•	
Use when a group member has violated the one topic at a time standard.
•	
You have permission to use this only when the group is clear about the topic and the one topic 
at a time standard.
Third Point
OUTCOME
Direct attention 
PROCESS
•	
Get the group to look at a screen or flip chart by using a frozen hand gesture pointed toward 
the screen and directing your own eyes at the screen.
•	
Walk away without making eye contact with the group. The group will continue to look at the 
screen.
VARIATIONS
•	
Direct attention to a section of text for members to interact with. 
TIPS
•	
The group’s eyes go where the facilitator’s eyes are directed. When the facilitator maintains 
eye contact, this is two-point communication.
•	
Three-point communication separates the message from the messenger. 
•	
When two-point communication is used related to hard-to-talk-about data, the facilitator is 
considered to be connected to the problem

TAG/TAU (Topic as Given/Topic as Understood) (Doyle and Strauss)
OUTCOMES
1.	
Check for understanding
2.	
Members are clear about the next topic
PROCESS
•	
With a credible voice, the facilitator names the next topic or task, with the information clearly 
displayed on a chart.
•	
The presenter defines key words.
•	
Next, the facilitator pauses, breaks eye contact, silently moves to a new space and in an ap-
proachable voice says, “Just to be sure that I stated that clearly, what is the next topic (or task)?” 
VARIATIONS
•	
Ask pairs or table groups to restate the topic and report to the group.
TIPS
•	
Like PAG/PAU, the effectiveness of the message is enhanced because it is communicated in 
space, voice and language.
Volunteer Stand
OUTCOMES
1.	
Redirect energy
2.	
Surprise and laughter
PROCESS
•	
Announce the need for a spokesperson for each group.
•	
Ask a volunteer from each group to stand.
•	
Ask for applause for the standing members’ willingness to serve.
•	
Instruct standing members to raise their right hand, move in a circle above their heads, and 
allow the hand to drop on the shoulder of the person who will be spokesperson for the group.
VARIATIONS
•	
Add anything that will add to the suspense and light atmosphere of the instructions.
TIPS
•	
It is not necessary for members to remain standing.
•	
You may have to coax volunteers from some groups.
Yellow Light
OUTCOMES
•	
Signal transition
•	
Members mentally prepare for transition

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
213
PROCESS
•	
Stop the group and gain attention.
•	
Indicate how many minutes are left in the activity.
VARIATIONS
•	
Use Show, Don’t Say in this appendix instead of verbally announcing the remaining time.
•	
Indicate that if groups have not started on ____ task they should do so now, as only _____ 
minutes remain.
•	
When groups are deep at work in lengthy tasks, move to groups silently and show a large sign 
showing the remaining minutes.
TIPS
•	
Use this to prepare members for transitions.
Focus and Maintain  
Attention
Manage Energy
Grouping
Grouping To Regroup and Energize
COMMENTS
•	
When seating is modified, members extend their conceptual horizons by interacting with 
people with differing experiences, perspectives and roles. Regrouping participants has the 
additional advantage of adding energy when members have been engaged in an activity for a 
length of time. Four principles apply in regrouping:
∘∘
First alert members that a partner change is ahead. The Pack and Stack signal described 
below accomplishes this. 
∘∘
Choice is the second principle. Repeated choice supports perspectives of self-directedness 
and efficacy. 
∘∘
The third principle is diversity. Over the course of a meeting provide opportunities for 
members to meet with others least likely to encounter in the flow of their work. 
∘∘
Fourth and finally is an immediate prompt. Assigning people a topic can be used to either 
summarize what just occurred or activate and engage members on the topic to enter. A 
prompt also preserves meeting time by directing immediate attention to the next task. 
•	
If energy is needed, create pairs through use of learning partners, eye contact partners, shoe 
partners or any device that will get people to move about the room.
•	
First, give instructions on the structure of the task, then name the partner with whom they will 
be working.
•	
Participants need to stack, pack and move their possessions.
Card Games 
OUTCOME
•	
Energize and randomly regroup

The Adaptive School
214
PROCESSES
•	
Distribute playing cards in a specific fashion. For example, place sets of three similar cards 
(e.g., Aces) randomly throughout the room, or sets of two distributed in a similar manner.
•	
Instruct members to locate a card partner, sit and respond to a prompt.
High Fives
OUTCOME
Energize and randomly regroup
PROCESSES
•	
Demonstrate three persons grasping hands above their heads for a “high five.” 
•	
Instruct members to stand with one hand in the air. Locate and grasp a hand of two other per-
sons. This is the group for the next task. 
•	
Sit and respond to a prompt.
Learning Partners
OUTCOME
Members choose four partners for future paired work
PROCESSES
•	
Provide a page displaying four partner choices. These might be seasons, places on a clock, 
sports teams or other symbols meaningful to the group. 
•	
Instruct members to make appointments with four people. If using a clock, for example, mem-
bers would choose a partner for 3, 6, 9, and 12 o’clock and record the appointments on the 
provided page.
•	
Check to see that each has a partner for each partner space. Form partnerships from those in-
dicating they are missing the same partner slot.
•	
Indicate a space to which members can move if they cannot locate their partner. If no one is 
available to pair with, advise them to join the brightest group.
Mix-Freeze-Pair
OUTCOME
Energize and regroup
PROCESS
•	
Instruct members to stand and move around the room.
•	
At a signal, freeze and pair with the nearest person.
•	
Sit together and respond to a prompt.
Pairs Squared
OUTCOME
Create quartet-working groups
PROCESS
•	
Instruct current pairs to join another pair, sit together and respond to a prompt.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
215
Stack and Pack
OUTCOMES
Alert members that a transition is coming in which they will be moving their materials to work in 
a seat different from the one in which they are now seated.
PROCESS
•	
Display a stack and pack slide.
•	
Initially, explain that this slide indicates a transition is about to occur in which members will 
bundle their materials in readiness to sit with new partners.
Facilitator Strategies
Purposes and intentions are shown for each strategy. These are the rationale a facilitator would have 
for using the strategy.
Analogy Prompts
Activate Ideas Corresponding to a Challenge
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Access and transfer concepts to a current situation.
PROCESS
•	
Pose prompts as analogies such as:
∘∘
How do runners manage to have a speed-up kick left for the finish?
∘∘
How did the stagecoaches of the American West manage to race across great distances in 
just a few days?
∘∘
How do the answers to the above relate to a challenge faced by the group?
EXAMPLE
•	
Making the observation that stagecoaches changed horses frequently, might lead to the idea of 
rotating and delegating school improvement tasks.
Banned Words
Inclusion
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Evoke humor, playfulness, and efficacy in reluctant or discouraged group.
PROCESS
•	
Table groups identify a few words they would like banned from this session.
•	
One or two words are heard from each group and charted.
•	
The group agrees to collectively groan whenever one of these words are heard.
•	
The group practices the groan.

The Adaptive School
216
TIPS
•	
Explain that sometimes words are overworked in organizations. This will give participants an 
opportunity to be free from them during this session.
•	
Periodically use one of the banned words to playfully stimulate a response.
Choreograph an Opening (Kendall Zoller)
Activate and Engage
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Acknowledge resistance
Members free themselves from a resistant state of mind
PROCESS
Verbal
Nonverbal
Thank you for coming
Eye contact with group.
Mix credible and approachable voice with an 
open, palms up gesture.
As if you had a choice
Pause with the hands vertical. Stand still and 
wait for a laugh.
On the agenda are four topics
Look and gesture toward the agenda. Use a 
credible voice and pause after each topic. After 
the last statement, turn to the group, stand still 
and count internally 3,2, 1.  
I imagine a number of you would rather be 
prepping your classrooms today and are 
disappointed that this has turned out to be 
a work day instead of a classroom day as 
promised.
Without talking, walk a few feet from the easel.
There is good reason to want to be in 
classrooms, it is where our passion lies, 
directly supporting students.
Gesture outside toward the classrooms. Pause 
periodically. Use a credible voice. At the end, 
stand still, pause, and silently count 2, 3, 1. 
Then move halfway back to the easel.
As you know, there is the passionate part you 
have for your students’ well being. At the same 
time you may be wondering what information 
I could get here that would even increase the 
value of my support.
How long might you be willing to listen to 
determine if the information is useful? What 
might it take to see how useful the information
might be?
Approachable voice. With palm up gesturing, 
use inclusive language. (our).
Take a few steps toward the front center of  
the group.
Approachable voice.
Gestures of inclusion, palms up. Use 
downward beat gestures to accompany 
the words of your message like a maestro 
directing an orchestra. (passionate – part – of 
you – students).
Pause, stand still, and silently count 3-2-1 . . .
And out first agenda item is -
Turn and walk toward easel, point to first 
agenda item using a new voice pattern, state 
the first agenda item.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
217
VARIATIONS
•	
Select phrasing that might most accurately describe the group. All of us (you), some of, parts 
of, a few of…
TIPS
•	
Prepare by listing what you surmise about the group. What do you believe are the emotions 
they are feeling, the reasons for the emotions and what the group values. 
Diversity Rounds
Inclusion
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Seek and identify likenesses in others, understand sameness and differences within group, and 
relate personal experience to topic.
PROCESS
•	
Indicate directions will be purposively vague so members can decide which subgroup they will 
report to.
•	
The facilitator chooses categories that fit the group’s purpose going from lesser to greater 
levels of sensitivity. Examples: birth order, decade of birth, gender, cognitive style, time in the 
organization, ethnicity.
•	
As each category is named stand and search for three or four people that fit criteria.
•	
How has this identity criteria shaped or influenced you as a professional?
•	
Eight to ten minutes.
•	
Hear reports from group.
•	
The facilitator names a new category and the pattern is repeated three or four times.
•	
Next, members write responses to prompts such as: “What I am noticing about myself, the 
group, and the effect of being in various subgroups”; “How I feel about the various subgroups 
that I selected; and what might we do to maximize the attributes of the various subgroups.”
•	
Responses are shared in heterogeneous groups.
•	
Each group develops a summary paraphrase of their findings and recommendations.
ALTERNATIVES
•	
Instead of journal entries, small groups might converse about their responses to the prompts.
TIPS
•	
Best for a group of at least twenty people. If group becomes too large, divide into smaller 
subgroups.
First Job
Inclusion
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Level the social perceptions of group members to similar youth-related experiences.

The Adaptive School
218
PROCESS
•	
In round-robin style, each person reveals his or her first paid job. Responses might include jobs 
like babysitting, shucking corn, and picking fruit.
Four Box Synectics
Activate and Engage
PURPOSES AND INTENTIONS
Evoke energy, creativity, and humor related to new topic.
PROCESS
•	
On chart paper, draw a 2 × 2 box. Post.
•	
A recorder at each table group draws a similar box to collect table group’s thinking.
•	
Elicit recommendations for an object or concept to place in each of the boxes. Suggest each 
time that the next recommendation be as different as possible from the previous recommenda-
tion (Ex: lamppost, sailboat, hammer, daisy or shopping, sailing, cleaning, fishing).
•	
Instruct table groups to brainstorm three or four responses for each box to the prompt you 
provide. (Ex: “Professional communities are like a lamppost because_____________.” “Pro-
fessional communities are like a sailboat because_____________.”)
•	
Give groups two minutes to select their best items and a spokesperson.
•	
Elicit responses from table groups using the full phrase: “A professional community is like a 
lamppost because__________.”
VARIATIONS
•	
People synectics. Provide each table group with three to five postcards that have images of 
famous persons. Ensure that postcards represent diversity.
•	
Direct table groups to talk about what they know about each person on the cards.
•	
Have table groups select one card and complete the phrase: (name the person) is like (the topic 
you are working on) because__________.
•	
Complete the phrase: (name the person) is NOT like (the topic you are working on) be-
cause__________.
•	
Synectic questions can be posed. “What game are you playing in this organization?” Responses 
carry insights and humor, as, “We are playing badminton in a hurricane.”
TIPS
•	
Explain that “Synectics” is derived from two Greek roots: syn (bringing together) and ectics 
(diverse elements). This activity draws from the metaphoric brain which holds information 
holistically.
Give One to Get One
Activate and Engage
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Generate energy, community building by interacting with others, and generate information 
about the new topic.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
219
PROCESS
•	
Individuals write data on 3 × 5 card. (Ex: name, role, agency, time I spend doing ____________, 
a trick of the trade about ____________, a technique that works for me during ____________.)
•	
Members move about room and share the information on their card with another person. 
Members paraphrase and inquire so they can, in a moment, share their partner’s card and in-
formation with another person.
•	
At signal, members trade cards.
•	
Members then locate a new partner and share the new card and information they just acquired 
with their new partner.
•	
At a signal, return to table groups. Share what you learned.
•	
As a group, identify what patterns or themes you detected.
VARIATIONS
•	
Go a third round.
•	
Provide a template for the sharing of patterns. “There were three themes here, ____________, 
____________, and ____________.
•	
Use to activate concepts such as, “A belief I have about adult learners is. . . .”
Greeting Circle
Inclusion
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Access affective states and establish a sense of group and self within group.
PROCESS
•	
Form a circle.
•	
The facilitator (or designated person) moves inside the circle and greets the person to his or 
her left.
•	
They continue inside the circle greeting each person in turn.
•	
Those who have been greeted follow the person who greeted them inside the circle.
•	
When the facilitator returns to his or her original location, those inside the circle continue to 
greet them, a second time.
•	
This time, the person inside the circle is the greeter, not the greeted. This balances the circle.
•	
When the greeting is complete, ask two questions. (1) How do you feel about the activity? (2) 
What did you learn from it that will make you successful?
VARIATIONS
•	
Moving right around the circle.
TIPS
•	
No ritual is older, and none more anxiety-ridden, than that of greeting each other. The natural 
tendency is to seek out those one is comfortable with, those who are like them.

The Adaptive School
220
•	
The greeting circle allows the anxiety and apprehension of the individuals to be encountered. 
It releases energy into the room in the sound of high voices, and laughter.
•	
The emotional material must be expressed first to allow learning to take place. It grounds the 
person in the moment and allows people to be real.
•	
Useful as a grounding for sessions on conflict, hard-to-talk about topics and, or when, two or 
more groups are brought together for difficult conversations.
Group Groan
Inclusion
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Through humor, induce ownership and responsibility for personal reactions in the session.
PROCESS
•	
Table groups list what are the best and worst things that can happen in this session.
•	
Hear a few and record them on flip charts.
•	
Make an agreement that should any of the worst things occur, all will participate in a group 
groan.
•	
Practice the groan once.
VARIATIONS
•	
Give think time before receiving items.
•	
With groups of twelve or less, elicit both best and worst from the full group. Record in two 
columns.
Grounding
Inclusion
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Activate internal resources for addressing sensitive topics with respect and skill.
PROCESS
•	
Form groups of four, six, or eight.
•	
Explain that the purpose for this activity is to set a norm for respectful listening, to get every-
one’s voice in the room in a manner that is nonconfrontational, to allow people to connect with 
one another, to allow for the expressions of hopes and apprehensions, to value thinking and 
feeling, and to surface agendas that might not otherwise be heard.
•	
Explain the procedure:
∘∘
Members take turns talking.
∘∘
When one member talks, all others are silent.
∘∘
Full non-verbal attention is given to the speaker.
∘∘
After everyone has talked, the first speaker will summarize what was said.
∘∘
When the members indicate that they understand the process, the facilitator names the first 
speaker. Alert in advance.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
221
•	
Post on a flip chart what members are to talk about:
∘∘
My name is . . .
∘∘
My relationship to this topic is . . .
∘∘
My expectations are . . .
∘∘
How I feel about being here is . . .
•	
When all groups are finished, the facilitator calls on the first person in each group to give a 
summary statement to the full assembly.
VARIATIONS
•	
Another prompt might be: What is the commitment that brought you into this room?
•	
With twelve members, the grounding can be done with the full group.
TIPS
•	
Since this activity’s primary purpose is to provide participants’ with an opportunity to be heard, 
this activity operates on earth time, not clock time.
•	
Use when a meeting is going to address hard-to-talk-about topics. The harder the topic is to talk 
about, the more valuable the full group grounding is.
•	
With a group size of forty to fifty people, this activity might take as much as forty-five minutes.
Hopes and Fears
Inclusion
PURPOSE AND INTENTION
Establish common ground and normalize member’s reaction to setting or topic.
PROCESS
•	
Briefly write your fears and hopes about this session or topic.
•	
Pairs share their greatest fear and greatest hope.
•	
Quartets meet (pairs squared) and identify themes in fears and hopes. 
•	
Report themes to full group.
•	
Facilitator makes comments to normalize fears and identify common hopes.
VARIATIONS
•	
Pairs report all fears and hopes.
•	
Conduct process as full group with facilitator eliciting and charting.
TIPS
•	
With either alternative, start with private reflection.
I’m In
Inclusion
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Facilitate mental and emotional transition from outside the meeting to being present in the 
meeting.

The Adaptive School
222
PROCESS
•	
Members go around the circle briefly naming anything on their mind. (Examples: “I’m con-
cerned about my eighth grader. She says she doesn’t have any friends. I know she is just down 
and does have friends. I’m figuring out how to handle this. OK. I’m in.” or “I’ve never had 
a third grade class so excited about creative writing. Their enthusiasm lifts me up every day. 
OK. I’m in.”)
•	
Stress that there is no side talk.
•	
At the end, make a summary paraphrase.
VARIATIONS
•	
Be the first speaker to model brevity.
TIPS
•	
Stop anyone who interrupts a speaker.
•	
Should someone ask to pass, that is OK, though we suggest not offering that as an option as 
you set up the activity.
Knots (Bob Chadwick)
Inclusion
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Leaving the familiarity of words, kinesthetically forming a working group. Evoke humor and 
energy.
PROCESS
•	
Form groups of eight. Form a circle.
•	
Everyone places left hand in circle and grasps the hand of ONE other person whose hand is 
in the circle.
•	
Now place right hands in circle and grasp the hand of ONE other person whose hand is in the 
circle.
•	
Everyone now should be holding the hands of two other people.
•	
Without letting go of the grips, untangle the human knot.
VARIATIONS
•	
Place the right hand in first.
TIPS
•	
Groups of six to eight are ideal. Ten are possible. Twelve are too many.
Know, Think You Know, Want to Know
Activate and Engage
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Engage constructivist-learning experience working with a fresh topic.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
223
PROCESS
•	
Label chart paper with three columns: Know; Think You Know, Want to Know.
•	
Give topic to groups and have them complete the charts.
•	
Post charts and have group look for patterns and themes.
VARIATIONS
•	
Facilitator responds to the Want to Know columns by providing responses to the large group.
TIPS
•	
If groups disagree on the “Know” column, encourage them to place content in the “Think You 
Know” column.
Like Me
Inclusion
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Recognize sense of self within community.
PROCESS
•	
Participants move chairs back from tables so it will be easy to stand if appropriate.
•	
Name categories like “my work is done at the elementary level, high school, middle school 
central office,” or “ I have been in this district five or more years, ten, twenty, thirty, more,” or 
“ I am a teacher, principal, consultant, etc.” or I am typically up before 6:00 a.m.”
•	
As people stand, remind them to look around and see who else is also in that group.
•	
Finally ask the question “other” regarding roles. In other words if your role has not been called, 
please stand. The facilitator asks standing members to state their roles.
VARIATIONS
•	
For parent groups change the prompts. My first child in this school, I attended this school, I 
speak a language other than English, etc.
TIPS
•	
Because this strategy is done as an inclusion activity when you do not yet have relationship 
with the group, it is important to state the multiple purposes of inclusion activities like this: 
They include setting norms of participation, focusing mental energy inside the room, answer-
ing the question who am I in relation to others in the room and beginning the journey from an 
aggregate of individuals to a group.
•	
The category “other” is essential. People feel left out if their role is not acknowledged.
•	
DO NOT ask participants to say “like me” when they stand. Perhaps appropriate for elementary 
children, it is embarrassing for adults.
Line-ups
OUTCOMES
Energize, regroup participants, and sometimes learn about each other.

The Adaptive School
224
PROCESSES
•	
Announce that the purpose is to regroup and energize.
•	
Designate a space in the room for members with low responses to stand and members with 
high responses to stand. Others will form a line representing their response in relationship to 
those two points.
•	
Provide a topic [e.g., how hot people like their salsa, birthdates (not year), alphabetically by 
desired profession or other topics.]
•	
Sample responses from different parts of the line-up.
•	
Cluster people into working groups by counting off, or moving along the line by threes, fours, 
or whatever group size desired.
VARIATIONS
•	
Have one-half of the line step forward. They walk toward the other half forming a double line 
with people facing each other. Facing members become partners for the next activity.
TIPS
•	
Structure line-ups around the perimeter of the room for the best use of space.
•	
Choose topic based on group’s knowledge of each other; intact groups might be more interested 
in alternative professions than groups who do not know each other.
My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean
Activate and Engage
PURPOSE AND INTENTNIONS
Recover energy as it begins to wane.
PROCESS
•	
Describe the purpose of this activity is to promote energy for the next portion of the meeting.
•	
Lead the group in singing “My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean.” When the letter “B” is used in 
the song stand if you have been seated, and sit if you have been standing.
TIPS
•	
Advise members to take care of any physical needs during the activity. Protect knees, back.
Pair-Share
Activate and Engage
PURPOSE AND INTENTION
Quickly energize a group to stimulate engagement on a topic. Facilitators use this to energize, 
activate, and engage or to give self-recovery time when stumped.
PROCESS
•	
Assign pairs.
•	
Direct them to “Talk with the person next to you for three minutes about_________.”

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
225
VARIATIONS
•	
Have members work with the “person behind them” for novelty and added energy.
•	
Use trios.
Paired Verbal Fluency (see also Generate Ideas)
Activate and Engage
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Recall prior knowledge.
PROCESS
•	
Form pairs.
•	
Describe the process:
∘∘
A and B will take turns responding to a prompt.
∘∘
At a signal one will speak and one will listen.
∘∘
At a signal the other will speak while the first speaker listens.
∘∘
Each time, no one is allowed to repeat anything that was said by the other.
∘∘
Check for clarification.
•	
Repeat the cycle two or three times. For activating prior knowledge:
∘∘
First round twenty seconds each.
∘∘
Second round forty seconds each.
∘∘
Third round sixty seconds each.
•	
For organizing and integrating:
∘∘
First round sixty seconds each.
∘∘
Second round forty seconds each.
∘∘
Third round twenty seconds each.
VARIATIONS
•	
Gauge the time allotted for the second and third round by the level of participant engagement. 
The purpose for the declining amounts of time is to focus thinking. The purpose of the increas-
ing amounts of time is to broaden thinking.
TIPS
•	
Announce the time allotted for rounds only after the exercise is completed so participants can 
apply this strategy elsewhere without knowing the structure until experiencing it.
People, Places, Things Cards (PPT Cards)
Activate and Engage
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Provide a variation of an A/E activity through attention to third point objects.
PROCESS
•	
Place cards on each table. These may be postcards of famous people, pictures of places or 
things cut out from magazines.

The Adaptive School
226
•	
Ask table groups to engage in a question regarding the cards. (See variations below.)
•	
Share with large group.
VARIATIONS
•	
Put enough People, Thing, or Place Cards on a table so that each person can chose one. Ask a 
processing question (e.g., “Which picture best describes where you are in your journey right 
now?”). Ask each person to share their response with their table.
•	
Put one Person Card on each table and ask table to fill in the blanks with a stem. (E.g., _______ 
is like a facilitator because: _________ ; _____________ is not like a facilitator because 
_____________.) Each table shares with large group.
•	
Use Thing Cards for a Visual Synectics.
TIPS
•	
Be sure People Cards represent diversity.
People Search
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Information Processing: Activating and Engaging/Organizing and Integrating.
PROCESS
•	
Construct a handout listing content information being learned (e.g., can name seven norms of 
collaboration) or ways in which participants might have applied content (e.g., used a norm in 
a meeting) or interesting information about participants (e.g., drives a sports car). Provide a 
space by each item for a name to be recorded.
•	
Ask participants to stand and find one person who can respond positively to an item on the 
page. The participant places the person’s name beside the item, thanks the person, and then 
finds another person who can respond to another item.
•	
Continue until time is called, filling blanks with different names.
VARIATIONS
•	
Provide a prompt with each item so that participants engage in a brief conversation about the 
effect of that item.
TIPS
•	
Be sure participants understand that they must ask each other questions; they cannot just hand 
their sheet to a person and ask them to sign one of the lines.
•	
Use information about participants to help people get to know each other.
•	
Use content information to connect people to their learning.
Propose Working Agreements
Activate and Engage
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
For one-time, short, or initial meetings agree to selected working agreements.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 
PROCESS 
Display and describe posted Working Agreements as shown below. 
Describe Sufficient Consensus and its benefits as shown in this appendix. 
Ask if members can agree to these during this meeting. 
ALTERNATIVES 
Eliminate sufficient consensus. 
Have the group develop meeting Working Agreements. 
ApPENDIX A 
Once a group has agreed to these Working Agreements, print them on each succeeding agenda. 
TIPS 
Working agreements are not always needed or wise as they might signal negative presupposi­
tions about a group's working capacity. 
When time is short and the meeting routine, this process can respectfully set agreements. 
Group-developed agreements may be useful when little working experience or trust exists.

Meeting Working Agreements 
Demonstrate Mutual Respect (Respect people and ideas - such respect does not represent 
agreement) 
Employ Skillful Listening (seek first to understand, then to be understood) 
Sufficient Consensus (each person has equal voice, the group works to understand all views, 
distinguish between dialogue and discussion and 75% agreement of those present constitute 
consensus) 
Strategies in this section are conversation containers. They support learning in that learning 
takes place only when processed by learners. They are valuable because they provide structures 
for talking about information making it more likely that conversations are efficient, focused, and 
safely allow full participation. They are designed to draw meaning from text or other sources, 
analyze, infer, develop hypotheses, extend ideas, relate content to selves, entertain questions, or 
reconsider and tentatively refine new ways of understanding. Because members come to a group 
with multiple cognitive styles and various levels of social skills and interests, strategies that 
name specific ways of talking and the cognitive processes to be used bring these diverse styles 
of individuals to common working focus.

Strategies in the previous section (Activate and Engage) are used either as inclusion activities 
or to trigger member’s knowledge before participating in new learning. The current collection pro-
vides the two final phases in Lipton and Wellman’s (1998) learning model in that learners process 
the data in a variety of ways to make it their own. These strategies accommodate two types of 
learning: explore and discover, and organize and integrate.
“Explore and Discover” is used when new content is introduced and must be processed by 
learners. Content may be provided in a variety of ways—paired reading activities, lecturette, case 
study, demonstration, inventories, and more. For learners to explore the new content—related to 
what they have previously activated—they must use skills of cognitive processing. How much and 
what kind of processing leads to a perennial facilitator dilemma in which time, outcomes, group 
energy, and group skills are criteria for decisions. Learning with the “Key Concepts/Key Ideas” 
strategy, for example, requires each partner to identity and reflect upon the most important parts of 
a text they have both read. This strategy is relatively brief, loosely structured, and uses cognitive 
skills well within the range of each participant.
Finally, in the third phase of the Lipton and Wellman model, participants organize and integrate 
their learning to make it uniquely their own. Developing personal organizational schemas to show 
the relationships of concepts is the work of the group member. Members catalogue and index new 
understandings; develop frameworks and models; or synthesize and represent learning. Synthesis 
and evaluative thought are called for. It is this stage, in fact, in which members crystallize meaning 
for themselves. 
Skilled facilitators use several criteria to select strategies with tight structures. Either emotion 
about the topic is high, the group is unskilled in group processes, the topic is complex or the group’s 
composition includes a range of roles and the voices of the less senior need to be protected. Avail-
able time and group size are other considerations. Facilitators working with intact groups support 
groups in becoming familiar with a few of these strategies before adding more.
3-2-1 Plus 1
Explore and Discover
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Recall and explain previous learning or what occurred at a recent event.
PROCESS
•	
Members draw a right-hand margin on a piece of paper. Label the margin “Plus 1.”
•	
Individuals in groups of three or four write three key ideas they remember from the last meet-
ing, two things they want to explore, and one point to ponder.
•	
Next, round-robin sharing of one idea from each category. As members share, listeners may 
record personal notes in the right-hand margin.
•	
Plus 1 refers to notes members take as they listen to others.
VARIATIONS
•	
Start the sharing at the second item (Two things to explore) as more value probably comes from 
the second two categories.
•	
Process the activity with the full group.

PROCESSES
•	
Members identify five words that represent today’s learning.
•	
Share the ideas, one at a time, in round-robin fashion. Explore the ideas as they emerge.
•	
Select three central ideas.
•	
If these three ideas were to go into a container with a label, what would that label be?
ALTERNATIVES
•	
Use for what you want to remember from today’s meeting or accomplishments.
•	
See “Most Important Point,” “Scrambled Sentences,” or “Three Balloons” in this collection.
TIPS
•	
Foreshadow several steps, but do not tell name of strategy.
•	
Use as follow-up to instruction.
•	
Vary the prompts.
TIPS
•	
Assign time, perhaps twelve minutes, so the group stays focused and brief.
A B Each Teach
Explore and Discover
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Explain content from text or other input.
PROCESS
•	
Pairs designate one partner as “A” and one as “B.”
•	
Person “A” reads one section of text.
•	
Person “B” reads another section of text.
•	
When both are ready, they “teach” their section to their partner.
VARIATIONS
•	
Pairs conclude by developing a summary of the text essence.
•	
Pairs join another pair and develop a summary.

The Adaptive School
230
TIPS
•	
If energy is needed, create pairs through use of learning partners, eye contact partners, shoe 
partners, or any device that will get people to move about the room.
Expert Jigsaw
Explore and Discover
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Interdependently acquire, summarize, and communicate information.
PROCESS
•	
Cluster members into home groups of five (if five topics are to be studied) and number off one 
to five. Each number is assigned a reading.
•	
Have all the number ones, two, threes, etc., move into expert groups of like numbers.
•	
Provide questions to expert groups to help them process information.
•	
In the expert groups, members read the material, report on the questions, then converse about 
its meaning.
•	
Members determine what ideas they will share and how they will share the ideas in their home 
groups.
•	
Return to home groups and share what has been learned in the expert groups.
VARIATIONS
•	
Expert groups develop an image or perform a skit to convey information.
TIPS
•	
While there is value in member choice, assigning topics takes less time than allowing members 
to choose their own topics.
Key Concepts/Key Ideas
Explore and Discover
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Select and interpret information and relate to member’s experience.
PROCESS
•	
Organize members into pairs.
•	
Assign a reading.
•	
Individuals read text, marking key concepts and ideas.
•	
When both have finished reading, take turns sharing and exploring concepts/ideas marked by 
each partner.
VARIATIONS
•	
Assign the reading in sections. After each section, share concepts and ideas.
•	
See the “Say Something Strategy.”

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
231
TIPS
•	
As with all text-based learning, remind members that a key value of this strategy is the different 
experiences and perspectives each member brings to the topic.

Partners Report 
Explore and Discover
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Synthesize constructed meaning.
PROCESS
•	
Partners engage in conversation knowing they may be asked to report their partner’s ideas.
•	
Provide two minutes for each to be sure they can paraphrase their partner correctly.
•	
Ask for a volunteer to share.
•	
Repeat the pattern as time permits.
VARIATIONS
•	
To increase energy, partner people from different locations and have them stand throughout 
this exercise.
TIPS
•	
It is not necessary for both partners to share. One speaker does not obligate the other.
•	
When possible, sequentially call on persons from different quarters of the room because this 
causes listeners to adjust body positions to hear, thus maintaining energy.

PROCESS
•	
With a partner, review and clarify a list of strategies so you can explain them.
•	
Select two to three strategies and develop applications for your work.
VARIATIONS
•	
Assign task to an affinity group members that work together.
TIPS
•	
When triple-track presenting is used, strategies will be recorded on flip charts as they are used.
•	
Few learners apply without specific tasks like this, which invite application thinking.
Text Rendering 
Explore and Discover
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Select, interpret, explain, and synthesize.

The Adaptive School
234
PROCESS
•	
Members review a document and highlight a sentence, a phrase, and a word that are meaningful.
•	
Provide strips of paper of varying lengths to accommodate a sentence, phrase, or word.
•	
Each member, in round-robin fashion, posts and explains his or her strips.
•	
Once all the strips are posted and explained, the group agrees on one sentence, one phrase, and 
one word that are most meaningful.
ALTERNATIVES
•	
Instead of sentence strips, have a facilitator guide a conversation as first a sentence is shared by 
each, then a phrase and a word. Record the phrase and word on chart paper. The group shares 
insights about the document.
•	
In either alternative use summarizing insights or selection of final sentence, phrase, and word.
TIPS
•	
When working with a large group, divide into clusters of about six, allowing the small groups 
to share results.

•	
Encourage A to choose one of the productive areas for inquiry such as: personal meaning, 
values, goals, consequences, examples, counter-examples, applications.
Two Sides of the Coin
Self–management
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Manage one’s inner states during discourse.
PROCESS
•	
Direct members to write one word on a 3 × 5 card indicating how they want to feel at the end 
of this meeting.
•	
Next, on the other side of the card, members write a short phrase or “self-talk” that they will 
use to guide their choices and attain their outcomes.
•	
In small groups and in round-robin fashion (one speaker at a time with no responses or com-
ments from others) members share side one of their cards.
•	
Next, in round-robin fashion (one speaker at a time with no responses or comments from oth-
ers) members share side two of their cards.
TIPS
•	
After about an hour, invite members to examine their cards and in small groups, report in 
round-robin fashion (one speaker at a time with no responses or comments from others) their 
goal, strategy and current progress.
•	
At the end of the day, members may, in small groups, reflect on their strategies, outcomes, and 
transferable learning.
Vocabulary Review 
Organize and Integrate
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Recall.
PROCESS
•	
Ask individuals to brainstorm and list words they’ve learned in the work so far. The words can 
be new or have new meanings as a result of their learning. The more words the better. Partici-
pants should try to think of words others might not remember.

The Adaptive School
236
•	
After a few minutes instruct participants to stand up, take their list and a pencil with them, and 
share their list with one other person.
•	
For every word that one person has on their list that the other does not, a point gets tallied. After 
sharing lists with one person, participants continue sharing until time is called.
•	
At the end of ten to fifteen minutes, participants sit down and tally their points.
•	
Share at the table and determine who at the table collected the most points. (Do not ask for a 
table total.)
•	
Survey the room by asking each table to identify the person with the most points.
•	
Acknowledge the highest point person and ask them to identify the words on their list that 
received the most points.
VARIATIONS
•	
Provide a small prize to the winner.
TIPS
•	
If more than one person in the room has close to the same number of points, acknowledge all 
of them.
•	
Be sure to emphasize that the brainstorm includes both new words and words that have new 
meanings.
What Comes Up 
Organize and Integrate
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Investigate, compare, and apply instructional concepts to student work.
PROCESS 
•	
Arrange six to twenty people seated in a circle with two or three pieces of recent student work.
•	
Presenter offers first piece of student work (read or posted or copies distributed). Participants 
review.
•	
Presenter asks, “What comes up for you when you examine this piece of work?” Provide a few 
moments think time.
•	
Each responds to the question in turn. No repeats.
•	
Open conversation in which members compare observations, relate elements of student work 
to local standards, hypothesize about student thinking, and generate teaching ideas.
•	
The process is repeated with a second piece of student work and perhaps a third.
•	
Close the conversation with a summary of new understandings or learnings.
TIPS
•	
Allow about thirty to forty-five minutes.

Generate Ideas in Large Groups
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
In large groups of sixty to two hundred, engage each member in generating ideas for decision 
making.
PROCESS
•	
Give a written task to individuals such as, name one area we could work on this year (two 
minutes).
•	
Pairs meet, share, and agree to one statement (six minutes).
•	
Each pair meets with two other pairs, shares and agrees to one statement (twelve minutes).
•	
Each group of six records their one idea on a sentence strip (eight to twelve words) and posts 
in the front of the room.
•	
The facilitator leads an inquiry session, in which members can ask questions for clarification. 
Authors of the item being questioned respond.
•	
Next the facilitator leads an advocacy session in which members advocate for items they feel 
are most important.
•	
Rank ideas by using the rule of one-third (see in this appendix) to determine the few items of 
greatest interest to the group.
•	
Name a subcommittee to gather data on these items and bring back information or recommen-
dations on which should be persued.
VARIATIONS
•	
Have pairs converse before either inquiry or advocacy.
TIPS 
•	
Individuals, not groups, should inquire, advocate, and rank.
•	
See the “Focusing Four Strategy” for details of this structure with smaller groups.

Around the Room and Back Again
Generate Ideas with Physical Activity
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Use novelty and physical activity to energize idea generation.
PROCESS
•	
Write one response only to a prompt.
•	
Next, without taking notes, move about the room and share your response, mentally catalogu-
ing the responses of others.
•	
When your head is full, or when signaled, return to your seat and list the responses you heard 
from others.
•	
Next, table groups pool responses.
TIPS
•	
Connect the prompt to something being studied (e.g., things that go wrong in meetings) and 
refer back to the pooled list during the presentation.
Brainstorm
Safely Generate Ideas
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Collective creativity without debate.
PROCESS
•	
Members call out ideas while a recorder charts them.
VARIATIONS
•	
Post topics or questions on charts.
•	
Cluster members into groups of three to five and have each group stand before a chart with a 
marker color that is different from other groups.
•	
Each group calls out ideas that are recorded on the charts.
•	
Each group moves clockwise to the next chart, reviews what the previous group(s) has written, 
and adds ideas with the color pen with which they first recorded.
•	
Members take a gallery walk to read all posted ideas.
HISTORY AND WARNING
•	
Brainstorming was invented in 1984 by Alex Osborne who theorized that a squad could gener-
ate more ideas than individuals by “storming” the objective without criticism of others’ ideas. 
More recent studies have found that free association activities without dissent lead to mostly 
predictable ideas and that imagination can be stimulated by conflict. A 2003 study by Nemeth 
at the University of California at Berkley found that teams encouraged to debate brainstormed 
ideas generated 20 percent more ideas than those that withheld criticism. This does not mean 
that traditional brainstorming processes should not be used. On the contrary, most people are 
more creative when working in teams. Familiar brainstorming processes provide voice, they 

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
239
start projects from members’ concerns and information, therefore representing a vital stage 
in collaborative work. See “Brainstorm and Critique” for a brainstorming format that safely 
includes criticism.
TIPS
•	
Stress that brainstorming means that there is no talking about the items, but rather the groups 
are to just list items. Even mature groups tend to forget this.
Brainstorm Modalities 
Safely Generate Ideas
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Collective creativity on a topic using modalities as a lens.
PROCESS
•	
Define the subject.
•	
Give everyone a minute or two to think.
•	
Invite members to call out ideas.
•	
A member records ideas on flip chart.
•	
Code the first ten ideas as either visual, auditory, or kinesthetic.
•	
Compute a ratio for each modality.
•	
Brainstorm again, focusing on the least represented modality.
VARIATIONS 
•	
Use paired conversations for think time.
•	
Have pairs or small groups brainstorm; code and brainstorm again instead of working as a full 
group.
TIPS
•	
Explain that considering the topic from the least used perspective will bring fresh ideas to the 
surface.
Brainstorm Questions
Safely Generate Ideas for Inquiry
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Develop lenses for inquiry.

•	
Have the work done in pairs or small groups.
•	
Precede the activity with dialogue.
TIPS
•	
Explain that generating questions can illuminate the group’s work.
Brainstorm and Critique 
Generate Ideas
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Enrich idea generation with psychologically safe critiques.
PROCESS
•	
Instruct the group of brainstorming research (see chapter 6 and “History and Warnings” under 
the brainstorm strategy). Brainstorming as commonly practiced has been found to be only par-
tially effective, asserts Paulus (2000). Researchers find that idea generation and idea quality 
increases when after traditional brainstorming, members individually study the list thinking of 
downsides or alternatives.
•	
Define the subject.
•	
Give everyone a minute or two to think.
•	
Brainstorm in which members call out ideas without commenting or questioning other items 
on the list.
•	
Provide time in which members silently critique items, and then share and discuss.
ALTERNATIVES 
•	
Instruct trios to offer critiques, downsides or counter arguments for as many ideas as possible 
within a time frame (twelve to fifteen minutes), report, and process by full groups.
•	
Arrange the recording sheets in such a way that small groups can move to the sheets and record 
their ideas.
•	
Use the rule of one-third to identify the top few ideas. Critique these.

Be prepared to share your statement with the large group.
VARIATIONS
•	
Groups of four, each person with own question.
•	
Have groups create a graphic to share with the large group, rather than a statement.
TIPS
•	
Provide recording page for each question, six spaces on each page.
•	
Make sure questions are open-ended and varied.
In and Out of the Frame
Generate Information Key to Planning or Problem Solving 
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Identify and explore frames of reference other groups and members of this group may be holding.
PROCESS
•	
Form groups of four to six persons.
•	
Stand before charts showing large rectangle.
•	
Group members brainstorm associations with the topic. Use only one pen color.
•	
Stop. Categorize the brainstormed items. Record categories in the top portion of chart.
•	
Assign each group another frame of reference as a lens, based on other perspectives that might 
need to be considered such as parents, students, community members, etc.
•	
With a new pen color, circle the ideas in the frame that this new group might have named had 
they been present.
•	
Below the frame add ideas this new group might have added.
•	
Reflect. Ask, “How might knowledge of these other perspectives influence planning and action 
on the topic under consideration?”
TIPS
•	
Use to plan new initiatives.
•	
Think about this framing map as a way of anticipating different perceptions and using knowl-
edge of those perceptions in communicating, planning, and action.

Pyramid
Find Common Elements in Member Thinking
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS 
Give individual input to develop group thinking.
PROCESS 
•	
Give a written task to individuals.
•	
Pairs meet and share common elements.
•	
Quartets meet and share common elements.
•	
Octets meet and share common elements with large group.
•	
The work of the octets can be charted for large group processing.
TIPS
•	
It is difficult for groups larger than eight to find common elements. If there is lack of consensus 
when charts are shared with the large group, time for dialogue should be scheduled.
Sensing Interviews 
Generate Information Key to Planning or Problem Solving
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Learn about the culture of a work group: its pride, perceived problems, and recommendations.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
243
PROCESS
•	
Arrange for thirty-minute confidential interviews with affected individuals.
•	
Advise that sources of information will remain confidential, but if the same idea is heard from 
three or more people it will be shared with the full group without identifying authors.
•	
Ask: “What are you feeling good about here? What problems exist? What recommendations 
do you have?”
•	
Organize the data and “publish” it with the full group. Display ideas on flip charts.
•	
Ask if you got the information right in order to start conversation about the data.
•	
Paraphrase and inquire as members offer “corrections” to the data. If appropriate, change the 
text on the flip charts.
VARIATIONS
•	
Publish the data in text for pairs to read and explore before full group conversation.
•	
Share the data with the leader; the leader shares the data and his or her analysis with the group.
•	
Facilitator might engage in “Public Coaching” with the leader.
TIPS
•	
Have small groups talk about the data if comments are not easily forthcoming; then engage the 
full group in conversation.
•	
Use when entering a new group as a leader or when problems exist within a group, but infor-
mation is not being shared about it.
Stem Completion
Explore and Discover
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Generate and report a group’s perceptions of itself.
PROCESS
•	
Members complete a thought from a prompt. For example: “I believe my culture affects my 
coworkers by . . .” or “In order to be more inclusive we should . . .”
•	
Pairs or small groups share and explore meanings from responses to the prompts.
•	
Small groups summarize and report.
VARIATIONS
•	
Change groups and share again.
TIPS
•	
Select stems that would be psychologically safe for members to talk about.

Ask for Sabotage Ideas
Test Commitments
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Achieve realistic commitments.
PROCESS
•	
Arrange group members around the perimeter of the room in groups of four.
•	
Number off one to four in each cluster.
•	
Clusters respond to prompt.
•	
At a signal, one member moves to the next cluster to bring information from the home group 
and learn information from the new group.
•	
Repeat the pattern with new prompts for the new group.
VARIATIONS 
•	
Conduct the strategy with clusters seated at tables instead of standing.
•	
Can also be used to review learned material—prompts would include recall, apply, and assess 
questions.
TIPS
•	
Draw from a deck of playing cards to randomly select the next person in each group to move.
•	
Benefits wane after three or four rounds.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
245
PROCESS
•	
State the agreement the group has made.
•	
Say, “I know none of you would ever deliberately sabotage this agreement, but if you were to, 
under what conditions might you make that choice?”
VARIATIONS
•	
Ask pairs or small groups to talk about this question.
TIPS
•	
Brings to the surface hidden reservations or unconsciously held conditions under which mem-
bers would not keep an agreement.
•	
This data provides an opportunity to clarify misunderstandings, develop ideas to overcome 
perceived obstacles, or reshape the decision.
Assumptions Inquiry
Test Ideas for Workability 
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Push beyond first easy and simple solutions.
PROCESS
•	
Participants set aside two to four “good ideas” from a generated list.
•	
Each idea is explored for conditions in which the idea would be productive and conditions in 
which it would be counterproductive.
•	
Discuss how good ideas are rarely rules, but instead represent principles.
VARIATIONS
•	
Use the process above to select ideas that address the needs of the group.
TIPS
•	
Especially when the group has generated the idea list, stress that this is not a right or wrong 
conversation.
Assumptions Wall
Locate Assumptions Sources
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Understand own and others’ assumptions on a topic.
PROCESS
•	
Individuals list assumptions about a topic.
•	
Have participants choose one that most informs their behavior.
•	
Participants write their choice on sentence strip in eight to twelve words.
•	
Post assumptions on wall.

The Adaptive School
246
•	
Facilitator models inquiry (approachable voice, plurals, invitational stems, and positive pre-
suppositions) and inquiry categories (importance, under what conditions, source, data, beliefs, 
values). For example: “I’m curious about that assumption. Whose is it? Help me understand 
what may be some reasons you value that highly.”
•	
Individuals inquire about posted assumptions in round-robin fashion.
VARITIONS
•	
The group lists assumptions related to a topic. One to three assumptions are selected. The group 
makes inquiries about these assumptions. The group then identifies implications of the selected 
assumptions.
TIPS
•	
Use groups of four to six.
•	
Caution the group not to beat to death the first assumption explored.
•	
Model approachable voice.
•	
Intervene and correct whenever the inquiry begins to sound like interrogation and disbelief.
Card Stack and Shuffle
Clarify and Understand Members’ Thinking
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Identify implications of assumptions.
PROCESS
•	
Participants complete two stems, such as “Good student writers . . .” and “Good teachers of 
writing . . .”
•	
Each response is written on a separate 3 × 5 card.
•	
Table groups, stack cards, and shuffle them. Pass them to the table on your right.
•	
Person “A” selects a card and reads it to the group.
•	
Members identify possible assumptions related to the response on the card.
•	
Group members then explore the implications of those assumptions.
•	
Repeat the pattern with “B,” “C,” and “D” drawing cards in turn.
VARIATIONS
•	
Use only one stem.
•	
Preface this activity with instruction about assumptions and implications.
TIPS
•	
Demonstrate drawing a card and eliciting assumptions.
•	
Demonstrate exploring implications of one of those assumptions.
•	
Encourage paraphrasing and inquiring.
•	
This can be a scaffold for dialogue.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves

Causal Loop Diagram
Recognize that the Way a Problem Is Defined Can Be the Source of the Problem
PURPOSES AND INTENTIONS
Examine underlying values, beliefs, and goals when repeated attempts at resolution are unsuc-
cessful.
PROCESS
•	
Advise members that:
∘∘
In single-loop learning groups modify their actions according to the difference between 
expected and obtained outcomes.
∘∘
In double_loop learning groups question the values, assumptions, and policies that led to 
the actions in the first place.
•	
Identify and list the intended and unintended results of an action.
•	
Identify and list the mismatches between intentions and outcome.
•	
Through dialogue, question ways in which the framing of the problem, assumptions, values, 
and policies might have affected the outcome.
TIPS
•	
This can be an appropriate time to talk about other language forms such as using “and” instead 
of “but” when responding to a previous speaker. “But” conveys the message that the previous 
speaker was wrong.
Corners
Reveal Preferences
PURPOSES AND INTENTIONS
Identify, make public, and process members’ preferences.
PROCESS
•	
Post labels in corners of room.
•	
Participants move to corner of greatest interest.
•	
Form clusters of two or three. Ask participants to explore and share their reasoning for select-
ing this topic.

The Adaptive School
248
VARIATIONS 
•	
Can also use three or five “corners/locations” instead of four.
•	
After a period of time, instruct people to move to the corner of their second choice and repeat 
the sharing in clusters of two or three.
•	
Ask people to stand in the corner that represents their position on an issue.
TIPS
•	
Learning is enhanced when participants identify interests within a topic.
ALTERNATIVES
•	
Use corners to represent different levels of agreement with a proposal.
Delve and Dialogue
Text-based Learning
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Deepen understanding of concepts and others through a structured dialogue.
PROCESS
•	
Read a selection of text and make connections to some aspect of your work.
•	
In groups, share some of your connections.
•	
Honor the spirit of inquiry with pausing, paraphrasing, and posing questions.
VARIATIONS
•	
Assign this to trios instead of a group.
TIPS
•	
Review principles of dialogue prior to starting this process.
•	
Because speaking, not listening, is a common default pattern, you may want to periodically 
stop the action and ask people to notice what is happening in the conversation, or engage them 
in the Round Robin Reflection described in this appendix.
Energy Sources Team Survey 
Self-assessment
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Self-monitor and self-modify five group energy sources.
PROCESS
•	
Team members individually respond to questions about their team.
•	
Tabulate scores for each Energy Source for each person.
•	
Use the data to dialogue about its meaning.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
249
VARIATIONS
•	
Use either an electronic version or paper version.
•	
It may be useful to calculate a mean, median, and mode.
•	
Use the instrument in a prescriptive manner to determine what actions might be taken to in-
crease certain Energy Sources in the group.
TIPS
•	
Emphasize the data is non-evaluative and serves as baseline impressions.
•	
Use the data to dialogue about its meaning.
•	
Consider the strengths of the group as well as discrepancies.
•	
It is particularly useful to do item analysis.
•	
When items are considered, they become sources of understanding for goal setting.
•	
Copies and scoring can be purchased at www.thinkingcollaborative.com.
First Turn/Last Turn
Dialogue Scaffold
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
This scaffold for dialogue enlists many cognitive and affective skills necessary for dialogue. 
This activity requires cognitive, emotional, and social skills including turn-taking, self-manage-
ment, comprehension, interpretation, application, relating, integrating, metacognition, and appre-
ciation of others.
PROCESS
•	
Form groups of four to eight.
•	
Silently and simultaneously, members read a section of text and highlight three to four items 
that have particular meaning for them.
•	
Facilitator names a person to start in each group.
•	
In turn, members share one of their items but do not comment on it. They simply name it.
•	
In round-robin fashion, group members comment about the identified item WITH NO CROSS 
TALK.
•	
The initial person who named the item now shares his or her thinking about the item, and 
therefore, gets the “last turn.”
•	
Repeat the pattern around the table.
VARIATIONS 
•	
When possible, have members read the text before coming to the meeting. When they have 
read prior to the meeting, allow three to four minutes for them to “review” what they marked. 
This can save face for those who forgot to read.
•	
Reading sources can include journal articles, policy statements, mission statements, a sample 
of student work, or original writing by members on a common topic.

The Adaptive School
250
TIPS
•	
Select the first speaker geographically (e.g., the person sitting with their back most directly 
against that wall). Selection that is both structured and random can interrupt problematic pat-
terns that occur in group dynamics, such as having one person always be the first responder.
•	
Stress that there is no cross talk. Explain that when cross talk occurs, it takes the focus off the 
speaker, changes the topic, diminishes the speaker’s influence, and interferes with listening.
•	
Explain that structured dialogue allows members to develop the emotional skills and values 
needed for high-quality dialogue. This experiential learning will serve as a scaffold as partic-
ipants learn to dialogue.
•	
Monitor and intervene when cross talk occurs as groups begin.
•	
Groups of six are ideal, sometimes four as a first experience.
Here’s What, So What, Now What
Data Analysis
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Move beyond data to implications.
PROCESS
•	
Distribute a three-column worksheet.
•	
Explain the purpose of each column: Here’s What Is for specific data the group is working 
with; So What Is for an interpretation or meaning of the data; Now What can be a predication, 
implication or question for further study.
VARIATIONS
•	
Structure the task to provide skills practice in paraphrasing and posing questions.
TIPS
•	
Provide an example and elaborate a response for each column.
•	
Provide specific Here’s What data such as “60 percent of female students scored X while 40 
percent of male students scored Y,” or have groups generate their own data for this column.
•	
In pairs or in small groups, members complete the Now What and So What columns.
•	
Conduct a full group dialogue.
Inside Outside Circle (Spenser Kagan) 
Explore and Extend Ideas
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
In the spirit of dialogue, small groups augment concepts.
PROCESS
•	
Form inner circle facing outward and outer circle facing inward with one-to-one correspon-
dence.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
251
•	
Provide a prompt such as “Students in grade six should be able to . . .” or “We could enhance 
student’s sense of belonging by . . .”
•	
Inner circle persons generate a response.
•	
Outer circle persons paraphrase and extend the idea.
•	
Outer circle people rotate clockwise three or four persons.
•	
Outer circle people respond to the same prompt, while the inner circle paraphrases and extends.
•	
Repeat the pattern with another prompt, if desired.
•	
Have members be seated and respond to the prompt “We are learning . . .”
VARIATIONS
•	
If space does not permit one large set of circles, run activity in more than one circle.
•	
Use to review or refine other skills such as pausing or posing questions to specify thinking.
•	
Use as a preface to extended dialogue.
TIPS
•	
Demonstrate the double circle configuration with eight participants.
Left-Hand Column (Chris Argyris) 
Self-assessment
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Increase awareness of personal assumptions, thoughts, and feelings that govern one’s thinking 
and contribute to blocking hearing others.
PROCESS
•	
During dialogue, members maintain a split-sheet format for recording items in either a right- or 
left-hand column.
•	
Record in the right-hand column data or ideas one wants to remember.
•	
Record in the left-hand column what one notices about self-talk and reactions to the conversation.
•	
Examples include, what I need to set aside in my listening in order to stay present; what are 
my intentions; what are my judgments; what am I feeling in the moment, and is the feeling 
evoked by a correct interpretation of the interaction, or am I responding to “noise in my head” 
or personal history in some way; what are my assumptions; what can I learn about me from 
my reactions.
ALTERNATIVES
•	
Provide members with two-column recording sheets with prompts in the left-hand column like 
assumptions, feelings, judgments, and supportive data.
TIPS
•	
Invite members to keep right-hand column, then reflect together on what they learned about 
themselves and dialogue.

The Adaptive School
252
Round-Robin Reflection
Self-assessment and Self-modification
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Discover thoughts, feelings, and internal talk influencing participation.
PROCESS
•	
At a stopping point or at the end of the meeting the facilitator asks, “What were some of the 
decisions you made about when and how to participate, and what were some of the effects of 
those decisions on you and the group?”
•	
Members reflect privately.
•	
In round-robin fashion, each member shares one decision and the effects of the decision.
VARIATIONS
•	
During the round-robin the facilitator paraphrases and inquires: “How did the effects of your 
decision compare to what you intended?” “How might this be a pattern for you?” “What might 
be some ways you can apply this learning to future meetings?”
•	
Pairs share instead of full group.
•	
Journal writing only.
TIPS
•	
Be clear that the prompt refers to decisions about participation, not the meeting content.
•	
Members self-direct performance improvements through this process faster and more per-
manently than having process observers report participant behaviors. Teams become more 
accomplished.
Success Analysis
Reflection on Practice
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Gain insights into improving practice.
PROCESS
•	
In advance of the meeting, participants develop notes describing an area where they are finding 
success or making progress.
•	
In the meeting, participants share their “case studies” of successful work with a student or with 
a group of students.
•	
In round-robin fashion, members share while colleagues take notes.
•	
Next, colleagues paraphrase, then ask questions of clarification seeking specificity related to 
the presenter’s language such as, “When you said ‘those students,’ to which ones were you 
referring?”
•	
Next, colleagues paraphrase then ask questions seeking elaboration such as, “How did you 
know to move on at that point?” or “What is your sense of the most catalytic decision you 
made?” or “What are some learnings you are taking from this situation?”
•	
Next, colleagues offer thoughts and ideas while presenter takes notes without responding.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves

253
Discuss
To discuss is to talk about something with a group. Synonyms include converse, confer, ex-
change views, and deliberate. Its Latin root is discussus for struck asunder, or shaken. In organiza-
tions, discussions lead to decisions and are properly preceded by dialogues in which the purpose is 
to build understanding.
Appoint a Devil’s Advocate (Doyle and Straus) 
Hear Differing Views
PURPOSE AND INTENTION
Break “Group Think.”
Many people will not speak out at meetings for fear of retribution, low group trust, or just the 
fear of looking stupid. As a result “group think” becomes the norm and poor decisions result. By 
appointing a devil’s advocate, you give official permission for raising differing views.
PROCESS
•	
For each issue discussed, appoint the role of “devil’s advocate” with the function of offering 
differing views.
•	
Rotate this role. Change for each topic or meeting.
•	
At the end of the meeting explore the effects this role had on group thinking and make revisions 
if necessary, for the next time the role is used.
•	
Finally, the presenter initiates conversation with colleagues inquiring more deeply about their 
thoughts.
•	
After the last round, the group summarizes what was learned and what can be applied from 
this session.
VARIATIONS
•	
Use this process for events that were not successful.
•	
Use with trios.
TIPS
•	
A total round for one person should take about thirty minutes.
•	
Use small groups of three to six members.
•	
Expressed judgments, positive or negative, are more threatening than data or open-ended, 
nonjudgmental questions.

The Adaptive School
254
Close the Discussion
Clarify and Flexibility
PURPOSE AND INTENTION
Members are clear about when a discussion is to be closed.
PROCESS
•	
Person in charge displays decision options:
∘∘
Participants can vote on whether to keep discussion going or not.
∘∘
Person in charge decides whether to end the discussion or extend it.
∘∘
Everyone gets one more chance to make a point.
∘∘
Continue the discussion, but limit it to a specific topic.
∘∘
Close the discussion if someone calls for closure and two others agree.
∘∘
Delegate the decision making to a subgroup.
∘∘
Talk until a predetermined time limit has been reached. Person in charge makes an execu-
tive decision if group hasn’t decided by then.
•	
Members explore advantages and drawbacks of each option.
•	
Group selects an option to use on a regular basis.
VARIATIONS 
•	
Group selects a few options for consideration when approaching a decision.
TIPS
•	
The goal is efficiency, consistency, clarity, and flexibility.
Criteria Matrix
Group Decision
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS 
Decisions based on identified values.
PROCESS
•	
Identify a decision you wish to make and the alternatives you are considering.
•	
Identify the criteria you consider important.
•	
Assign each criterion an importance score.
•	
Determine the extent to which each alternative poses each criterion.
•	
Express as High, Medium, or Low.
•	
Assign number values such as High = 3, Medium = 2, and Low = 1.
•	
Record on criteria matrix and analyze scores to see which alternative has the highest total 
points.
•	
Based on your reaction to the selected alternative, determine next steps.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
255
ALTERNATIVES
•	
Assign point value to each criterion if some are more important than others.
TIPS
•	
Group needs only rough agreement on High, Medium, and Low ratings.
•	
Should two alternatives appear to be equally desirable, add other criteria.

Decision Options
Clarify Decision Authority and Strategy
PROCESS
•	
Executive decision:
∘∘
Clarify whether the group’s function is to inform or to recommend.
∘∘
Announce when decision will be made and the manner in which it will be communicated 
to the group.
•	
Fallback position:
∘∘
Limit group decision making time.
∘∘
Define a decision process if group cannot decide within allotted time.
•	
Subgroup decision:
∘∘
Clarify whether subgroup will be bringing back a decision or a recommendation.
∘∘
Provide decision parameters.
VARIATIONS
•	
Specify the decision-making strategy to be used. (See “Criteria Matrix” in this appendix.)
TIPS
•	
Select an option before discussion begins.
Disagreement Grid
Disagree Agreeably 
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Members can disagree respectfully.

The Adaptive School
256
PROCESS
•	
Ask participants to participate in the next activity as a warm-up to conversations in which 
diverse opinions are held.
•	
Draw a four-by-four grid on a chart. Ask participants to assume that each square is equal in 
dimension to the other squares.
•	
Ask participants how many squares they see.
•	
As each number is offered, write it on the chart margin without comment.
•	
After several numbers are recorded, stop. Ask, “Who saw (one of the higher numbers of 
squares)? Would you please explain to the group where you see these squares?”
•	
Mark on the grid as a member explains what they see.
•	
Ask: “Was the person who said sixteen wrong? Seventeen? Twenty-four?”
•	
Addressing the whole group, say, “As we move into the conversation that follows, let me sug-
gest that when you have a difference of opinion you say, ‘I see it a different way.’”
TIPS
•	
This can be an appropriate time to talk about other language forms that can be used when dis-
agreement occurs. Suggest participants use the word “and” which implies addition, instead of 
“but” which implies the first speaker is wrong.
Focusing Four
Achieve Agreement
(See Garmston, Dolcemascolo (2009) The Focusing Four: A Consensus Seeking Activity For Pri-
oritizing: DVD Viewers Guide. www.thinkingcollaborative.)
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Each member feels heard, understood, and contributes to decision.
PROCESS
•	
Explain task, topic and process.
•	
Check for understanding.
•	
Brainstorm ideas and record on chart paper.
•	
Push for between twelve and eighteen ideas.
•	
Next, members ask questions of clarification. The “author” responds.
•	
Next members advocate for items.
•	
Finally, use the rule of one-third to determine which items are of greatest interest to the group. 
Use a hand count. (See p. 261 for details)
•	
Conclude by determining a process to narrow the choices down to one or two if necessary. See 
“Close the Discussion” options in this appendix.
VARIATIONS
•	
Occasionally have partners confer before a new step in the process begins.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
257
TIPS
•	
Each step in the process must be kept separate.
•	
Statements of advocacy must be stated in the positive, as in, “I advocate for this because . . .” 
and never “I don’t like this because . . .”
•	
Tell group they will be guided, not bound by the numbers. For example, in a group of fifteen 
members, item A gets nine counts and item B gets eleven; that may not be a sufficient enough 
difference to select B. In cases like this, the facilitator will ask the group how it wants to handle 
the situation.
•	
See a detailed description of this process in the “Adaptive Schools Syllabus,” useful for in-
structing groups.
Gatekeeping
Invite Participation
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Open opportunities for quiet members to speak
PROCESS
•	
A member notices that a colleague has not talked.
•	
The member says, “Booker, I’m aware you have not talked for a while. Is there anything you 
would like to add?”
VARIATIONS
•	
“Monica, I know you served on a committee addressing this. Do you have anything you’d like 
to say?” or “What might you like to add?”
•	
“Ken, from where I’m sitting, your eyebrows look furrowed. What comments might you like 
to add?”
TIPS
•	
Phrase the questions so that the colleague can gracefully decline to speak.
Issues Agenda
Identify Issues
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Illuminating issues
PROCESS
•	
Brainstorm issues related to a project.
•	
Dialogue on degrees of importance, desirable attention sequences, and connections.
•	
Develop and agree to a timeline.
ALTERNATIVES
•	
After brainstorming, develop a criteria matrix (appendix A) to analyze importance and atten-
tion sequences.
•	
An issues agenda can be conducted informally focused only on topics to be addressed during 
the current meeting.

The Adaptive School
258
TIPS
•	
Remind members of brainstorming guidelines. Even experienced groups may forget these 
without a reminder.
Jigsaw Carousel 
Information Processing: Exploring and Discovering
PROCESS
•	
Form groups, one for each concept (ex: If working with four concepts, will need four groups).
•	
Each group describes a concept in its own words.
•	
Give behavioral examples: what they would see and hear as indicators of this concept.
•	
Have table groups identify and describe situations in school, life, or work in which it would be 
important to draw on this concept.
•	
Pose questions intended to help others become aware of this concept in their life or work.
•	
Have table groups create a logo or simile as a reminder for this concept (e.g., “Complete the 
simile: This concept is like a ________ because________”).
•	
Compose a brief statement or slogan that summarizes the concept.
•	
Report work to full assembly.
TIPS
•	
Provide an advance organizer for the entire process.
•	
Have each member be responsible for learning one concept and then teaching it to others.
Lasso (Doyle and Straus) 
Language Specificity
PURPOSE AND INTENTION
Members gain clarity on terms.
PROCESS
•	
Circle or lasso words on flip chart that lack specificity.
•	
Invite members to define the words within the context of the group’s work.
•	
Ex. “How to solve drug use at schools.” Ask what do you mean by drugs, which ones, which 
schools, what age levels, and even what do you mean by solve: reduce, eliminate entirely, 
prevent, etc.
ALTERNATIVES
•	
Ask pairs or small groups to define the words and report out for group reinforcement or adoption.
•	
Record the definitions on chart paper.
TIPS
•	
Classes of language most useful to question for specificity: vague nouns or pronouns; vague 
verbs or action words; universal quantifiers like all, everyone, never; modal operators like 
must, have to, can’t; and comparators like better, worse, greater.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
259
•	
As a general rule, clarify vague nouns and pronouns first.
•	
If there is an “and” in the definition, make sure you are not trying to solve two problems at once.
Naïve Question—(also a group member strategy) 
Direct Topic or Process Back on Track
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Members influence group’s fidelity to meeting standards (one process at time, one topic at a 
time, clarity about decision making, etc.). (See chapter 4.)
PROCESS
•	
A group member asks a naïve question to which the group responds. Examples are: Who is 
making this decision? How much detail do we need to move this item? What parts of this issue 
live in our area of responsibility? Who will do what by when? And is there something we are 
not talking about?
VARIATIONS
•	
The facilitator says to the group: “Given what you know about meeting standards, what seems 
to be going on right now?”
TIPS
•	
A naïve question is one asked with innocence, a desire to know, and in a melodic approachable 
voice. This is a powerful way for group members to offer corrections to group work.
Set and Test Working Agreements
Generate and Adhere to Agreements
PURPOSE AND INTENTION
Members influence group process.
PROCESS
•	
A group member says, “I notice that our meetings are not starting on time. Could we make an 
agreement to start on time? (Set agreement.)
•	
The facilitator leads a conversation in which the group develops an agreement.
•	
In a later meeting a group member says, “I’d like to talk about the agreement we made to start 
our meetings on time. I notice we are not doing it. What needs to happen to keep our agree-
ment?” (Test agreement.)
•	
The facilitator leads a conversation in which the group develops an agreement.
VARIATIONS
•	
A group member requests this topic be placed on the agenda.
TIPS
•	
This relates to the group member capability—know when to self-assert and when to integrate.

The Adaptive School
260
Setting Group Working Agreements
Establish Ground Rules
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Member ownership of working agreements.
PROCESS
•	
Sometimes, when a group is beginning a long-term relationship, invite the group to develop 
their own working agreements.
•	
Brainstorm and record possible agreements.
•	
Clarify brainstormed items.
•	
Select the five to seven most important to group success.
•	
Post these at each meeting or place on each printed agenda.
•	
Later, should members stray from an agreement, the facilitator or a member intervenes.
ALTERNATIVES
•	
For mature groups this might convey negative attitudes about the group’s capacity. When this 
is so, or when a group is working well, do not use this.
•	
For ad hoc groups suggest a set of predetermined working agreements such as demonstrate 
mutual success, employ skillful listening, develop sufficient consensus, and ask if the group is 
willing to adopt them. Define each set of terms.
Thumbs-Up
Poll the Group
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Dip-stick group sentiment.
PROCESS
•	
The facilitator or any member can call for a thumbs-up to determine the degree of agreement 
the group has on an item.
•	
Thumbs up means yes, thumbs down means no, thumbs held sideways means not sure or it 
doesn’t matter.
•	
Call for a show of thumbs.
•	
Announce the result.
VARIATIONS
•	
Use as a poll to learn what direction/thinking the group is favoring prior to further conversation.
•	
Use as a mechanism for sufficient consensus.
TIPS
•	
Ask members with thumbs held sideways to explain their reasoning.
•	
Ask members with thumbs held down what would need to be modified in the proposal for them 
give it thumbs-up.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
261
Discussions often culminate in decisions. This set of strategies is used when the leader de-
sires that a group be involved in either recommending a decision, making a decision, or having 
subgroups decide and bring a decision back to the full group for approval. Decisions by vote are 
perceived as the least useful, and often counterproductive in that issues are often not fully explored 
and votes produce both winners and losers. Those who did not vote on an item typically have low 
commitment and motivation to follow through. Sufficient consensus is the most practical participa-
tive approach to decision making in school settings. Rarely would a group have the time to reach 
full or 100 percent consensus on an item, so reaching a level in which 80 percent agree is considered 
sufficient to move along. Critically important in this approach is that the voices of those who do not 
agree are heard, and they know others understand their reservations. Sufficient consensus, or full 
consensus for that matter, is not designed to make people happy but rather to reach a decision that 
represents the best feasible course of action.
This form of decision making involves everyone clearly understanding the situation at hand, 
analyzing the relevant facts together, and then jointly developing solutions that represent the 
group’s best thinking about an optimal decision. Dialogue, a lot of listening, and the understanding 
of divergent opinions precede it. Sufficient consensus generates a decision about which everyone 
says, “I can live with it.”
Participative decision-making takes longer than decisions made independently from a leader, 
but requires very little time in gaining acceptance by a group. Participant decision-making is used 
in situations in which choices affect behaviors of members; complex decisions are under consider-
ation affecting several groups of people; and when understanding, commitment, and motivation to 
implement are desired.
100% Consensus (Bob Chadwick) 
Full Consensus on Guiding Documents such as Mission Statements or Values
PURPOSES AND INTENTIONS
Commitment of each member to adoption of a document.
PROCESS
•	
In a group of six or less, invite someone to volunteer to be a facilitator and someone to be a 
scribe.
•	
Define the facilitator’s role as calling on people and keeping the process intact. The scribe’s 
role is to chart exactly what each person says, then make the exact corrections requested by 
subsequent group members.
•	
The facilitator poses a question such as, What should be the role of the project leader?” or 
“How shall we define completion?”
•	
In round-robin fashion, members are called on to contribute one sentence which is recorded 
word-for-word by the scribe.

The Adaptive School
262
•	
Before the process is complete, both the facilitator and scribe can have someone briefly take 
their roles while they contribute a sentence.
•	
When all sentences are charted, the facilitator asks, “Is there anyone who cannot live with this 
as stated?”
•	
Members may raise their hand, and offer different wording for parts of the sentence. Without 
consultation, the scribe scratches out the original and adds the new.
•	
The facilitator asks again, “Is there anyone who cannot live with the first sentence?” The pro-
cess continues until no more changes are suggested for the first sentence.
•	
The facilitator repeats the process for the second sentence.
•	
The process is repeated for all the remaining sentences.
ALTERNATIVES
•	
For larger groups, have subgroups work on the same task—report results to the full group, then 
have the scribes draft a statement containing all the words of the several versions.
•	
Develop a full paragraph before editing.
TIPS
•	
Schedule a couple of hours for this strategy.
•	
Don’t wordsmith. Request corrections only if the corrections refine the meaning.
•	
Do not “go along” with something you are uncomfortable with.
•	
This will go slow at first. About midway through it will pick up speed.
Combine Opposites 
Decisions
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Subgroups resolve impasse without audience.
PROCESS
•	
Use when the group is stuck. Ask if two sets of persons with divergent views would be willing 
to step outside and bring a recommendation back to the group.
•	
Ask the group if this recommendation is agreeable.
•	
Determine a time for the subgroup to converse. Their choices are: now, outside the meeting 
room, or later at a break. The only limitation is that the recommendation must be made today.
•	
Clarify the subgroup’s decision-making authority with the full group. Determine whether the 
subgroup will be making a decision by which the group will abide or bring a recommendation 
for group consideration.
TIPS
•	
Request or suggest that certain members serve on the committee. Asking the most impassioned 
voice to serve increases the likelihood of group acceptance.
•	
Set a time limit for the subgroup.

Eliminate the Negative 
Decisions
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Reduce decision complexity
PROCESS
•	
Assuming members have clarified items on a list, ask, “Are there any items you would be okay 
removing?”
•	
When a member names an item, ask if anyone objects. If not, remove the item.
•	
If there is an objection, do not remove the item. No discussion required.
•	
When this process is complete, move to the next step in the decision-making process.
TIPS
•	
Explain that this process saves the group the time of talking about items in which the group 
has limited interest.
Existing State-Desired State Map
Decisions
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Focus on outcomes
PROCESS
•	
Display a desired state map, as shown below.
•	
Explain that defining the desired state establishes a goal and is more important than exploring 
why the problem exists.
•	
The group names a desired state in broad terms.
•	
Next develop a behavioral description. What would one see and hear when the desired state 
is achieved?
•	
Next identify the resources needed to achieve the desired state. Consider skills, knowledge, 
and behavior.
•	
Select the most catalytic of resources and develop a plan for developing them.
VARIATIONS
•	
Generate a description of the existing state, and then describe the desired state as a direct con-
trast to existing state elements.
TIPS
•	
The facilitator should preview the stages and sequence of thinking required in this approach.
•	
When members do not have the same information about an issue, it is useful to describe the 
existing state from the various perspectives. Otherwise, public display of the existing state is 
rarely of great value unless using the direct contrast approach described as an alternative.

Forced Choice Stickers I 
Decisions
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Provide interactive decision-making protocol
PROCESS
•	
List options on flip chart.
•	
Distribute an equal amount of stickers to each member.
•	
Instruct members to spend all their stickers.
•	
Members place stickers near preferred options.
•	
The stickers represent a vote and are binding. See variations.
Forced Choice Stickers II
Decisions
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Provide advocacy and interactive decision-making protocol
PROCESS
•	
Chart and post various options from which to select.
•	
Invite members to stand by the chart of their first choice. Ask members to talk about why they 
value this option. Have each group select a spokesperson.
•	
Each spokesperson gives a brief advocacy statement.
•	
Entertain questions of clarification.
•	
Provide each member with an equal amount of stickers.
•	
Stickers are spent.
VARIATIONS
•	
The group examines sticker distribution and decides which few options should receive further 
consideration and conversation.
•	
Post options on several flip charts. Subgroups stand by options representing their choices and 
tell group rationale for their choice.
•	
After advocating and inquiring about members’ choices, fresh stickers are distributed and spent.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
265
TIPS
•	
Some members will want to know if they can spend all their stickers on one option. Discourage this.
•	
It is acceptable to place more than one of one’s stickers on an item.
•	
Prior dialogue is valuable.
Freeing Stuck Groups
Decisions
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Facilitate decision-making
PROCESS
•	
The facilitator asks, “What’s stopping us from making a decision?” or “Who would be willing 
to meet with (name) and (name) and develop a proposal for the next meeting?” or “Are you 
willing to give the subcommittee the authority to make that decision?” or “Would it be agree-
able to the group if we asked (name) to bring us more information before we proceed?” or “I 
think this is a decision for (name). Shall we ask her to make it?”
VARIATIONS
•	
Group members can also pose these questions.
•	
See “Naïve Questions” in this appendix.
•	
See “Close the Discussion” options in this appendix.
TIPS
•	
Identify, when possible, the time available in the meeting to reach closure.
Is/Is Not (Doyle and Straus) 
Decisions 
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Identify most relevant data
PROCESS
•	
In one column write the facts that are known about a problem, where it is, what its effects are, 
when it occurs, and so on. For example, the boys scored higher than the girls in four of the 
five test batteries.
•	
In a second column write facts that are known to not be part of the problem. For example, boys 
and girls are doing equally well in daily assignments.
VARIATIONS
•	
Small groups generate is and is nots. Report and agree on the most significant examples.
•	
Follow this with data gathering based on the is/is not analysis.
TIPS
•	
Provide categories for “is”: where, when, to what extent, and with whom does the problem occur?
•	
Provide categories for “is not”: where, when, to what extent, and with whom does this not 
occur? Therefore, what might explain the pattern of occurrence and nonoccurrence?

The Adaptive School
266
Not A or B, but C
Decisions
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Eliminate decision obstacles
PROCESS
•	
The group is polarized on two options.
•	
Ask if anyone can suggest a third option (C) that might contain what seems to be attractive 
about the first two (A and B).
VARIATIONS
•	
List desirable features of A.
•	
List desirable features of B.
•	
Have small groups generate options that contain the positive aspects of A and B while mini-
mizing the negative aspects of each.
TIPS
•	
If the group remains stuck, use a criteria matrix shown in the appendix.
Paired Weighting
Decisions
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Rank larger groups of items.
PROCESS
•	
Individuals compare each item with every other item according to importance.
•	
Example: Which is more important, A as compared to B, A as compared to C, A as compared 
to D, etc. Then B as compared to A, B as compared to C, B as compared to D, etc.
•	
Participants go through the items, comparing each pair, circling their preferences. They count 
up all the As, the Bs, the Cs.
•	
When counting up their responses, participants count across the A line: From then on they 
count down and then across, starting with B in the top line and then down (counting only the 
circled letters); then C down and across, then D down and across, etc.
VARIATIONS
•	
You can also compare the items in reference to performance: How are we performing? Which 
are we performing better? A or B, A or C, A or D, etc. Then B or C, B or D, etc.—You can do 
either or both processes.
•	
Numbered cards are thrown on the table and members scramble for their question of choice.
•	
Add other summary checks for groups larger than four. Some examples might be:
∘∘
Who needs to know what happened in this meeting?
∘∘
By when are the next steps due?
∘∘
What should be highlighted in the minutes of the meeting?

Rule of One-Third (Doyle and Straus) 
Identify the Most Important Ideas
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Achieve agreement
PROCESS 
•	
Alert the group that after sufficient items have been identified, members will be asked to pick 
about a third of the items they feel are most important. Explain that this will identify the items 
most important to the group for further analysis.
•	
Use the formula one-third plus one in this way: For a list of twelve items each member would 
choose five. For a list of twenty items, each member would choose 8.
•	
For each item on the list, the facilitator asks for a show of hands and records the number of 
hands on the chart, circled, in a color not yet used.
•	
After counting is completed, ask the group to identify the top few items—mark these in some 
fashion.
•	
When about a third have been identified, or at the point in which a large gap appears between 
two numbers as in 20, 18,16, 12, the group will be asked if they want to include the last number 
(in this example 12).
NEXT STEPS
•	
Depending on the purpose for identifying high priority items, a number of options exist including: 
(1) accept all as in a staff development menu, (2) have a subcommittee study and return with 
recommendations when only one choice is to be made, (3) address the high priority items with 
other tools of discernment, such as pros and cons or measuring items against a list of criteria.
TIPS
•	
These processes are complicated and require a lot of time.
The recording page for participants looks something like the following:

Slip Method
Decisions
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Develop “trustworthy” data on member preferences
PROCESS
•	
Distribute a large quantity of 3 × 5 cards to each member.
TIPS
•	
Explain that numbers will not make the decisions; group members will be able to advocate for 
an item not selected and if the group agrees, add it to the list.
•	
See the video “Focusing Four: A Consensus Seeking Activity for Prioritizing,” Robert Garm-
ston and Michael Dolcemascolo, Denver, Colorado (www.thinkingcollaborative.com, 2009) 
for a demonstration of the entire process.
Six-Position Straw Poll
Decisions
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Diplay proposition preferences
PROCESS
•	
Members give poll page to designated person who records the tallies on a wall chart.
TIPS

Appendix A	
269
•	
State a problem in “how to” language such as “How to increase student attendance,” or “How 
to support the lower quartile kids in mathematics.”
•	
Members write only one idea per card.
•	
Collect and categorize the cards. Discard duplicate, ambiguous, or illegible items.
•	
Present and study categories and ideas.
ALTERNATIVES
•	
Use slips to prioritize items. On each slip, members record a letter for the item (A, B, C, and so 
on) and a number representing the priority weight they assign to it. Assuming they have twleve 
items, 12 would be highest weight, 11 the next highest, and 1 the lowest.
•	
Slips are turned in and stacked alphabetically. The numbers for each letter are tabulated and 
presented to the group.
TIPS
•	
Fifteen participants should be able to generate 150 ideas.
•	
Because it so mechanical and free from influence, this form of prioritizing is useful when there 
is low trust in the group.
Spend a Buck
Decisions
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Reveal individual or collective choices
PROCESS
•	
Members have one hundred imaginary pennies they can distribute across a few options.
•	
Explain the options.
•	
Individuals decide how many pennies they will spend on each option.
•	
Gather and present the data to the group.
VARIATIONS
•	
Use for individual choices rather than a collective expression of priorities.
TIPS
•	
Provide think time before members assign pennies.
Sufficient Consensus
Decisions
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Achieve agreement
PROCESS
•	
Determine a figure—like 80 percent—that will represent sufficient consensus.
•	
Keep to one process at a time.
•	
Members clarify and advocate for items.
•	
Members may inquire as to the reasoning of another member’s choice.

The Adaptive School
270
•	
Minority view voices must be encouraged to speak.
•	
Member views can be paraphrased.
•	
Call for a show of hands.
•	
Announce the result.
VARIATIONS
•	
Determine what percentage will qualify as sufficient consensus in general.
•	
In any meeting, an item can be singled out for even a 100 percent consensus. This should be 
very rare.
TIPS
•	
No member has the right to block a group.
•	
Employ a guideline for members not budging from a position. Ask if this is a matter of prin-
ciple or preference. If a principle, encourage dialogue; if a preference, after others understand 
the preference, set it aside.
Thumbs-Up
Decisions
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Members and facilitator understand tentative degrees of agreement.
PROCESS
•	
The facilitator or any member can call for a thumbs-up to determine the degree of agreement 
the group has on an item.
•	
Thumbs up means yes, thumbs down means no, thumbs held sideways means not sure or it 
doesn’t matter.
•	
Call for a show of hands.
•	
Announce the result.
VARIATIONS
•	
Use as a poll to learn what direction/thinking the group is favoring prior to further conversation.
•	
Use as a mechanism for sufficient consensus.
TIPS
•	
Ask members with thumbs held sideways to explain their reasoning.
•	
Ask members with thumbs held down what would need to be modified in the proposal for them 
give it thumbs up.
Value Voting
Assess preferences
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Display member preferences

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
271
PROCESS
•	
Ask the group to express their response to a statement visually.
•	
Show five fingers for strongly agree, four for agree, three for neutral, two for disagree, one for 
strongly disagree.
•	
Ask each person to respond to this question on a Post-It note: “What would it take to get me 
reenergized?”
•	
Phrase the statements as “I’m satisfied with the direction the group is taking,” or “We should 
move forward on this initiative now.”
•	
Say the number of fingers you see as you scan the group, as 3, 3, 2, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 3, 2.
•	
Interpret what you see as, “Seems to be an average of about four,” or “ I notice responses on 
both ends of the scale. Can members voting low share some reasons for their response and 
members voting high do the same thing?”
VARIATIONS
•	
Ask members to look around the room and compare what they see with the number of fingers 
they are displaying.
TIPS
•	
The benefit of value voting is that the responses are public, giving the group a sense of the 
whole.
•	
Use this as a straw poll only, not a final decision—unless you see unanimous display of five fingers.
Set and Test Working Agreements
Generate and Adhere to Agreements
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Members influence group practice.
PROCESS
•	
A group member says, “I notice that our meetings are not starting on time Could we make an 
agreement to start on time?” (Set agreement.)
•	
The facilitator leads a conversation in which the group develops an agreement.
•	
In a later meeting a group member says, “I’d like to talk about the agreement we made to start 
our meetings on time. I notice we are not doing it. What needs to happen to keep our agree-
ment?” (Test agreement.)
•	
The facilitator leads a conversation in which the group develops an agreement.
VARIATIONS
•	
A group member requests this topic be placed on the agenda.
•	
When working agreements have previously been made by the group, either the facilitator or 
member can call attention to agreement fidelity.
TIPS
•	
This relates to the group member capability—know when to self-assert and when to integrate.

Accordion Planning
Receive Full Group Input in Planning
PURPOSES AND INTENTIONS
Allow planning teams to work deeply while informing and getting feedback from the larger 
group at various planning stages.
PROCESS
•	
Planning team adopts a template such as define the problem, analyze causes, identity possible 
solutions, and implement and test solutions.
•	
After each stage, planning team members work with others in the organization, informing of 
the team’s work and seeking reaction and guidance.
•	
The planning team takes into account responses from the larger group, refines that stage of their 
work, then repeats the process for the remaining stages up to implementation.
VARIATIONS
•	
Select different planning templates.
•	
Have each team member report to a group in which they hold membership like a grade level 
or department.
TIPS
•	
Team members must be clear they are to think for themselves, rather than represent and only 
speak for the thinking of a group they are a member of.
•	
Accordion planning takes longer than using a process in which a planning team does the full 
work, then reports to the larger group. The benefit of this form of planning that makes it worth 
the extra time is the degree of ownership held by other members of the organization.

Denominalize
Render Concepts Amenable to Problem Solving
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Be proactive in response to statements like “We have a problem with communication,” or 
“There is limited trust in our group.”
PROCESS 
•	
Inform a group that when verbs or adjectives have been converted into nouns, they become 
nominalizations. It is not possible to solve nominalizations, so for planning to start they must 
be denominalized.
•	
Invite the group to denominalize by phrasing challenges as “What will we see and hear our-
selves doing when we are communicating more effectively? This way of stating the problem 
reveals the desired state about which a group can plan.
Done—Yet to Do—Questions
Name Action Steps
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Identify and agree on what yet needs to be done.
PROCESS
•	
Regarding a group project, individual members record a list of tasks that are done, tasks that 
are yet to be done, and questions about getting the work done.
•	
In table groups, share the information.
•	
Get agreement on the next most important things to be done.
VARIATIONS
•	
Identify tasks that should be discarded if not done.
•	
Run the process as a facilitated full-group activity.
TIPS
•	
Members are often so deep in the complexity of work that it is hard to see where they are and 
generate focus and energy for the next tasks.
Fishbone Diagram
Planning for Technical Change
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Discover cause and effect relationships.
PROCESS
•	
Draw a fishbone diagram on chart paper as shown below.
•	
Code sections of the chart that may be related to an existing condition of an issue. For tardiness, for 
example, getting to school, school responses to tardiness, school staff, and home might be listed.
•	
Brainstorm factors that might be affecting the existing condition and record on the diagram.
•	
Explore pros and cons of various combinations of solution approaches.

Force Field Analysis
Technical Change Planning
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Select opposing forces to weaken and favorable forces to strengthen.
PROCESS
•	
Post a T-bar chart with a topic or goal at top. In the left side, write “forces for” and in the right 
side, write “forces against.”
•	
Members list forces that fall into either category.
•	
Members may paraphrase or question for clarity.
•	
Limit each list to about six items. Once the list is deemed complete, mark the three strongest 
forces on either side.
•	
Explore how the forces against might be made weaker and the forces for, strengthened. This 
phase may take the form of dialogue.
•	
Rate the forces and how feasible it would be to modify them.
•	
Select one or more on which to work.
VARIATIONS
•	
Assign the first three tasks above to small work groups, then chart and post group results.
•	
As a full group, entertain questions of clarification
•	
Continue with the process as a full group.
TIPS
•	
Some forces may legitimately appear on either side of the chart.
•	
It is usually easier to weaken the forces restraining change than it is to strengthen the helping 
forces.
ALTERNATIVES
•	
Have subgroups brainstorm each of the categories and record them on a separate chart.
•	
Next, report and explore the various charts. Allow additions.
TIPS
•	
Protect the group from delving into too much minutia.

Topics such as decreasing dropout rates, increasing attendance, or increasing student motiva-
tion to write might prove challenging, as their complexity exceeds this simple analysis.
Futures Wheel
Identifying Possible Consequences 
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Reveal factors to consider in planning.
PROCESS
•	
Display a futures wheel on chart paper.
•	
Write the name of the innovation or idea that the group will be working with in the center of 
the wheel.
•	
Work outward from the center to the first layer of circles.
•	
Identify two positive consequences and two negative consequences. Have the positive and 
negative be as different as possible.
•	
Continue in this manner to the second layer, then the third, or fourth.
•	
Dialogue about the findings. How might this information influence the perceptions and deci-
sions of a planning team?
VARIATIONS
•	
Through this process, a need for more information may surface. Determine what is needed and 
how to gather it.
•	
Two small groups could work on the same decision, then share results to gain greater perspective.
TIPS
•	
These are not predictions. They are possible consequences.
•	
An analysis of the data may lead a group to abandon the idea.
•	
An analysis of the data may inform a group of ways of implementing the idea that would avoid 
some negatives.
•	
Use the information to learn what needs to be communicated to whom and in what ways.

Histomap (Suzanne Bailey)
Learn from Group History
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Release emotional barriers to working toward a desired state.
PROCESS
•	
Hang chart paper on wall like a timeline.
•	
Mark eras in the group’s history—the year the bond issue passed, the year the new principal 
arrived, the loss of a federal program, etc.
•	
Use icons to illustrate the different events that occurred within each of the eras.
•	
Next, groups of people add words and icons to the timeline and share their memories.
VARIATIONS
•	
Organize groups randomly or as intact working groups.
TIPS
•	
When people hear about the same event from different perspectives, a more complex history 
is understood.
•	
What is expressed and understood can be released and need not dominate the working space 
of the group.
Outcome Mapping
Resolve Persistent Performance Problems 
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Discover and strengthen internal resources to improve performance.
PROCESS
•	
Reveal purpose and process to group.
•	
Display six columns with these headings:
∘∘
Presenting problem
∘∘
Tentative outcome
∘∘
Desired behavior of selected others
∘∘
Internal resources required to achieve desired behaviors
∘∘
Change agent strategies to build resources
∘∘
Internal resources required for change agent to perform strategies.
•	
Elicit responses from group; paraphrase and record responses.
•	
If there is disagreement regarding what group members say, dialogue may be scheduled for 
another meeting.
VARIATIONS
•	
Facilitate the use of this map with a change agent desiring change from another group or in-
dividual.

277
•	
Use as a group facilitation tool.
•	
Direct the focus to others or to self as a group.
•	
Use to explore potential strategies to promote growth for an individual.
TIPS
•	
This is task analysis work and must be followed in sequence. Intuitive leaps and leaps to solu-
tion should be set aside. We can’t prescribe solutions until the exact behaviors and required 
resources are known.
•	
Presenting problem. Don’t need specific descriptors. (Ex. Don’t function as a team.)
•	
Tentative outcome. Don’t need specific descriptors. (Ex. Uses team work.)
•	
Desired behavior. State behaviorally: What, by when, how much.
∘∘
Behaviors must be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant to the larger outcome, and 
tactical. Tactical means the positive byproduct of the existing state can be maintained.
∘∘
Select a few behaviors, most amenable to change in the near future, for the analysis that 
follows.
•	
Internal resources. Answers the question: “What knowledge, skills, attitudes, or states of mind 
would be necessary to perform these behaviors?” The assumption is that if they were present, 
the behaviors would be present.
•	
Change agent’s strategies. Answers the question: “What strategies might the change agent 
perform in order to have the group access the required resources?”
•	
Internal resources for change agent. Answers the question: “What knowledge, skills, attitudes, 
or states of mind would the change agent need to have to perform identified strategies?”
Polarity Mapping
Identify and Manage Paradoxes
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Engage members with polarized positions to look beyond one view and forge a workable way 
to manage the situation.
PROCESS
•	
Identify an ongoing chronic issue.
•	
Identify a key polarity.
•	
Agree on value neutral names for each of the poles.
•	
Draw map below on chart paper.
•	
Write the pole names on the map.
•	
Brainstorm content for each quadrant.
•	
Agree on a name for the highest purpose and deepest fear.

Naming purpose and fear integrates oppositional views and provides a reason to manage the 
tension between the two views.
•	
Some examples of polarities are work and home, individual and team, stability and change, and 
independence and interdependence.
•	
Empathically paraphrase participants, for all need to know they are being understood for the 
process to proceed.

Responsibility Charting
Decisions
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Insure follow-up accountability
PROCESS
•	
List all major responsibilities on the left side of a chart. List the names of team members and 
other persons related to the responsibilities along the top.
•	
Review all responsibilities and code “R” to mean responsible for the task, “A” to indicate who 
must authorize decisions, “S” to indicate members providing support and “I” for those who 
must stay informed.
VARIATIONS
•	
Do this work with a subcommittee to reduce full group meeting time on this task.
TIPS
•	
This can become cumbersome to complete with a full group.
Spot Analysis
Strategic Planning
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Develop a plan.
PROCESS
•	
Hang chart paper on the wall divided into quadrants.
•	
Label the four sections strengths, problems, opportunities, and threats (SPOT).
•	
List strengths, then problems.
•	
Rank the strengths and problems if you have time.
•	
Brainstorm opportunities. Invite members to see potential opportunities within problems.
•	
List threats. Explore which ones could invalidate the work of the group.
•	
Review the chart for insights and action ideas.
VARIATIONS
•	
Next, categorize elements of an issue to be addressed such as curriculum, assessment, and staff 
development.
•	
List concerns or goals within each category.
•	
Identify connections across categories.
•	
Consider intervening at various starting places.
TIPS
•	
Assign the alternative ideas to a subgroup.

Structure Conversations About Data
Data-Driven Planning
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Utilize data to achieve outcomes.
PROCESS
•	
Select type of outcome, demographic, or process data.
•	
Select most useful organization of data.
•	
Determine type of analysis.
See chapter 11, Facilitating Data Teams.
Wicked Problems Map
Preparing Action Plans
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Reveal systems for adaptive planning
PROCESS
•	
Draw a large circle on chart paper and a smaller circle in the center.
•	
The smaller circle describes the project/initiative the group is working on. It might be imple-
menting rigorous content standards.
•	
In the outer circle list the systems and practices that would be affected. For implementing stan-
dards these might include curriculum alignment, parent expectations, data collection, special 
education, teacher evaluation, district culture, professional development, reporting practices, 
and so on.
•	
Identify complexities and factors that would need to be taken into consideration in developing 
an action plan.
VARIATIONS
•	
Generate list of affected systems and practices in small group conversations prior to developing 
the problem map.
TIPS
•	
Apply to “wicked problems” for which no known solution processes are available. Often these 
require new mental models or are dynamical, producing emergent phenomena within systems 
and subsystems.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
281
7-11 Conversations
Organize and Integrate
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Recall, clarify, and correct misunderstandings regarding what happened in a meeting.
PROCESS
•	
Members prepare comments they would make to a friend summarizing this meeting.
•	
After composing—either mentally or on paper—members mill about the room sharing their 
comments with others.
•	
After a few minutes, the facilitator redirects members to report to the full group some of their 
summaries.
•	
The facilitator and group edit for consistency and accuracy.
ALTERNATIVES
•	
Summaries can be written and passed around a table for editing.
TIPS
•	
Frame this as a conversation in a convenience store needing to be brief, informal, and without 
academic language.
•	
People often report different versions of what happens in meetings. This corrects this tendency.
Content Check
Summarize
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Clarify the what, why, and how of next steps.
PROCESS
•	
Randomly distribute cards numbered one through four.
•	
Display a chart with the following ideas:
1.	
Walk out knowing what to do.
2.	
Why are we doing it?

The Adaptive School
282
3.	
What are we expecting to see?
4.	
What are our next steps?
•	
The numbers members received determine which meeting summary statement they make.
VARIATIONS
•	
Members draw a playing card.
•	
Numbered cards are thrown on the table and members scramble for their questions of choice.
•	
Add other summary checks for groups larger than four. Some examples might be:
∘∘
Who needs to know what happened in this meeting?
∘∘
By when are the next steps due?
∘∘
What should be highlighted in the minutes of the meeting?
TIPS
•	
Make the process routine for greatest results or alternate with “Process Check” in this appendix.
Gots and Wants
Meeting Assessment
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Adjust ways of working with group based on group feedback.
PROCESS
•	
Individuals compose “gots” on sticky notes, one idea per sticky note. A “got” might be an idea 
received, something learned, or a positive response to working with colleagues.
•	
Individuals compose “wants” on sticky notes, one idea per sticky note. A “want” might be a 
comment about process (go faster or slower), a request for information, or a comment about 
materials.
•	
As the group adjourns, members place their sticky notes on charts labeled as GOTS or WANTS.
VARIATIONS
•	
See “Plusses and Wishes” in this appendix.
TIPS
•	
After the event, categorize and label the gots and wants. Use this information to adjust your 
practices at the next session.
•	
Communicate to the group your response to their needs as you open the next session.
Matchbook Summary
Summarize
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Reveal the essence of a topic.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
283
PROCESS
•	
Following the introduction of a topic, groups craft a “matchbook” definition.
•	
Like a matchbook, very few words can be used (eight to twelve).
•	
Groups have five minutes to craft and post the definition.
VARIATIONS
•	
Use this strategy to check understandings by summarizing conclusions from a discussion or 
dialogue.
TIPS
•	
Set wordsmithing aside. Save it for a different task.
•	
Keep the definitions posted for later reference.
•	
Use half sheets of chart paper to encourage short definitions.
Most Important Point (MIP) 
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Energize members as they distinguish and report personally relevant information. 
PROCESS
•	
Invite the group to reflect on something learned or a conversation held.
•	
Stand, locate a partner, and share your most important point.
VARIATIONS
•	
Add “Partners Report” to this activity. Members will report to the full assembly the Most Im-
portant Point of their partner. The reporting need not be reciprocal and reporting is best done 
while members are still standing.
•	
Instead of locating another partner, share MIPs at tables and agree on a table MIP.
TIPS
•	
Learning partners, eye contact partners, or any configuration of partnerships can be used. See 
“Learning Partner” in this listing of strategies and moves.
•	
When partners report, because they are reporting their partner’s ideas, they will be briefer.
One-Word Summary
Summarize
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Synthesize a conversation or information from a text.
PROCESS
•	
Write one word that summarizes the central idea from this conversation or text.
•	
Share with a neighbor or table group.

The Adaptive School
284
ALTERNATIVES
•	
See “Most Important Point,” “Scrambled Sentences,” “Three Balloons,” or “5-3-1” in this 
appendix.
TIPS
•	
Allow “open text” in which members might review notes or text before arriving at a one-word 
summary.
Pluses and Wishes
Meeting Assessment
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Adjust ways of working with group based on group feedback.
PROCESS
•	
Inform the group you will be requesting members to name pluses (things they appreciated or 
things that supported their learning) and wishes (things they wish the group had done more of, 
less of, or differently).
•	
Use two to four flip charts depending on size of group. Each chart is displayed as a T-Bar with 
plusses at the top left and wishes at the top right
•	
Recruit recorders.
•	
Request pluses first. As each plus is named, paraphrase and direct it to recorders in turn.
•	
Ask for wishes and repeat the patterns.
•	
Members orally report pluses—what they valued about content or processes—while a recorder 
charts the ideas.
•	
Next, report wishes—what they wish had been done more, less, differently, or wishes for the 
next session.
VARIATIONS
•	
“Gots and Wants” (elsewhere in this list) is another strategy that serves this purpose.
•	
With a small group, up to ten or so people, you can serve as both facilitator and recorder.
ALTERNATIVES
•	
Use multiple recorders to speed the charting process.
TIPS
•	
After initial contributions always ask “What else?” rather than “Is there anything else?” to elicit 
further comments.
•	
State as “What are some pluses . . .,” not “Are there any plusses?”
•	
After the session, organize each category into sub-topics and report to the group at the next 
session how their ideas have informed this next session.
•	
Keep your facial and verbal responses neutral.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves

Recipe
Review and Condense
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Engage both sides of brain in review.
PROCESS
•	
Provide format: “Recipe For__________; Name of Dish____; From the Kitchen of____; 
Serves____; Ingredients____.”
•	
Table groups develop and post recipes on chart paper.
•	
Spokesperson from each table makes a brief presentation to the group.
VARIATIONS
•	
Provide ingredients with which the recipe will be made.
•	
Use a “Gallery Walk” to share recipes.
TIPS
•	
Give a time estimate, usually about fifteen minutes.
Scrambled Sentences
Review
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Energy and collective review.
PROCESS
•	
Each person writes one word on a card or sticky note illustrative of the individual’s learning.
•	
The group constructs a sentence using all the words while adding as few words as possible.
•	
Group spokespersons read the sentences to the full group.
VARIATIONS
•	
Write words for a common experience.
•	
After creating one sentence, have participants take their word and form another group, creating 
another sentence.
TIPS
•	
Give a signal for the group work to begin.
Song Writing
Review
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Engage right and left brain in summarizing important points.

The Adaptive School
286
PROCESS
•	
Have individuals write the name of a song from their childhood on a sticky note.
•	
Next have them write the name of a song from their high school years.
•	
Next they write a song they associate with celebrations.
•	
Using these songs as activators, direct table groups to develop a song that expresses something 
about the full group in which they are participating, and prepare to perform it.
•	
Ask which group wants to go first, second, etc. Perform and appreciate.
VARIATIONS
•	
Use this to celebrate accomplishments or transitions in the life of the group.
TIPS
•	
Use this only when table groups have five or more members. This provides enough musical 
repertoire and style variance for a group to be successful.
Sound and Motion Symphony
Full-bodied Review
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Energy, creativity, and group cohesion.
PROCESS
•	
Table groups select a collective sound and a motion to represent their learning.
•	
Stand and rehearse.
•	
When groups are ready to perform, facilitator assumes role of symphony conductor.
•	
After each section of “instruments” is rehearsed, the facilitator conducts the group bringing 
different sections in and out as appropriate.
VARIATIONS
•	
The facilitator might stand on a riser or table for greater visibility.
TIPS
•	
Emphasize rationale. Explain that of the many ways humans organize and integrate knowledge, 
body movements bring a special opportunity for the kinesthetic learner. This activity focuses 
more on the affective domains of learning than the cognitive.
•	
Prerequisites for this activity are safe learning environment and trusting relationship with fa-
cilitator. Rarely would this occur on the first day of a group’s work.
Three Balloons
Summarize
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Quick individual and collective review.
PROCESS
•	
Imagine each member had three balloons on which there was space to write one word or phrase 
capturing an important idea from today’s work.

Facilitation Strategies and Moves 	
Appendix A	
287
•	
Members record their ideas.
•	
Members report out to the full group.
VARIATIONS
•	
Do not report out.
TIPS
•	
Reporting is useful when the goal is to reinforce certain ideas, stimulate recognition of others, 
and contribute to a sense of “we” rather than “me.”
Tweet 
Summarize
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Reveal the essence of a topic.
PROCESS
•	
Following the introduction of a topic, groups craft a “tweet.”
•	
The summary can be no longer than 140 characters.
•	
Groups have five minutes to craft and post the definition.
Walk About
Review
PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Reflection on what has been important, personally and as a group.
PROCESS
•	
Establish groups of four to six participants.
•	
Distribute walk about form. (See below.)
•	
Members write what they know in left margin (five minutes).
•	
Demonstrate talking with person from different table. Each provides one idea to the other.
•	
Each records in one of the cells the idea and the person’s name so others can be referred to that 
person for more information.
•	
After ten to twelve minutes, have people seated, sharing the data they gathered.
•	
Group members analyze data they have collected looking for themes or patterns.
VARIATIONS
•	
Reduce the number of cells to four to save time.
•	
Select prompts such as recall–insights–applications or know–want to know–think you know.
TIPS
•	
Ensure that people write their original barter material outside instead of inside one of the cells.

Teachers in school-based leadership posi-
tions whose responsibilities include facilitating 
school improvement efforts, and whose roles 
have been determined in part by special fund-
ing sources or district policy, often face the 
dilemma of having to sort out their working 
relationship with the school principal or other 
administrators to whom they normally report.
This is complex for two reasons. First, any 
employee–supervisor relationship is governed 
by multiple factors: district policy, negotiated 
agreements with employee organizations, the 
management and leadership style of the prin-
cipal, the work culture in the school, the style 
characteristics of the employee, and the inter-
personal relationship of the principal and the 
teacher-leader.
Because informal personalized factors 
have a greater influence on working procedures 
than do the hypothetical relationships described 
in program descriptions, the actual relationship 
is negotiated between the two people.
However, becoming clear about the work-
ing relationship is further complicated, because 
knowing who is to be served in a support role is 
complex for even the most practiced consultant 
or facilitator.
Because one cannot serve two masters, an 
early task for a consultant or facilitator is to 
learn who the primary and ultimate clients are. 
It is these parties whom the resource person is 
committed to serve. Thus, besides the question 
of the teacher–principal working relationship, 
there are several other questions that the teach-
er-leader and the principal must address:
1.	
Because of the potential for having role re-
quirements given to the teacher-leader from 
sources beyond the principal, who exactly 
is the teacher-leader’s primary and ultimate 
client, and what are the teacher-leader’s 
responsibilities to those clients?
2.	
Under what conditions can the principal be 
a primary client?
3.	
Under what conditions can a working 
committee of the entire faculty be a pri-
mary client?
4.	
What are the core values that will guide 
this work?
5.	
Who is the client?
A contact client is a person who makes the 
initial contact with the teacher-leader. This es-
tablishes an expectation for serving a principal 
or a school according to the goals and descrip-
tions of the funding program. Sometimes the 
contact comes from the following:
•	
A personnel office;
•	
A staff development office;
•	
An administrator in charge of special pro-
grams.
An intermediate client is involved in the 
early contracting arrangements between the 
teacher-leader and the school. This person 
is often responsible for administrating the 
districtwide program under which each teach-
er-leader has been assigned. The intermedi-
ate client will communicate program goals, 
procedures to follow, and job descriptions for 
the teacher-leader. These guidelines set the 
parameters within which the principal and 
teacher-leader are to work.
The primary client is the group with 
which the facilitator will work. Because spe-
cific goals and working procedures can be 
developed only with the primary client, the 
teacher-leader must be clear about who this is. 
Appendix F	 The Responsibilities Dilemma  
of the Teacher-Facilitator Person

The Adaptive School
298
Three prerequisites for being successful as a 
primary client are as follows:
•	
The primary client has made a free and 
informed choice to ask the facilitator for 
services.
•	
The primary client has accepted respon-
sibility for the problem being worked on.
•	
The primary client has or can access the in-
formation necessary to develop solutions.
The ultimate clients are the stakeholders, 
whose interests should be protected even if 
they are not in direct contact with the meeting 
processes. These would include the organiza-
tion as a whole, students, parents, and commu-
nity members.
The larger the school system, the greater 
the chance that communications between the 
support-role person and the contact, interme-
diate, and primary clients will be incomplete, 
contradictory, or confusing. Large school sys-
tems, even with the best of intentions, have 
communication problems. This is a systems 
problem, not a people problem. The most effec-
tive level for aligning incongruent understand-
ings about role and function is with the two 
people closest to the action, the teacher-leader 
and the principal. If necessary, the district re-
source teacher or the administrator who leads 
the program can help.
In some situations, the primary client 
might also be the contact and intermediate 
client. For example, a department chairperson 
asks you to facilitate a meeting to develop 
faculty consensus on a set of educational val-
ues. The chairperson then works with you to 
develop agreements on mutual responsibilities 
as well as the goals and agenda for this meet-
ing. During the meeting that you facilitate, the 
chairperson is also a member of the group that 
is receiving your services.
A principal can be the primary client when 
he or she will receive, or be a member of the 
group that receives, direct services from the 
facilitator. The principal will be an effective 
primary client when he or she has met the three 
prerequisites listed above for being successful 
as a primary client.
A working committee of the entire faculty 
can be the primary client when it represents the 
full range of opinions of the faculty and when 
the same three conditions for success as a pri-
mary client have been met.
The ideas below are recommended as ge-
neric core values to guide all facilitation work.
What are the presenting problem, diagnosis, 
and plan? Facilitators should not assume that the 
client has accurately or inaccurately defined and 
diagnosed the problem. The confident client has 
already defined the problem, its causes, and a 
method for solving it, and asks, “Can you help 
me accomplish this?” The searching client has 
identified the problem but is not clear about 
its causes or the methods to solve it, and asks, 
“How can you help us with this problem?” The 
puzzled client has not yet identified the problem, 
and asks, “Can you help us to figure out what is 
going on and what to do about it?” The reluctant 
client talks with a facilitator because job expec-
tations require it; this person asks, “What does 
the project want you to do?”
What are the resources and motivation 
for change? Two often overlooked resources 
for change are the group’s strengths and the 
critical voices of selected group members. Just 
because a group seeks help does not mean that 
it is interested in changing its behavior. Groups 
require resources to change. These include 
time, information, skills, knowledge, and mo-
tivation. Motivation to change can result from 
the following forms of discomfort:
•	
An internal dissatisfaction with the status 
quo;
•	
Organizational pressure to improve;
•	
An unachieved vision;
•	
A drive toward craftsmanship and contin-
ual improvement.
What type of facilitation services are be-
ing requested? In basic facilitation, the group 
seeks only to solve a substantive problem. 
The group engages a facilitator to temporarily

improve its processes in order to work on 
the problem. When the problem is resolved, 
the group’s process knowledge and skills are 
relatively unchanged. The basic facilitator is 
like a mechanic who fixes the group’s car well 
enough to get it to a destination. Facilitation 
and agenda development tend to be done by 
one or two individuals, and the group expects 
the facilitator to use whatever processes he or 
she considers effective.
In developmental facilitation, the group 
seeks to permanently improve its processes 
while solving a substantive problem. When 
the problem is resolved, the group will also 
be more knowledgeable and skilled at solving 
future problems. The developmental facilitator 
is like a staff developer who leads the group in 
learning how to monitor, repair, and redesign 
its own car so it can use the vehicle to reach any 
destination it seeks. Facilitation and agenda 
development are shared, and the group periodi-
cally reflects to learn from its experience.

Many facilitation contracts are faulty for one of three reasons:
1.	 The client felt some kind of coercion, however subtle or indirect.
2.	 The client agreed to the arrangements but increasingly felt inadequate 
control over what was happening.
3.	 The client talks a more participative game about decision making than 
he or she is really comfortable with.
Ask “Is this project something you really want to see happening? Are you 
fully satisfied with the way we have set things up? Do you feel you have 
enough control over how this project is going to proceed?”
Provide support.
Make genuine supportive statements about the client’s willingness to

Appendix K	Polarity Management: Using 
Conflict as a Resource
Carolyn McKanders
Polarities are chronic, ongoing tensions 
that are inherent in individual and organiza-
tional systems. They are unavoidable and un-
solvable, they have two or more right answers 
that are interdependent, and they must be man-
aged with both-and thinking.
Examples of polarities are the following:
•	
Individual rubrics and schoolwide rubrics
•	
Tight and loose structures
•	
Autonomy and collaboration
•	
Team and individual
•	
Home and work
Polarity Management™ is a model that in-
volves a set of principles and tools for dealing 
with all polarities in life.
Betty Achinstein (2002), writing about 
conflict among school teachers, notes that col-
laboration and consensus—critical elements in 
building community—actually generate con-
flict. She found that by airing diverse perspec-
tives in a collective setting and encouraging 
teachers to debate what and how to do school-
ing, schools generate new conflicts because 
of their commitment to creating collaborative 
communities.
In what ways might conflict represent a 
polarity?
Conflict is a manifestation of interdepen-
dence, and tensions between independence 
and interdependence are ever present. This 
inherent tension can be a source of productive 
energy for groups, or it can lead to unproduc-
tive interactions and create an energy drain. 
Groups that use tension productively distin-
guish between affective and cognitive conflict. 
Affective conflict is personalized conflict and 
is detrimental to group energy and productivity. 
Cognitive conflict is conflict over ideas and ap-
proaches, and it is a hallmark of high-perform-
ing groups. Groups that engage in cognitive 
conflict critically examine ideas to sort out the 
best practices for student learning. Thus con-
flict becomes a resource (Amason, Thompson, 
Hochwarter, & Harrison, 1995).
Achinstein (2002) quotes John Gardner’s 
explanation of conflict, diversity, and commu-
nity. Gardner states that diversity is not good 
simply because it implies breadth of tolerance 
and sympathy. A community of diverse ele-
ments has a greater capacity to adapt and renew 
itself in a swiftly changing world. To keep 
a balance between diversity and wholeness, 
com- munities must apply structures to reduce 
polarization, to foster communication among 
diverse groups, and to create mechanisms for 
conflict mediation.
Barry Johnson (1996) offers a set of prin-
ciples, tools, and structures for identifying and 
utilizing the natural tensions that are created 
as individuals and organizations attempt to en-
gage in cognitive conflict. These tensions often 
manifest as polarities: ongoing, chronic issues 
that are unavoidable and unsolvable. Johnson 
asserts that when groups can distinguish be- 
tween a problem to solve and a polarity to man- 
age and can effectively deal with both, they are 
able to celebrate and capitalize on diversity and 
convert resistance to change to a resource for 
sustainable strength and adaptivity.
Leaders, teams, and organizations must 
ask this fundamental question when they are 
faced with a challenge: Is this a problem to 

The Adaptive School
312
solve, or is it an ongoing polarity that we must 
manage well? Problems to solve are those that 
have one right answer or two or more right an-
swers that are independent. For example: “How 
do you spell?” or “What should we include in 
our parent survey?”
In contrast, polarities to be managed are 
sets of opposites that can’t function well in- 
dependently; they require both-and thinking. 
Because the two sides of a polarity are interde-
pendent, you cannot choose one as a solution 
and neglect the other. The objective of manag-
ing polarities is to get the best of both opposites 
while avoiding the limits or downside of each. 
Johnson (1996) uses breathing as a metaphor 
for all polarities. You cannot solve the inhale- 
exhale polarity by choosing to either inhale or 
exhale. You manage it by getting the benefits of 
each while appreciating the limits of each. It’s 
not a static situation. It’s a process, an ongoing 
flow of shifting emphasis from one to the other 
and back again. Managing this polarity requires 
choosing both inhaling and exhaling.
Some examples of polarities to manage are 
work and home, individual and team, stability 
and change, independence and interdepen-
dence, and planning and action.
A central premise of the adaptive school 
work is that leaders must recognize that 
schools are living paradoxes (i.e., polarities), 
operating simultaneously as “thing” and “en-
ergy” models—dynamic systems of energy 
and information.
The principles and tools of Polarity Man-
agement TM support collaborative communi-
ties in accessing the richness of capitalizing 
on diversity and engaging cognitive conflict to 
liberate group energy and productivity.
The Polarity Map
The polarity map is a tool for mapping 
paradoxes or dilemmas, which we refer to as 
polarities. The map provides a structure for 
making invisible tensions visible and for ad- 
dressing the whole polarity picture. Once the 
map is completed through collaborative con-
versation, it provides a focus for dialogue from 
diverse perspectives.
The polarity map is a square divided into 
four quadrants. The right and left halves are 
called poles. The upper part of each pole con-
tains the positive results of focusing on that 
pole, referred to as its upside. The lower part 
of each pole contains the negative results of 
focusing on that pole to the neglect of the other 
pole and is called the downside. Creating and 
discovering the content of all four quadrants is 
essential for maximum effectiveness in manag-
ing a polarity.
Guidelines for Creating  
a Polarity Map
Define the challenge. Identify an ongoing, 
chronic issue (a) within your sphere of influence 
(b) that has eluded problem-solving and (c) that 
has to be addressed in the next 2 months.
Identify a key polarity. A polarity differs 
from a problem in the following ways: (a) The 
issue continues over time, (b) there are two 
interdependent alternatives, (c) you need to 
have the positive aspects of each of the alterna-
tives, and (d) developing one alternative to the 
neglect of the other will eventually undermine 
your productivity. Ask the following probing 
questions:
1.	
In what ways do you continue to experi-
ence this issue over time?
2.	
In what ways are there two alternatives 
that are interdependent? This means that 
you can focus on only one pole for so long 
be- fore you are required to focus on the 
other pole.
3.	
What is the necessity of having the upsides 
of both poles over time?
4.	
To what extent will focusing on one upside 
to the neglect of the other eventually un-
dermine your productivity?
Explore the issues, opportunities, and polari-
ties. Facilitate a conversation that is designed 
to create an objective description of the issues, 

Polarity Management: Using Conflict as a Resource	
Appendix K	
313
opportunities, and polarities that are present. 
The skills of dialogue (chapter 5) and the 
norms of collaboration (chapter 4) are essential 
to this goal. Presume that all ideas are respected 
and important. Paraphrasing (chapter 4) is a 
primary tool in these conversations.
Well-crafted paraphrases communicate I 
am trying to understand you, and therefore I 
value what you have to say” and establish a 
relation- ship between people and ideas.
Here is an example. A high school lead-
ership team that was conversing about staff 
resistance to interdepartmental collaboration 
concluded that there were merits to some staff 
members’ advocacy of autonomy. During this 
conversation the facilitator offered the follow-
ing paraphrases:
•	
“Sam, you believe the complaints we’re 
getting are data worth examining.”
•	
“A value that we all hold is that all de-
partments working together will produce 
better results for all students.”
•	
“On the one hand, we want teaming, and 
on the other hand, we see the necessity for 
individual action.”
•	
“It sounds as if we want to honor autonomy 
in two ways, individuals and departments.”
The facilitator provided a “abstracting 
paraphrase” (chapter 4) to paraphrase the po-
larity: “Let me see if I can sum this up. We’re 
wondering how we might collaborate while 
also honoring individual autonomy.”
In this example the high school leadership 
team decided to create a collaboration-auton-
omy polarity map. Later they repeated this 
mapping process with the staff.
Agree on names for the poles. The names 
should be value-neutral and be agreed on by 
the group.
Write the pole names on the map. The 
polarity map is created on chart paper so that 
group members can see the map as it unfolds.
Brainstorm the content for each quadrant. 
Aim to write four to eight entries in each quad-

rant. Collect all ideas from the participants 
with- out judgment, criticism, or questions. 
Identify both upsides, asking, “What are some 
positives results or upsides of focusing on?” 
Then identify both downsides, asking, “What 
are the negatives of focusing on to the neglect 
of the other pole?” This order can be modified 
to meet individual and group needs. For exam-
ple, a group that values stability over change 
might need to brainstorm the upside of stability 
and the downside of change before being ready 
to move to mapping the upside of change. Op-
positional values and fears should be identified 
and respected as important.
Agree on a higher purpose and a deeper 
fear. Agreeing on a higher purpose and a deeper 
fear integrates oppositional views and pro- 
vides a reason to manage the tension between 
them. The higher purpose is the major benefit 
of managing the polarity well, and the deeper 
fear is the major negative result of not manag-
ing the polarity well. Again, use dialogue and 
the norms of collaboration.
The “abstracting paraphrase” is invaluable 
for integrating seemingly competing values and 
views, elevating conversations to a common 
higher purpose. For example, a middle school 
staff dialogue about student discipline became 
quite emotional, with members giving example 
after example of student misbehavior. Some 
staff members insisted that more suspensions 
and rules were necessary; others challenged 
this idea, stating that the students would just 
become resentful, passive-aggressive, and less 
willing to behave. They argued that their role 
was to support students in learning life skills 
for controlling themselves.
The chairman of the committee, who was 
acting as the facilitator, offered a “abstracting 
paraphrase”: “Some of us feel strongly about 
tightening the rules to get order, whereas some 
believe that students might need to be taught 
how to use their freedom to self- regulate. It is 
apparent that a goal we all hold is how to sup-
port the students in exhibiting more productive 
behavior.”
After additional conversation, the group 
agreed to map the structure-freedom polar-
ity, coming to the conclusion that both were 
necessary to encourage students’ productive 
behavior.
Dialogue about the completed polarity 
map and explore ways to maximize the upside 
of each pole and minimize the downside of 
each pole.
Understanding How  
Polarities Work
A polarity map appears as a static set of 
ideas in four labeled quadrants: positives and 
values in the upside of each pole, and nega-
tives and concerns in the downside of each 
pole. In fact, there is a predictable movement 
through a polarity situation, and we can en-
vision it with the polarity map. As polarities 
work, we can predict people’s movement 
from one pole to the other as they (a) antici-
pate or experience the downside of one pole, 
from which they want to move away, and (b) 
are attracted to the up- sides of the opposite 
pole, which they want to move toward. The 
downside of the pole they want to leave often 
becomes identified as the problem.
The upside of the opposite pole be- comes 
identified as the solution. However, for a po-
larity to be well managed, one must remain 
in the upside of both poles while avoiding the 
limitations of the downsides of both poles. The 
natural energy flow of a well-managed polarity 
is an infinity loop, with only a slight dip into 
the lower quadrants.
Facilitating Polarity Mapping
Facilitation provides the focusing, direct-
ing, and organizing features that are necessary 
for adult conversations to produce results for 
students. Facilitators manage group energy 
through attention to three areas: (a) helping 
members in active participation, and (c) focus-
ing group attention.

Polarity Management: Using Conflict as a Resource

Well-facilitated conversations around po-
larities and other diverse viewpoints produce 
the cognitive conflict and psychological safety 
that is necessary for highly productive dia-
logues that foster shared meanings, values and 
goals, and collective agreements.
The following are some principles and 
strategies that facilitators may use to support 
these conversations:

Grounding (a) sets a norm for respectful 
listening, (b) brings people to the present, 
(c) brings everyone’s voice into the room 
in a nonconfrontational way, (d) encour-
ages people to connect with one another, 
(e) allows for expression of hopes and 
apprehensions, (f) values thinking and 
feeling, and (g) brings hidden agendas to 
the surface.
•	
Greeting Circle. This is another ground-
ing activity in which each person greets 
and is greeted by another. In this process, 
everyone confronts the natural tension 
about greeting others. When participants 
are asked how they felt and what they 
learned, productive energy is released into 
the room.
•	
Address One Topic at a Time. There is a 
limit to what individuals and groups can 
attend to in the moment. When more than 
one topic is being discussed, the group 
lacks focus, and confusion reigns. Natu-
ral tensions are present when discussing 
polarities. Keeping the group focused on 
one topic and/or polarity at a time honors 
both the ideas and those who are gener-
ating them.
Group processes are vehicles for collective 
thinking. To brainstorm, to clarify, to analyze, 
and to evaluate require different mental opera-
tions. In order to use one process at a time, the 
facilitator must make sure that all group mem-
bers know what the process is, how it works, 
and why it is being used.
Facilitating Conversation About 
a Completed Polarity Map
Once a group has completed mapping a 
polarity on chart paper, a facilitated conversation 
offers group members the opportunity to view 
and explore the dilemma as a whole and from 
multiple perspectives. Furthermore, the group 
can now generate strategies for staying in the 
upsides of both poles while avoiding the down- 
sides. The norm of putting inquiry first supports 
the facilitator and the group members’ resource-
fulness and success in these conversations.
Here are some sample questions:
•	
As you reflect on our collective wisdom, 
what new learning and insights are emerg-
ing for you?
•	
Given our expanded perspective, what 
might be some benefits for managing this 
polarity well?
•	
What might be some higher purposes that 
will benefit all of our students?
•	
What might be some of our deepest fears if 
we fail to manage this polarity well?
•	
As we reflect on phrases in each quadrant, 
what might be some assumptions, values, 
or beliefs that are present?
•	
Given our desire to stay in the upsides of 
both poles, what are some strategies?
•	
What are some indicators that will tell us 
we are moving to the downside of a pole? 
Who will remind us, and how?
•	
What seems most important to all of us 
here?
•	
What might be some impacts of collabora-
tively mapping a polarity?
•	
What are your hunches about other polari-
ties that might exist in this situation?
•	
How might we apply this to other areas of 
our work?

Tips for Using Polarity Maps
•	
Remember that to pursue the benefits of 
one pole, you must also pursue the benefits 
of the other pole. The solution is not static.
•	
One possibility is to identify the indicators 
for each pole, which will let you know 
when you are experiencing its downside. 
Putting feedback mechanisms in place aids 
in managing the polarity. (Example: Using 
conversation maps and tools)
•	
Listen deeply and facilitate dialogue, espe-
cially with naysayers.
•	
Brainstorm strategies for staying in the 
upsides of both poles.

**Preface**

In the blink of a cosmic eye the technological developments from the atom bomb, cell phone, Internet, and ingestible cameras for medical research have brought profound changes. The individual and cumulative effects of these revolutionary developments liberate, endanger, connect, and separate us. Mass media, telecommunications, information technology, and artificial intelligence are changing our world and our very selves, as they bring us to new starting points for human and social development. This is a world in which serious conversations among researchers in the field of artificial intelligence urgently ask the questions: What is intelligence? What is the mind? Will machines wrest control from their human masters?

How do we cope with such an increasingly unpredictable world? To move with the flow of change we need to be able to let go of past assumptions and learn to think afresh. As change pushes us to make more decisions faster and faster, it becomes increasingly important not to fall into the trap of rushing our judgments or being seduced by the comfort of action. Complex problems always have simple solutions—that are usually wrong. Quality decisions require that we slow down and create the opportunity for insights and feelings to emerge in our awareness. Slowing to think, to inquire, to collaborate, to talk together about student learning is what biologists call an adaptive trait.

Adaptive traits have a current functional role in the life of an organism. In organizations, these traits maintain, sustain, and evolve by becoming normative forces that shape the behavior of managers and employees. This is not a simple matter, as this new normal requires support, monitoring, and indelible connection with values. The organization must remain viable at all stages of its development and within all phases of environmental change.

On a recent break from working with international educators in Mumbai, India, while wandering the alleyways and passageways of Dharavi, the locale for the movie *Slumdog Millionaire*, we wondered what adaptive traits might be keeping this multireligious, multiethnic, diverse settlement alive. With nearly one million people sardined into five hundred acres, these human beings are amazingly resourceful. Adaptivity is their essential human quality, enabled by self-conscious intelligence modifying either the conditions or themselves to such an extent that they can live at the extremes. People adapt and use their ingenuity and inventiveness to survive, but also to find meaning and purpose, and whatever degree of pleasure, even happiness, that humans may know.

We also wondered anew about the adaptive traits necessary for twenty-first-century schools to crest the waves of unrelenting change. From the first edition of this book in 1999 until now, the essential adaptive traits we have witnessed in many settings are the dispositions to inquire, to collaborate, and to talk about student learning and teachers’ roles in student enlight-

enment. These traits, and the instruments that serve them, have been sustainable and embraced internationally now for seventeen years. Teaching is a people business, and effective schools are settings in which people meet in the center of their practice. They meet as humans and with the practical and productive tools described in this book.

Regarding this third edition we especially appreciate the keen editing eyes of Jane Ellison, Carolee Hayes, Carolyn McKanders, and Wendy Ferguson and the invaluable assistance provided by Michael Dolcemascolo in refining this new organization and material on facilitator moves and strategies. And above all, we want to express gratitude to Sue Canavan, acquisitions editor and friend, who has guided this work through three editions now, and whose indefatigable spirit, encouragement, and problem-solving abilities have been indispensable in making this work available to readers.

We are eternally grateful to the many voices that have contributed to our learning, from schools around the world, from colleagues at Thinking Collaborative, and from the emerging research and knowledge in our profession. We remain committed to the notion that adaptation is a process requiring relatively small changes over time and those changes begin with us.

**Introduction**

This edition of *The Adaptive School* represents much of our learning about school systems and groups in the past twenty years as we have worked with educators in settings that span the globe. Although each school is unique, there are social patterns that are easily recognizable when people gather in groups to work together. Drawing on these experiences and looking at group work through the theoretical filters of biology, ecology, quantum physics, complexity science, systems thinking, and cognitive and social psychology, we offer a practical set of principles and tools for developing and facilitating collaborative groups.

*The Adaptive School* is about developing strong groups and schools in which collaborative faculties are capable of meeting the uncertain challenges of tomorrow. Some schools are flourishing. Others are making remarkable gains in improving student achievement, increasing attendance, attaining higher post-school accomplishments, and developing satisfying relationships with their communities. Some schools produce only fair results; others languish. We believe that all can be better.

As realists, we recognize that difficult and different challenges beset schools and communities in their quest to serve students. Issues differ from school to school. Urbanism and ruralism bring their own special problems. Defeatism, extremism, apathy, or politics infect some schools. Schools can become obsessed with ensuring predictable results or they can struggle to overcome the effects of extreme poverty, neglected children, or the burdens of ponderous bureaucracy. Money can bring its own problems. Some affluent communities lobby for traditional definitions of success at the expense of other needs. In some districts, the teachers and students struggle daily with inadequate and outdated materials and facilities. In some settings, faculty turnover is so frequent it is difficult to maintain a collaborative core. Regardless of the nature of the issues, it is our premise that the means for improvement exist within the school community. The practical ideas in this book show how to activate these resources if they are dormant and focus them if they are scattered.

We believe that leadership is important, and that the most effective leadership is widely distributed, informed, and deeply developed. To be adaptive and meet the demands of omnipresent change requires more than linear thought, old problem-solving formulas, and recycled strategic plans. In the work of school improvement, human energy matters as much as the elements of good management do—maybe more.

**How to Use This Book**

This book is informed by the central notion of adaptivity, five principles of complex systems, and focusing questions that bring attention to the fundamental issues of capacity building in schools. (See sidebar.) These ideas are initially introduced in part I and elaborated in the remaining chapters. They form the conceptual backbone of the chapters and provide a

Below the quote, the main text is divided into two columns:

**Left Column:**
School reform has been a topic of study for much of the history of formal schooling. These generations of inquiry continue to influence present practices in both productive and, in many cases, nonproductive ways. Traditional views and linear designs for organizing learning limit our ability to see schools as complex systems of interacting parts, each influencing the others.

This opening section of the book reveals a glimpse of the patterns and emerging evolution of thinking related to significant human achievements, including the education of children and youth. We make the case that clockwork thinking has driven most organizational innovation, especially in the ways reformers think about school change. These habits of technical thought guided the exploration of the ancient world and even now the exploration of space. We propose that newer sciences are revealing a fresh way of thinking about complex organizations, including schools, and offer promise for working with the perennial challenges in schooling. Here we offer a definition of adaptivity, explore its importance to education, and present a short version of how groups operate with it as a driving principle.

**Right Column:**
Here we provide a brief history of school improvement efforts. Our thinking is informed by constructivist psychology, quantum mechanics, complexity theory, fractal geometry, evolutionary biology, and systems thinking as new ways of looking at schools. Here we address several issues: Why adaptivity is important to schools, what adaptive leaders do to support sustainable change, and what both formal and informal leaders can do to support adaptivity in their schools.

We also explore the limits of traditional leadership and comment on emerging understandings of the role of the adaptive leader.

**Chapter 1**  What is an Adaptive School?

An adaptive school is neither a place, nor a program, neither a leader nor a structure. Rather, it is the application of two lenses, one for “things” and one for “energy” to examine learning and the organic systems in which it thrives. Central to these lenses is a dual focus held by leaders—leaders not just in the traditional sense of assigned authority, but including those passionate enough to step forward and lead from any role when conditions favor such emergence. These dual perspectives might be found in a grade-level group, a department, a cross disciplinary team, a school, or an entire district. The lens for “thing” focuses on the basic stuff of good management. “Thing” ways of seeing and working get the details handled, the bills paid, and the buses running on time and making the right stops in the right neighborhoods. “Thing” thinking is the historical foundation of management systems in modern organizations.

The second leadership perspective focuses on energy. Margaret Wheatley (1992) observed that the quality of human relationships creates the energy that produces work. This interdependence, noted by Wheatley, studied by Louis, Marks, and S. Kruse (1996) and examined in high performing groups by Woolley and colleagues (2010) is an essential energy for school success. Other important energies are the energies of commitment, will, efficacy, craftsmanship, consciousness, and others. With the additional lenses explored in this book, leaders in all roles can identify, enhance, and concentrate these energies on the moral mission of schools.

The revolution in physics called quantum mechanics clarifies the essential distinctions between matter and energy and simultaneously blurs the line between them. The very term *quantum mechanics* means bundles of energy (quantum) in motion (mechanics) (Capra, 1991). This book describes ways to shape this energy through the liberating structures of collaborative norms, well-organized meetings, new frames for conflict, and communication practices that make a difference for student learning.

As Richard Elmore (1995) reminds us, the real work of changing schools lies not in changing things, but in changing norms, knowledge, and skills (energy) at the individual and organizational levels. In fact, without new norms, knowledge, and skills, structural changes such as block scheduling, site-based decision-making, multiage classrooms, and inclusive classrooms will have little or no effect on student learning.

In adaptive organizations, leaders pay attention to both things and energy and to the flow and interchange of energy and information. Energy becomes an avenue to attainment. We will expand on this idea in chapter 3 with descriptions of four leadership roles, in chapter 8 with an elaboration on the role of facilitator,

THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL

and in chapter 10, in which we will describe five invisible sources of high performance.

**Adaptive, Not Adapted**

Evolutionary biology is the source for a central notion in our work: adaptivity. To be *adaptive* means to change form in concert with clarifying identity. This is quite different from being *adapted*, which means to have evolved through specialization to fit specific conditions within tightly defined boundaries.

Monarch butterflies are a good example of an adapted species. As we write this, the monarch has been added to the endangered species list. Across North America, the summer fields sparkle with their flight. Monarchs, as most schoolchildren learn, lay their eggs only on milkweed plants. When the larvae hatch, they feed on the milkweed leaves, growing and developing until it is time to spin a chrysalis that is attached to the milkweed plant. The larvae metamorphose into adult butterflies, and the cycle repeats. Without milkweed there would be no monarchs. The monarch’s nutritional and habitat needs are firmly adapted to this one type of plant.

An example of adaptivity within a species can be found on another continent. As primatologists study the social lives of chimpanzee groups, they discover a remarkable range of behaviors within individuals and within populations that are isolated from one another. They are now using the term *culture* to describe variations in food-gathering techniques that include prepositioning hammer stones for cracking nuts in anticipation of ripening, using grass stalks as tools to fish termites from holes, and sharpening sticks to use as thrusting spears when hunting small monkeys. These cultural variations spread through local populations and to the next generation but remain unique to a given region.

Organizations, like species, also need to contend with adapting to changing environments. This usually means letting go of existing *forms* and continually clarifying the core *iden-*

-tity* of the enterprise. As we write this volume, the United States Post Office is struggling for relevancy. Years of deficit budgets have coincided with changes in the ways people communicate. E-mails, texts, Twitter, Skype calls, and other digital innovations have eroded the Post Office’s dominance in the communication field. Today, they are reasserting their place in the economy with a change in form, and in identity. “Our former identity,” an official told us, “was *connecting people*. You write your grandmother a letter. In a couple of days she gets it. Today people have all these other ways of connecting. So our emerging identity is *connecting goods*. We are cheaper than FedEx or UPS and are the delivery service for Amazon.” The Post Office is changing its form, eliminating a fleet of planes, handling more packages than letters, with big-brother data everywhere clocking the time people spend in line, and how long it takes a driver to get out of the truck at a stop. “FedEx drivers,” he told us, “are disciplined if they spend too much time backing up” because studies show backing is less efficient than moving forward.

One of the most significant changes in form and identity in schools has been the relatively recent transformation of the role of the school librarian. This was first brought to our attention several years ago at a seminar we were conducting, when a participant stopped by at a break to share her struggles with this issue. As the head librarian for a medium-sized school district, she described all of the professional changes she had experienced since completing her master’s degree in library science in the early 1970s. As a supervisor, she supported several librarians who were also struggling with similar changes. She noted that as librarians they were taught to be quality filters and to stock the shelves with reliable and authoritative reference materials. When students and teachers asked for resources, the librarians were able to supply the best sources available and took professional pride in knowing and having these materials on hand.

**Why Adaptivity Matters to Schools**

To address this question we must first address the differences between technical change (fixing an ordinary problem without altering the system) and adaptive change (fixing a problem by disrupting the system), for in truth, adaptivity matters when one’s goal is sustainable change. Educational literature is replete with dramatic stories of change; a heroic principal turns around an underperforming school, a superintendent promotes reforms that raise the test scores in a middle-class district, a special ed director causes improvements in math scores for students whose teachers she directs. Inevitably, these dramatic accounts of progress realized by treating adaptive challenges as technical ones reverse course, and gains made during a brief period of charismatic attention return to a status quo.

Sustainable change is, of course, an oxymoron unless it is understood that healthy change efforts include a period of refinement and revision as educators seek to bring the changes into alignment with best possible benefits for students. Mutation monitoring is a process in which leaders monitor application practices that differ from the adopted innovation, eliminate those that interfere with program fidelity, and expand on those that provide better mechanisms to achieve program goals.

Sustainable change is driven by moral clarity, only possible with adaptive approaches, and only realized when identity is clear. CVS Pharmacy is changing its name to CVS Health as it shifts its emphasis to promote health in line with its emerging identity. It is banning cigarette sales from its stores and, as reported by Hakim at the *New York Times* (2015), recently resigning from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce because of that institution’s position against antismoking laws.

**Using Fresh Lenses and New Skills**

Technical challenges, differ from adaptive ones in that the problems are easy to identify, may lead to quick and easy solutions, can sometimes be solved by edict, and rarely address the root causes of problems. Adaptive change, however, requires a systems view, asks for changes in values, is difficult to identify, easy to deny, requires altering numerous arenas within the organization, needs people with the problem to resolve it, and requires experimental thinking. In the medical field, if high blood pressure is the problem, taking blood pressure medicine is an example of technical change while moving to a healthier lifestyle would be a more adaptive approach. Managing schools calls for both kinds of change. Examples of problems requiring technical change are altering bus routings to reduce time students are in transit, improving the win record of a high school sports team, or changing the start times of school even with the resulting challenges this brings to other aspects of the program such as student schedules, after-school work opportunities, and athletic practices. Sending a person to the moon and performing open-heart surgery are often offered as examples of complicated problems needing technical change and linear reasoning.

In contrast adaptive changes require nonlinear thought, attention to an ever-changing environment, ownership of the problem by the people closest to it, fearless inquiry, and addressing values conflicts. In schools, improving the reading performance of primary students, achieving a student body committed to inquiry, or eliminating bullying requires adaptive change.

The same problem can be viewed from either lens. One school confronting the challenge of receiving a passing mark on a tenth-grade state literacy test focused its remedial efforts

**The Peripatetic Pivot Point**

Successful sea captains must apply adaptive competence, explains P. F. Willerton in *Basic Ship Handling for Master, Mates and Pilots* (1980). There is no formula for ship handling, but an array of forces that must be monitored lest the captain be caught off guard. Tide, displacement, wind, and current can all cause a ship to pivot, and the captain must be able to anticipate these forces and tap into learning from past experience in order to skillfully move the vessel forward.

The tricky thing about the pivot point is that the location of the pivot point changes from moment to moment because the *location of the pivot point* of a boat that is underway *depends on how or even whether the boat is already moving relative to the water that it is in contact with at that moment.*

Added to the complexity of ship handling is the reality that ships do not have brakes. An anchor helps when a ship is moving slowly, but a ship can still move forward even with its anchor dropped. This increases the importance of monitoring forces, as well as how forces interact with one another. For example, given that part of the vessel is underwater, if the current is moving faster than the wind, the water will exert more force than the air. This knowledge of which forces are exerting the most impact informs the captain’s decision-making regarding steering and adjustments.

Schools are much like ships, requiring monitoring forces rather than following a formula. Anchorage District principal Deanna Beck (Lt. Commander, U.S. Coast Guard Reserve) told us how she prioritizes forces as a leader. “It depends on your speed,” she replied. If you’re going fast you’ll have to pay attention to what will have the biggest impact on your vessel and what else is going on in the environment. When coming into San Francisco Bay, for example, she first makes note of anything nearby such as trees or buildings, then figures out how fast she’s going. With that collective information she can determine whether the wind or water is having more force, and how to adapt accordingly (Beck, 2015; Whiteley, 2015).

on boosting the achievement of students who were falling just below a failing grade. Another school facing the same situation concentrated its efforts on improving literacy for all students for the long run. Teachers worked together to improve their practices and engaged the community with a full month emphasis on literacy skills. In the second school, results for the first year were not dramatic, but by the third year the school had become the district’s second-highest scoring school (Hargreaves and Fink, 2004). In the first example, the school treated an adaptive challenge as a technical one and got quick but nonsustainable change.

One emerging, messy issue for schools that requires adaptive change is that a sustained emphasis on information and communication technologies has significantly influenced students and their school experience. At a restaurant the other night we watched a three-year-old competently manage an iPod. Ian Jukes (2006) notes that kids’ brains are being changed because of intense sustained experience (seven days a week, several hours a day) with the digital world. Some observe that the average working memory space might be less today than when we were students. How many phone numbers do you know other

### Main Text (Partial Transcription):

Beyond the issues of sustainability, and a rapidly changing environment, another reason adaptivity is important is that schools are complex systems, and, while it is not possible to change such systems, it is possible to disturb them. A complex system is one in which tiny events cause major disturbances (the butterfly effect in meteorology or the paraphrase in social systems); everything affects everything else (on days when David is absent, everything goes better in class); you don’t have to touch everyone to make a difference (six teachers changed the work culture of an entire school by being publicly polite in public places); and both things and energy matter (while things like new books are important, more important are effort, caring, and commitment).

Complicated systems, on the other hand, lack the interactive characteristics of complex ones and can be changed through edict and linear logic. Performing brain surgery is an example of working in a complicated system.

Managing a marriage represents a complex system challenge (Cuban, 2010; Garmston and Wellman, 2013).

Schools are nonlinear systems in which cause and effect are not tightly linked. In nonlinear systems, the parts do not add up to the same sum each time they are combined. Fresh combinations result in different outcomes. For teachers, the curriculum combines with instructional and assessment practices to support student learning. Yet every school year turns out differently as the pedagogical mix blends with a new crop of students.

A blend of regularity and irregularity shapes nonlinear systems, producing patterns of stability and instability. Critical choice points present new possibilities and new forms of order. Instability permits creative life in school systems. The self-organizing interactions between people develop feedback loops that recur and amplify across the scale of the organization. Changes in such systems may be unexpected.

Self-organization develops through meaningful adult interactions about students, student work, and the purposes and processes of schooling. To be productive, such interactions must be infused with and guided by shared values and norms of collaboration. The environment must encourage reflection, inquiry, challenge, and deprivatization of practice for both teachers and administrators. This in turn requires skills in dialogue, discussion, planning, and problem solving. At times the work...

is messy and nonrational. Habitual, linear ways of thinking will work for some issues but not for the increasingly complex and ill-structured problems that beset many schools today.

**Principles of Complex or Dynamical System Change**

In the early 1950s a trucking magnate named Malcolm McLean and his colleagues began the process that produced the shipping-container industry that we know today, revolutionizing costs as cargo handling at either end of the voyage produced as much as 50 percent of the costs of moving goods (Levinson, 2006). McLean was not limited by the identity of being a trucker. He realized that he was in the moving goods business and that trucks, trains, and ships could work in harmony to move material if that material was placed in uniform-sized containers and a supporting infrastructure facilitated the rapid deployment of these containers across the globe.

His innovations rapidly reduced the costs of moving goods and negated the need to have sources of production and storage close to ports. The waterfronts of the world swiftly shed manufacturing industries, and warehouses were transformed into high-status housing and recreation areas in many locales. In 1964 the five boroughs of New York City were home to manufacturing concerns that employed nearly 900,000 workers. By the mid-1970s more than one-third of those jobs were gone. Cheap transportation motivated the search for cheaper labor and lower manufacturing costs. Distance was no longer an obstacle to commerce. This example illuminates five underlying principles, described below, that guide adaptive systems such as the shipping industry, weather systems, and schools.

1. **More data do not lead to better predictions.** Malcolm McLean did not need to know all the economic data points about the industries that were his customers. He merely needed sufficient data about his own business and the appropriate metrics to guide his business plans. Meteorologists have more data than at any time in history, yet their radars and computer models lose meaning beyond a four-day window. Many schools we work with are data-rich and meaning-poor. They collect endless surveys and pore over spreadsheets but don’t take the time to dialogue and make meaning from their experiences and the knowledge they have within them.

2. **Everything influences everything else.** The rise of the shipping container made the economic boom possible both in Asia and for Wal-Mart and other big-box discount stores. These forces have fueled growing prosperity as well as environmental damage across the globe. In weather systems, temperature changes affect wind patterns, which affect precipitation patterns, which in turn influence climate changes, including droughts and floods. In schools, the affective climate of the building and classrooms influences how adults feel about their work, the energy they invest, and the academic results for students.

3. **Tiny events create major disturbances.** Putting a stack of boxes in and on ships is in many ways a tiny event. Yet this simple revolution has changed economies throughout the world, changed labor relations by making loading ships highly technical skilled work, and changed the balance of power as emerging countries flex their new financial and political muscles. As tropical storms develop off the coast of the African continent and swing across the Atlantic Ocean and into the Caribbean Sea, encountering water that is as little as one-fourth degree warmer tips the storm into a raging hurricane. In collaborative groups, a participant who is skilled in paraphrasing and inquiry opens up the thinking of others and deepens the meaning that these conversations produce.

4. **You don’t have to touch everyone in the system to make a difference.** Malcolm McLean

didn’t have to run around the globe and get all the policymakers and decision makers in place and on board before starting his venture. He designed some sturdy boxes, converted some old tanker ships, and built some special cranes at the sending and receiving ports. The rest of the system responded over time to these innovations. Weather systems affect behaviors by their mere presence. Whether these systems are hot or cold, wet or dry, environments and organisms respond to these influences without the right to vote. In the same way, a school culture shapes the behavior of its members. That is why school cultures are so tenacious in the face of personnel changes. The real work of school improvement, then, is the work of “reculturing” by shaping the norms, beliefs, and values of those cultures. We’ve consulted with several international schools on this for whom this is a special challenge.

5. **Both things and energy matter.** Ships, boxes, cranes, trucks, and trains are all things. They have to work together in a timely fashion to move the goods that move the economy. They also represent the energy of commerce—the innovating, buying, selling, and improving of products that engage human minds and imaginations. Wind, sun, and rain are all tangible phenomena, but it is the energy they contain and transmit that moves windmills, sprouts plants, and produces waterfalls. Schools require books and bells, halls and balls, but again it is the energy of caring and commitment that moves minds and produces learning.

**How Schools Become Adaptive**
So far we have discussed the importance of adaptivity and the need to clarify identity, both as individuals and as organizations, without clinging to outmoded forms. We’ve suggested a rationale for why this is important by framing schools as nonlinear, complex, dynamical systems in which cause-and-effect linkages are not so easily drawn. We will now briefly describe how schools can achieve this. The chapters that follow will expand, elaborate on, and share many of the concrete tools we have learned to use from our work with successful schools.

For readers that prefer to see the big picture, figure 1.1 gives an overview of concepts that follow in this book.

**A Short Course in Adaptivity: Focusing Questions**
We encourage departments, committees, councils, and faculties to reflect frequently on three focusing questions: (a) Who are we? (b) Why are we doing this? and (c) Why are we doing this this way? The byproduct of this reflection is action for improving student learning.

**Who Are We?**
Principal Kathy Dunton of Vine Hills Elementary School in California told us that these three questions transformed her school. She encourages teachers and parents to ask them frequently and to explore them in depth. The question “Who are we?” leads directly to the issue of identity. This issue forces the related questions of “About what do we care?” and “How much do we dare?” The form taken by a school, team, department, or teacher’s assignment is less important than identity. Identity represents the story that a group tells itself to organize its values and beliefs. A group’s beliefs determine its behavior. Collectively, its behavior affects student learning (Dilts, 1994). (See chapter 10.)

Identity cannot be found in a mission statement. It displays itself in hallways, faculty lounges, meeting minutes, and student academic results. Identity reveals itself in periods of stress: What a group strives to preserve or fights to protect describes its identity. The very definitions of success, the awards and rewards

THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL

for both students and staff members, symbolize driving values and beliefs.

**Why Are We Doing This?**
Folk wisdom, tradition, and unexamined habit rule much of what schools do. The agricultural calendar, factory schedules, and athletic practices continue to frame yearly and daily time use. Bus schedules and teacher contracts exert powerful and often unexamined influences on student learning. Yet these and other features of school life go unquestioned. “It’s just the way we do things around here,” one is told when bold enough to inquire.

A classic story captures the essence of this issue. A little girl, watching her mother prepare a ham for the oven, wanted to know why her mommy was cutting the end off before placing it in the roasting pan. “I don’t really know,” her mother replied, “That’s the way my mommy did it.”

So the little girl went to see her grandmother and asked her why she cut the end off the ham before putting it in the roasting pan. “I don’t really know,” her grandmother replied, “That’s the way my mommy did it.”

So the little girl went to see her great-grandmother and asked her why she cut the end off the ham off before putting it in the roasting pan. “Well,” the old woman explained, stretching her arms wide, “I grew up on the prairie in a little sod house, and our hams were this big.” Bringing her hands closer together, she concluded, “And our oven was this big. We had to cut the end off the ham to fit it in the oven.”

In many settings, educators continue to “cut the end off the ham” long after the original rationale has passed. The deep structure of schooling is set on foundations of “hams and end scraps” from earlier eras. Unquestioned assumptions form the “ovens” in which they “cook.” Many current practices are rooted in beliefs about the need for power and control over others and over resources (Sarason, 1990). Such beliefs were at the heart of the management literature during most of the 1800s and 1900s. They are the source of conflicts over curriculum and at the center of most tensions around any form of shared decision making. The question “Why are we doing this?” brings attention and choice to practices that have become unquestioned habits.

**Why Are We Doing This This Way?**
The “this” that we are doing could be grouping students for instruction, developing learning experiences, or deciding time allotments for activities. This last question, valued so highly by California principal Kathy Dunton, brings focus not to the what and why of the activity but to the how. Walk through any school with a notebook in hand, because this question will have you scribbling rapidly.

The daily schedule is a good starting point. Anyone who has observed the sleeping and waking patterns of adolescents knows that 8:00 a.m. is not peak time for anything not conducted in a prone position, yet district schedules organized by transportation patterns typically have high schools starting around that hour. On the other hand, many five- and six-year-olds are up and bustling, ready to get on with the new day. Schools might, in fact, have the daily time schedule for the various levels of schooling in reverse order from what would be a better fit with physical development patterns.

The question “Why are we doing this this way?” could be restated as, “Who benefits from the current system?” Exploring this form of the question provides insight into the forces that keep current practices in place. As Kathy Dunton found, these three focusing questions open up new ways of seeing school practices. Once revealed, they can be acted on and modified. Left unexamined, they keep the institutional drivers on autopilot and the “map” stuffed in the “glove compartment.”

place in it. The Aboriginal people of Australia believe that their land is covered with a web of invisible pathways. These “dreaming-tracks” or “songlines” first appeared during the Tjukurpa (djook-oor-pah) or “Dreamtime,” when ancestral beings wandered over the featureless landscape, singing the world into existence. These totemic ancestors sang out the name of everything that crossed their path. They sang out the names of plants, animals, rocks, rivers, salt pans, and waterholes, coding and wrapping the world in a web of song (Chatwin, 1987).

When an Aboriginal mother is pregnant and feels the baby kick for the first time, she calls the shaman to identify that child’s totemic spirit guide. Physical features at the site of the kick are then interpreted, and the spirit of the child—the child’s “dreaming”—is thus identified. This dreaming can be one of any number of mammals, insects, birds, or reptiles. As the child grows, he or she learns the song of this spirit guide. Coded into the song are the features of the local landscape—where to find food, water, shelter, and safe travel routes. Song is the oldest mnemonic device, far easier for a nomad to carry than any road atlas.

An Aborigine who goes “walkabout” on a journey of discovery or on a hunting foray calls on this song to guide him or her. Along one’s “songline,” one has safe passage, meeting others who share the dreaming along the way. Memory carries the traveler to the limits of the song. At the boundaries Aborigines meet and, through ritual, swap songs. This sharing relationship extends the territory of each and binds one to another through song.

To find new territory and new routes, we all need to learn new songs. This earth and its workings are not as we were once taught. At the limits of our songs, we need one another so that we can be adaptive in a world made of bundles of energy in motion.

**Chapter 2  The Context**

When pioneering navigators first sailed from the coasts of Asia, Africa, and Europe, they were guided by their dreams, the stars, and primitive compasses—sailing into territories marked on their fanciful charts as unknown lands and seas of mystery. Undoubtedly many in the ships’ crews cast apprehensive glances at familiar receding shores, trusting in the soundness of their vessel and the courage and skills of their leaders. Their affects were legion: some were destructive, decimating indigenous cultures and native ecologies; others were constructive, made possible by the forces of technical change, the same forces that propelled a satellite in a flyby of the dwarf planet Pluto in July 2015.

Their tools, by today’s standards were primitive: the compass, the sextant, the quadrant to measure the altitude and angle of celestial bodies, and primitive maps of the world and its seas. Incredibly, the same class of scientific thinking, admittedly more sophisticated, directed the twenty-first-century spacecraft passing Pluto, sending images back over three billion miles from its nine-and-a-half-year journey. This form of thinking has also governed approaches to school change for hundreds of years. It was present in the early life of kindergartens in 1900, the introduction of “scientific management” during the period 1900 to 1925, an approach introduced in industry by Francis Taylor. Scientific management promoted the virtues of efficiency and time management.

Taylor’s educational followers saw teachers as workers requiring direct supervision to meet predetermined goals. Edward Thorndike, another researcher committed to efficiency, introduced standardized testing, including intelligence testing adopted by the U.S. Army beginning in 1900. In 1948 one of these authors graduated eighth grade, the same year the National Commission on School District Reorganization proposed to eliminate the one-room schoolhouses, thereby reducing the country’s 115,000 districts to five thousand.

Efforts to study and improve curriculum were launched by twenty men in 1930, eventually leading to the formation of the Association of Supervision and Curriculum Development, still a dominant force in staff development. Major attempts to reform secondary education occurred during the period 1933 to 1941. According to Tyack and Cuban (1995) this “Eight Year Study” allowed students to attend courses that crossed departmental boundaries. The first “In Service Workshops” emerged during this era. The effects of the Eight Year Study declined as reformers responding to the perceived threats of World War II and the Cold War advocated for more authoritarianism in school organizations. Technical thinking drove efforts in innovation throughout the period from 1930 into the 1950s. Later, during the 1980s and 1990s the effective schools research led to lists, inventories, and an emphasis on behaviorist psychology with rewards and sanctions as the means to school improvement.

  - The text begins by critiquing the NCLB Act for being insensitive to schools as systems, leading to unintended consequences such as increased time for reading and math at the expense of other subjects and recess. It mentions that teacher pay became linked to student test scores, causing unrest among parents and teachers.
  - The author references Goldstein (2014), who notes that education is uniquely scrutinized compared to other professions and that public school teaching is now one of the most controversial professions in America.
  - Sergiovanni (1994) is quoted, stating, “Schools are not fast food chains or armies,” emphasizing that schools are more like families or religious organizations.
  - The text traces the shift toward a human relations orientation in education by 1925, advocating for more democratic treatment of teachers and administrators.
  - The RAND change-agent study from the late 1970s is mentioned, highlighting three principles of school change: staff efficacy, participation in decision-making, and simultaneous top-down and bottom-up change efforts.
  - The text then discusses the meta-analysis of school improvement designs by various authors and the formation of the Institute for Research on Learning (IRL), which contributed to the “Seven Principles” of learning and the idea of communities of practice.
  - The late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries saw research focus on trust, professional communities, collaboration, and teacher efficacy.

Today, we enter a new world, personally, in education and in the broader environment. Innovation, new opportunities, and challenges confront us: from fMRI studies of the brain to proposals by Amazon to use drones to get products to customers more speedily. Our personal and organizational maps for this new world are in many ways incomplete. What we most need to develop are the mental, emotional, and social tools for finding our way in these shifting landscapes. We also need new lenses to see the world not as a reflection of ourselves, but as images of the many possibilities within the human landscape, and to grasp a more complex understanding of how change occurs.

New lenses lead to unfamiliar tools that help us to see fresh sights, think new thoughts, and do new things. For productive school improvement efforts, many of these new tools are both cognitive and cultural. How we think influences the ways that we work together. How we work together influences the ways that we think about that work. This book explores the previously unfamiliar lens of adaptivity as it relates to improving our schools.

**Adaptivity in a Complex System**

In the summer of 2015, we witnessed a grey wolf and two grizzly bears maneuvering over an elk carcass, brought down that morning by the wolf. What we learned is that the elk is an adaptive animal, changing its habits according to environmental conditions. Elk move into heavy timber when wolves are around and return to grassy meadow when wolves are absent. The return of the grey wolf to Yellowstone National Park triggered a trophic cascade among animals and plants (Yellowstone Wolf Project, Annual Report 2013).

In 1995 grey wolves were reintroduced to the park after nearly a seventy-year absence. Technical thinking in the 1930s led to the extermination of park wolves, because they were believed to be bad for the survival of elk. Elk are also prey for bears and at that time cougars, but the culprit focused on by park managers was the grey wolf. With wolves gone and less predatory pressure on the elk, herds grew so large as to become unsustainable because of insufficient food; many elk grew sick and died as they over-grazed pastures. The park, like schools, is an ecosystem in which everything affects everything else. Elk populations grew, and without the predatory pressure from wolves, didn’t move around much in the winter, instead feeding heavily on aspen, cottonwood plants, and willow. Beavers need willow to survive in the winter. Because the elk felt safe from the wolves, giving them no need to move, willow were over-browsed leading the beaver population’s decrease to one colony.

Today, with the grey wolf back, elks keep on the move, and healthier willow stands enable nine beaver colonies to thrive in the restored habitat. More beavers mean more dams and ponds, with multiple effects on stream hydrology. The dams even out the seasonal pulses of runoff, store water for recharging the water table, and provide cold, shaded water for fish, while newly robust willow stands provide habitat for songbirds. Scavengers that once relied on winter-killed elk for food now depend on wolf-killed elk. That benefits ravens, eagles, magpies, coyotes, and bears (grizzly and black), especially as the bears emerge hungry from hibernation. Wolf kills also affect beetles, wolverine, lynx, and other species.

would immediately trigger a host of chemical, physical, and emotional reactions. Modern humans still possess automatic routines for Pleistocene-era problems and like frogs in warming water, can’t sense the change until it is too late.

The fast reflexes that supported our hunting and gathering ancestors will not help educators develop the forms of schools and schooling that we need in this new era. These demands require new minds and models that are better suited for the challenges of today. Most of all, educators need new sensitivities that can discern what is not readily apparent to the senses and help to craft new ways of improving schools for the journey ahead.

**Adaptive Leaders**

*When the task is done, the people will say we did it ourselves.*

—Lau Tzu, describing the best leader (Tzu’s Tao Te Ching, c. 500 BC)

---

Traditional, views of leadership are less and less useful given the complexities of our modern world. Never-ending reform efforts, ongoing political challenges to schools, and rapid social and technological change strain systems organized as hierarchies. At no time has the need for adaptivity been so urgent, requiring both protection and questioning of the status quo, orchestrating conflict to press for richer levels of understanding and action, and developing capacities for provocative leadership in all members of an organization. As both stability and change are needed, the adaptive leader is both a member of a group and an observer of the group and its environment. Teachers, school and department heads, and students can all lead adaptively.

One of the demands of adaptive leadership is the need to mobilize people to take on difficult challenges. Such leadership is grounded in the idea that prevailing issues in schools are often addressed unsuccessfully because of insufficient knowledge, skills, and values (Zoller, Lahera, and Noremore, 2015). Adaptive leadership activates new perspectives and builds on the past, helping people determine what is worth preserving and what is productive to question (Heifetz and Linsky, 2002). “Who are we?” “Why are we doing this?” and “Why are we doing this, this way?” (chapter 1) are potent questions, stimulating adaptivity. As such, successful adaptive changes build on the past rather than ignoring it making successful adaptations both conservative and progressive.

Mobilization includes developing faculties for cultures of inquiry and collaboration. Adaptive leaders patiently cultivate the social skills of professional capital, by nurturing the skills sets for dialogue, discussion, productive conflict, and pushing teachers to continually explore the relationship between curriculum, pedagogy, and student learning. Mobilization, too, involves developing in faculties a sense of system awareness and discernment between technical and adaptive challenges. Technical problems are head and shoulders issues, adaptive changes are processed lower in the gut (Linsky and Zoller, 2015).

Adaptive challenges are issues that, in the beginning, others do not recognize as problems. It is the adaptive leader that brings heat to the system, and structures responses in such a way that the people who have the problem do the work. These leaders sell the problem and not the solution.

Because adaptive change is disruptive, leaders also support people in navigating the change. Rather than resisting change, according to Heifetz and Linsky, people resist loss. This is congruent with Bridges’s (1980) seminal work on transitions in which people inevitably move through three psychological zones related to change—endings, where loss is profoundly experienced, a neutral zone of disorientation, and finally new beginnings in which leaders focus people on the process of achieving outcomes, not the outcomes themselves. Because these first two are normal reactions to change, and because, uninformed, many feel there is something wrong with them when they experience

the emotions of loss and disorientation, the adaptive leader helps normalize the processes and offers tools for making the psychological changes necessary.

We have found these questions useful with groups experiencing adaptive change (Garmston, 2004).
- What is over and what is not?
- What do you value and want to continue? As individuals and as a group, what can we do to support ourselves through changes?
- What are some areas in which we might need to tap into our creativity?
- What are some areas in which we might need to manage the chaos of transition?
- If this phase of life for this school looks like clouds, what might be some silver linings?

Viewing the system and system change from the balcony is an essential trait of leadership. We have watched countless examples of skilled quarterbacks, in the middle of the action, appear seemingly calm as they scan the field looking for possible receivers. In the immediacy, the quarterback is sensitive to burly bodies hurling his way allowing him to step aside to avoid them, while the balcony view affords an understanding of the whole play. Every leader, according to Heifetz and Linsky (2002), should routinely climb to the balcony over their organization to survey, study, and to gain perspective on what is going on and determine needed adjustments. School leaders, too, operate from these multiple perspectives—participating in the group, modeling new behaviors, embracing learning and risk taking, keeping ears to the ground in private conversations, and moving to the balcony in meetings and in reflections as they consider progress of their unit as a whole.

Consistent with the values, goals, and tools of Adaptive Schools, we increasingly witness the following adaptive leadership practices in schools, departments, and grade-level teams.

- Reframing the leader’s job from that of problem-solver to problem framers and developer of problem solvers.
- Asking the important, tough questions without having the answers.
- Knowing how to help people learn, not by telling, but by understanding the perceptions, beliefs, and values that drive their action, and helping them to plug into alternative, more agile ways of thinking.
- Fostering reflection and big-picture thinking, slowing down to move the action forward.
- Demonstrating and modeling consciousness, efficacy, flexibility, and courage.
- And, finally, seeking or being open to coaching, a practice consistent with world-renowned classical musicians and professional dancers as well as professional athletes in team and individual sports.

It seems the critical question is no longer, “How to manage change?” rather, the current question asked by Heifetz and Linsky (2002) is, “How to lead adaptive change.”

As educators, authors, and consultants, we are actively exploring new possibilities and developing ways of thinking about adult interactions in schools. Our own thinking is influenced by the emerging sciences of quantum mechanics, complexity theory, fractal geometry, evolutionary biology, and systems thinking as they apply to social organizations. We are also influenced by constructivist psychology, as it relates to learning and leadership: and our personal histories in a variety of roles in education—teacher, curriculum consultant, staff developer, principal, superintendent, and professor; and our current work as consultants with schools throughout North America, and schools in Australia, Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and India.

Developing shared expertise and working with common purpose are vividly present in the schools that are beating the odds and making a difference for student learning internationally and in North America.

How teachers talk affects how students learn. Loaded with practical tools, this section of the book underscores how the will to make a difference in the lives of students is more important than school structures, buildings, textbooks, or lab materials. When this will is collective, school teams can overcome many obstacles to student learning.

Drawing from essential research findings from the 1980s to the present and the work on professional capital by Hargreaves and Fullan (2012) we emphasize the increasing importance of developing strong professional communities in schools.

Part II makes the case that the Adaptive Schools’ models and tools serve two major underpinnings of professional capital: developing human capital and enhancing social capital. In this section, we introduce ways to develop seven norms for collaborative work as expected patterns of behavior in all school communications: in groups, in hallway conversations, with students, and with parents. Importantly, we provide descriptions of the metacognitive skills for being an effective group member, which cannot be found in other literature as far as we can discern. This role, in our experience, is more crucial to group success than having a skilled facilitator. Here we distinguish the role of the group leader from that of the facilitator. The group leader is the person with knowledge and/or role authority and in many situations should not be facilitating the meeting or work session. Finally, we offer a simple model for helping participants be clear about their intentions during group conversations. These Two Ways of Talking give focus and structure to conversations that flow from dialogue to discussion to decisions that stay made.

The layout is clean and professional, with a horizontal line at the top separating the chapter heading from the main text. The chapter number and title are prominently displayed:

**Chapter 3**  
**The Importance of Professional Community**
---

The main text begins with a large, stylized "T" as the first letter of the chapter. The content discusses the meaning and significance of the term "professional community" in the context of school working cultures. It explains the etymology of "professional" and "community," emphasizing the importance of shared expertise and regular communication among practitioners.

**Transcription of the text:**

---
The term *professional community* is striking when it is applied to the working cultures of schools. The word *professional* has its roots in *profess*, meaning to declare, to own, and to claim some body of knowledge; it therefore implies a level of expertise with a strong technical core that can be clearly articulated by practitioners. The word *community* has its roots in the word *common*, and its relationship to the word *communicate* implies that this is a shared body of expertise. The practitioners in a *professional community* talk regularly about their collective practice and work together to extend and effectively apply this knowledge base.

Developing shared expertise and working with common purpose are vividly present in the schools that are beating the odds and making a difference for student learning both internationally and in North America (Bryk and Schneider, 2002; Dufour, Eaker, and Baker, 1998; Louis, Marks, and Kruse, 1996; McLaughlin and Talbert, 2006; Hargreaves and Fullan, 2012).

Unfortunately, the notion of shared practice within a school or a district is still not as universal as we would like. Richard Elmore (2000) pointed out that schools and schooling are governed by the principle of “loose coupling” (p. 6), with many decisions about what and how to teach residing in individual classrooms and not in the surrounding organization. Loose coupling tied to a weak technical core is a recipe for disaster. The effects of both effective and ineffective teachers are felt for years. The issue, then, is how to enhance and spread good practice throughout the school to produce cumulative and lasting effects for all learners, not just those who are fortunate enough to learn the material the way it is presently taught. Fresh studies are emerging that document student gains as a result of high-functioning teacher learning communities. As one example, research investigating the extent to which teachers’ collaborative school improvement practices are related to student achievement was conducted from a sample of 2,536 fourth-grade students in forty-seven elementary schools in a large urban school district in the mid-western United States. Schools with greater levels of teacher collaboration produced higher achievement in mathematics and reading than those with lesser amounts (Goddard, Goddard, and Tschannen-Moran, 2007). In John Hattie’s meta-analysis of more than eight hundred studies, teacher collaboration is an important characteristic for three of nine teaching standards (Hattie, 2009).

One of the most stable factors in schools over the years has been the relative isolation of teachers from one another throughout their workday and work year. Working lives in which autonomous teachers are organized by a culture of individualism are still common. In some of these schools teachers live episodically

THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL

from one year to the next and seek routines that are efficient and energy conserving. Caution about intruding in others’ territory and guardedness or resistance about changes in curriculum and instruction are normal. Teachers in these schools work hard, but with little sense of their potential collective power. We have worked in many of these schools, from the west to the east coasts in North America and in a some international settings. Despite leadership efforts, and various forms of professional development, many classroom practices remain fundamentally unchanged even though teacher collaboration is undoubtedly linked to improving student learning outcomes.

The Professional Learning Community (PLC) movement (Teacher Learning Community in the United Kingdom) organizes practices around the premise of improving learning by improving teaching practice. Richard Dufour, a champion of PLCs, cautions that the term has been used so loosely that it is forfeiting meaning (Dufour, 2004). And while PLCs are not what we are describing in this book, research in this area sheds some light on two questions related to teacher collaboration. First, does collaboration change teaching practices, and second, do changes in practices improve student learning? (Vescio, Ross, and Adams, 2008). Only recently have researchers gathered empirical data on these two questions, and the short answer to these queries is yes.

In their award-winning book Hargreaves and Fullan (2012) declare that one can’t grow much human talent by focusing on individuals. They envision a pathway to schools with high-quality teachers and teaching. They remind readers of Leana’s (2011) finding

> that patterns of interaction among teachers and between teachers and administrators that are focused on student learning make a large and measurable difference in student achievement and sustained improvement. (p. 34)

These patterns of interaction are the basis of social capital in schools. In a sense, helping schools bring into being the structures and social capital necessary for profoundly effective teaching is the purpose of this book.

Hargreaves and Fullan (2012) are envisioning communities of practice. “Communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern, a set of problems, or a passion about a topic, and who deepen their knowledge and expertise in this area by interacting on an ongoing basis” (p. 4). Communities of practice is a concept first proposed by cognitive anthropologists Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger in 1991. Members in these communities collectively learn in order to do better that which they are passionate about. Wenger (1998) described such groups as having shared norms and collaborative relations; a shared understanding of what binds them together and shared repertoire, literally creating a communal resource. Hargreaves and Fullan (2012) note that first it is about developing trust and relationships and second, collaborative work will benefit “from deliberate arrangements of meetings, teams, structures and protocols” (p. 127). But if these are built in the absence of commitment, all this will be ineffective. “First,” by the way, is not a statement of sequence, rather it is statement of primary focus while doing shared work around teaching and learning.

**The Elements of Professional Community**

In our work, we are becoming increasingly optimistic that schools as professional communities hold rich promise for meaningful staff engagement leading to increases in student learning. Our intent is to share what we are learning in this area. We offer ways to build professional communities in schools so that teachers and administrators can talk about difficult things, ask hard questions about teaching and learning practices, and adults can actively learn from one another.

**THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL**

Six factors work in concert to produce a sense of shared responsibility for student success that successfully delivers results. They are a prime example of the complex systems principle that everything influences everything else. Each principle on its own is important, but not sufficient for the task of energizing instructional improvements. The emerging research base supports the importance of these essential elements of professional community. The six factors are as follows:

1. Compelling purpose, shared standards, and academic focus;
2. Collective efficacy and shared responsibility for student learning;
3. Social capital emerging from teacher talk about learning and improving said learning;
4. Collaborative cultures communally applying effective teaching practices;
5. Relational trust in one another, in students, and in parents;
6. Individual and group learning based on ongoing assessment and feedback.

These shared efforts produce school-wide gains in student achievement. When teachers take collective responsibility for students, they conceive their work to be a joint enterprise (Little, 1990). They have a greater sense of personal and collective efficacy and assume that learning is a result of school rather than nonschool factors (Lee and Smith, 1996). In high schools where this sense of collective responsibility was strong, students have been found to have larger gains in mathematics, reading, history, and science than in schools where the collective sense was weaker. These outcomes were especially true for minority students and students from low socioeconomic backgrounds.

**Compelling Purpose, Shared Standards, and Academic Focus**

Communities come into existence and thrive because of a common purpose for working together. A group’s compelling purpose establishes reciprocal expectations for its members. International evidence suggests that educational reform’s progress depends on teachers’ individual and collective capacity and its link with school-wide capacity for promoting pupils’ learning (Stall et al., 2006). Compelling purposes, however, do not mean a race to the top. Andy Hargreaves notes that while Singapore schools are consistently rated among the best in the world, they have not set goals to be the best. Rather, they have set goals to be effective, and like other successful organizations, aim for 2 percent annual gains. They teach less so students can learn more. Teacher innovation flourishes in their collaborative cultures. Teachers give away their best ideas and then invent new ones.

Teachers’ professional communities operate with a sense of moral authority and moral responsibility for making a difference in the lives of students. Such purpose is grounded in clearly articulated standards for both student and teacher performance. Defining and refining the meaning of doing good work is the task of a professional learning community.

**Collective Efficacy and Shared Responsibility for Student Learning**

Collective efficacy refers to the shared sense that teacher knowledge and effort will overcome obstacles to student learning. Such efficacy is achieved through four routes: (1) direct experience in which a group overcomes difficulties through persistent effort; (2) vicarious experience, the observation of others’ successful experiences; (3) social persuasion in which members are persuaded they have what it takes to make a difference and the students they are working with have the capacity to learn; and (4) personal emotional states, in which the sense of feeling good about what one is accomplishing is a further reinforcement. This raises confidence, which in turn reinforces the practice of working hard. Stress can weaken

this affect, and weaken the sense of collective efficacy (Holanda, et al. 2014).

The personal efficacy of individual teachers is a well-studied phenomenon. Teachers with stronger personal efficacy beliefs consistently outperform teachers in the same settings with weaker beliefs. They also work harder and experience less stress. Participating in decision making contributes strongly to teachers’ beliefs in the capabilities of their peers, fosters commitment to school goals, and promotes gains in student achievement. A group of high-efficacy teachers, however, is not the same as a group with collective efficacy.

Collective efficacy, however, is not a panacea. Parker (1994)—and other, earlier researchers—found that collective efficacy can partially counteract the negative effects of low socioeconomic conditions.

---

**Social Capital Emerging from Teacher Talk about Learning and Improving Said Learning**

One invests capital to reap returns. In schools, social capital develops from the frequency with which teachers and others engage in conversations about student work and teaching practices related to that work (Hargreaves and Fullan, 2012). Social capital improves the teaching performance of all teachers. Schools with rich social capital invest in teacher development; not only in pedagogy, but collegial practices which themselves further inform collective teaching practices. Trust, reciprocity, information, and cooperation are associated with these social networks.

Talent is the human capital teachers bring to their work. Regardless of starting levels, human capital grows in relationship to social capital, in magnitudes not possible through attention to individual teacher development. Social capital raises the aspirational and performance bar for everyone. Two parallel dimensions are related to social capital: decisional capital and cognitive capital. Decisional capital rises from the professional decision making of teachers when they are treated as professionals, rather than being treated as workers who need to be told what and how to teach. Costa, Garmston, and Zimmerman (2014) assert that training in reflection, not teacher assessment, is a driving force for self-directed learning. Not only is teaching complex requiring agile thinking, but also sustainable decisions made by groups require similar competencies.

---

**Collaborative Cultures Communally Applying Effective Teaching Practices**

*Illustration of people sitting around a table, discussing.*

The norm of privacy has deep roots in “real” schools. Once the classroom door is closed, the teacher is God. In this sphere of autonomy lies both greatness and sorrow. Within the zone of isolation, some teachers still find ways to develop craft knowledge, content knowledge, and compassion for their students. These extraordinary individuals manage to stimulate their teaching and continually renew their passion for daily interactions with young minds. All too often, however, this same isolation buffers mediocrity and hides high performers from those who might learn from their modeling, consultation, and coaching.

When practice is deprivatized, teachers visit one another’s classrooms to observe master teaching, to coach each other, to mentor, and to solve problems in the living laboratory of instructional space. Students are the beneficiaries of shared teaching repertoires. Although many schools and districts have spent much time and energy developing coherent curriculum maps, shared instructional maps are equally

important. When a student proceeds to the next grade or next subject in a secondary school, having possession of a predictable learning repertoire (such as an understanding of a palette of graphic organizers), energizes learning and increases success—especially for the least successful learners.

By developing communities of practice, teachers establish a working zone between the macro world of district initiatives and resources and the micro world of their classrooms (McLaughlin and Talbert, 2006). In this way they develop more coherent instructional approaches that represent shared understandings of their unique setting.

**Relational Trust in One Another, in Students, and in Parents**

In their work on the effects of academic optimism on student achievement Hoy, Tarter, and Woolfolk-Hoy (2006) point out that collective efficacy is the cognitive side of the equation; academic emphasis is the behavioral side; and faculty trust in one another, in students, and in parents is the affective side. Given the powerful biochemical connections between thinking and feeling in our bodies and our brains, it is difficult to separate these functions in practice.

Trust is the glue that binds community members to one another. This is equally true for teacher communities, classroom communities, and parent communities. When all three parties hold high expectations for their relationships, and these expectations are grounded in shared goals and values, trust is a powerful resource for learning.

Bryk and Schneider (2002), in their seminal work in Chicago schools, name four criteria for the discernment of relational trust: respect, competence, personal regard for others, and integrity. *Respect* comes in the form of basic civility and a willingness to listen deeply to what each person has to say. Parents, students, and teachers need opportunities to talk with and influence each other and to believe that they can positively affect educational outcomes.

*Competence* is the sense that each party has the ability to carry out its appropriate roles and produce desired outcomes. This applies to both academic results and teacher-student relationships. When gross incompetence goes unchecked, it erodes trust and undermines shared efforts toward improving learning. *Personal regard for others* deepens relational trust. We are a social species, wired for relationships and reciprocity. Mutual support and mutual caring fuel these associations. Extending ourselves to and for others is like making a deposit in the trust account; the interest in this account compounds with each deposit. *Integrity* is the congruence between saying and doing. In trusting relationships, this means we believe that a sense of morality and ethics is operating in others and in the ways we are relating. Following through with agreements and commitments is a key aspect of integrity.

**Individual and Group Learning Based on Ongoing Assessment and Feedback**

“Learning is a basic, adaptive function of humans. More than any other species, people are designed to be flexible learners and active agents in acquiring knowledge and skills” (Bransford, Brown, and Cocking, 1999, p. xi). Cognitive science tells us that learning is socially constructed and individually integrated; learning therefore requires engaging with other learners and is an active process for all involved. Individual and collective learning is one of the key characteristics of effective professional learning communities (Bolam et al., 2005).

For adult groups, learning how to learn together requires conscious attention, purposeful structures, and meaningful feedback. One form of feedback arises when teachers look at student work together to explore what is working and what might require modification in their curricular and instructional approaches. Groups apply another form of feedback when they take time to reflect on their own processes and outcomes to consider which practices to continue, which to abandon, and which to modify.

**Text Content:**

From time to time a group or team will share with us that it has some great number of years of combined teaching experience. Their assumption is that learning is additive, when in fact the group members have merely been involved in side-by-side processes. Engaging in parallel play without feedback and reflection is usually a poor teacher.

**Developing Teachers’ Professional Communities**

Despite the existence of these descriptors of schools that make a difference for students, the question of how we get there remains. Schools require frameworks, role clarity, and self-renewing tool kits for collaborative practice. Based on our understanding of the literature on school change, organizational development, and teaching and learning, as well as our experiences with schools the past several years, we offer the following four frameworks as organizers for this journey:

- Twin goals: developing organizational capacities and developing professional capacities;
- Four “hats”: facilitating, presenting, coaching, and consulting;
- Five energy sources: efficacy, flexibility, craftsmanship, consciousness, and interdependence;
- Seven norms of collaboration: pausing, paraphrasing, posing questions, providing data, placing ideas on the table, paying attention to self and others, and presuming positive intentions.

Figure 3.3 shows the interaction of the first three frameworks.

**THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL**

To address problems in languishing schools, districts and schools must continually apply energy and resources to both production and production capacities. Leaders of adaptive schools simultaneously develop two goals related to the organization’s ongoing need for self-improvement. The first goal expands six organizational capacities for adaptivity. The second goal strengthens six professional capacities for adaptivity. These twelve capacities for organizational and professional adaptivity are the source of and focus for reflective dialogue in professional communities. Exploration of these twelve areas helps communities to focus their work and strengthen their ties to one another. We offer them here as lenses for examining schools and teaching practice in the hope that they will become focal points for important dialogues and discussions in schools, departments, teams, and governing councils. We will provide brief descriptions here and elaborate on them in chapter 13.

**The Languishing High School**

At the languishing high school, many students proactively disengage from learning. They slump in their seats on the days that they even bother to come to class. Students ignore homework assignments, and remediation needs outweigh the coverage of new material. External rewards such as grades, honor rolls, and college admissions requirements hold little or no motivational power. Teachers are attempting to deal with this situation by embracing tradition, enforcing standards, and struggling to maintain the integrity of teaching methods and materials. The net result of all these interactions includes departments with abnormally high failure rates, decreased enrollments in advanced courses, falling attendance, and increased dropout rates. Staff morale and teacher efficacy plummet.

This is a classic situation in which the five principles of complex systems (see chapter 1) are at work:

1. More data do not lead to better predictions. Additional surveys and reports about attendance, dropout rates, test scores, and staff attitudes will not improve this school.
2. Everything influences everything else. Tough standards only raise the bar higher for students who lack basic jumping skills. Poor student performance lowers expectations and teachers’ professional pride and sense of purpose. Parental concerns and complaints cause defensiveness and withdrawal.
3. Tiny events create major disturbances. Student expulsions, a dropped section of an honors course, and half-full classes create ripple effects throughout life in the school.
4. You don’t have to touch everyone in the system to make a difference. A belief that everyone in the school must be ready for change before any action can be taken blocks movement and innovation.
5. Both things and energy matter. Rules, routines, and procedures will count for little unless you also attend to the qualities of human relationships in the school.

**Organizational Capacities for Adaptivity**

The six organizational capacities for adaptivity are (1) vision, values, and goal focus; (2) systems thinking; (3) initiating and managing adaptation; (4) interpreting and using data; (5) developing and maintaining collaborative cultures; and (6) gathering and focusing resources.

**Vision, Values, and Goal Focus**

Clarity of vision, values, and goals is a hallmark of successful schools. The most important goals are the academic goals for the students. These in turn are an expression of the value system that governs the organization. Healthy

**The Importance of Professional Community**  
**CHAPTER 3**

Schools and organizations hold a vision for themselves of how they wish to operate in the world. This is a vision of values and goals in action. Such a vision is informed by real-world measures of student achievement and other goal accomplishments.

At the languishing high school, vision, values, and goals require rethinking and refocusing. English literature might not be the most appropriate course to teach students who have fundamental literacy needs.

**Systems Thinking**

Systems thinking and vision, values, and goal focus are the major organizers of adaptivity. Helping others to see systems places the work of schools in a larger context. This framework reveals influential interactions and helps to answer the question “What part of the system can we influence to create positive change?”

Adaptive schools engage in systems thinking. Whether explicitly labeled as such or not, this is what professional communities do.

**Initiating and Managing Adaptation**

Adaptation is the work of leaders at all levels of the school and professional community. Inquiry is an essential tool of adaptation. The three focusing questions offered in chapter 1 are resources: “Who are we?” “Why are we doing this?” and “Why are we doing this, this way?”

**Interpreting and Using Data**

Data have no meaning on their own. Meaning is a result of human interaction with data. Many schools are data-rich and meaning-poor. Adaptive groups develop the capacity to discern what data are worth paying attention to and what collaborative practices help people to engage with data in ways that increase ownership and willingness to act on conclusions. (See chapter 11.)

The languishing high school usually has enough data about the system, but little knowledge. Knowledge, meaning, and commitment result from dialogue and discussion about what story is told by the data. Without organized story making, people in organizations make up their own explanations for events. Part of the reason for this is protection from unwanted truths.

**Developing and Maintaining Collaborative Cultures**

Collaboration is the essence of teachers’ professional community in schools. Collaboration, social capital, and group development work hand in hand. In chapter 10 we will discuss ways to help groups become more interdependent and cohesive.

Collaboration operates within and between groups. When students work with units of measure as they quantify lab materials, interdependence connects the math teachers to the science teachers. Success in the lab builds on math skills learned in other settings. Laboratory applications further reinforce the practical nature of algorithms learned in math class.

A sense of collaboration is lacking at the low-performing high school. The teachers and the departments feel besieged, hunkering down and fighting their own fights for some sense of accomplishment and dignity. The students and the teachers do not see themselves aligned in a shared task. Each sees the other as an adversary, with small victories and losses accumulating on a daily basis. Each carries an identity as a teacher of a discipline or grade level, not as part of a team dedicated to student success.

**Gathering and Focusing Resources**

Time, money, and human energy are some of the resources that support goal accomplishment in schools. Overload and fragmentation are the enemies of success. Resources must be focused where they will make the greatest difference. Ultimately this leads to some hard decisions in schools. Resource allocation and goal accomplishment are directly linked. What receives attention gets done.

**THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL**

This last organizational capacity for adaptivity cannot work without clarity in the others. Values and goals point out resource needs. Systems thinking frames where to target resources. To initiate and manage adaptation means to apply and manage resources. All this is missing at the languishing high school. Energy, time, and money are thrown at problems to fix the most visible ones. Doing anything is considered good enough. The goal is to protect individuals and the organization from the accusation of not working hard enough. Without a clear focus and without honest feedback systems, however, this only saps resources and increases the magnitude of the problems.

**Professional Capacities for Adaptivity**

The six professional capacities for adaptivity are (1) collegial interaction; (2) cognitive processes of instruction; (3) knowledge of the structure of the discipline; (4) self-knowledge, values, standards, and beliefs; (5) a repertoire of teaching skills; and (6) knowing about students and how they learn.

**Collegial Interaction**

In many respects, collaboration needs to be taught. Past practices and workplace culture influence the capacity for collaboration. So does gender and school organization (elementary, middle, or high). Attitudes, knowledge, skills, and practices can be taught; these are the focus of chapters 4, 5, 6, and 10. The capacity to be a colleague is different from other capacities of good teaching. It draws upon craft knowledge, self-knowledge, and interpersonal skills to form a web of reciprocal relationships and services.

Norms of privatism are strong at the languishing high school. Each teacher operates as an independent artisan. There is no craft guild with which to share professional knowledge and concerns. Small breakthroughs with students are personal victories to be savored and fleetingly enjoyed in quiet moments.

**Cognitive Processes of Instruction**

Instructional thinking occurs in four phases: planning, teaching, analyzing and evaluating, and applying what has been learned to future work.

The more cognitively adept a teacher is, the better the results are in classrooms and with colleagues. This capacity includes the abilities to manage multiple goals simultaneously, to align one’s work with that of one’s colleagues, and to learn from experience in the classroom (Costa and Garmston 2015).

Teachers in the languishing high school feel as if they have no time to reflect. The pace of survival puts action ahead of reflection on most personal and collective agendas. Peer coaching programs sputter out in the press for time. Formal supervision is pro forma and ritualized. Administrators are mostly satisfied with teachers who “keep the lid on” in a classroom and keep kids out of the office.

**Knowledge of the Structure of the Discipline**

Knowledge of the structure of the discipline moves beyond content knowledge, which is necessary but not sufficient for good teaching. The former involves knowing the organizing schema of the field, including the significant ideas in the discipline and how they relate to one another. Anticipating major misconceptions and barriers to learning and understanding the significant ideas are also important here. These inform curricular choices and the selection and use of resource materials.

Little attention has been given to matters of curriculum at the low-performing high school beyond periodic textbook adoptions. Teachers’ knowledge of their fields is not always up to date. In fact, more than a quarter of the staff might be teaching outside their areas

Self-Knowledge, Values, Standards, and Beliefs  
The knowledge of what one stands for is the most important asset a professional educator has to maintain a steady course through the ups and downs of life in schools. Having clarity about personal standards for good work and good behavior and effectively

A lack of deep professional interaction does not serve teachers in the languishing high school. Many are unsure of themselves and insecure in the changing world in which they find themselves. Old touchstones, such as grades, course syllabi, and school traditions no longer provide comfort and a sense of purpose in the world. Some cling tightly to known elements even in the face of evidence of their negative effects. The comforts of the past hold memories of the way things are supposed to be.

A Repertoire of Teaching Skills  
In chess, the queen is the most powerful piece on the board because she has the most flexibility of movement: She can move forward or backward, left or right, and diagonally, for any number of spaces. Like a chess queen, teachers with an expanded repertoire of teaching skills have the most flexibility of movement and thus the most options.

No one knows it all in the classroom. Craft knowledge is a lifetime in the making. There is always something new to invent and learn as research, technology, and professional practice continually expand both the knowledge base of teaching and the answers to the questions about what works and why. Teachers at the low-performing high school cling to old ways of doing business in the classroom. Lectures, videos, reading from textbooks, note taking, and quizzes prevail. Students play out their part of the ritual, minimally complying with this production. Alternative teaching techniques such as simulations and project-based learning are usually rejected as “not my style.”

Knowing about Students and How They Learn  
Just as educators can never know enough about the structure of their disciplines, themselves, and their teaching repertoire, they can never know all there is to know about their students and how they learn. This capacity is divided into two parts. The first, knowing about students, means knowing them as people—who they are and where they come from. This is the stuff of genuine relationships that nurture and motivate learning. The second part, knowing how students learn, is informed by knowledge of learning styles, developmental stages of intellectual growth, cultural differences, and gender differences.

Students in the low-performing high school are often viewed as problems to overcome. They are the objects of instruction, not the constructors of meaning. All too often, relationships between teachers and students are strained in the battle for power and control. Each side needs the other but does not always know how to cross the gap that divides them.

The Four “Hats” of Shared Leadership  
In adaptive schools, all players learn to “wear four hats,” or play four roles. By all players we mean administrators, teachers, support staff, students, and, when appropriate, parents. In such schools all the players must have the knowledge and skills to manage themselves and influence and lead others.

Leadership is a function, not a role and is a shared function in meetings, staff development activities, action research, and classrooms. Recognizing the “hats” and knowing when and how to change them is shared knowledge within the organization. When values, roles, and work relationships are clear, decisions about appropriate behavior are easy. We offer

**definitions to illustrate the major functions of four leadership roles and the distinctions among the roles. See Costa and Garmston, and Zimmerman (2014) for extended discussion on how each of these functions can contribute to the development of cognitive capital.**

**Facilitating**
To facilitate means “to make easier.” A facilitator conducts a meeting in which the purpose is dialogue, shared decision making, planning, or problem solving. The facilitator directs the processes used in the meeting, choreographs the energy within the group, and maintains a focus on one content and one process at a time. Ideally the facilitator is not the person with role or knowledge authority (described in chapter 8). The role of facilitator is central to the ideas in this book. Many of the templates, tools, and strategies provided here apply to it. We have therefore elaborated on this role in chapter 8.

**Presenting**
*(There is a black and white illustration of a person standing at a podium, gesturing with one hand. The caption reads: "Figure 3.4. Illustrations from Learning Guide")*

To present is to teach. A presenter’s goals are to extend and enrich knowledge, skills, or attitudes and to enable these to be applied in people’s work. A presenter may adopt many stances—expert, colleague, novice, or friend—and use many strategies of presentation—lectures, cooperative learning, study groups, or simulations. Touchstones of effective presentations include clarity of instructional outcomes, of standards for success, and ways to assess learning (Garmston, 2005; Garmston and Wellman, 1992).

**Coaching**
To coach is to help a group take action toward its goals while simultaneously helping it to develop expertise in planning, reflecting, problem solving, and decision-making. The coach takes a nonjudgmental stance and uses open-ended questions, pausing, paraphrasing, and probing for specificity. The skillful coach focuses on group members’ perceptions, thinking, and decision-making processes to mediate resources for self-directedness (Costa and Garmston, 2015).

**Consulting**
To consult is to have your expertise be used by others. A consultant can be an information specialist or an advocate for content or process. As an information specialist, the consultant delivers technical knowledge to the group. As a content advocate, the consultant encourages group members to use a certain instructional strategy, adopt a particular curriculum, or purchase a specific brand of computer. As a process advocate, the consultant influences the group’s methodology, such as by recommending an open rather than a closed meeting to increase trust in the system. To effectively consult, one must have trust, commonly defined goals, and the group’s desired outcomes clearly in mind (Block, 1981).

**Description:**
The page appears to be from a book titled "The Adaptive School." The text discusses the concept of complexity in group behavior, using the example of a computer simulation of flocking birds (boids) to illustrate how simple rules can lead to complex group dynamics. The page also proposes simple rules for group members to follow and discusses the importance of collaboration among teachers.

---

**Transcription:**

**THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL**

This simplicity is illustrated in a story related by M. Mitchell Waldrop in his book *Complexity: The Emerging Science at the Edge of Order and Chaos* (1992). Complexity is the study of intricate dynamical systems. It is an integrative science in which economists, biologists, ecologists, meteorologists, and specialists from other fields connect to explore the underlying principles that govern natural and human systems. Much of the work is done using high-powered computers to simulate natural and designed systems.

Craig Reynolds of the Symbolics Corporation in Los Angeles is one such researcher. He designed a computer program that captures the essence of the flocking behavior of birds, the herding behavior of sheep, and the schooling behavior of fish. The elegance of his design was in not trying to build rules into the group. Instead, the rules resided within the individuals. He created a collection of autonomous, birdlike agents he called *boids*. Each “boid” was programmed with three simple rules:

1. Maintain a minimum distance from other objects in the environment, including other “boids.”
2. Match the velocity of other “boids” in your vicinity.
3. Move toward the perceived center of the mass of other “boids” in your vicinity.

There was no superintendent of “boids.” None of these rules said to form a flock, yet flocks formed every time the program ran. “Boids” would at first be scattered around the computer screen but would soon flock up. Flocks were able to fly around obstacles or break into subflocks to fly around objects, coming together again on the other side. On one occasion a “boid” banged into a pole, lost its bearings momentarily, then darted forward to rejoin the flock.

If simple rules govern complex behavior in groups, what might be some simple rules for group members to follow? We propose the following:

1. *Take care of me.* It is each group member’s groundedness, resourcefulness, and energy that develops the synergy that makes high-performing groups possible.
2. *Take care of us.* It is our interdependence, interactions, and caring for each other and the group that motivates us to want to continue to work together.
3. *Take care of our values.* It is our values that drive our goal clarity about who we are, how we want to be together, and what we will accomplish for students.

In chapters 4 and 5 we explore these simple rules in action as we discuss group-member capabilities, the seven norms of collaboration, and two ways of talking in groups.

Who teachers are to one another is as important as who they are to their students. In high-performing and improving schools, studies show that collaboration is the norm. We are not talking here about project-based collaboration or the “contrived collegiality” described by Hargreaves and Dawe (1990) in which administrators create tasks and agendas to occupy teachers’ collective energies. Rather, we are referring to sharing expertise and perspectives on teaching and learning processes, examining data on students, and developing a sense of mutual support and shared responsibility for effective instruction.

**Chapter 4**  Developing Collaborative Norms

We once observed a faculty during a September meeting. Eight teachers, new to the school were studiously attentive to the veterans, emulating their patterns of interaction. This was a vivid example of one essential benefit of establishing norms of collaboration: they are normative—that is, they become a model for newcomers, and are especially valuable in schools with high teacher turnover.

In this chapter we reveal the metacognitive skills of effective group members, show why collaborative inquiry is at the heart of improving student achievement and describe seven norms of collaboration. Groups who employ these norms in conversations about student learning consistently develop the social capital that improves collective teaching expertise (Hargreaves and Fullan, 2012).

Working in groups is a natural condition of human life. Since the dawn of humanity on the plains of Africa, bands, clans, tribes, and families have collaborated for defense, food gathering, and ceremonial purposes. Work in groups is often difficult, filled with conflicts and tensions, but it is also absolutely necessary for achieving results in modern organizations.

Each group member must balance personal goals with collective goals, acquire resources for his or her own work, and share those resources to support the work of others. Navigating the tensions between part and whole—between personal autonomy and collaboration—is an ongoing feature of both the surface and the deep structure for any working group.

Many organizations try to control these tensions by using facilitators to shape and mold group energy and task focus. Although a person in such a role can often make a difference in a group’s performance, a skilled facilitator is only one element of group success. (See chapter 8 for more on the role and skills of the facilitator and chapter 3 for a description of four leadership roles.) Individual group members need consciousness and lenses for shaping personal decisions and behaviors in meetings.

All surface behaviors are driven by inner awareness and ongoing calibration of deeper values. Skillful group members monitor and adjust their behaviors to support the other group members and the group as a whole. To operate with sufficient flexibility, group members need self-awareness and self-monitoring skills to guide their choice making. Skillful facilitators increase this awareness by shining the light of reflection on group processes and by supporting group members in reflecting on the behavioral decisions they are making.

Four capabilities shape the self-monitoring system of high performing group members. These in turn organize and drive seven norms of collaboration. The seven norms are the day-to-day working tools for both skilled group members and skilled facilitators.

that was developing “Cognitive Coaching” with Art Costa and other colleagues from the Institute for Intelligent Behavior. A capability names what a person is able to do. It is different from capacity, which refers to how much one can hold. Capabilities are the metacognitive awarenesses with which people determine how to use, when to use, or when not to use certain skills. Capabilities therefore organize and direct the use of skills; they influence the application and effectiveness of knowledge and skills.

The four group-member capabilities are as follows:

1. To know one’s intentions and choose congruent behaviors;
2. To set aside unproductive patterns of listening, responding, and inquiring;
3. To know when to self-assert and when to integrate;
4. To know and support the group’s purposes, topics, processes, and development.

**To Know One’s Intentions and Choose Congruent Behaviors**

Clarity of intention drives attention, which in turn drives the what and how of a group member’s meeting participation. This is true in the moment and over time. This clarity precedes and influences the three other capabilities. It is the source of impulse control, patience, strategic listening, and strategic speaking.

This capability is the foundation for flexible and effective behavior. If, for example, a person’s intention is to positively influence the thinking of others, various behaviors can be used congruently with that intention: under some circumstances, a paraphrase will convey an attempt to understand and open the door for reciprocal understanding; in some situations, direct advocacy will be persuasive; in other cases, an inquiry into the thinking of another speaker might more effectively influence point of view.

**Right Column:**

**To Set Aside Unproductive Patterns of Listening, Responding, and Inquiring**

For each meeting participant, there are two audiences. One is external, made up of the other group members. The other is internal, made up of the feelings, pictures, and talk going on inside each individual. Group members need to continually decide which audience to serve.

Three major set-aside areas focus this choice and allow fuller and more nonjudgmental participation. They are as follows:

1. To set aside autobiographical listening, responding, and inquiring: “Me too!”
2. To set aside inquisitive listening, responding, and inquiring: “Tell me more!”
3. To set aside solution listening, responding, and inquiring: “I know what you need to do!”

The autobiographical frame leads to several problems in group work. The first is the filtering process that goes on when individuals try to hear another’s story through the lens of their own experiences. Although this can be a source of empathy, it can also lead to distortion and miscommunication.

This type of listening, responding, and inquiring, while typically the way people listen, is a major source of wasted time in meetings. It often triggers endless storytelling in which everyone around the table shares a related anecdote. This is dinner party conversation, not productive meeting talk. Each member of the eighth-grade team does not have to relate a discipline horror story. Instead, the team could more productively spend its time developing a collective understanding of the students and their needs and generate appropriate response patterns to elicit desired behaviors.

The inquisitive frame is sometimes triggered by the autobiographical. People inquire to see how others’ stories compare to their own. Pure curiosity also motivates inquisitive listening, responding, and inquiring. A critical question at this juncture is “How much detail do we

need to move this item?” This is an example of what we call a naive question. (See appendix A for other examples of naive questions.) Such questions can be asked by any group member. The purpose is to focus attention on critical matters and avoid unnecessary specificity.

The solution frame is deeply embedded in the psyche of educators. Status, rewards, and identity are all tied up with being a good problem solver. The pressure of time in schools pushes people toward action and away from reflection. The downside of this pattern is that groups and group members get trapped in situations and action plans before they have time to fully understand the perspectives of others.

The solution frame also stifles the generation of new possibilities. It gets in the way of developing alternative ways of framing issues and problems, pushing groups toward action before creating and clarifying clear outcomes.

**To Know When to Self-Assert and When to Integrate**

In productive groups, each member must decide when to self-assert and when to integrate with the group. In one group, a member confided to us that she was concerned about the autocratic disposition of the new chairman. Although she valued the directness that he brought to the group’s work, she was concerned that they would lose collective ownership if she or other group members did not advocate for their own ideas and perspectives. Her issue, and the tension for each group member, was when to challenge and when to go with the flow. Self-assertion and integration are conscious choices only when group members have personal clarity about their own intentions as well as a knowledge of and a willingness to support the group’s outcomes and methods.

Self-assertion does not necessarily mean self-focus. It can mean asserting oneself into the flow of group interactions to refocus the group on a topic or on a process. It can mean reminding others of the purpose of the meeting when the conversation strays off course. It can also mean speaking up and advocating topics and processes.

When individual group members integrate, they align their energy with the content and processes of the meeting. During dialogue they suspend judgments and counterarguments in an attempt to understand viewpoints different from their own. During discussions, they follow the flow of logic and reasoning as it emerges. In this way, solutions satisfying to the group as a whole are more likely to emerge.

Consensus decision making is the ultimate test of this capability. This procedure assumes that participants know when and how to self-assert and when and how to integrate, both during and after the decision-making process. The next two chapters describe ways of talking in groups as well as principles and practices for successful meetings. In these chapters you will find many ideas and examples of places for self-assertion and for integration.

**To Know and Support the Group’s Purposes, Topics, Processes, and Development**

All ongoing groups need to balance three simultaneous agendas. The first is task focus, which is the ultimate expression of the group’s purpose. The second agenda is process skills development. Without continued attention to expanding repertoire and skills, the group stagnates and does not increase its capacity for handling more complex work in the future. The third agenda is group development. All groups exist on a continuum from novice to expert performance. Experience alone is an insufficient teacher. Many longstanding groups operate at novice levels of performance. In chapter 9 we elaborate on concepts of group development.

High-performing groups are adaptive groups. They learn from experience and improve the way they work. In supporting the group’s purposes, topics, processes, and development, individual group members make

a commitment to this shared learning and to personal learning.

The paradoxes of work in groups establish the essential tensions that groups and their individuals must continually resolve. The four group-member capabilities supply metacognitive and emotional filters for decisions, choices, and behaviors. All this requires a toolkit for productive group work.

**Promoting a Spirit of Inquiry**

High-functioning groups and group members infuse their work with a spirit of inquiry. Inquiry is central to professional communities that produce stable gains in student learning. Learning at its root is a questioning process, and successful collaboration embraces the patterns and practices of inquiry. Inquiry presumes an openness to and an investment in the ideas of others. Physicist David Bohm has noted that thought is “largely a collective phenomenon.” These thoughts, like electrons, are shaped by their interactions with others (Senge, 1990).

To inquire is to ask, be curious, invite the transmission of thoughts or feelings, confer, consult, wonder, request, examine, and investigate ideas. David Hackett Fischer, a Pulitzer prize-winning historian, observed that questions “are the engines of intellect—cerebral machines that convert curiosity into controlled inquiry” (Berger, 2014, p. 15). Richard Elmore (2000) points out that “the knowledge we need to solve problems [in schools] often doesn’t reside close at hand; it has to be found through active inquiry and analysis” (p. 13). Such interactions are not always the norm in schools. Collaborative work is fraught with the tensions and the fears of being judged or of being perceived as one who might be judging others.

Teaching as a private practice has a deep cultural history. Breaking and reshaping the patterns within a culture requires both skill and commitment to the ongoing process of building community. Teaching in many ways has traditionally been a “telling” profession. Teachers tell students what they need to know and how to do the things they need to learn how to do. This “telling” behavior often carries over into patterns of adult communication as we tell others our stories, thoughts, and opinions or wait for our turn to do so. This culture of advocacy defines much of the interaction in adult groups. We are often caught up in the tyranny of or (Collins and Porras, 1997). The “or” in the statements that things must be right or wrong, true or false, yes or no causes these declarations to be dichotomous.

Dichotomous thinking leads to dichotomous questions, which in turn polarize group members. The art of asking invitational questions that avoid these dichotomies is the heart of collaborative inquiry. Invitational questions form connections between people and ideas as well as between ideas and other ideas.

All group work is about relationships. Relationships shape and define patterns of discourse. These relationships are shaped by who initiates a query and the form of that query. Who responds and how he or she responds is a direct result of the ways in which a group member initiates a topic. Form, function, and outcome are linked within an emotional and social system that, when handled with care, opens and expands thought and creates new possibilities. For example, a person initiating a topic with, “One idea we might consider is . . .” will result in a totally different response from a person initiating a topic with, “I think we should . . .” The former will elicit responses from more group members, who will treat the idea as a possibility, not a decision. Those respondents will also be inclined to generate more ideas, increasing the group’s flexibility. The second response will increase the possibility of defensiveness among group members and discourage the generation of new ideas.

The patterns of inquiry built with the tools of the seven norms of collaboration lead to deeper understanding and to better-informed action. This understanding and these actions can be internal for participants and external in their behaviors. As we grapple with ideas and perspectives we come to know others and ourselves

Purposeful inquiry helps us to interpret personal and collective values and the implications of these as we live them out in our organizations.

First, they are group and setting specific. Second, they are developed by a group to guide behaviors when that group is convened. Some common examples are: start and end on time, come prepared, and listen respectfully. To arrive at these a facilitator might invite the group to brainstorm agreements they might like to make in order to maximize group success when they meet. After brainstorming, the group clarifies the posted ideas. Finally the group selects five to seven agreements most important to them. These are posted on the wall or appear on each subsequent meeting agenda.

For groups that already have a successful group history they are unnecessary and establishing them runs the risk of presuming members would not select productive behaviors without this step. This can have an infantilizing effect on members. Next, should groups establish them, monitoring is necessary. “Once groups establish rules, the facilitator must make sure that group members follow the working agreements. From time to time, individuals might need to violate a rule by leaving early or taking an emergency phone call; as long as deviations are outside of the agreement, no one will care. When bad habits become the de facto working agreement, everyone notices” (Garmston and Zimmerman, 2013, p. 54). Since an overarching aim of group work is self-directedness, self-monitoring is best.

The image is a page from a book or article titled "The Adaptive School." The main heading on the page is "The Seven Norms of Collaboration." The text discusses the importance of developing group members' skills for effective collaboration, rather than focusing solely on training skilled facilitators. It introduces the concept of "norms of collaboration," which are behaviors that facilitate productive communication within groups. The page lists the seven norms and explains their significance, as well as the difference between skills and norms. The text also encourages readers to reflect on their own behavior in group settings and to assess which norms they consciously practice.

**The Seven Norms of Collaboration**

Several years ago our friend and colleague Bill Baker commented that organizations have been training the wrong people. Instead of spending time and energy developing more skilled facilitators, he said, they should develop group members’ skills as the way to improve practice and success. Our experience bears out the wisdom of this approach. When group members are knowledgeable and skilled, anyone with simple knowledge of facilitation principles and moves can facilitate constructive group work.

Drawing from the “Cognitive Coaching” model (Costa and Garmston, 2015); the work of Peter Senge (1990); the work of Baker, Costa, and Shalit (1997); and refinements by Dolcemascolo and McKanders (2014) we have adapted and updated this set of norms of collaboration as the tools for productive communication between members of a working community. These are as follows:

1. Pausing;
2. Paraphrasing;
3. Posing questions;
4. Placing ideas on the table;
5. Providing data;
6. Paying attention to self and others;
7. Presuming positive intentions.

Reflect on your typical behavior in some group with which you regularly work. Before reading the following descriptions of the norms of collaboration, do the following self-assessment. In the list above put a checkmark after the norms to which you pay conscious attention in most meetings with the group you have in mind.

There is a marked difference between skills and norms. A skill is something that someone knows how to do. A skill becomes a norm when it is normal behavior in the group.

When this occurs, the behavior becomes normative for new group members, who model their own behavior on the standards tacitly set by group veterans.

When the seven norms of collaborative work become an established part of group life and group work, cohesion, energy, and commitment to shared work and to the group increase dramatically. The seven norms serve as guides and benchmarks in groups, in hallway conversations, with parents and students, and in the staff room. As they become established within the working substrate, they teach and remind all members, both veterans and newcomers, that this is the way we talk to each other around here.

In our follow-up work with clients, this phenomenon is reported time and again. An assistant superintendent shared with us that when one or two people in a meeting practice the norms, the behavior of other group members becomes more effective.

A major tension is that all groups have more tasks to accomplish than time in which to accomplish them. Yet any group that is too busy to reflect on process is too busy to improve. The seven norms become goals for collective growth. In adaptive schools, individuals and groups select goals from among the seven norms. They practice, monitor, and reflect on the impact of the norms for themselves and for the group.

Each norm is deceptively simple. Most are skills that people regularly apply in one-to-one communications. The irony is that these seemingly simple behaviors are rare in many meetings. Inquiring into the ideas of others increases the capacity for group members to influence each other. Pausing and paraphrasing are often missing, especially when things get tense. Posing questions for specificity is forgotten when members presume to understand others’ meanings. This can lead to later confusion and complication. Presuming positive intentions prevents members from judging others. Interpersonal judgments spawn blocked thinking

CHAPTER 4

and negative presuppositions. See appendix B through E for self and group assessment inventories. We offer the following explanations of the norms as a rationale for their importance.

**Pausing**

There is a vast research base on the positive effects of teacher pausing and silence on student thinking. The “wait time” research of Mary Budd Rowe (1986) has been replicated around the world. Thinking takes time. High-level thinking takes even longer. This research indicates that it takes from three to five seconds for most human brains to process high-level thoughts.

Not all brains work the same way. This is especially evident in meetings and group work. Some people prefer to think out loud and construct their ideas externally; others prefer to process ideas internally and reflect and analyze before speaking. The external processors often get in the way of the internal processors. This can be an alienating experience for deliberate, internal thinkers. The meeting topics move by before the internal processors have had a chance to contribute.

The members of one middle school team with whom we worked began to laugh at themselves after completing the Norms of Collaboration Group Inventory (appendix C). When we inquired, they said they’d been working together for more than two years and had yet to make a decision. In their group, if you stopped to breathe while speaking, you lost the floor. Consequently, they all had tremendous lung power and claimed they could each talk for hours on a single inhalation. What they recognized was that without a norm of pausing, meetings became a competition for air space. They soon learned to monitor pauses at several junctures to increase their productivity and satisfaction.

Groups become skilled at pausing at four places in the flow of their conversations. The first pause occurs after asking a question or offering a paraphrase. This allows initial processing time for those responding to the question or reflecting on the paraphrase. The second pause occurs after someone speaks. Human beings think and speak in bursts. With additional processing time, more responders organize thoughts into more coherent speech. The third place to pause is before paraphrasing or questioning. A group in Istanbul told us that they initiated a five-second pause rule after each speaker. Meetings became less stressful, more respectful, thoughtful, and more productive.

In the original wait-time research with students, when teachers paused after asking questions and after the students’ initial responses, the length of the responses increased from 300 percent to 700 percent, depending on the socioeconomic status (SES) of the child. The lower-SES children had the greatest gains.

The first two pauses require the questioner and other group members to monitor and control their own behavior. These are pauses to give other people time to think. This is personal reflection time in which that person waits before answering. Sometimes one says, “Give me a moment to think about that before answering.” At other times one acknowledges the question nonverbally, goes inside oneself to think, and then responds to the question. This is also a nice way to model thoughtfulness for others and can be an important normative behavior in groups.

A fourth place for pausing in meetings is a collective pause. This can be formally structured or can occur spontaneously. These shared pauses allow ideas and questions to settle in and allow time for note taking and reflection. The intent of these breaks in the action is to create shared cognitive space for the group and its members.

Pausing gets blood and nutrients to the neocortex and begins a pattern followed by paraphrasing and questioning. Groups give themselves a powerful gift when they establish this pattern as a norm; pause, paraphrase, and pose questions for a wider range of thoughts or for details; and pause, paraphrase, and pose questions about feelings.

Principles of Paraphrasing
- Attend fully.
- Listen with the intention to understand.
- Capture the essence of the message.
- Reflect the essence of voice tone and gestures.
- Make the paraphrase shorter than the original statement.
- Paraphrase before asking a question. Use the pronoun “you,” instead of “I.”

**Main Text:**

Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is one of the most valuable and least used communication tools in meetings. It is the key practice in authentic listening. Even people who naturally and skillfully paraphrase in one-to-one settings often neglect this vital behavior in group settings. Groups that develop consciousness about paraphrasing and give themselves permission to use this reflection tool become clearer and more cohesive about their work.

Try this experiment. Paraphrase, then ask a question. Do this several times. Now ask questions without preceding them with paraphrases. Since a well-crafted paraphrase communicates “I am trying to understand you, and therefore I value what you have to say” and establishes a relationship between people and ideas, questions preceded by paraphrases will be perceived similarly. Questions by themselves, no matter how artfully constructed, put a degree of psychological distance between the asker and the asked. Paraphrasing aligns the parties and creates a safe environment for thinking (Lipton and Wellman, 1998).

We refer to paraphrases that invite thinking and reflect the speaker’s content and the speaker’s emotions about the content as mediational paraphrases. These can acknowledge, organize, or frame a level of abstraction for holding the content. The paraphrase reflects content back to the speaker for further consideration and connects that response to the flow of discourse emerging within the group. Such paraphrasing creates permission to pose questions for details and elaboration. Without the paraphrase, some group members may perceive posing questions as interrogation.

Knowing when to paraphrase in groups is a gained skill. Acknowledging paraphrases often occur when emotion is detected and in response to initial statements to establish expectations for listening. Organizing paraphrases are employed to capture contributions of several speakers on a topic or when individuals might have offered a series of ideas. As can be seen in table 4.1 abstracting paraphrases support conceptual or “things” thinking.

*The Structure and Flow of Effective Paraphrasing*

Listen and observe carefully to calibrate the content and emotions of the speaker. Signal your intention to paraphrase. This is done by modulating intonation with the use of an approachable voice and by opening with a reflective stem. Such stems put the focus and emphasis on the speaker’s ideas, not on the paraphraser’s interpretation of those ideas.

For example, reflective paraphrases should not use the pronoun “I.” The phrase “What I think I hear you saying” signals to many speakers that their thoughts no longer matter and that the paraphraser is now going to insert his or her own ideas into the conversation.

The following paraphrase stems signal that a paraphrase is coming:

You’re suggesting . . .
You’re proposing . . .
So what you’re wondering is . . .
So you are thinking that . . .
Hmm, you’re pondering the effects of . . .
So your hunch is that . . .

The table is divided into three main sections, each with bolded headings and bullet points or short paragraphs underneath. Here is a detailed transcription:

**Table 4.1. Balancing Inquiry and Advocacy**

**The Structure of Inquiry**
- Ask others to make their thinking visible.
- Use nonaggressive language and an approachable voice. “Can you help me understand your thinking here?”
- Use a pattern of pause, paraphrase, pause, and probe or inquire.
- Use exploratory language. “What are some of . . . ? How might you . . . ? What are your hunches about . . . ?”
- Inquire about values, beliefs, goals, assumptions, examples, or significance. “How does this relate to your values, beliefs, goals, or assumptions? What are some examples of what you think might happen if we act on your proposal? In what ways does this relate to your other concerns?”
- Explain your reasons for inquiring. “I’m asking about your assumptions here because . . .”
- Invite introspection. “What questions do you have about your own thinking?”
- Compare your assumptions to theirs.
- Investigate other assumptions. “Would you be willing to have each of us list our assumptions, compare them, and explore if there might be other assumptions about this issue?”
- Check your understanding of what is being said by pausing, paraphrasing, and inquiring. “So your main concern is the way our team is interacting and you’d like to see more cohesion and focused energy. What are some of your thoughts about how this might look and sound in action?”
- Test what others say by asking for broader contexts and examples. “How might your proposal affect . . . ? In what ways is this similar to . . . ? Please share a typical example of . . .”
- Reveal your listening processes. “I have been listening for themes. So far I’ve heard two. Are there others?”

**The Structure of Advocacy**
- Make your thinking and reasoning visible.
- State your assumptions. “Here is what I assume are the causes of . . .”
- Describe your reasoning. “I came to this conclusion because . . .”
- Describe your feelings. “I feel ______ about this because . . .”
- Distinguish data from interpretation. “These are the data I have. I’ll share them as objectively as possible. Now here is what I think the data mean . . .”
- Reveal your perspective. “I’m seeing this from the viewpoint of . . .”
- Frame the wider context that surrounds this issue. “Several groups would be affected by what I propose.”
- Give concrete examples. “To get a clear picture, imagine that you are in a new school and . . .”

**Test your assumptions and conclusions.**
- Encourage others to explore your model, assumptions, and data. “What do you think about what I have just said? Do you see any flaws in my reasoning? What might you add?”
- Reveal where you are least clear. “Here’s one area that you might help me think through . . .”
- Stay open. Encourage others to provide different points of view. “In what ways do you see it differently?”
- Search for generalizations, deletions, and distortions. “In what I’ve presented, do any of you believe that I might have overgeneralized, left out data, or reported data incorrectly?”

**THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL**

Choose a type of paraphrase with which to respond. There are three broad categories of paraphrase types, each with a specific function. We have refined our thinking about these since the last edition. One discovery is that sometimes people infer that the three types should be used in sequence. This is not the case, though it is not unusual to begin conversations with the intention of acknowledging the speaker.

1. **Acknowledging.** If the paraphrase is not completely accurate, the speaker will offer corrections. “So you’re concerned about the budgeting process and ways to get input early.”
2. **Organizing.** Offer themes and “containers” to organize several statements or separate jumbled issues. This is an especially important type of paraphrase to use when multiple speakers contribute to a topic. “There appear to be two issues here. One is resource allocation and the other is the impact of those decisions on student learning.” In video 4.1, the facilitator poses a question, listens to the group, then responds with an organizing paraphrase.

*QR code labeled "Video 4.1."*

3. **Abstracting.** Listen deeply for meaning then shift to a higher or lower level of abstraction. This paraphrase invites the speaker to think at levels either more abstract or concrete in an manner congruent with the *Ladder of Abstraction* (Hayakawa, 1939). In video 4.3, the facilitator offers an abstracting paraphrase and “How to work with a person who is threatened.” paraphrase by naming the common ground in the four responses she has heard from the group.

*QR code labeled "Video 4.3."*

“So a goal for you is . . .” or, “An assumption you have is. . . .” Paraphrasing within a flow of discourse often moves through a starting point of acknowledging, then using each of three forms of paraphrase depending on intention in the moment. Paraphrases move to a higher level of abstraction when they name concepts, goals, values, and assumptions: “So a major goal here is to define fairness in the budgeting processes and compare those criteria to the operating values of the school.” “So you are valuing depth over breadth.” Paraphrases move to a lower level of abstraction when concepts require grounding in details: “So fair might mean that we construct a needs assessment form for each department to fill out and submit to the site council for public consideration.”

*Learning Styles and Paraphrasing*

Paraphrases that summarize or shift the abstraction level of discourse support and stretch the thinking styles of different group members. Global thinkers appreciate paraphrases that separate and organize “thinking in progress.” At other times the shift down in level of abstraction grounds global thinkers in specific examples and concrete details. Concrete, highly sequential thinkers learn from the shift up to higher levels of abstraction. This helps them to explore a bigger picture and creates a wider context for thinking.

*Posing Questions*

Thes first two norms are the platform for inquiry. In practice, inquiry follows a pattern of pausing, paraphrasing, and questioning. The tonal and syntactical stucture of questions can

amplify or reduce any perceived danger that the listener might hear in the inquiry. Deep in our biological wiring we have a finely tuned threat-detecting system. The molecules of emotion link to the molecules of cognition so strongly that the emotional processing circuits of the brain are the first centers to filter incoming messages. Perceived threats trigger emotional responses that can inhibit or in some way interfere with high-level thought. To reduce threat and to open thinking, persons skilled in posing questions apply the following template (Lipton and Wellman 2013).

*Full Attention.* The invitation to think begins with full attention to others in the group. This makes our complete presence available for this conversation, which also indicates that we intend no harm. This physical message meshes with several verbal elements to form an invitation to think together about the ideas being explored.

*Approachable Voice.* Using an approachable voice is the next element of the invitation to think. This voice tone is well modulated and tends to rise at the end of a statement, summary, or question (Grinder, 1997). This tonal package envelops questions and comments, indicating the intention to invite and explore thinking and not to interrogate or challenge. In video 4.2, listen to the facilitator pose a question in an approachable voice and respond to the group using the concept of hopefulness in an abstraction paraphrase.

[QR code]
Video 4.2.

*Plural Forms.* Two important syntactical choices invite colleagues to think with us. One is to use plural forms to increase options and possibilities for thinking. The use of plural forms sets aside the need for evaluation and the sorting of ideas. For instance, to inquire about someone’s goals instead of their goal opens the realm of multiple intentions and not just one course of action. Group members often need to hear their ideas aloud before they know which are most central to the issues before the group.

*Tentative Language.* The other syntactical element is the use of tentative phrasing in statements and questions. Words like *some, might, seems, possible,* and *hunches* widen the potential range of responses and reduce the need for the listener to respond with confidence and surety. Words like *could* and *why* can decrease the confidence of listeners by seeming to ask for premature commitment or a need to defend ideas and actions that might not be fully developed.

*Open-Ended Forms.* In addition to employing the elements noted above, mediational facilitators and group members frame their questions by using open-ended forms. These are questions that cannot be answered yes or no. For example, instead of asking a group, “Does anyone have any ideas to add?” they ask, “What are some additional ideas we might add to the mix?” By eliminating dichotomous stems such as, “Can you,” “Did you,” “Will you,” or “Have you,” skilled questioners invite more productive thinking that puts inquiry first within the group.

**Posing Questions to Explore Thinking**

Using the elements of invitation, we pose questions to explore thinking by asking about perceptions, assumptions and interpretations, and invite others to inquire into their own thinking.

Examples:
- What might be some of the assumptions we have about . . . ?
- Given our concern and knowledge of this issue, what might be some of the observations . . . ?
- As we are considering the bigger picture, what might be some of the factors and . . . ?
- How might you describe your feelings about . . . ?
- What might be some reasons our four-year-olds ask more questions than our six-year-olds?

**Posing Questions to Specify Thinking**

Human brains are not designed for specificity. In a world swimming in details, brains form quick generalizations from fragments of information. Brains delete particulars from streams of data and distort incoming and outgoing messages to fit deeply embedded models of reality (Bandler and Grinder, 1971). These are all natural processes; they do not willfully occur. Generalizations, deletions, and distortions are survival patterns hardwired into the human brain. They are adaptations to the challenges faced by our hunting and gathering ancestors. In modern times these same traits cause difficulties in human communication. Conversations go haywire when the various parties make different assumptions about the meaning of words and concepts and neglect to verify or correct those assumptions. Problem definition, problem solving, and solution generation all rely on specificity for success.

Five categories of vagueness inhabit human speech; these are described below.

**Vague Nouns and Pronouns**

Someone named “they” makes most of the decisions in organizations. “They” are joined by “the central office,” “the administrators,” “the union,” “the parents,” “the students,” and a host of others as the source of mysterious messages, concerns, and directives. Unless group members know who “they” are, communication takes longer, and people do not always know how to treat the information.

When a speaker in a meeting says our students can’t write, someone in the group should paraphrase then pose a question asking for details. It might sound like this: “So you’re concerned about student writing. What’s your hunch about how many of our students have writing difficulties?”

After the speaker answers, the logical follow-up question would be about which areas of writing are of most concern. If the group discovers that a small number of students lacks specific skill, they can develop a remediation plan for this targeted audience. If the group discovers that a large number of students has fundamental issues as writers, this calls for a more in-depth look at the patterns of curriculum and instruction in the school. Without the details, the group does not know which problem to solve.

**Vague Verbs**

Planning and problem-solving sessions require specificity for targeted action. The verb plan itself means very different things to different people. Some think that it means scratching ideas on a napkin; others imagine timelines and flowcharts with names and dates attached. Groups have to define their verbs. Words like *improve, enhance, design, modify,* and *understand* are all examples of vague verbs used by working groups. Someone should begin by posing questions for specificity in order for the team to agree on concepts, plan for change, and act in concert.

Vague nouns and pronouns and vague verbs often go hand in hand. A statement like “We want our students to be on time and prepared for class” easily produces surface agreement in most groups of educators. It is only when we pose question about which students are not yet meeting these requirements and what the meanings of “be on time” and “be prepared” are that the issue can even be discussed rationally.

**Comparators**

“This meeting was much better than last month’s session.” Unless the group discovers the speaker’s criteria for better, the members will not know how to repeat the improvement or, for that matter, whether the speaker’s “better” is even desirable. Words like *best, larger, slower, more,* and *least* leave out the point of comparison and the standard for the comparison.

When undefined comparators are used, pose questions about criteria. “So you’ve enjoyed this meeting. What were some of the ways this was better for you?” The respondent here has been careful to ask the speaker for his or her criteria (“better for you”), which might not be important criteria to other group mem-

**bers. The intention is to draw the speaker out and expand the meaning of the statement.**

*Rule Words*

People operate with conscious and unconscious rules about how the world works and how they are supposed to operate in it. These rules appear in language when people say things like “We have to,” “We must,” “You shouldn’t,” and “I can’t.”

To clarify these rules and the ways that they govern behavior, other group members should pose questions for the rules behind the statements: “What would happen if we didn’t?” “Who or what says we must?” “Shouldn’t? Who made up that rule?” “What stops you?” Intonation is important here. The voice carrying the response has to be well modulated, friendly, and nonthreatening.

*Universal Quantifiers*

“Everyone knows that this program is great.” Words and phrases like *everyone, all, no one, never,* and *always* are examples of universal quantifiers. Linguists use the term “deity voice” to describe this type of language. It is spoken as if the statement contains a universal truth of which “everyone” must be aware.

As most parents and middle school teachers know, universal quantifiers are the lingua franca of teenagers. “I need to go to the mall; all my friends will be there.” The typical response pattern is “All your friends? I can’t imagine that all your friends’ parents would permit them to go.”

By qualifying and clarifying a universal quantifier, group members ground their conversations in data and measurable details. When someone makes the statement that “These students never understand the assignments the first time,” another participant can pose questions to learn the meaning of never: “Has there ever been a time when students understood the first time around?” This can be followed up with an inquiry into the qualities and conditions of the assignments that are an exception to the initial statement.

**Placing Ideas on the Table**

Ideas are the heart of group work. In order to be effective, they must be released to the group. “Here is an idea for consideration. One possible approach to this issue might be . . .” When ideas are owned by individuals, the other group members tend to interact with the speaker out of their feelings for and relationship to the speaker rather than with the ideas presented. This is especially true when the speakers have role or knowledge authority related to the topic at hand. To have an idea be received in the spirit in which you tell it, label your intentions: “This is one idea” or “Here is a thought” or “This is not an advocacy, I am just thinking out loud.”

Knowing when to pull ideas off the table is equally important. “I think this idea is blocking us; let’s set it aside and move on to other possibilities.” In this case, continued advocacy of the idea is not influencing other group members’ thinking. This is a signal to pull back and reconsider approaches.

---

**Providing Data**

Productive group work is driven by data, both qualitative and quantitative. Data about student learning, school climate, teacher satisfaction, parent satisfaction, and the like are important to ground ideas being put on the table. Collaborative work in schools requires data as well as impressions. In fact, important learning is possible whether or not the data align with the impressions of group members.

Knowing what data are worth paying attention to is important. It is also important to know what collaborative practices will help people to engage with data in ways that increase their ownership and willingness to act on conclusions. Data can be quantitative or qualitative. Schools are difficult places to motivate and govern with numbers. A 6 percent rise in student reading scores is often not as compelling as a teacher’s tale of the slow reader who makes a breakthrough. Reasoning by anecdote is often more common than reason-

...ing with data. Interpreting and using data are learned skills that take time and practice to develop. Knowledge, meaning, and commitment result from dialogue and discussion about what story is told by the data. Without organized story making, people in organizations make up their own explanations for events. Part of the reason for this is protection from unwanted truths.

**Paying Attention to Self and Others**

For meaningful dialogue and discussion to occur, each group member needs to be conscious of themself and of others. Skilled group members are aware of what they are saying, how they are saying it, and how others are receiving and responding to their ideas. This includes paying attention to both physical and verbal cues in oneself and others. Since the greatest part of communication occurs nonverbally, group members need consciousness about their total communication package (Goleman, 2006). This includes posture, gesture, proximity, muscle tension, facial expression, and the pitch, pace, volume, and inflection in their voices.

Paying attention to self and others draws on emotional and cognitive maturity. It requires mindfulness, sensory acuity, and reflective action. Mindfulness focuses attention on sensory experiences, thoughts, and feelings without judgment. With sensory acuity, members increase the levels of detail of what is happening internally and externally to themselves. Reflective action, utilizing the first two resources, capacitates one to act, observe reactions, and sustain action when results align with outcomes or modify actions when they do not (Prickett and Ravlin, 2015).

One important skill to develop is paying attention to and responding to the learning styles of others. The earlier section on paraphrasing offers some tips for communicating with global and concrete thinkers. In addition to using those ideas, skilled group members match the language forms of others. This occurs when the respondent joins in a metaphor offered by another. It also occurs when the respondent matches the representation system of the speaker by using visual, kinesthetic, or auditory words in response to hearing the speaker operate within one or more of those categories (Lankton, 1980). Here’s an example:

Speaker: I’d like to see us develop a workable action plan.

Respondent: So you have an image of practical process that we can apply to our work. What are some of the features you’d like to have on view before us?

**Presuming Positive Intentions**

Assuming that others’ intentions are positive shows respect for others and encourages honest conversations about important matters. Respect, from its Latin origin, *respecere*, means to look again. “Where once we saw one aspect of a person,” explains William Isaacs, “we look again and realize how much of them we had missed” (1999, p. 111). This is an operating stance that group members must take if dialogue and discussion are to flourish; it is also a linguistic act for speakers to frame their paraphrases and inquiries within positive presuppositions.

Positive presuppositions reduce the possibility of the listener perceiving threats or challenges in a paraphrase or question. Instead of asking, “Does anybody here know why these kids aren’t learning?” the skilled group member might say, “Given our shared concern about student achievement, I’d like to examine our assumptions about what might be causing gaps in learning.”

The first question is likely to trigger defensiveness. The second approach will most likely lead to speculation, exploration, and collective understanding. This is especially true when a speaker has strong emotions about a topic and even more important when the respondent initially disagrees with the speaker. Here’s an example:

In the example above, the respondent presumes that the speaker is a committed professional who wants to solve a real problem. People tend to act as if such presuppositions are true. The emotional processors in the brain hear the positive intention and open up access to high-level thinking (Ledoux, 1996).

**Section Title:**  
*Working with Grace in a Culture of Advocacy*

In working groups that have not yet embraced a spirit of inquiry, round-robin, or back-and-forth advocacy are often the prevailing patterns of discourse. People who are not talking are not necessarily listening; in fact, they might just be waiting to talk or internally debating and are composing their thoughts and responses as they sit poised to pounce at the first opening. By applying the norms of collaboration, skilled group members, individually or collectively, interrupt this nonproductive pattern and establish more thoughtful forms of discourse within their groups. To do so they must first break the pattern of balancing advocacy with their own advocacy. Flexible group members and skillful facilitators learn to respond to advocacy with a pattern of pausing, paraphrasing, and inquiring.

We are influenced in this arena by the work of Peter Senge and his colleagues (1994) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Organizational Learning. We have extended the concept and refined specific language patterns for operating within this framework.

Matching advocacy with inquiry requires both emotional and cognitive resources. The balance is most necessary at the exact moment when many group members are least likely to want to inquire into the ideas of others. It is at the moment of greatest disagreement and discomfort that this pattern makes the biggest difference. To balance means to spend equal amounts of time and energy inquiring into the ideas of others before advocating one’s own ideas. The highest performing teams balance both (Losada and Heaphy, 2004). To do both equally well requires the resources of the seven norms of collaboration. Inquiry and advocacy are built on the linguistic and perceptual foundation described earlier in this chapter. Table 4.2 shows how to balance advocacy and inquiry.

The power of this pattern became apparent to us in an experience related to us by our friend and colleague Diane Zimmerman, who was enrolled in a doctoral program in organizational development. At the time, she was also a principal in Davis, California. Diane and her staff had taken on the norms of collaboration as a shared learning goal. As a skilled and congruent leader, Diane knew that she needed to apply the seven norms in her interactions with adults and students. To support her own learning, she continually sought opportunities to master and integrate these communication skills.

At an early stage in her graduate program, the professors organized a small-group learning experience. The students were placed in small groups and given a controversial topic to discuss. Most of the groups were soon at one another’s throats with rising emotions, much heated talk, and little listening. Diane’s group took a much different course. After a time, the professors gathered around in surprise, because the activity normally evoked the responses present in the other groups. Unable to resist their curiosity, they asked her group what was going on. Diane explained

#### Skilled Advocacy

The section explains that the intention of advocacy is to influence the thinking of others. It describes how group members may try to influence with volume, repetition, and passion, but effective advocacy works through logical reasoning and clear conclusions. The text notes that advocacy is more powerful when structured for multiple audiences and when individuals can frame issues for both concrete and sequential thinkers. It emphasizes the importance of blending logic with emotion and the value of stretching one's thinking preferences.

#### Developing Personal and Group Skills with the Seven Norms of Collaboration

This section compares group skill development to ballet dancers practicing in mirrored studios. It mentions that groups improve through reflection and references inventories in appendices B, C, D, and E for self-assessment and goal setting. It suggests focusing on one skill at a time and practicing it until it becomes automatic. The text encourages seeking daily opportunities to practice communication norms.

tool so that is available to you when you need it the most in a meeting. The rating scale in the appendix is a useful instrument for self-reflec- tion after running or participating in a meeting.

With groups in the early stages of devel- opment, we suggest that individuals assess by filling out the inventory located in appendix B. Once completed, the form becomes the basis for dialogue about skill development and base- line data for goal setting for individuals and groups. We encourage groups to master one or two of the norms at a time rather than attempt to take them all on at once.

For intact groups with some history of working together, the form is best completed by subsets of the group. In twos and threes they can work through the form, rating the full group’s use of each norm. Each subset then compares its assessments with the other subsets. Most groups discover that all members do not perceive meeting behaviors in the same way. This conversation leads to goal setting for individuals and groups.

The rating scale provides a useful vehicle for ongoing group assessment. Regular mon-

itoring with reflective processing keeps the norms alive and motivates steady improve- ment. In addition, the round-robin reflection pattern described in chapter 8 is a powerful tool for increasing personal and group consci- ousness and skills.

The four group-member capabilities and the seven norms of collaboration are essen- tial capacities and skills for high-performing groups. They operate within several practical frameworks that help groups to develop shared meaning and gracefully reach decisions. In the next chapter we describe two ways of talking among adults that make a difference for stu- dent learning. Both ways, dialogue and dis- cussion, draw on group-member capabilities and norms.

**Chapter 5**  
**Two Ways of Talking That Make a Difference for Student Learning**

Professional communities are born and nurtured in webs of conversation. What we talk about in our schools and how we talk about those things says much about who we are, who we think we are, and who we wish to be, both in the moment and in the collective future that we are creating for ourselves as colleagues and for the students we serve.

Research on the social nature of learning and cognition proposes three central themes as frames for thinking about the construction of new ideas and perspectives (Penlington, 2006; Putnam and Borko, 2000).

(1) Cognition is centered in specific physical and social contexts. Creating communities of thought is the ultimate outcome of developing a high functioning team or department. Thinking together is both the expectation and the reward in such communities. As we pointed out in chapter 3 the word community itself is rooted in the word communicate. We hold things in common by attending to the form and function of collective talk. The physical organization of meeting rooms enhances these processes. For more details on managing space and the surround to enhance collaborative engagement see chapter 6.

(2) Cognition is social in nature. Thought is a collective process. Our outer talk reflects internal thought patterns and in the process of language construction, we modify those same thought patterns. In this way, our external talking alters our inner speech. By listening to the perspectives of others, reflecting those thoughts back in the form of paraphrases, and inquiring into the ideas of others we shape both their thinking and our own. These same alterations in the patterns of thought occur when others paraphrase us and inquire into our ideas.

(3) Cognition is distributed between individuals and tools. No one person has all the answers or all of the ideas. Collectively we are typically smarter than when working alone. Yet, working together is not always easy. It requires skills, dispositions, and a shared toolkit of maps and tools for talking to manage the cognitive and emotional load of productive collaboration.

Group talk is the organizing ingredient of shared learning, yet it is dangerous and often counterproductive to put people in a room without frameworks and tools for skilled interaction. The group-member capabilities and norms of collaboration described in the previous chapter supply part of the equation. What is missing is a map for two kinds of talking that make a difference for student learning (Garmston and Wellman, 1998).

An elementary school staff was struggling with the reduced budget for instructional aides. Although consensus and fairness were their goals, they reported that they felt like turkeys being asked to vote on the merits of Thanksgiving. No one really wanted his or her aide time cut. One first-grade teacher was adamant: She would agree to lose aide time “over my dead body.” Six months later, as part of a schoolwide effort to support development of literacy and reading skills, this same teacher volunteered to share her classroom aide with a third-grade

**Main Content:**

The page discusses different ways of talking that impact student learning, focusing on dialogue, discussion, conversation, and deliberation.

- **Dialogue** is described as honoring the social-emotional brain, building connection, belonging, and safety. It connects to underlying motivations and mental models, forming a foundation for sustained effort and community building. Example phrases include:

- **Discussion** is described as more skillful, requiring sustained critical thinking, careful consideration of options, and respect for conflicting points of view. It leads to decision-making that serves the group’s and school’s vision, values, and goals. Example phrases include:
  - “We need to define the problem we are solving before jumping to solutions.”
  - “I’d like to see the data that these assumptions are based on before we go much further.”

**Content under Subheading:**
- When groups come together, they “converge” and “converse.” The Latin roots of these words mean “turn together” and “associate with one another.”
- **Conversation** is informal, sharing information, anecdotes, and opinions to learn or enjoy company. When it takes on an organized purpose, it can deepen understanding or make decisions.
- **Deliberation** (from Latin *deliberare*, to weigh, evaluate, assess, or ponder) is a conscious choice for groups to engage in dialogue or discussion.

- The text discusses the importance of road maps for group processes and purposes, and how culturally embedded patterns shape behaviors. It mentions the influence of media-saturated environments and the tendency for conversations to become polarized, referencing the Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley debates of 1968.

- The text warns that if group members are not careful, they may listen to find gaps in logic or interrupt, leading to verbal combat with winners and losers. Valued colleagues may become conscientious objectors, and the group loses perspective and alternative viewpoints. The loudest voices become policymakers, and in the worst cases, passive noncompliance or sabotage may occur among those who feel excluded or devalued.

**THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL**

When groups understand that they have more than one way of talking available to them, they can consciously choose to pursue the path of dialogue or to follow the path of discussion. Most important issues require explorations along both pathways. Many sensitive issues, especially those with high stakes for the participants, call for separate sessions in which the dialogue and discussion are separated in time and sometimes space. One useful facilitation technique is to explicitly label agenda items as either dialogue or discussion and offer language models to further mark the distinctions between the two forms of discourse.

As group members become more sophisticated with the ways of talking, the pathways become more malleable. For example, during a dialogue, a group member senses an emerging consensus on an issue. He or she then inquires if this is so and frames a proposal to move the item to a decision. In another case, during a discussion, emotions rise and the details become muddled. Someone then proposes that the group switch to a dialogue format for a set time to explore the feelings and underlying issues that are present.

**The Path of Dialogue**

Dialogue is a reflective learning process in which group members seek to understand one another’s viewpoints and deeply held assumptions. The word *dialogue* comes from the Greek *dialogos*. *Dia* means “through” and *logos* means “word.” In this meaning-making through words, group members inquire into their own and others’ beliefs, values, and mental models to better understand how things work in their world. In dialogue, listening is as important as speaking. For skilled group members, much of the work is done internally.

Physicist and philosopher David Bohm (1990) described dialogue as a process of eliciting and altering the “tacit infrastructure of thought.” As a quantum physicist, Bohm draws an analogy between dialogue and superconductivity. Electrons that are cooled to extremely low temperatures dramatically change their behavior, operating more as a coherent whole and less as separate parts. In supercool environments, electrons flow around barriers and one another without resistance, creating very high energy. The same electrons radically change behavior in a new environment. At higher temperatures they operate as separate entities, with random movement and loss of momentum (Isaacs, 1993).

Dialogue creates an emotional and cognitive safety zone in which ideas flow for examination without judgment. Although many of the capabilities and tools of dialogue and skilled discussion are the same, their core intentions are quite different and require different personal and collective monitoring processes.

**Monitoring Dialogue**

Mindful group members pay attention to three essential elements during productive dialogue. They monitor themselves, the process of the dialogue, and the new whole that is emerging within the group.

*Self*

Dialogue is first and foremost a listening practice. When we “listen to our listening,” we notice whether we are internally debating with the speaker, reviewing our mental catalogue of related information and personal anecdotes, or composing a response. Noticing these common internal processes allows us to switch them off so that we can hear others without judging.

Dialogue requires choice making. Typical choices include how and when to talk. Do we paraphrase prior comments to check for understanding and/or synthesis? Do we inquire into the ideas and assumptions of others? Do we put a new idea or perspective on the table to widen the frame?

Listening set-asides (chapter 4) and suspension are essential internal skills in dialogue. To suspend judgment, group members temporarily set aside their own perceptions, feelings, and impulses and carefully monitor their internal experience. Points of personal conflict can eas-

**CHAPTER 5**

...ily emerge when we believe that others are not hearing us or that they are distorting our point of view. Points of conflict also surface when our own values conflict with those of a speaker. These areas of discomfort influence our listening and our responses, which in turn influence the thoughts and behaviors of other group members.

Senge, Roberts, Ross, Smith, and Kleiner (1994) note that suspension also involves developing an awareness of our own assumptions and purposely “hanging them from the ceiling”—that is, suspending them in front of the group so that all can examine them. These assumptions are beliefs—often unexamined—about why we think things work as they do. Our assumptions drive our perceptions, simultaneously opening and blinding us to possibilities in the world around us.

*Process*

Dialogue as a process requires focusing on the goal of developing shared understanding. In our action-oriented work environments, this is often countercultural. Yet in every group with which we’ve worked, all the participants could recite examples of decisions that were poorly conceived, poorly communicated, simply ignored, or, in the worst cases, violated by many organizational members without consequence. At the root of all these stories were group processes that were not thought out, but rather often hurried and inappropriately facilitated. The rush to action pushed unclear decision-making processes and timelines onto the group without sufficient attention to developing a shared understanding of both problems and solutions.

By going slow and honoring the flow of dialogue, groups can often go fast when they get to the choice points in decision-making. When the assumptions and the implications of those assumptions have been explored during dialogue, group members don’t second-guess the motives of others during discussions.

Meetings should be safe but not necessarily comfortable. When a group confuses safety with comfort, it sacrifices productive tension for the ease of conviviality. Humor and banter can be avoidance strategies as much as they can be social lubricants. A lack of comfort with discomfort weakens dialogue and undermines the learning possibilities in that moment.

*Whole*

Thought is both a personal and a collective process. We influence and are influenced in turn by others. During dialogue, the line between self and others blurs when we open ourselves to the possibilities within the communal thought space. This created whole is in itself a goal of dialogue. Communities move forward together. Collective understanding leads to shared goals and shared practices that tap the power of cumulative effect for student learning and for the adult learning community.

The whole is always greater than the sum of the individual parts. In many ways it is both process and product simultaneously. By learning to observe the processes, patterns, and results that emerge from our dialogues, we can more consciously participate and more consciously contribute to the whole of which we are the parts.

**Understanding as the Outcome**

Well-crafted dialogue leads to understanding. This is the foundation for conflict resolution, consensus, and professional community. Decisions that don’t stay made are often the result of group members feeling left out or having their ideas discounted by the group. Dialogue gives voice to all parties and all viewpoints.

Misunderstanding lies beneath most intragroup and intergroup conflict. Dialogue illuminates and clarifies misunderstandings when the underlying values and beliefs are brought to the surface for examination. There is often alignment at this level; it is at the solution level that opinions differ. Working from a foundation of shared understanding, group members can more easily and rationally resolve differences, generate options, and make wise choices when they move to the discussion side of the journey.

**The Path of Discussion**

*Discussion*, in its Latin root *discutere*, means “to shake apart.” It focuses on the parts and their relationships to one another: the causes, the effects, and the ripple effects of proposed actions and solutions. In its most ineffective forms, discussion consists of serial sharing and serial advocacy without much group-member inquiry into the thinking and proposals of others. Participants attempt to reach decisions through a variety of voting and consensus techniques. When discussion is unskilled and dialogue is absent, decisions are often low-quality, represent the opinions of the most vocal members or leader, lack group commitment, and do not stay made.

Three elements (chapter 6) shape skilled discussions: (1) clarity about decision-making processes and authority; (2) knowledge of the boundaries of the topics open to the group’s decision-making authority; and (3) standards for orderly decision-making meetings. Most meetings are, in fact, structured discussions.

---

**Monitoring Discussion**

Mindful group members pay attention to three essential elements during productive discussion. They monitor themselves, the processes of skilled discussion, and the details of the problem solving, planning, and decision-making processes in which they are engaged.

**Self**

Productive discussions require group members to have emotional and mental flexibility. When our goal is to influence the thinking of others and we give up the model of winning or losing, we are more able to notice our thoughts and actions and the effects of those thoughts and actions on others.

Mentally, this requires taking a balcony view. This perceptual position is neither *egocentric* (I am intensely aware of my thoughts, feelings, and intentions and know my own boundaries) nor *allocentric* (I am aware of how something looks, feels, and sounds from the point of view of another). The balcony view is a third perceptual position, a *macrocentric* perspective, in which, with compassion and detachment, we try to understand the nature of the situation the group is in at the moment. It is with this view, looking down upon the group, that we gain the most knowledge about our group, the group’s interactions, and ourselves.

From the balcony we can make the most strategic choices about how and when to participate. Should I advocate or should I inquire? At what points should I press? When should I probe for detail or let go? How might I phrase an idea for greatest influence? These are the same internal skills that teachers employ when they monitor and adjust in their classrooms.

**Process**

Skilled discussion as a process requires mindfulness about focusing on one topic and applying one process tool at a time (chapter 6). When topics and processes blur, group members lose focus. To maintain focus requires clear structure, purposeful facilitation, impulse control on the part of individual group members, and recovery strategies if the group strays off course.

Effective group members share responsibility with the facilitator for maintaining the flow of the discussion, for encouraging other group members to share knowledge and ideas, and for hearing and exposing points of confusion or murkiness.

When working groups stray from skilled discussion, they often move to an unskilled form of debate. This occurs when group mem-

- Title: "Two Ways of Talking That Make a Difference for Student Learning"
- Chapter: "CHAPTER 5"

---

**Main Body:**

The page discusses the differences between dialogue and discussion in group settings, particularly in the context of student learning and professional communities.

**Key Sections and Content:**

1. **Details**
   - Successful dialogue requires attention to the whole, while successful discussion focuses on details in isolation and in interactions.
   - Discussion is also the path of decision-making, requiring identification of constraints (timelines, deadlines, budgets, standards, assignments, and decision-makers).
   - Groups need tools for:
     - Generating ideas (brainstorming, creative thinking strategies)
     - Organizing ideas (conceptual and graphic tools)
     - Analyzing ideas (tools for assumptions and clarifying particulars)
     - Deciding among alternatives (clarification of decision-making roles and processes)

2. **Decision as the Outcome**
   - The Latin root of "decision" is "decidere," meaning "to cut off or determine."
   - Decision-making involves eliminating some options to allow stronger ideas to prevail.
   - Ideas should belong to the group, not individuals, to be shaped, modified, and discarded as needed for the group's purposes.
   - The next chapter will address decision-making issues in greater detail.

3. **Professional Community**
   - Professional community is both a cause and effect of the two ways of talking.
   - Being in a community provides motivation and vision for interacting and working together.
   - A strong professional community results from both what is talked about and how people talk.
   - This requires courage, confidence, and skillfulness in applying tools for shared understanding and strategic decision-making.

4. **Consensus as the Holy Grail**
   - Consensus is one form of decision-making, not the only one.
   - Some groups get stuck using consensus without understanding the difference between dialogue and discussion.
   - Two types of consensus:
     1. Opening consensus (develops through dialogue)
     2. Focusing consensus (develops through discussion)
   - Opening consensus involves considering perspectives and possibilities.
   - Focusing consensus involves winnowing choices by clarifying criteria and applying them.
   - Consensus is a value and belief system, not just a decision-making process.

**Details**

Whereas successful dialogue requires attention to the whole, successful discussion focuses on the details, both in isolation and in their interactions. The path of discussion is also the path of decision. As such, groups need to identify any constraints under which they might be working, such as timelines, deadlines, budgets, product standards, nonnegotiable items, task assignments, and, most important, who they are in the decision-making process. Groups skilled in discussion employ many intentional cognitive skills. There is no set sequence for these efforts. The task before the group determines the necessary intellectual tool kit.

Groups need tools for the following:

- Generating ideas, including a repertoire of brainstorming and creative thinking strategies and protocols;
- Organizing ideas, including both conceptual and graphic tools;
- Analyzing ideas, including a variety of tools for illuminating assumptions and clarifying particulars;
- Deciding among alternatives, including the clarification of decision-making roles and processes.

**Decision as the Outcome**

Decision, in its Latin root decidere, means “to cut off or determine.” In practice this means to cut off some options. The purpose of discussion is to eliminate ideas from a field of possibilities and allow the stronger ideas to prevail. Groups must learn to separate people from ideas in order for this to work effectively. If ideas are “owned” by individuals, then to cut the idea away is the same as cutting the person away. Ideas, once stated, should belong to the group, not to individuals. In this way they can be shaped, modified, and discarded to serve the group’s greater purposes. The next chapter will address decision-making issues in greater detail.

**Professional Community**

Professional community is both a cause and an effect of the two ways of talking. As a cause, being in a community provides the motivation and vision of ways of interacting and working together. As an effect, a strong professional community results from both what is talked about and how people talk. Such talk requires courage, confidence in self and others, and skillfulness in applying the maps and tools for developing shared understanding and strategic decision-making practices.

**Consensus as the Holy Grail**

Consensus is one form of decision making, but not the only form. Some groups get stuck trying to use consensus processes without a consciousness of the difference between dialogue and discussion.

There are two types of consensus: (1) opening consensus, which develops through dialogue, and (2) focusing consensus, which develops through discussion. Opening consensus involves the consideration of perspectives and possibilities. Focusing consensus involves winnowing choices by clarifying criteria and applying these criteria to the choices. Focusing consensus for complex decisions depends on effective opening consensus.

Ultimately, consensus is a value and a belief system and not simply a decision-making process. Unless groups are willing to hang

**out with the process for as long as it takes, they are not usually ready for full consensus decision making.**

Most groups with whom we work are better served by “sufficient consensus.” This generally means that at least 80 percent of the group is willing to commit and act. It also means that the others agree not to sabotage. Sufficient consensus relies on both dialogue and discussion for its effectiveness. The practice of balancing advocacy and inquiry is essential. Any dissenting voices must be able to influence and persuade 80 percent of the group to carry the day. This also means that other group members can paraphrase and draw matters to a close when only a few voices line up on one side of an issue. Groups more easily come to common ground when they distinguish positions (divisive) from concerns.

**Norms and Values**

Professional community is built on the bedrock of norms and values, which are both honed by dialogue and discussion. Strong schools have core values about how children learn, what they should learn, and how faculties should work together. Some norms about faculty work are philosophical (e.g., everyone can be involved in decision making, or no one has to be involved, but once decisions are reached they are binding on everyone). Carl Glickman (1993) calls this a charter, or guiding rules of governance. This type of norm signals what is important to the organization.

Another type of norm specifies how the values of the organization can be achieved. Our work with schools emphasizes the use of the seven norms of collaboration described in the previous chapter. When school faculties make these seven tools into norms—that is, normal operating behaviors in formal and informal interactions within the school—adult relationships improve, groups work skillfully to explore members’ mental models and assumptions, and both dialogue and discussion are served. These norms also have a tremendous payoff in the classroom for both teacher-student interactions and student-student interactions. In many cases faculties take them on with the dual agenda of enhancing both faculty and student performance.

**Getting Started**

The collaborative norms of the group (chapter 4) have more influence on the possibility of success than do the knowledge and talents of the group facilitator. Thus, our staff development energies must go to groups, not to designated leaders of groups. We have found this to be helpful in groups that achieve high levels of skills in the challenging talk that is required in professional communities.

*(There is an illustration of five people sitting around a table, engaged in discussion. They appear to be collaborating or having a meeting.)*

Any group that is too busy to reflect on its work is too busy to improve. Every working group has many more tasks to do than time in which to do them and so is naturally reluctant to spend time monitoring and reflecting on its working processes. Many groups commit themselves to a task-process ratio to overcome this tendency; they budget a protected percentage of each meeting for examining how well the group is working and what it might do to improve.

Reflection can take many forms. Typically the least effective form involves a process observer—a special role for gathering data about the frequency or distribution of behaviors that the group believes are important. Because this places the gathering of data outside the group members, they ultimately become less accurate

in gathering their own data and self-assessments. A process observer can be useful when after gathering requested data, the data are shown without comment and members are invited to interpret them. The most effective form is through reflection on the four capabilities described in chapter 4. This can occur through journal writing, round-robin reflection, and dialogue that is focused on personal and collective learning about the power of attention to process. For reflecting on discussions use the meeting inventory (appendix I) in which members assess criteria for successful meetings.

Human beings are a social species. Living and working in groups is an important part of our genetic heritage. It is ironic, then, that in many schools, professionals who are charged with preparing students to be successful, collaborative citizens are themselves cut off from the rich resources offered by true collegiality. That we talk together in our schools is vitally important in these changing times. How we talk is just as important, for it is how we talk that influences the personal and collective satisfaction that motivates us to effectively talk together in our schools.

This section of the book offers principles for agenda design and samples of model agendas. (3) Applying skillful meeting facilitation concepts, strategies, and moves. While many of the skills involved are similar to making presentations to groups, the facilitation role is more complex. This leadership role requires neutrality toward the meeting content, a process tool kit for helping the group get its work done, and the courage to intervene when needed to support task focus and group development.

Chapter 6  Well-Run Meetings Enhance Social Capital

In chapter 1, we described schools as complex or dynamic systems. So too are groups of educators working together, such as faculties, departments, grade-level teams, and administrative cabinets. What happens in these groups influences other gatherings of educators throughout the system and can instill effectiveness, efficacy, and meaningful effort within an organization’s DNA.

Human, social, and decisional capital are essential for strong schools (Hargreaves and Fullan, 2012). Together, they form professional capital. Human capital refers to highly qualified teachers with knowledge of content, student learning characteristics, sound preservice work, emotional intelligence, and capability in relationships. Social capital refers to trust, collaboration, collective responsibility, peer pressure and support, mutual assistance, and networks. Decisional capital refers to teacher judgment, experience, practice, and the ability to reflect alone and together on their practices and to adjust practice to improve students’ learning accordingly.

Well-run meetings produce specific benefits in social capital including norms of reciprocity, clear communication, and operationally sound information flow. At the heart of these meeting is professional discourse. It occurs informally within disciplines as well as across disciplines, grade levels, departments, and faculties. It occurs in pairs, trios, and large groups. It occurs spontaneously and when planned. It happens in meetings. It is in meetings that teachers work together to improve instructional practice and performance. It is in meetings that teachers clarify policies, identify and address problems, assess standards, and modify schedules. It is in meetings that faculties respond to the changing needs of students, standards, and curriculum demands. It is in meetings that groups mature and manage differences, and it is in meetings that their working culture evolves—or stays the same.

Meetings have a greater effect on organizational success than initially meets the eye. First, effective and time-efficient meetings produce work that is important to the school. Second, well-conducted meetings promote member satisfaction, the capacity to collaborate, and a willingness to conscientiously contribute. Third, the more successful groups are at getting important work done in meetings, the greater their collective efficacy, a resource that is undeniably linked to student success. (We will say more in the next chapter about designing for efficacy.) Finally, members of successful groups ultimately become members and leaders elsewhere and enrich the quality of work done by units within the school and the district. For these reasons, knowing how to produce work through meetings has become an essential part of a professional portfolio, regardless of an individual’s role.

This chapter describes what members need to know and be able to do to have meetings that are productive, time-efficient, and satisfying. As noted earlier, teachers acquire social capital in these meetings. They also develop decisional capital as they gain wisdom and discernment relating student assessment data to instructional decisions. As we described in chapter 4, two ways of talking support such learning in

working groups: dialogue and discussion. Dialogue, which leads to understanding, is a necessary precursor to discussion, which leads to significant decisions.

**Talking to Decide**
Inquiry into the craft of meetings is fundamental for effective meetings. This inquiry should include questions on (1) how to distinguish the urgent from the important; (2) how to stay on track, on topic, and focused; (3) how to use conflict constructively; (4) how to orchestrate space and materials; and (5) how to make decisions that stay made. This is important for leaders and members, for, as we shall see, skilled members have more influence on meeting success than good facilitators do.

Three organizing principles guide meeting productivity and satisfaction: a collaborative mindset, positive relationships, and collective energy sources. These are described below.

**Collaborative Mindset**
Meeting success is influenced more by the collaborative mindset of the group than by the knowledge and skill of the group’s facilitator. Schwartz (2013) reports that over 90 percent of teams have a unilateral control mindset, ascribing to the leader the right and responsibility to make decisions for the team. An alternative mindset is collaborative, recognizing that “at any given moment, the insight and ability to move the team forward might come from anyone at the table” (p. 10). We refer to group members having this mindset as engaged participants. The overriding commitment of groups with a collaborative mindset is to work with others to achieve shared goals. For a committee, task force, department, or faculty to achieve this commitment, the members need to have the skills and knowledge for producing work in meetings. Counterintuitively, this is more important than the skills of a good facilitator. Imagine an athletic team playing without goals, knowledge of the rules of the game, an awareness of other positions, and some sense of common strategy. As much as a football team needs a coach, it also needs players who have a common understanding of the game and who are committed to achieving the goals and improving their individual and collective performance. Whether or not a group knows that it is directing its own dynamics, this is the most determining factor in accomplishing work.

**Positive Relationships**
The power of a group to produce results is rooted in the quality of the relationships among the participants. The highest performing groups have far more positive than negative communications, with a positivity ratio of roughly six to one (Losada and Heaphy, 2004). Becoming a learning community that focuses on improving practice and developing shared accountability is a goal for many groups. As evidence mounts that student learning is the result of such cumulative effort, teachers increasingly need the skills to conduct productive meetings in which they generate the know-how and the will to inquire into student learning, dialogue about data, assess and refine instruction, raise student achievement, and enhance professional community. To achieve this requires skillful collaboration. Collaboration is not easy, nor has it been previously required in most schools. It implies shared objectives, a sense of urgency and commitment, mutual trust and respect, intellectual agility, and the application of diverse skills and knowledge. Achinstein (2002) notes the following:

> When teachers collaborate, they run headlong into enormous conflicts over professional beliefs and practices. In their optimism about caring and supportive communities, advocates often underplay the role of diversity, dissent, and disagreement in community life, leaving practitioners ill-prepared and conceptions of collaboration under explored. (p. 5)

Collaboration requires the development and exercise of social, emotional, and cogni-

### Content Description:

The text discusses the importance of well-structured meetings in enhancing social capital, particularly in educational or workplace settings. It focuses on the concept of "Collective Energy Sources," which is rooted in cognitive social theory. The theory suggests that the culture of a workplace influences what teachers (or workers) do and how they think, beyond just their training or knowledge.

#### Key Points and Sections:

- **Collective Energy Sources:**  
  The section introduces the idea that robust social norms and behaviors within a group influence its members. The culture of the workplace can either inhibit or amplify learning. Well-structured meetings are highlighted as a way to influence this culture.

- **Five Sources of Collaborative Energy:**  
  The text identifies five sources of collaborative energy for high-performing groups:  
  1. Efficacy  
  2. Flexibility  
  3. Craftsmanship  
  4. Consciousness  
  5. Interdependence

  These are described as self-organizing values and are compared to the five states of mind in "Cognitive Coaching."

- **Efficacy:**  
  Collective efficacy is linked to improved student achievement. Groups with high efficacy use creative approaches, persevere longer, and achieve better outcomes. The collective efficacy of a school influences how persistently teachers pursue excellence.

- **Flexibility:**  
  Flexibility involves inquiring into data, developing theories, and solving academic challenges by considering multiple perspectives. Groups with flexibility honor diversity and can navigate internal tensions, generating multiple ideas for progress.

- **Craftsmanship:**  
  This is likened to the mindset of expert performers (musicians, artists, teachers, etc.). Groups with craftsmanship strive for improvement, elaboration, clarity, and precision, setting demanding goals and deepening their skills.

- **Consciousness:**  
  Consciousness is about being mindful and making thoughtful choices. It is essential for self-control and self-direction. Groups that utilize this energy source maintain awareness of their values and norms.

#### Text Excerpt (Transcription):

> Collective Energy Sources  
> The third organizing principle comes from cognitive social theory. The culture of the workplace influences what teachers do and how they think more than their training, experience, or knowledge influences what they do. Cognitive social theory holds that robust social norms and behaviors exert an influence on the individual members of a group. The work culture inhibits or amplifies the learning of its members. Well-structured meetings are one way to influence working culture.  
> ...  
> Efficacy. Collective efficacy is consistently related to improved student achievement. Collective efficacy beliefs seem to influence group performance by shaping the behavioral and normative environment of schools (Goddard, 2001). Groups with efficacy judge themselves to have the knowledge, skills, and will to meet goals and overcome obstacles to learning and behave accordingly. Efficacious groups use more creative approaches to problem solving, persevere longer, work more diligently, and achieve outcomes more successfully than groups without efficacy. The greater the collective efficacy of a school, the more that teachers persist in their pursuit of excellence. If most teachers in a school believe that the faculty can successfully teach students, it becomes the norm for teachers to help the students achieve high levels (Goddard, 2001).  
> Flexibility. To inquire into data, to develop theories of causation and solutions for academic challenges, requires an ability to set aside the first (too) easy answers and continue to delve from various perspectives. Groups who develop this energy source honor and value diversity inside and outside the group, attend to both rational and intuitive ways of thinking, collectively shift perspective, and utilize a wide array of thinking and process skills. Such groups can also navigate the internal tensions that are related to confusion and ambiguity and open capacity for generating multiple ideas for moving ahead.  
> Craftsmanship. Like the mindsets of expert performers—musicians, artists, teachers, craftspeople, and athletes—groups with craftsmanship take pride in their work and consistently strive to improve current performance. Craftsmanship—the drive for elaboration, clarity, refinement, and precision—is the energy source from which groups set demanding goals for themselves and ceaselessly work to deepen their knowledge, skills, and effectiveness.  
> Consciousness. To have consciousness is to be mindful—moving beyond habituated thinking to thoughtful choice. Consciousness is a prerequisite to self-control and self-direction. Groups that tap this energy source maintain an awareness of their values, norms, and iden-

...tity; monitor the congruence of their espoused beliefs and their manifested beliefs; and stand outside themselves to reflect on their processes and products.

_Interdependence._ Interdependent groups value and trust the process of dialogue, have an awareness of their multiple relationships and identities with other groups, and regard disagreement as a source of learning and transformation.

**Three Success Structures**

We now turn our attention to three success structures. We use the term _structure_ to describe a system of order and organization. Effective social structures honor the dynamic relationship of parts and bring them together into a workable whole. Since any group brings a variety of mental models, cognitive styles, personal histories, and individual agendas to its work, the potential for chaotic interaction always exists. Providing structures permits a full and focused expression of these differences in a manner that is useful to the work and life of the group.

The following three structures, taken together, guide groups to continual success. Each addresses significant questions in the work life of groups.

1. Who decides? What topics are ours? What decision-making processes will be used?
2. What meeting room features (the surround) will support the work?
3. What are the meeting standards that support us in staying focused and effective?

**Who Decides?**

Is a decision to be made by certain individuals within the group, by the group as a whole, by the person who convened the group, or by some person or group not present at this meeting? Groups are most effective and productive when they are clear about whether their role is to inform, recommend, or decide.

Ask any group to describe instances in which a lack of decision-making clarity led to confusion and poor implementation, and you will hear many examples. We worked with a group once whose members discovered that they didn’t know who would make the decision on the topic they were discussing. Yet they vigorously continued to work on the issue within this conceptual vacuum.

Trust diminishes when a group is not clear about who is making the final decision and what decision-making processes will be used. When group members lose trust, second-guessing, resistance, or lengthy and unproductive process arguments can occur. This steals time and, more important, saps group energy, efficacy, and motivation to persevere on important agenda items.

When curriculum committees understand that a final decision will be made by the school board, they can strategically plan their time. Thus 80 percent of committee time might be devoted to becoming as clear as possible about the recommendations they will make to the board. The other 20 percent of the time might be used to study and implement ethical systems of influence. Many a curriculum committee has been dismayed to have its recommendations denied because it had not brought the board along in the deliberations. The following are possible levels of authority for decision making:

- An individual or group above you;
- An administrator unilaterally;
- An administrator with input;
- An administrator and staff by consensus;
- A staff with input from administrators;
- A staff by consensus;
- A staff by a vote;
- A subgroup of a staff with input from others;
- A subgroup of a staff unilaterally;
- Individual staff members, selecting from a menu of options.

Well-Run Meetings Enhance Social Capital

CHAPTER 6

Constituents will blame the process when unhappy with the outcome. One of us worked in a district in which a neighborhood school was to be closed. A representative community committee met several times, examined data, formulated criteria and recommendations, and forwarded this work to the superintendent. He then examined the committee’s work with the administrative cabinet and made a recommendation to the school board. When the board announced the school would be closed, all hell broke out. Why? The process was sound, but had not been overcommunicated, thus constituents, both community and staff, assumed the decision had been in the superintendent’s desk since the start of the study. Mistrust clouded each new step in managing the transition.

Clarity about decision making is so crucial that we suggest that facilitators name the ultimate decision maker(s) and decision process as many as four times. Why overcommunicate like this? When people are investing energy in topics important to them, they often forget that there might be other parties in the decision-making chain. Thus, while introducing an item, the facilitator could say, “On this topic, you will be making a recommendation to the curriculum committee, which has the final say.” During the conversation about the topic, the facilitator could say, “As you consider how to structure your recommendation to the curriculum committee. . . .” At the conclusion of the meeting, the facilitator could summarize the action taken on each item, again stating on which topics the group made a recommendation or decision. Finally, if there are minutes for the meeting, the language should convey the level of decision-making authority possessed by the group. One of us worked with a superintendent in an eastern state who was particularly adept at maintaining clarity with groups about decisions. On one occasion, he visited each school’s faculty to seek its input on a decision he had to make. He said to each group, “Your job is to give me the best information possible. Your job is to inform me. My job is to make a decision. When I do decide, you will hear it first from me.” He then asked questions and listened. When his decision had been made, he again visited the schools. He reported to each staff, “This is the decision I made. This is my rationale. Here is how your information influenced me.” He then responded to questions.

Several months later another issue emerged in which the superintendent wanted input from the schools. He sent a memo describing the situation and saying that if the faculty wished to inform him, please send a representative to the central office for a meeting at a designated time. The teachers said to one another, “He really means it.” They had learned to trust the process. Teachers went to the meeting and informed the superintendent.

Remember the principle that meeting success is influenced more by the collaborative mindset of the group than by a skilled facilitator? Members, too, share responsibility for group consciousness about decision making. They can ask naïve questions (appendix A) such as “Excuse me. Who makes the final decision on this?” or “Where does this recommendation go after it leaves us?”

Asking a naïve question is one way that group members can effectively offer a correction to group work. To communicate naïvely is to speak with innocence. It is to be artless, unaffected, and natural. Naïve questions have an intonational quality of childlike inquiry in which the question being asked is truly open-ended. “Who will communicate this decision?” and “Who will be informed about this?” are examples of naïve questions. They serve the group in developing awareness about process, and they sometimes serve leaders because the question has been overlooked in planning.

A principal from a large urban district complained about thirty years of attending dysfunctional meetings. After being introduced to naïve questioning, he realized that as a group member he could make a difference. He began to ask naïve questions and was amazed at the influence he held as a group member to get meetings on track.

The image is a page from a book titled "The Adaptive School." The page is numbered 72. It contains two figures and several paragraphs of text.

**Figure 6.1: Decision Making Questions**
- This is a diagram with arrows and text boxes, showing questions to consider in decision making:
  - "How will the decision making process be communicated? – before – during – and after the decision (and to whom)"
  - "Who decides?"
  - "Who are we in the decision making process? Who is affected by this decision? Informing, Recommending, Deciding"
  - "What decision making process will be used?"
  - "How will the decision be communicated? (Clearly & Synthetically)"

**Text:**

> One of the best guides for clarity about decision making is a seminal twelve-step model (figure 6.2) offered by Saphier, Bigda-Peyton, and Pierson (1989). They emphasize that the model’s effectiveness comes from making it public.

> We advocate sharing and teaching this information to all members of an organization through modeling and explicit discussion; this goal is critical to school improvement. We do not do the process “to” or “on” people, nor is it a Machiavellian model for working one’s will on others. It is, rather, a set of guidelines for making good decisions that will stay made.

**What Topics Are Ours?**
> Groups conserve precious energy by focusing their resources where they have direct influence. When the “sandbox” in which a group is to “play” is clear to all the members, group energy can be powerfully directed at the items it can affect. This structure works in tandem with the first structure, deciding who decides.

**Figure 6.2: Twelve Steps for Making Successful Decisions**

The steps are divided into three sections: Planning, Deciding, and Implementing.

**Planning**
1. Identify and explicitly state the issue, who owns it, and what the underlying goal is.
2. Find out and explain how much discretion you have to take action or not. *Must* this issue be dealt with? State how strongly you personally feel about it.
3. Every issue lands in someone’s lap in the beginning. If it lands in yours, be sure to choose the proper path for who will make the preliminary and the final decisions.
4. At the beginning of the process, communicate clearly who will make the decision and identify any constraints that will affect the scope or content of the decision (e.g., staffing, budgeting, time).
5. State explicitly the values you want to maintain and why they are not negotiable, if that is the case (e.g., “Whatever proposals come forward, I want to hand on to small class size and the high quality of personal student-teacher contact we get from that”).

**Deciding**
6. Identify and periodically check out with people what the full impact or full consequences of the decision will be and communicate them to all parties involved.
7. Involve all parties whose working conditions will be affected by the decision.
8. Make clear the timeline for deciding and implementing the decision.
9. Decide. Then make an explicit statement of the decision or recommendations, summarizing to evaluate it and revise it if necessary.

**Implementing**
11. Close the loop. Communicate the decision fully and clearly to all affected parties after the decision is made, including how people’s input was used.
12. Plan how to monitor and support the day-to-day implementation of the decision and communicate these plans to everyone involved.

Well-Run Meetings Enhance Social Capital  
CHAPTER 6

As simple as these two decision-making concepts are, they become complex in organizations in which different groups have intersecting interests. After much deliberation, a high school’s faculty members went on a school holiday believing that because they had voted for a change in the school schedule, it would be changed when they returned to school. They were stunned to learn that schedule adjustments could not be made until administrators consulted with classified staff.

In another case, a teachers’ union spearheaded a joint project with the administration for a site-based decision-making program. One provision was a district-level council to oversee the site work. The union published the responsibilities and functions of each participating group, describing “sandbox” topics and decision-making authority on some topics. Despite good effort, insufficient specificity led to confusion, which in each case required time and emotional energy to untangle.

School site councils are common in many states and have different but related responsibilities with administration and the governing board. Councils are often composed of persons elected by teaching faculty, support staff, parents and community members, and the principal. Their work is complex, often encumbered with well-intentioned but burdensome state or district regulations. To foster success with these groups, districts often provide training in managing meetings. We encourage avoiding Robert’s Rules of Order for these groups. Robert’s was designed to protect potentially messy gatherings from chaos and disorder—a unilateral control mindset. A collaborative mindset using information about meetings provided here has been found to be less threatening and more productive.

All groups have interests that intersect with other groups’ decision-making authority. Considerations of collegiality, politics, and effectiveness must honor these overlapping areas of concern. Individual and collective vigilance is an essential ingredient of group success. At some time in every group’s history, this structure becomes important to departments, curriculum task forces, advisory groups, grade-level teams, site councils, and faculties.

An issue common to many schools is who should be responsible for decisions about schoolwide policy and practices on student discipline. This seems like a simple “sandbox” question. However, even the briefest conversation will reveal that several related questions must be explored. (We have labeled these naive questions and listed examples in appendix A.) Student discipline is necessary in what areas (gum or guns)? Within what parameters (state law or district policies)? At what level of authority (unilaterally or in consultation with the principal or parents)?

Suzanne Riley, a friend and colleague, was asked to consult with an elementary principal who was “under siege.” The school technology committee, composed of parents and teachers, had written and received a technology grant from a community business partner. The initial elation at receiving the funding had been replaced by frustration. The committee had submitted a list of desired equipment to the principal. The principal submitted the requisition for the equipment, but was then contacted by the district technology coordinator, who informed the principal that the desired equipment was not compatible with the district master technology plan. The principal informed the committee. The committee was very upset. One of the parents, who was knowledgeable about computers, said that the district plan was totally outdated. The committee argued that since it had secured the funding, it should be able to purchase the best available equipment for the students. The committee accused the principal of wasting its time and ignoring its recommendations. The disagreement escalated into a very unpleasant situation. Had the committee and principal clarified the “sandbox” issues at the beginning of the process, much unhappiness could have been avoided.

What decision-making processes will be used? Over time, intact groups learn a number of decision-making processes. Knowing what

process is being used is as important as knowing who decides. Collective decision making is used to develop criteria for decisions, rank related values, or select within alternative approaches to achieve goals. Voting is the least useful approach, typically producing a set of “losers” without adequate opportunity to express opinions or influence others. Consensus is a concept, not a strategy. The most useful consensus strategy we know is sufficient consensus, a process in which 80 percent agreement is required to move a proposition forward. When a decision requires implementation by group members, ranges of commitment must be expressed. Sufficient consensus provides this and differing perspectives can be heard, and accomodated when possible. The facilitator is responsible for assuring that minority voices are heard. It is understood that while some may not be fully in agreement with the group’s decision, each has a professional obligation to carry it out. Chapter 8 on facilitation details a number of specific decision-making strategies.

**What Meeting Room Features Will Support the Work?**

Consider the ideal meeting room. It is probably quiet, comfortable (but not too comfortable), and free from distractions. David Perkins (1992) defines these and other factors as part of the surroundings that mediate thinking and behavior. Although psychological, emotional, cognitive, and physical elements contribute to the surroundings, the facilitator has the greatest control over the physical arrangements in the meeting room.

Schwartz (2002) describes three principles for seating arrangements in meetings, and we have added a fourth. They are as follows:

1. All participants and the facilitator should be able to see and hear each other and any visual information presented (e.g., flip charts, projected images).
2. Arrange the seating to distinguish the participants from the nonparticipants.
3. The seating arrangement should be spacious enough to meet the needs of the group, but no larger.
4. The work-group space should accommodate physical movement, subgrouping with different partners, and personal ownership of the entire room rather than of a single chair or a table.

Arranging a room to accommodate the first principle is rarely a problem when the group size is about twenty or fewer. The semicircle, U-shape, or oval arrangements shown in figure 6.3 will easily serve twenty to twenty-five participants. As the group size expands up to forty or so in a council or decision-making group, arrange a series of tables in a herringbone pattern to allow all participants to see the facilitator and the flip charts. When the group size reaches eighty to three hundred people, as it sometimes does for community forums, facilitate from a set of risers. Position flip charts on the risers and use large markers like Washable Marker available online and in many office supply stores. Regardless of the size of the group, if the participants cannot hear one another at any time, they should call out, “Louder, please!” The facilitator should remind the group of this at the beginning of the meeting.

Specific tasks require conscious room arrangement and provision of materials. The room arrangement communicates and structures the desired interaction.

Keep in mind that if eleven million bits of information are bombarding the participants each second, ten million come through the eyes, and only 40 percent of all that information is being processed consciously. Visual displays are more important for working groups than we have previously thought. Lightweight nylon banners displaying seven norms of collaboration, two ways of talking, meeting standards, and group member capabilities are available at www.thinkingcollaborative.com for display in meeting rooms.

High-performing groups post charts that state outcomes for their tasks and charts that

**Main Text (Below Box):**

Remind the participants of the agenda, working agreements, and other central foci like collaborative norms. These groups chart for group memory during discussions. They choose strategies that include a visual component.

Group memory and graphic processes support learning and retention. Charting materials such as markers, tape, pads, and easels should be readily available. Wall space should also be considered. Blank walls without other artwork are best for meeting rooms. This lets each group craft the space to its own needs. When groups become fatigued, auditory functions are the first to go. The very best markers we have found for facilitation and presentations are Charters® Markers available at Grove Consulting (store.grove.com). Another useful brand, not as expensive, is Mr. Sketch Markers available online and in office supply stores. In video 6.1 the narrator describes room armgnent concepts and materials.

Many public bodies and decision-making groups work in settings in which others are present to observe, inform, or advocate. It is easier for the facilitator to monitor the moods, interactions, and energy of the members when the seating arrangements distinguish them from nonmembers. We’ve seen several arrangements for this. For instance, a council of eight to twelve people is seated, facing one another,

>
> Two of the most important facilitator responsibilities are to focus the group on one topic at a time and one process at a time (see "Developing Standards," below). Space, flip charts, other visual displays, gestures, and the position of the facilitator's body become valuable tools for focusing the group. In addition, all facilitator communications are enhanced when nonverbal signals are congruent with the purpose and the facilitation language. For example, people consciously direct their attention to an area at which someone points and unconsciously attend to where the person's eyes are looking. Thus, recorders who point to a flip chart and direct their eyes to the same spot not only focus group energies there, but also ensure facilitator control of focus by not looking at the group.

> Stand in one spot to give directions. Move to a new space to ask for clarification. This "visual paragraph" separates the intention of the two messages both verbally and nonverbally. Chapter 8 describes the facilitator role in detail and offers many nonverbal facilitation strategies to direct. In video 6.2, a narrator describes a facilitators's use of the visual paragraph as we observe the facilitator give instructions.

> Skilled groups develop a variety of seating patterns and room arrangements to support different types of social and cognitive interactions. Planning these setups is part of the meeting design process. Groups and meeting designers who lack this awareness can get trapped by the default furniture configurations of the rooms in which they work. Moving the furniture to support productive group work is an important part of a meeting's success.
>
> One vital consideration is to remove any empty chairs from the work area. In both dialogue and discussion settings, empty chairs draw energy from the group and increase both the physical and psychological divide among the participants. The actual physical removal of unused chairs sends a powerful message to the group about the need for connection. This is reinforced when latecomers have to move a chair to join the group.
>
> When people in meetings sit where they always sit, they tend to see what they always see and say what they always say. Group members will initially sit where they are most comfortable; let them. However, people unconsciously become territorial in meetings quite easily. You might have noticed that in groups that meet periodically, the members will take the same space that they occupied in the last meeting. There are two generic advantages for periodically changing the seating arrangements. First, it produces energy to move and sit with someone else. Group deliberations can be deadening, and thinking deadened, without physical movement.

> Second, subgroup conversations that are always held with the same person or small group impose limitations on thinking. Conceptual boundaries are formed by these consistent relationships, backgrounds, cognitive styles, and positions. Moving members into different conversational subgroups brings

The image is a page from a book titled "The Adaptive School." The page number is 78. The content is divided into several paragraphs discussing the use of technology and visual aids in meetings to enhance group productivity and collaboration.

**Detailed Description:**

- The top of the page continues a discussion on the importance of fresh thinking in meetings, mentioning how changing seating arrangements can serve various purposes, such as breaking up cliques or signaling transitions between agenda items.
- It discusses how certain tasks (like planning, problem-solving, and decision-making) are more effective with special room arrangements and access to multiple kinds of data, such as laptops, tablets, projectors, charts, and posted information.
- The text emphasizes the value of visual aids, such as group memory devices and charts, which help clarify tasks and remind members of agreements and standards. It notes that composing language for public recording enhances thinking and consensus.
- There is a QR code labeled "Video 6.4." with a caption below it: "Video 6.4."
- A new section titled "Technology Use in Meetings" begins. It explains that the facilitator’s role is to focus energy and attention, regardless of technology use, and to help the group achieve its goals by managing one process and topic at a time.
- The text discusses the double-edged nature of technology in meetings: while digital devices can increase productivity, they can also distract group members. It mentions strategies for managing device use, such as naming agreements about when and how devices should be used.
- The section highlights the importance of using technology collaboratively (e.g., sharing laptops or tablets for group work) rather than individually, and suggests setting up a second projector for group data exploration.
- The text concludes by recommending that groups master a few digital tools rather than many, and suggests the Google Suite (Google Drive, documents, spreadsheets, and graphs) as a useful toolkit for group collaboration.

In addition to working with laptops, tablets, and projector; writing on charts; and information posted on the walls become group memory devices. Many times we have witnessed a group fall silent while members scan what is on display, linking and relating information to the next task in their project.

> Perhaps more important than serving memory, what is written becomes a visual voice—always in the room, never silent, interacting with group-member thinking. Many high-performing groups post charts to clarify tasks and remind members of working agreements. Some groups keep lists of collaborative norms, meeting standards, and group-member capabilities on permanent display. Furthermore, the act of composing language for public recording interacts with thinking, forcing greater specificity, economy, and consensus. In video 6.4 the importance of markers, tape, flip charts, and wall space is noted.

> In meetings with or without technology, the facilitator’s functions remain the same: to focus energy and attention and to support the group in collaboratively attaining its goals. Central to this is maintaining the first two standards of effective meetings which are to manage one process at a time and one topic at a time which are described later in this chapter.

> Technology can be both a boon and a bane. Digital devices offer access to information and tools that help groups focus on their work by increasing productivity and efficiency. Unfortunately, in too many cases, such devices are the great distracter, removing group members from the task at hand and from their working relationships with the colleagues who are in the room. To mitigate this latter effect some groups develop working agreements to name appropriate ways to respond to text and voice messages and clarify when and under what conditions this might be appropriate. Mindful teams also name the elephant in the room of people bringing personal work to the meeting. Peeking at laptops and scrolling through screens on tablets and smart phones has become the modern version of members distracted by correcting student assignments and grading homework during team meetings. Ultimately, if the group and its work are valued and intended to produce value, then full presence with colleagues is the price of admission.
>
> Increasingly, working groups need access to information held on school, district, and state or provincial Web sites. It is more productive to have participants share laptops or tablets to encourage collaboration with text and graphic information rather than work on their own devices. When simultaneous attention matters it is even better to set up a second projector with attached laptop to create a group focus for exploring such data. The screen for such a set-up should be located off to the side, establishing the “Third Point” pattern described in appendix A. This set-up leaves the main projector and screen available for the facilitator to project process directions that guide the group’s work.

work sessions. These shared objects encourage both synchronous and asynchronous collaboration by keeping the group’s work products visible to all.

For larger groups, a second screen is sometimes useful for creating a shared space by connecting to Web sites such as TodaysMeet.com. Group leaders can post prompts for small groups to consider and then have table groups huddle to craft their responses before posting them to the site. This pattern gives participants voice and provides a sense of the room to all involved. This then becomes a structured form of the collective pause, protecting time for thinking and reflection. The day’s work can then be archived and accessed later by interested participants.

New tools are undoubtedly being developed as we write these words. An interesting example of a recent find is the Post-it Plus App which allows users to snap a picture with a tablet or smart phone of a set of sticky notes and then rearrange the notes on the screen. Users can export the screen images to other screens and archive them at sites like Dropbox, Evernote, and OneDrive. The point here is not to become enamored with a specific tool, but to focus on the meeting, the tasks, the collaborative energy of the group and the group’s development as a group by tapping resources that serve these purposes.

**Developing Meeting Standards**

Standards are agreements for ways of working together. Although each group is responsible for deciding what standards will guide its work, we advocate starting with the following simple set of standards, because whenever we have seen these standards in place, we have witnessed successful meetings: (a) maximum product, (b) minimum time, and (c) maximum member satisfaction. In addition, when effective groups implement these standards, their levels of efficiency, efficacy, craftsmanship, and satisfaction soar. When ineffective groups adopt them, their productivity improves.

Doyle and Straus (1993) initially discovered these standards for themselves in the form of success principles from attending and analyzing hundreds of meetings.

They noted that certain elements are common in all successful groups. A board of directors, a governmental task force, a student council, a citizens’ committee, an administrative staff, [and] a radical political group may have different values and objectives, but they all face similar problems when they hold a meeting.

We have updated the principles to reflect current research. Our list of standards for this meeting structure is as follows:

1. Groups should address only one topic at a time.
2. Groups should use only one process at a time.
3. Meetings should be interactive and engage balanced participation.
4. Decision-making meetings should encourage cognitive conflict.
5. All parties should understand and agree on meeting roles.

**Addressing One Topic at a Time**

There is a limit to what any individual can attend to in the moment. Groups are limited as well. If more than one topic is being discussed at a time, a group will lack focus, and confusion will reign. We often hear group members ask, “Which topic are we on right now?” Doyle and Straus (1993) named this a fundamental meeting process, a multiheaded animal, “the tendency to go off in all directions simultaneously” (p. 20).

Multiple-topic discussions start because many issues are linked with others or because one idea stimulates an associated idea in another person. For example, a subcommittee is meeting to recommend new textbooks for adoption. One member says, “You know, I’m

I was in there the other day; it’s still a mess!” Another group member says, “Has anyone seen my microscope? I’ve been looking for it. It was in the supply room the last time I was there.”

Let’s put it here so we don’t lose it. We’ll come back to it later.” See appendix A for this procedure.

> Group processes are vehicles to collectively apply cognitive processes to common tasks. To generate ideas, to clarify, to analyze, and to evaluate require different mental operations. In order to use one process at a time, all group members must know what the process is, how it works, and why it is being used. Appendix A describes many meeting strategies, including some alternatives and tips for each one. These can be of great help to meeting planners and facilitators. Doyle and Straus (1993) observe that facilitators who “go slow in order to go fast” can save meeting time by frontloading detailed instructions before they proceed.

**Main Text (Top Left):**
- The text discusses generating ideas to reduce traffic congestion. It describes an experiment where groups were instructed to brainstorm, debate, or received no process instruction. The debating teams generated nearly 20% more ideas than the brainstorming group, while the group with no process did the worst. Debate encouraged greater engagement and reassessment of ideas. The text emphasizes the need for a collaborative mindset, constructive criticism, and clarity of process for success. Lehrer (2012) is cited, noting brainstorming groups produce fewer ideas than groups working independently before sharing.

**Section:**
- "Here are some classic and alternative strategies for generating ideas."

**Boxed Section:**
- **Title:** "Brainstorm To Foster Quantity of Ideas"
- **Bullet Points:**
  - Call out ideas. No judgment, criticism or questions allowed.
  - One (or two) members record ideas on public charts as they are heard.
  - Quantity is more important than quality during this phase of group work.
  - Encourage out-of-the-box ideas.
  - Build on ideas on the list when you can.
  - Sequence of Events
  - Describe the guidelines. Check for understanding. (PAG/PAU)
  - State the topic “What’s the best focus for our time this year?”
  - Prime the pump. (Pairs generate initial ideas)

**Boxed Section (Top Right):**
- **Bullet Points:**
  - Invite members to call out ideas.
  - Assign numbrs to the first few raised hands (*Airplane stacking*—See Appendix A).
  - Repeat *airplane stacking* after the first group have stated their ideas.
  - Facilitator repeats key words until recorder(s) have charted the idea.

**Main Text (Bottom Right):**
- Discusses the importance of balanced participation in meetings. It notes that meetings are more productive when everyone is engaged, not just one person talking. The text emphasizes the value of having all minds engaged for effective group work and ownership.

**Facilitator Moves Examples:**
- “Take a moment and jot down your ideas on this before we begin sharing.”
- “Turn to your neighbor and generate a few more ideas. You’ve got thirty seconds.”

**Main Text:**
in detail in appendix A). In “Assumptions Wall,” groups bring up and and examine their assumptions. This requires recordable wall space for subgroups. “In and Out of the Frame” provides groups with opportunities to get outside their own perspectives to approach a topic. In “Corners,” members vote with their feet, moving to a place in the room that represents their position.

Too often we have heard the statement that the purpose of participation in meetings is for “buy-in.” We discourage the use of this phrase because it carries with it suppositions of manipulation and inferences that the leader has something to sell and the group has an opportunity to buy it. We find, instead, that the purpose of participation is to develop ownership. When ideas are owned, when values are articulated and owned, when beliefs are admitted, when plans and programs and strategies are posed by the group, commitment is high and the likelihood of successful implementation is great. As we shall see in the next principle, ownership does not occur without disagreements.

Balanced participation does not mean that every member must speak for an equal amount of time; it means that the door is open for member participation. There are two forms in which group members speak: to the entire group and to a partner or a small group nearby. Facilitate participation by asking individuals to share with a partner before speaking or to get together with a group of four and identify major criteria to be brought before the group. Partner talk is the safest form of member participation. Moves like these richly engage everyone in thinking processes. They also offer a cloak of anonymity when voices do not wish to be identified.

**Section Title:**
*Engage Cognitive Conflict*

Meetings must be safe, but not necessarily comfortable. When a group’s meetings are always comfortable, the group is probably not talking about the right things. Cognitive conflict—disagreements among group members about substantive issues like goals, values, and assumptions—tends to improve team effectiveness, lead to better decisions, and increase commitment, cohesiveness, empathy, and understanding. Cognitive conflict occurs as teams examine, compare, and reconcile these differences.

The problem with encouraging cognitive conflict is that once it is aroused, it can be difficult to control. If cognitive conflict slides into affective conflict, then hostility, avoidance, cynicism, or apathy can result. Affective conflict focuses anger on individuals rather than ideas, and disagreement becomes personalized. It can occur when group members lack the skills to disagree gracefully. The greatest insurance against affective conflict is group-member skills and practice of the seven norms of collaboration (see chapter 4).

Conflict about ideas improves decision quality but can also weaken the group’s ability to work together. Resolving this tension is especially important when consensus is valued and follow-through is required. Teams that encourage cognitive conflict without affective conflict are characterized by focused activity, creativity, open communication, and integration. They work close to the core of issues and are not distracted by trivial points. They en-

The image is a page from a book or document titled "Well-Run Meetings Enhance Social Capital," specifically Chapter 6. At the top of the page, there is a boxed figure labeled "Figure 6.6. Outcomes of Conflict." The figure is divided into two columns comparing "Cognitive Conflict" and "Affective Conflict."

**The content of the figure is as follows:**

---

**Cognitive Conflict**
Disagreements about substantive differences of opinion improve team effectiveness and produce
- Better decisions
- Increased commitment
- Increased cohesiveness
- Increased empathy
- Increased understanding

**Affective Conflict**
Disagreements over personalized, individually oriented matters reduce team effectiveness and produce
- Destructive conflict
- Poorer decisions
- Decreased commitment
- Decreased cohesiveness
- Decreased empathy

Below the figure, the text discusses the value of conflict in teams, emphasizing that cognitive conflict can be beneficial for team effectiveness, while affective conflict is detrimental. It explains that productive conflict encourages open communication and the full use of all members' abilities. The text also notes the importance of understanding meeting roles for effective teamwork, using a baseball analogy to illustrate the importance of knowing responsibilities.

The section titled **"Understand and Agree on Meeting Roles"** explains that teams work best when members know each other's responsibilities, similar to how baseball players anticipate each other's actions.

The text then introduces four typical meeting roles: (a) engaged participant, (b) facilitator, (c) recorder, and (d) role or knowledge authority. The section "Engaged Participant" describes the importance of this role, noting that anyone can be an engaged participant and that their contributions are essential for group effectiveness. Engaged participants monitor adherence to meeting standards and use the seven norms of collaboration.

**clarify decision-making processes and levels of authority, and perform gatekeeping functions for others. When members are clear they have a role in communicating the meeting’s content to others, they are more likely to insist on their own clarity (Heifetz, Linsky, and Grashow, 2009).**

**Gatekeeping.** Malita might say to Sid, “Sid, I’m aware that you haven’t talked for a little while. Is there anything that you would like to add?” Notice in this interchange that Sid is not on the spot to respond. The gate, however, has been opened. Similarly, Leonardo might say to Aron, “Aron, I know you served on a committee like this last year. Do you have anything that you’d like to say?” Alejandra says to Ken, “Ken, from where I’m sitting, your eyebrows look furrowed. What are some comments might you like to add?”

**Setting and testing working agreements.** Engaged participants set and test working agreements. For example, Jose sets a working agreement by saying to the group, “I’m requesting that we make an agreement to start our meetings on time. I notice that some of us are here on time and others are not. Frequently, I have to wait fifteen minutes before the meeting starts.” Discussion ensues. The group decides to begin meetings on time. Several weeks later, Anahd tests the agreement by saying, “I’d like to talk about the decision that we made several meetings ago to start meetings on time. I notice that this is not happening. What do we need to do to keep our agreement?”

**Testing consensus.** Engaged participants informally test consensus by summary paraphrasing. Sometimes they say, “It seems that we may have agreement on this. Is that true?” or “Could we see a show of thumbs? Thumbs up if you are in agreement, thumbs down if not, thumbs sideways if you’re not sure or it’s not important to you.”

**Monitoring internal processes.** Engaged participants monitor their own internal processes and listen to their own listening. They become aware of when they have stopped listening to others and are following a train of thought in their own minds. They recognize their emotional responses to other speakers. When they are irritated, they notice it, but instead of giving in to the irritation, they locate the probable reason. Then they set the feeling aside so they can stay fully engaged in the conversation. When they are listening to understand, yet find themselves offering counter-arguments in their own minds, they notice this and suspend the unproductive mental activity.

Finally, engaged participants are conscious of the assumptions they bring to a conversation and notice how these influence their listening, thinking, and speaking.

**Facilitator**

As you will see in chapter 8, the facilitator role requires a sophisticated set of skills. A facilitator is a third party to a conversation and is responsible for process. As a director of process, the facilitator knows what kind of structures and strategies will be useful in helping the group do its work. When the facilitator asks the group to use certain procedures or intervenes with counterproductive behavior, it is on the basis of this process knowledge. A facilitator must be a person who is acceptable to all members of the group, who is substantively neutral, and who has no decision-making authority about the topic.

Although a facilitator displays no preference for any of the solutions the group considers, no facilitator is truly neutral. To be “substantively neutral” (Schwartz, 2002) means that facilitators give no verbal or nonverbal cues of their personal reactions to the ideas being discussed. Because the facilitator is serving the group, not certain members, this display of neutrality is important.

Facilitators often start by clarifying their own role with the group:

*My job is to help you have a conversation about these topics in such a way that you understand one another’s views and the reasoning that leads people to those views. In this way you have the information with which to make informed decisions. I will not share*

On average humans can manage three to four items of information in their working memories (Moskowitz, 2008). Public recording keeps key data in front of a group.

Their function is to support the group by maintaining a clear visual representation of important ideas and data and to support the facilitator in managing processes as effectively and efficiently as possible.

THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL

of their positional authority and control over school resources, principals are in a strategic position to promote or inhibit the development of a teacher learning community in their school” (McLaughlin and Talbert, 2006).

Many people lead meetings. Leadership roles in meetings are called by many names: chairperson, convener, facilitator, leader, consultant, specialist, manager, and others. Because we see a critical leadership role in meetings that does not include running the meeting, we have been searching for a term that might be neutral, or at least unlike the other names we have for meeting leadership.

The most descriptive term we’ve found so far is role authority or knowledge authority. The role authority might be the principal in a staff meeting, the vice principal if the principal is not there, the superintendent in a district office meeting, or the assistant superintendent if the superintendent is not there. The knowledge authority might be the literacy coach, at a task force dealing with the reading program; the science consultant, in a committee addressing a science curriculum; or an external consultant charged with making recommendations to the group on improving organizational effectiveness.

When the role or knowledge authority is in a meeting without a facilitator, this person typically manages the group processes. He or she sets the agenda, decides when to move to the next topic, recognizes those who want to speak, writes meeting notes to assist remembering, and summarizes actions to be taken. In managing all these procedural tasks, the role or knowledge authority limits, or at least diffuses, the attention given to meeting content and also limits group access to the special information resources that are part of this person’s particular role or knowledge expertise.

Without a facilitator, the value of the role or knowledge authority’s information is limited. First, because this leader has to balance attention between process and content, there is less time for interaction with the content. Second, it is extremely rare that a leader can maintain the neutrality required of the facilitation process give content information to the group, and be perceived as neutral. For this reason, leaders become more influential and the group matures and makes better decisions when a person other than the role or knowledge authority facilitates the meeting.

When leaders such as department heads or principals use the services of a meeting facilitator, they will often set meeting schedules, coordinate topics with faculty and others, arrange to have department members rotate through the facilitator and recorder roles, and codevelop the agenda design with the meeting facilitator. The role authority will also follow through to see that subcommittee tasks are clear, that resources are available, and that evaluation of processes and products is provided.

In many ways, the role or knowledge authority functions like any engaged participant in the meeting, but he or she is also available to inform the group about constraints, resources, and values related to the topic. Like other group members, the role or knowledge authority can advocate one’s own ideas as well as inquire about the ideas of others. Remember that until groups have attained a high state of interdependence, actions in this role will speak louder than words.

Can the facilitator or recorder ever speak?
Under certain conditions. Periodically the person facilitating or recording may have important information for the group or may be asked for an opinion. In such cases, signal role change by asking if it is okay to change hats, ask a participant to take over the facilitation or recording role and sit as a member of the group until you have completed your input. Since people are influenced more by what they see than what is said, the physical shift is essential. This is especially useful for team leaders and department heads who often need to wear two hats—facilitator and leader. In some settings, content specialists will often facilitate meetings in content areas other than their own and a special education consultant might periodically facilitate the superintendent’s cabinet. For principals, turning the meeting over requires

developing a collaborative mindset with the faculty and gradually grooming individuals to take over the facilitation role.

In one Arizona district that was influenced by the concepts and tools presented here, the superintendent working with her leadership team redesigned their monthly meeting to break the pattern of each major department head presenting to the whole group in serial fashion. As you can imagine, this common way of organizing a “meeting” did not energize high levels of participation among the group members in attendance that were reluctant to raise points of confusion or offer alternative viewpoints in front of their peers and supervisors.

In the revised scheme, major players, including the superintendent and the various associates and department leaders arranged themselves around the periphery of the room with chairs for participants to join them. Then, for a set amount of time each district leader presented essential information to their small group and engaged each group in dialogue and discussion about that month’s priorities. After a set amount of time, the small groups rotated to the next presentation. This format motivated district leaders to develop clear outcomes for the overall meeting and for their specific segments. They also reported much higher levels of engagement and a greater willingness on the part of participants to raise issues and concerns.

**Using the Three Success Structures**

Every working group needs a declarative knowledge of the three success structures. This means that members can describe the structures, their parts, and the principles on which they are based. As groups learn from their experiences, procedural knowledge will develop, and members will become skillful at exercising, monitoring, and self-correcting both themselves as individuals and the group. One way to increase both consciousness about and skill in applying the three success structures is to use the meeting assessment inventory found in appendix I. Regular use of this inventory and reflective dialogue with group members about the results focuses attention on skill gains and sticking points for that group.

Mature groups eventually acquire a degree of conditional knowledge, allowing them to recognize when to break the rules and achieve their purpose even more effectively. Such powerful and cumulative knowledge can be, and is, developed with faculties, committees, task forces, cabinets, advisory boards, and other groups. It does not have to be lost because of changing membership or environmental crises. We have facilitated a statewide group responsible for deciding how millions of dollars will be used each year to support technology. This group met for a full-day meeting three times a year. Because members were appointed as representatives from regions, membership constantly changed. Yet after a year-and-a-half of facilitated meetings, the consensus of the group was that “we have become our values and operating principles.” Effective groups develop a commitment to practice and monitor their use of the three structures.

In any session in which planning, reflecting, or problem solving occurs, the engaged participants—that is, the group members—are the ones who do the work of the meeting. In fact, the meeting’s success is more dependent on their informed participation than on the skills and knowledge of a boss, a content expert, or a facilitator. This is especially so in small work teams. In large groups a facilitator is required to orchestrate and direct the contributions of group members. Group members should be able to distinguish between data and inference; distinguish relevant from irrelevant information, claims, or reasons; identify unstated assumptions; and interpret data.

member satisfaction. The ultimate goal is that meetings serve as vehicles to protect and support the primary mission of the school, which is student learning. At schools and in special district committees—McLaughlin and Talbert (2006) say this as well—the goal is to study data on teaching and learning, and then agree to the next steps for changing instruction and for examining the effects of change on student learning.

Meetings are becoming as important a part of teachers’ work as lesson design. For this reason, knowing how to produce work through meetings has become an essential part of a professional portfolio, regardless of one’s role.

In the next chapter, we explore in detail the principles of facilitation, facilitator functions, and facilitation tools.

**Postscript**

While this book was still in development, Google released the results of a multi-year study of 180 Google teams. The results confirm and extend ideas in this book and chapter. Google’s approach to the development of teams and team leadership applies findings from MIT’s Human Dynamics Laboratory.

Psychology safety, more than anything else, produces effective group work. Psychological safety, they found, was based on group norms in which individuals set aside their personal proclivities during group work and honor team norms. Two essential attributes: equity of turn-taking and social sensitivity, create a climate of interpersonal trust and mutual respect that foster task success. There was nothing in the research supporting the idea that a certain mix of personalities, skills or backgrounds contributes to higher performing teams. (Duhigg 2016).

We propose that the seven norms of collaboration (chapter 4), two ways of talking (Chapter 5) and three success structures (chapter 6) forge a resilient foundation for psychological safety.

**Chapter 7  Time-Efficient Meetings**

Meetings that are well-planned and executed—and the planning is prerequisite to the execution—promote one of the most valuable energy sources for groups, and the one most consistently related to school success: efficacy.

Agenda construction is, first of all, a way of thinking. There is simply no other activity that can economize time and maximize success and satisfaction as much as a well-formed agenda. The problem, of course, is that it requires time to develop one.

“Prepare more and meet less” is a motto for successful groups and effective leaders. By making a personal investment in agenda design, leaders reduce wasted time by tenfold and overall meeting time by as much as 30 percent. This in turn produces dramatic increases in productivity and group-member satisfaction.

When leaders value agenda design, department meetings become better run, ad hoc committees function more smoothly, and task forces and advisory groups feel better about their work and get more done. Being smart and proactive about meeting design pays off throughout the school and the district.

Smart leaders and facilitators value meeting planning in the same way that high-performing teachers value planning for instruction, because it influences the success of what follows.

Groups meet for many reasons in schools. Each meeting provides opportunities to both manage the work of the group and the school and to increase the group’s capacity to do richer and deeper work. Once again, both things and energy matter. Smart agendas help groups that meet for planning and problem solving get better at planning and problem solving. This happens when the meeting design provides both task focus and opportunities to reflect on the process and personal and collective learning in these arenas. Smart agendas help groups that meet to explore and refine teaching strategies also learn how to learn as colleagues and professionals. Smart agendas help groups that meet to support the learning needs of individual students also learn ways to collaboratively learn from and with data and from and with one another.

**How to Use This Chapter**

We will describe the remarkable benefits of meeting design in complex nonlinear systems, such as schools. Although protecting time to design meetings produces some tensions, and time-pressed leaders occasionally have to work extemporaneously, the majority of meetings, planned well, will produce benefits by the hundredfold. This chapter elaborates on ways to achieve these benefits. You will find principles of agenda construction, samples of agendas, and a template for delegating tasks to groups. Finally, we offer some general design and planning tips.

The sequence in which you will want this information depends on your prior information, personal history, present needs, and urgency. If you have an immediate need for agenda samples, move ahead to the section “Agenda Templates” or to the list of tips within it. If you want a rationale with which to persuade others to invest in design work, go to the section

**Design Matters**

Consider the time you spend in meetings. At a modest two hours per week, you are spending more than three thousand hours in meetings throughout the life of your career. If you translate that to a team of twelve, then 4,500 eight-hour days are being spent in meetings. That’s more than twelve years! All professions and industries tend to malign meetings as time wasters. This doesn’t have to be so.

Poorly organized meetings incur abysmal costs. Morale suffers, venting and other counterproductive exchanges move to the building’s parking lot, and members grow less and less willing to invest their time in projects, committees, and teams. Frustration reigns in department meetings and ad hoc groups and insinuates its presence into school activities, including teaching. Many of us have experienced this and yet know that it does not have to be so. In many settings, meetings are well-organized; what emerges there are well-run meetings, optimism, efficacy, successful results, and an increasing willingness to participate in collaborative work.

What’s talked about matters. One district collected and analyzed agendas from faculty meetings, school leadership teams, department meetings, and grade-level groups. From 60 percent to 80 percent of the meetings were devoted to “administrivia”—scheduling, announcements, event organization, discipline, compliance issues, or disputes—leaving only a small percentage of time for the discussion of teaching and learning. In other districts announcements and other “administrivia” are handled through other forms of communication. The only reason an announcement or event details should appear on an agenda is if members need conversation in order to understand and uniformly apply it.

Agendas, too reveal the dynamical systems principle that both things and energy matter. When meeting topics are matters of substance and the conversations are well-organized, the intangible products of meetings translate to mindsets and behaviors. These must not be underestimated, for when the intangibles are positive, they provide the energy for productive work. Well-planned and executed meetings promote collective efficacy, found to be a foundation for success even in low socioeconomic schools (Hoy et al., 2006).

**Principles of Design**

Because principles are generalizations, not rules, they offer elasticity, which rules do not. We will explore five agenda-design principles: (a) allocentrism, planning with the group in mind; (b) relevance, connecting to the members and unit goals; (c) information, ensuring that groups have the information they need to do their task; (d) interaction, keeping minds and voices active; and (e) congruence with organizational values and beliefs.

---

**Allocentrism**

Design with the users in mind. Put yourself in their place. Imagine how you will feel entering the meeting. Are there special needs that require attention? Will the group be tired or distracted? Are the participants informed about the purpose of the session? What knowledge do they bring to the table that does not have to be repeated? What would they need to know to encourage participation? What skills might have to be introduced or reinforced for them to do good work on the issues that will be addressed? Are there issues of mood that might run counter to receptivity? What seating is going to be comfortable, psychologically and physically? When attitude or low energy is an issue, design an opening that alters this. Consider using banned words, acknowledge re-

**CHAPTER 7**

sistance or check-in or other inclusion activities found in appendix A to shift mood.

We once conducted a meeting in a kindergarten room that was not going well. Finally, we realized the discomfort that people were feeling sitting in those itty-bitty chairs, so we corrected the seating and the quality of the meeting improved. A simple matter of furniture placement can make an enormous difference in meeting success. We described practical models for room design and materials in chapter 6.

**Relevance**

The principle of relevance concerns membership, the internal fit of the agenda items, and the degree to which the agenda has some bearing on the larger contexts and goals within which the group works.

When an item is relevant to only part of the group, schedule it last and dismiss those who are not involved. Nothing is more frustrating and disrespectful of time than to make someone sit through agenda items that are irrelevant to them. Selective dismissals honor the group members and become part of a norm of appreciating their energies and time.

To what degree do the agenda items relate to one another? Cluster those that relate. Organize others using transitions activities that are described in chapter 8. Finally, and perhaps most important, what bearing does this meeting have on the larger contexts of the group’s existence and work? Cognizance of this allows an opening in which the meeting is perceptually framed to help the participants make sense of the work. Groups often need a sense of their history to understand and embrace the work of a particular meeting.

**Information**

Three questions guide agenda construction related to information. The first of these is deciding what information is needed for the group to do its work. As mentioned above, sometimes this information is history and context so that the group members can start from the same place together. Groups might occasionally need policy information or research summaries on a topic in order to do informed work; the agenda planner can then provide for a paired reading activity from an appropriate journal. Second, it is often important to know which players outside the group, or which other groups, have say on the topic so that consciousness can be brought to the question of defining the “sandbox,” one of the four structures for successful meetings described in chapter 6.

Third, and most important, groups need to know who they are in the decision-making process. Are they to inform, recommend, or decide? Third, if they are to inform or recommend, to whom are they relaying information and what are the next steps in the process? Display this information directly on the agenda next to the items.

**Interaction**

Assuming that the purpose of a meeting is for members to think, deliberate, or take action, interaction is essential. Any group that spends the majority of its time in full-group mode is keeping its brain activity suppressed, encouraging lethargy, and reducing meeting achievement and the value for participants. Two essential questions must be addressed to plan for the degrees and types of interaction. What tasks will be asked of the group: comprehending, exploring, informing, recommending, or deciding? What cognitive activities will be required: generating, categorizing, analyzing, synthesizing, or extrapolating?

The thoughtful use of “conversation containers” fosters success. These essentially provide scaffolds for the talk. Skillful designers consider ways to start, structure, and sustain thinking in their meetings.

Just because people are sitting together does not mean that they are a group capable of working together. Recognize that groups do not arrive primed for work; they need to transition physically, socially, cognitively, and emotion-

ally into the work space and topic. Wellman and Lipton (2004) refer to strategies that perform this function as *conversation starters*.

Well-chosen activators are psychologically safe conversation starters that are pertinent to the task. Safety is important; it allows the risk of stating ideas when you are not sure, disclosing that you do not know, disagreeing, or being able to talk and not be overridden by highly verbal participants. Overcoming this risk is at the heart of effective meeting participation. What happens early in a meeting sets the tone for the session. By encouraging full participation at the outset, participants then expect to contribute throughout the session. When group leaders talk at the group in the opening minutes, participants become passive consumers of information with varying degrees of engagement. See inclusion activities in appendix A for ideas.

Protocols (both starters and structures) can be designed to minimize risk and maximize critical thinking. Avoid, at all costs, opening with “feel good” activities in which participants see no connection to their work.

Although safety is necessary to access the neocortex and the members’ best thinking, comfort is not a requirement in meetings. In fact, if a group is always comfortable, it is probably talking about the wrong things.

*Structures*

Structures are strategies, or protocols, that shape and organize conversations, again providing psychological safety and maximizing time efficiency. Almost any strategy can be designed as a protocol that sets rules or instructions for a conversation. Many are listed in chapter 8, related to facilitator tasks during different meeting stages; others can be found in appendix A.

We are using the terms *strategy* and *protocol* somewhat interchangeably. In diplomacy a protocol governs who greets whom first; in technology it governs the rules for two pieces of equipment to talk together. A meeting protocol provides a “container” for conversations that defines what is to happen and how it will occur. In meetings, protocols have the following three functions:

1. Establish topics, time for the activity, who speaks, and the sequence of the speakers, if any.
2. Provide challenge and limit discomfort.
3. Designate the thinking skills to be used.

Without a structure, conversations can meander, go off course, and take valuable time away from the meeting objectives. The thoughtful selection of strategies supports the efficient use of time by defining the total amount of time for a conversation and the time for each component. Protocols can also determine the type of thinking that is required, such as separating data from inference, analyzing, evaluating, or developing theories.

Some examples of structures are the paired-reading activities of “Say Something,” or the strategies “Key Concepts/Key Ideas,” “Assumptions Wall,” and “Card Stack and Shuffle” (appendix A). Brainstorming is a structure because it specifies the thought processes to use and the order in which to use them, and because the facilitator is calling on people, determining who speaks when. It is our view that the steps in the brainstorming protocols always have to be reviewed and that facilitators should intervene immediately when violations or mutations occur.

*Sustainers*

Sustainers are strategies and tools that are used to maintain longer, focused conversations. How people talk to one another will either sustain or dampen communication. Sustainers are verbal and nonverbal tools used by group members to enhance their ability to deliver psychologically safe thoughts to one another even when they disagree. The seven norms of collaboration described in chapter 4 serve as the starting point for this set of skills. Learning the tools for inquiry described in chapter 4 represents an ongoing curriculum for many groups. Group size is an important sustainer.

The image is a page from a book, specifically page 93, from Chapter 7 titled "Time-Efficient Meetings." The content on the page discusses strategies for effective group work and meetings, focusing on group size, structure, and the importance of aligning meeting strategies with organizational values.

Here is a detailed transcription of the text:

---

**Paired activities require the least amount of time, compared to trios, quartets, or sextets. Pairs are psychologically safer units than larger groups are. Trios bring the valuable tension of three sets of experiences. It is also harder in a trio than in a pair to leave the task and enter social talk. Quartets are diverse yet small enough to be in the early stages of learning as they apply new communication skills. Quartets are an ideal size to dialogue about data posted before them on the wall. Groups of six are a good size for protocols like “First Turn/Last Turn” or “Grounding” (see appendix A) and for activities that synthesize findings.**

**Individual reflection is the safest size unit of all. Many strategies begin with private reflection, either mentally or in writing, giving members a chance to gather their thoughts before participating in a group.**

*Offer the What, Why, and How of Strategies and Structures*

A wise facilitation practice is to offer the what, why, and how of any strategy and structure you are about to use with a group. Offering the “Why” is especially important when applying new meeting tools that break pattern for the group. For example, using pairs and trios instead of operating as a committee of the whole may be disconcerting for some group members. In this case the facilitator might say: “We’re going to use a paired reading strategy so that you can engage with the text and with a partner to clarify your understanding and gain the perspective of another set of eyes.” The “Why” is a statement of purpose and intention. The why speaks to both the intention of a particular strategy or structure and to the deeper group development outcomes for that group.

Keep in mind that these are principles, not rules, and that the strategies named here are not limited to the group size suggested. Sue Presler, a colleague and friend, while working with a full faculty in Hawaii, once took a step from the “Focusing Four” (see appendix A) and used it with the full group to have them advocate lunchroom solutions that had been generated the week before. We never would have considered doing that, yet after just a few people talked, it became clear to the group which solution would serve best.

Degree of structure is another sustainer. The planners decide when to select a tight or a loose protocol as a matter of scaffolding for success. A tight protocol is one in which members have little choice about when and how to participate and have maximum scaffolding for success. Examples are “First Turn/Last Turn,” “In and Out of the Frame,” and “Futures Wheel.” Designers will plan for tight protocols when the topic is complex or emotionally loaded or when the group does not have much experience working together effectively.

Loose protocols provide less scaffolding and leave more decisions in the hands of members. Examples are “Paired Verbal Fluency,” “Around the Room and Back Again,” and “Most Important Point.”

Group maturity, another sustainer, refers to the collective effectiveness of a group as it works together. A long-standing group can be immature; a recently formed group might be mature. The more immature a group is, the more need there is for tight structures and for carefully describing the reasons for and the structures of the strategies. Mature groups can work with either tight or loose protocols and, in fact, will sometimes ask for a tight protocol because they recognize that the topic is hard to talk about.

**Congruence**

Congruence with organizational values and beliefs is the fifth principle of agenda design. What happens in meetings is a manifestation of the degree to which the group is a learning community and will be a force for or a force against developing collective efficacy. Thoughtful design can help unify faculty perspectives and experience. Many schools experience too much fragmentation. Good meeting design can express and reinforce deeper organizational values and beliefs about learning and

are opportunities to model effective learning designs. Well-planned meetings link the project to the initiative, the immediate to the important, the short range to the long, and the greater community to its subsets.

**Drafting a Design**

[Illustration of a calendar/agenda with rows labeled A, B, C]

We now move from design principles to the hands-on activities of drafting an agenda you will use. We will explore whether a meeting is even necessary. If the answer is yes, what type of meeting will it be? To help answer this question, we present a planning template and samples of agendas that serve different purposes.

**Is a Meeting Necessary?**

Your first consideration is whether a meeting is even necessary. Ask yourself what you want to accomplish and if meeting together is the best possible use of your group’s time on this topic. Are there alternatives, such as surveys, memos, focus-group interviews, or phone or video conferencing that might serve just as well?

If you decide that a meeting is appropriate, examine the potential agenda topics. Does each item on the agenda concern at least three members of the group? If not, deal with it one-to-one. Is it clear what type of action the group is to take on the item? If not, clarify it. Can it be dealt with either initially or fully at a lower level? If so, reroute it to the appropriate group or subcommittee. Has the item for discussion been thoroughly prepared—researched, documented, and defined? If not, hold it over until the preparation is complete.

Once you’ve decided that a meeting is the best alternative and have screened the agenda items to determine which ones must be addressed, consider who should be there. Do the agenda items pertain to the entire staff or just some of them? As mentioned earlier, if some are for all but others pertain to just a couple of departments, schedule two adjournment times, releasing those who are not involved before starting on the final items. Are the items under consideration important or urgent enough to be on the next agenda? If not, reschedule them for a later meeting.

Always reserve the last five to ten minutes of discussion or dialogue meetings for the members to reflect on the meeting process. Developing other processes is one of the highest callings of leadership. Using a meeting assessment inventory reinforces paying attention to the success structures and meeting standards described in chapter 6 and helps groups to grow more skillful with each meeting.

Use the rule of one half: List the agenda topics, then cut the list by half. One reason meetings can be a source of dissatisfaction is that they attempt to cover too much. Slow down. Allow the time that the topics and the members deserve.

**What Type of Meeting Will It Be?**

The type of meeting will influence the type of outcomes that can be reached. Four meeting types common to working groups are musters, assemblies, discussions, and dialogues. Chapter 5 presented the purposes of dialogue (to understand) and discussion (to decide) as well as the structures for these meeting functions. Grade-level teams, department meetings, curriculum-council leadership groups, and full-

### Detailed Description:

#### Main Text Content:
- The text discusses different types of meetings, such as assemblies and musters, explaining their purposes and formats. Assemblies are described as routine meetings of large groups, often limited to receiving and clarifying information or making decisions on proposals. Musters are regular meetings for departments or special units, focusing on communication, announcements, and coordination.
- The section "Clear Outcomes" emphasizes the importance of having clear, behaviorally observable outcomes for each agenda item in a meeting. It notes that well-formed outcomes describe a product, not a process.

#### Section Headings:
- **Clear Outcomes**
- **Agenda Templates**

#### Boxed Section (Right Side):
There is a boxed section titled:

**A Pocket Guide to Agenda Design**
- What must happen at the opening of the meeting to provide an inclusion experience, define goals and roles, and adopt an agenda?
- What terms should be defined?
- What questions must the group address, and in what sequence, to achieve its desired outcome?
- How much time will be assigned to meeting topics?
- What processes and language will be used to maintain group-member efficacy, flexibility, craftsmanship, consciousness, and interdependence?
- What closing activities will ensure clarity on group decisions, and who is to do what by when as the next steps?
- What follow-up will be required?
- What will be communicated to others about this meeting, and how will it be communicated?

#### Additional Notes:
- The text at the bottom of the page discusses the complexity of having clear outcomes and suggests that high-functioning groups should consider their development as a group, not just the goals of the meeting.

conducted in such a way that the group gets better at being a group.

Finally, regardless of your role within a meeting, or even the nature of the meeting, what, specifically, are your desired outcomes? As a group member, do you desire greater clarity about an issue, or is it your intent to influence the group on an item? If the latter, how will you know you’ve succeeded, and what might some strategies be? Mentor teachers often report to us with surprise that being clear about their outcomes has transformed one-to-one meetings with the teachers they are supporting.

In our own practice we often begin a consultation conversation with the following questions: “What do you want as a result of this meeting? How will you know if we have achieved that? What topics should be discussed for that goal? How much time should we allot, and in what sequence should we discuss them?” Helping the other party to think in outcome terms, whether the meeting is a parent conference or the start of a thirty-minute session with two other colleagues helps to focus time and strategies to get results.

The more one practices, the easier agenda construction becomes. Here are some final planning tips:

- **Engage design help.** In fact, part of developing your group is to increase group consciousness and skill in this area.
- **Post outcomes in the meeting rooms.** This forces you to construct clear language and observable goals and aids all members in knowing the reason for this meeting and how to best focus their energy. In addition, should group members get off topic, it allows the facilitator to gesture toward the posted outcomes and ask, “Please help us to understand how your comments relate to this outcome.” Sometimes they will tell us; sometimes they will monitor their own contribution, saying, “I’ll save it for later.”
- **Determine how much content and how much process will be required to achieve outcomes related to the agenda items.** How much discussion, exploration, or dialogue might be necessary? How much information will be required? Remember that when goals are related to attitude and behavior change, more process time is required, not less.
- **Estimate the time that each agenda item will take.** Remember that if processes are involved, it takes time to explain them and to check for understanding.
- **Place divisive items early on an agenda to minimize the possibility of members leaving at the end of the meeting in a funk.**
- **If the meeting purpose is singular and brief, remove the furniture.** This signals a stand-up meeting—quick, focused, and everyone out in fifteen minutes.
- **When you are a meeting leader, keep the first hour after the meeting to write minutes and memos and do the necessary follow-up.** Sending out a written follow-up to a meeting within twenty-four or forty-eight hours signals that you value people’s time.
- **Consider what commitment will be made in the meeting to group development.** What time, processes, and areas of group development will be addressed? At times, one of the seven norms of collaboration (see chapter 4) will emerge as important to strengthen; at other times, raising consciousness on the five standards for successful meetings (see chapter 6 will be useful. This attention to group development, often overlooked, is the secret to getting better and is the focus of the next chapter.

This format was developed by the International School Bangkok after one of the authors worked with them developing collaborative tools for instructional leaders. Members of these classes included the Superintendent, Associate Superintendent for Curriculum, all Principals, some department heads and teachers in informal leadership roles. The learning and the modeling by the Superintendent was instrumental in spreading sound practices throughout the school. The cabinet also held its meetings in the round so anyone could come and observe them at work, practicing meeting standards and employing norms of collaboration (Garmston and Welsh, 2007)

- Need for AS to grow organically at ECA, needs to be something that is seen as relevant and useful and moves with the needs of the school and not simply seen as a new initiative/flavour of the month type thing (this fits perfectly with the definition of an adaptive organisation). AS should outlast staff, admin and become a part of ECA itself for it to be successful and help ECA stay ahead.
- Staff need to see it as useful for them and for the growth and survival of the school as a leading school.
- Promoting AS could be as simple as talking with others at any opportunity about what AS is so great and why we are so excited about it for ECA. Could survey staff on their thoughts but leaning towards informal chats.
- Habits of Mind mentioned as a possible common language that everyone at ECA could use - proving very successful in classes that are using it at the moment.

**Main Text:**

**Posing Problems for Groups to Work On**

Much time can be saved when councils or other groups delegate tasks to subcommittees. Our experience is that three hours spent carefully posing the problem has saved literally hundreds of hours of committee work, eliminated false starts, and helped to keep morale and communications at healthy levels.

To delegate without clear directions, constraints, and other details often produces unsatisfactory results. Both parties feel bad, and sometimes the committee that developed the report is directed to repeat the work. It is in this type of work that clarity about decision authority needs to be at its most precise.

Decide which ones are most appropriate for a problem you are posing for a group to work on.

Well-constructed agendas are an essential part of successful meetings. An excellent facilitator, informed and capable group members, and sufficient time and space alone are not enough to create meetings that get a lot of quality work done in a short amount of time with a great deal of member satisfaction.

The image is a page from a book titled "Time-Efficient Meetings," specifically from Chapter 7. The page is numbered 103 and contains a boxed section titled "Figure 7.6. Leaders Pose Questions for Delegated Assignments." The content is structured as a step-by-step guide for leaders on how to delegate assignments effectively. Here is the detailed transcription of the text:

---

**Step 1. Leaders define the problem:**
(a) What is the problem or challenge?  
(b) Who is affected directly?  
(c) Who and what are affected indirectly?  
(d) What feelings may exist about the problem?  
(e) What time, personnel, and fiscal limitations apply to resolutions or resolving processes  

**Step 2. Leaders develop resolution criteria:**
(a) What is the desired outcome?  
(b) What criteria must the outcome meet in order to reach a satisfactory resolution?  
(c) In what ways will the resolution contribute to organizational values or goals?  
For example:  
• The management team achieving and maintaining a common focus • Employees knowing that they are cared about and can contribute to the organization’s directions  
• Development of five energy sources (efficacy, flexibility, craftsmanship, consciousness, and interdependence)  
(d) In what ways will the resolution procedures and processes contribute to the organization’s reflection, continued learning, and systematically managed change?  

**Step 3. Leaders phrase the assignment for the task force or ad hoc group:**
(a) Determine the level(s) of decision-making authority the group will have  
(b) Decide if the group is to present one resolution or three, with advantages and disadvantages for each.  
(c) Phrase the task with language such as “What might we do in order that…” or “In what ways might we provide the widest latitude to the task force and maximize potential for creativity?”  
(d) List the resolution criteria with language such as “In ways that increase group efficacy, sharpen the management team’s focus, and do so within existing budget guidelines.” This informs the group of organizational values and/or resolution restraints.  

**Step 4. Leaders present the assignment to the group and initiate processes for clarification and understanding of the task:**
Example: This committee’s task is to present to the superintendent of schools, by March 1, a recommendation regarding the issue stated below. The superintendent will take under advisement the committee’s recommendation and will draft and recommend policy to the board of trustees. The board, after holding public hearings, will make a final decision at their June 8 meeting. Issue: In what ways might we develop teachers’ capacity to teach for culturally proficient standards and authentically interact with families of minority cultures. The committee’s recommendations must do this in ways that will:  
(a) Bring us into full compliance with the law  
(b) Maximize individual choice  
(c) Work within the allocated budgets for professional and organizational development  
(d) Contribute to collective efficacy

**Chapter 8**  
**The Confident and Skilled Facilitator**

Facilitation is the group’s instrument for making the most of its time and resources. Perhaps no role is as significant to developing social capital and producing self-directed groups that effectively plan, problem solve, and make decisions as the facilitator. This chapter offers definitions of facilitation work, addresses the requirements for facilitators, the tasks during the various stages of facilitation, ways to develop confidence and competence, and ways facilitators intervene when things go wrong in meetings. A special section is included on facilitation practices in groups of three or four members.

*There is an illustration below this introductory paragraph. The illustration depicts a person standing and pointing at a board, apparently facilitating a discussion or meeting with three seated individuals facing the board.*

Because meetings are inherently messy, facilitation is essential. A person serving as facilitator makes complicated conversations manageable, manages energy and focus, provides structure and protocols, accommodates differences in cognitive style, equalizes the influence of new and veteran teachers, and accommodates the vocal and the shy.

Facilitators make a group’s work easier, clarify outcomes and manage processes, make sure all views are considered, ask the right questions, create safe environments, and strengthen the fabric of community. Effective listening is embedded in all of this (Davis, 2013). Listening, manifested by attentive paraphrasing, lets the speaker know he or she has been heard, connects one person’s contribution to another’s, summarizes group conversation, and often allows people to hear one another, even if their mind was somewhere else during the original statement. Paraphrasing is but one of several language tools the facilitator uses.

A great facilitator is like an accomplished dancer. One notices the dance, but not the dancer. She directs process, yet is supremely flexible. She follows principles, not rules. She improvises. She is comfortable with who she is and sets aside judgments about others. And, changing genders for balance, he is clear in the moment about his intentions. He thinks beyond activities to outcomes. He is reflective and learns from experience. He can direct or request, be firm or soft, serious or light, focus on task or on relationships. Male or female, the skilled facilitator has abundant knowledge about processes and groups and is effortlessly competent with many facilitation moves.

Above all, the facilitator is an observer who helps groups mediate tensions. Every system is influenced by demands that present mixed messages. The principal who responds to the demands of the central office without considering impacts on staff can unwittingly contribute to teacher reluctance, resistance, or rebellion. Teachers, driven by concern for student learning needs, sometimes collectively

work in opposition to excesses of standardized testing. Parents and teachers look at a system through different eyes. Each day, there are different interpretations of the same data, and stakeholders respond from different perspectives. A facilitator serves the system by bringing the different perspectives to consciousness.

**Facilitation Compared to Other Leadership Roles**
As mentioned in chapter 3, facilitation is similar to but different from three other leadership roles: presenting, consulting, and coaching. Groups need clear role definitions because the name of a role influences people’s expectations. The most common error we’ve noticed is for the presenter and facilitator titles to be used interchangeably. This has become so pervasive that the spell-check on one of our laptops automatically changes the word facilitator to presenter. Just as a Ford is not a Honda, a facilitator is not a presenter, and a presenter is not facilitator. In one case both are vehicles, in the latter, both are leadership functions with important differences.

In a professional community dedicated to adaptive change leadership is shared. All participants develop the knowledge and skills to manage themselves and lead others. Leadership is a function shared in teams, in professional development, in research, and in projects. Recognizing what we have called the four hats of leadership (see chapter 3) and knowing when and how to change them becomes shared knowledge within the organization. When values, roles, and work relationships are clear, decisions about appropriate behavior are easy. Because the terms presenter and facilitator are sometimes used interchangeably we repeat key distinctions made in chapter 3.

**Facilitators Make Work Easy**
Facilitate comes from the Latin stem facilis “easy” and from the French faciliter “to render easy.” Groups convene to solve problems, make decisions, develop plans, or clarify information. Facilitators direct processes, choreograph energy, and maintain a focus on one content and one process at a time. The facilitator may not be the person in charge of the group. More ideas are generated and better decisions made when a facilitator serves groups than when no facilitator works with a group.

Because presenters use many instructional methods, including facilitating learning in processes that actively engage adult learners, the roles are easily confused. While facilitators are neutral to content, presenters are responsible for the content. When facilitators have essential information about a topic, it is difficult to stay within the neutrality boundary (Bens, 2012). We periodically witness meetings in which colleagues ask the group member who is facilitating to add to the conversation. Wanting to know the facilitator’s ideas is understandable, but it is a disservice to the group to lose a content-neutral facilitator. The strategy *Signal Role Change* permits the facilitator to step out of the role to comment and yet protect the integrity of the role. See appendix A for thirty-seven moves facilitators use to manage energy, focus, and information.

---

**Boxed Section:**

**Signal Role Change**
- When facilitating a meeting and wanting to contribute content, ask, “May I add something?” The group usually will concur.
- Move off to the side of the group or be seated. From this space, make a contribution in a credible voice.
- Without speaking, return to the facilitation space. In an approachable voice say, “OK. Let’s move on,” or “How does that add to your thinking?”

The Confident and Skilled Facilitator

CHAPTER 8

gift of attending to everything at once, and knowing what to do when you don’t know what to do. You don’t have to be flashy to be a good facilitator, but you do need to be developing consciousness, clarity, competence, credibility, and confidence.

**Consciousness**

Facilitators are simultaneously aware of multiple events in the external environment and in their internal world. They work to hone their sensory acuity. Of the eleven million bits of data bombarding a person every second, ten million come through the eyes. Facilitators pick up cues that group members are engaged, socializing, fatigued, impatient, apathetic, curious, excited, or just going through the motions. With auditory senses, facilitators detect nuances in voice tone even when they are turned away from the group. They pay attention to breathing, room temperature, and sight lines. They shuttle from looking outward to looking inward. Facilitators maintain their own resourcefulness, take stock of their energy, notice when they might be making poor judgments, remind themselves of context, and assess their relationship with the group. The facilitator’s internal focus complements, not dominates, the external awareness.

Facilitators stay aware of multiple outcomes and contexts. Most meetings are nested inside other circumstances or initiatives. Perhaps most important, facilitators are aware of their point of view at any given time, and they press themselves to understand interactions from various perspectives. Facilitators know that success often depends on their ability to see things in new ways, gain new understandings, and produce new patterns of group interactions.

**Clarity**

Facilitators are clear about their role, its boundaries, and its responsibilities, and they communicate this unambiguously to groups. They know to whom they are ultimately responsible. (See appendix F for the distinctions among a contact, intermediate, or primary client.) Facilitators know the importance of language and strive for precision. The following are examples of clear facilitator language:

- *To get attention.* “Look this direction.”
- *To clarify purpose.* “Today’s task is to ____ [approve, generate, select, identify, explore, resolve].”
- *To give directions.* “Identify some ideas you would like to explore as a team. Prepare to share your two most important ideas.”
- *To encourage participation.* “Here are some suggestions for how to get the most value out of today’s meeting. Be responsible for your comfort and learning. Don’t wait for a break to make yourself comfortable. Be responsible for your learning. If you can’t hear someone, say ‘Louder, please!’ If someone is speaking too abstractly and you need a concrete example, please ask for it.”
- *To enlarge perspective.* “Who is not in this room and can’t speak for themselves on the topic? What do you imagine their concerns might be?”
- *To invite group awareness.* “How is the group doing on its agreement about listening to one another? Tell your partner.”
- *To foster understanding.* “Who can offer an organizing paraphrase?”
- *To encourage agreements.* “Are you ready for a decision?”

Language obscures or clarifies. Precise language is a gift to the facilitator and the group. It saves time and frustration, eliminates ambiguity, conveys respect for the group, and fosters facilitator credibility. Facilitators strive to be organized, brief, and specific. They use words and phrases that have one meaning. Use nouns more than pronouns. Tell the group what it is to do, why or how that relates to the bigger context of its work, and the specific intention

### Competence
- **Description:** This section discusses how competence develops through continuous learning, experience, and reflection. It emphasizes the importance of understanding effective meetings, distinguishing between discussion and dialogue, using facilitation strategies, and designing agendas. Competence also involves reading a group, paraphrasing, asking questions, being comfortable with silence, and using nonverbal strategies.
- **Text:**  
  "Competence develops with continuous learning, experience, and reflection on experience. Facilitators’ competencies are grounded in a basic knowledge of effective meetings. This includes the distinction between discussion and dialogue (chapter 5), a set of facilitation strategies (see appendix A), and three structures for successful meeting (see chapter 6). Additional competencies include designing an agenda (chapter 7), reading a group, paraphrasing, asking invitational questions, being comfortable with silence, and using a host of nonverbal strategies and moves. Competence also means realizing that a plan is only a map of the territory and having the wisdom to know when the plan is not working. You may also want to see a book on resolving problems in meetings and workshops to self-assess yourself on a facilitator proficiency scale (Garmston and Zimmerman, 2013)."

### Credibility
- **Description:** This section explains that credibility is a byproduct of clarity, competence, and confidence. It is a perception formed by the group about the facilitator. Credibility can be temporarily lost, especially if mistakes are not owned or if disrespectful comments are made. The section provides advice on how to recover from mistakes, including stepping away from the error and using humor or self-disclosure.
- **Text:**  
  "Credibility is a byproduct of clarity, competence, and confidence. Credibility does not live inside the facilitator; rather, it is a perception the group forms about the person. When a group believes that a facilitator is competent, confident, neutral, trustworthy, and fair, the group can say that this person is credible.
  Credibility, like trust, can temporarily be lost. Being less than honest, not owning mistakes, or speaking disrespectfully about those who are not in the room will drive a wedge of discomfort between you and the group. One essential facilitator capacity is learning how to recover from mistakes. As a friend of ours says, if you step in it, know how to step out of it.
  The strongest element of a recovery move is to step away from the place you made the error. (“Did I say that?”—Pointing to the space you just left), or direct some humor at yourself (“I always wanted to be skillful, now I realize I should have specified at what”). To regain credibility for errors of greater magnitude use four steps. (1) Acknowledge whatever you did that evoked discomfort (“I brought you incorrect information that resulted in confusion and upset”); take responsibility (“I’m sorry, I was supposed to bring that to you today, and I forgot”); (3) Apologize (“That was insensitive, please accept my apology”); and (4) self-disclose (“I will make it my intention to not make that error again”)."

### Content Description:
The text discusses key elements for effective group facilitation, focusing on the following points:

1. **Amplifying and Directing Group Energy**: 
   - Facilitators help direct emotional, cognitive, and physical energy toward group goals.
   - Research shows some groups are "smarter" collectively, performing better in problem-solving due to collective intelligence.
   - Factors such as inquiry, advocacy, positivity, and social sensitivity contribute to group success.
   - Collective efficacy is linked to high performance across various contexts.

2. **Information as an Essential Current**:
   - Groups need to consume and construct information to plan, decide, solve problems, and act.
   - Information comes in many forms (abstractions, examples, research, etc.).
   - Facilitators help groups focus on relevant data and identify patterns.

3. **Logistics**:
   - Logistics is described as the "ground" of group process, enabling flow by managing the environment, equipment, materials, schedules, and procedures.
   - Facilitators should prepare the room and materials in advance, removing unnecessary clutter.

4. **Importance of Visuals**:
   - Visuals help focus attention, as most sensory information is visual.
   - Charts are valuable for their permanence and ability to keep information visible.
   - Facilitators can use charts to direct attention to data and away from themselves, especially when presenting uncomfortable information.
   - Color-coding and clear, block-lettered text are recommended for readability.

The Confident and Skilled Facilitator

CHAPTER 8

mary task is to amplify and direct emotional, cognitive, and physical energy to group goals. Researchers have found that some groups are “smarter” than others—that is they collectively have higher performance or greater success in solving problems than comparison groups (Fredrickson and Losada, 2005; Losada and Heaphy, 2004; Woolley et al., 2010). The researchers found substantial evidence for collective intelligence as real and measurable. Factors like turn taking, balancing inquiry with advocacy, higher positivity ratios, and social sensitivity were attributes of the more accomplished groups. Studies also find that collective efficacy, one of the five energy sources, is consistently related to high performance across subject areas, across locations and using multiple instruments (Eells, 2011; Goddard, Hoy, and Woolfolk-Hoy, 2004).

Information is the third essential current. Groups consume and construct information in order to plan, decide, solve problems, and take action. Information comes in a variety of packages: abstractions, examples, generalizations, details, thoughts, feelings, research, numbers, history, and dreams. There is typically too much data and too little time. Facilitators assist groups to select some data to study and others to ignore. They guide groups to know when to look for details and when to examine themes and patterns.

The fourth and final current is logistics. “This is the ‘ground’ of group process—the most constrained and, when mastered, the most enabling flow because it frees up attention and energy for other things” (Sibbit, 2002, p. 55). This current carries the management of the meeting-room environment, equipment, materials, time allotments, schedules, and reporting procedures (chapter 6).

Give instructions for room arrangement and materials (see chapter 6 for ideas on organizing the room for different purposes). Arrive at least thirty minutes early to make whatever adjustments are necessary. Get any clutter out of the room. Often there are too many tables or chairs to work effectively.

Visuals are indispensable for focusing attention. Most of our sensory information comes through the eyes. One major value of charts over images on a screen is their potential for permanence. People know that a screen image will disappear and therefore experience a muscular tension they don’t have when looking at a chart. On a chart, information stays visible throughout the meeting, allowing the participants to know where they are on the agenda and the facilitator to refocus them on goals or norms. Charts are especially valuable if information is being presented that makes members uncomfortable. A facilitator can use the strategy Third Point to direct attention to the data and away from him- or herself, providing a separation between the message and the messenger. Place the charted agenda where it can be easily referred to throughout the meeting.

Color-code charted agendas or other data that has been prepared in advance. Use red for headlines; brown, blue, and green for text; and yellow and black for organizing or graphics. Always print in block letters, never in cursive—and, despite what some books advise, never use all caps. Any teacher will tell you that printed upper- and lowercase block letters are the most readable.

**Main Text (Left Column):**

Color-coding is not advisable when you are recording during a meeting, because it can slow the flow of talk. Graphics aid memory and communicate complex concepts metaphorically. *ChartArt* (Buckley, 2002) is a series of images that can be traced onto a chart; they are considered useful by both experienced and novice facilitators. Buckley (2002) describes how to work with charts and graphics.

**Facilitation Functions**
The facilitator’s work begins before the meeting does and continues after the meeting. During a meeting, there are many facilitator functions with unique purposes and tools. Meeting work is cyclical. The same functions—generating, organizing, and analyzing—can repeat, and complex strategies often have embedded in them several smaller ones. Focusing attention will be repeated many times throughout a session, along with framing the work and activating relevant knowledge.

Here we describe tips, strategies, and overarching goals for each function.

**Preparing**
Is this part of an initiative in which the group has already worked? Will there be meetings to follow? Are other groups involved? Learn the leader’s perception of meeting goals. You might have to be a coach or consultant before you can be a facilitator, in some situations. Often the meeting outcomes have not been considered at the level of detail necessary to design an effective session. Explore specifics. Find out if anything is happening in the group, or to the group, that could bring counterproductive energy into the room. Occasionally you might arrange to meet with a small planning committee or conduct a phone conference to get multiple perspectives. This is essential when you have been asked to facilitate conflict-related or problem-solving meetings. See appendixes F, G, and H for tips on contracting for facilitation services. Ask to see the meeting announce-

ment; you want to know what information the participants have about the meeting.

**Opening**
An opening might take as little as ten minutes or as long as thirty minutes, depending on your desired outcome, available time, group size, level of group maturity, and experience in working together. The first three to five minutes are critical in developing expectations, receptivity, and relationship with a group. During the opening the facilitator must get people’s attention, focus their energy, acknowledge any resistance that might be present, be especially careful about pronoun use (your meeting, not mine), provide for a public display of information and group memory, and clarify roles—the facilitator’s, the participants’, and the record-

The image is a page from a book titled "The Confident and Skilled Facilitator," specifically Chapter 8. The page number is 111.

**Content Description:**

- The top of the page has the book title on the left and the chapter title and number on the right.
- The page is divided into two columns of text.

**Left Column:**
- The text discusses the importance of the facilitator addressing the topic, its relevance, organization, and their own credibility at the start of a session.
- There is a QR code in the center of the left column, labeled "Video 8.1."
- Below the QR code, the section titled "Focusing" discusses the importance of attention for facilitators and the impact of nonverbal communication. It references Grinder (2007) and mentions that many nonverbal tools are described in appendix A.
- The next section, "Clarifying Role," emphasizes the importance of specifying the facilitator's role and staying neutral. It suggests facilitators should ask group members to clarify the type of facilitation they desire, ranging from tightly directed to more group-guided processes.

**Right Column:**
- The text continues discussing the facilitation process, emphasizing the need for focus, efficiency, and energy conservation.
- It explains that groups must allow themselves to be facilitated, granting psychological permission to the facilitator.
- The section discusses the importance of confidence, trust, and nonjudgmental attitudes in facilitators, and how body language (such as breathing from the abdomen) can signal confidence.
- Wellman and Lipton (2004) are cited regarding a permission-getting process that allows groups to provide direction to facilitation services.
- The final paragraph describes an approach to empowering groups by negotiating the facilitator's stance, using metaphors to describe a continuum from hard to soft facilitation (e.g., Rambo to Mr. Rogers, Xena the Warrior Princess to Mary Poppins, lion to lamb). It notes that groups may select harder forms of facilitation if some members dominate time and energy.

> Grinder (2007) describes twenty-one nonverbal tools that people unconsciously use to enhance their speech. Many of these appear in appendix A. Since humans are influenced more by nonverbal communication than by the spoken word, it is necessary for facilitators to develop a nonverbal vocabulary. We have incorporated many nonverbal tools of communication in training facilitators and have had remarkable success in helping them amplify their effectiveness. See appendix A for descriptions of over thirty facilitator moves.

> Clarifying Role
>
> Take time to specify that your role is to guide the process and stay neutral to the content. Encourage group members to tell you if they think that you are stepping out of role. Have them direct you about the type of facilitation they desire: tightly directed by you or with greater allowance made for the group to guide the process. Facilitation is essential to maintain focus, efficiency, and energy as well as to conserve time and achieve results.
>
> Ultimately groups allow themselves to be facilitated. If it has not given its tacit permission, a group will resist or subvert the facilitator’s efforts to serve them. A group grants psychological permission to the facilitator to manage the meeting process and to place issues before the group to consider. Permission is based on a number of intangibles. Among these are a perception of confidence, trust, and a belief that the facilitator can remain neutral and nonjudgmental. Confidence and credibility are perceived by congruent language—that is, the body says what the words describe. Confident facilitators breathe from the abdomen. Facilitators whose breathing is high and shallow signal their own discomfort, which affects the group’s sense of ease. Wellman and Lipton (2004) describe a permission-getting process that signals responsiveness and permits the group to provide direction to the facilitation services:
>
> One approach to empowering a working group, whether it is at a novice level of performance as a group or at a more expert level, is to negotiate your stance as a facilitator. Stances may vary from hard to soft facilitation. An effective way to offer these options is to describe a physical continuum organized by metaphors, then ask group members to point to the spot on the continuum they believe will be most effective for that session. Some metaphors that we have used include facilitation stances that range from Rambo to Mr. Rogers; from Xena the Warrior Princess to Mary Poppins; or from a lion to a lamb. Presenting choices helps the group to gain or regain the power to control its own direction and purposes. This is especially true if individual group members are dominating the group’s time and energies. Such a group will tend to select harder forms of facilitation and facilitator permission to intervene with problematic situations. (p. 15)

**Framing the Work**

As a noun, *frame* marks the boundaries within which an entire picture is displayed. As a verb, *frame* means to create a mental structure, or frame, through which people interpret or make sense of a situation. Facilitators frame tasks to set a tone for participation and productivity—to describe the purposes of the work, how it relates to a larger context, and how it benefits participant interests.

Groups perform at their best when they have clearly defined outcomes. You might start with an artfully vague statement such as “Today you will explore ways to save the after-school program.” Broad outcomes maintain momentum because people relate to the intent and don’t get bogged down by the details. Later, after framing and an inclusion activity, you should be more specific: “The purpose today is to identify what resources we could make available for the program. You will recommend some to consider. Next you will assess the costs to other school programs and, based on that, make a go or no-go recommendation on continuing the after-school activities.” Working outcomes employ a verb that specifies what action is to be taken, such as *decide, recommend, inform, assess, explore, advocate, inquire,* or *identify*.

**Acknowledging Resistance**

Some of the people, some of the time, will want to resist, oppose, refrain from participation, or push back against proposals, programs, ideas, and even resist being in a meeting. Keep in mind that their resistance is just a way of taking care of themselves and is not about you. The resistance often has nothing to do with the meeting. One of the authors met with a group of principals and sensed apathy and fatigue. He asked what was going on. He learned that this was the fourth day that week that the principals had been out of their buildings. In addition, they had delivered reductions-in-force notices the day before. Given these circumstances, the proposed agenda made little sense, and as the group modified its task, energy returned to the room.

To resist resistance is futile. To resist resistance is to have it persist. One cannot be reasoned out of resentment, hurt, anger, betrayal, blame, or discouragement, the typical sources of resistance. Only if you acknowledge the validity of the perceptions and feelings (which is different from agreeing with them) will the group have the choice to set them aside.

For extended resources see Garmston and Zimmerman’s (2013) strategies for resolving twenty types of problems facilitators face. Here we will identify three approaches to work with resistance. Each is a form of reframing. If resistance is present or anticipated, it must be addressed immediately at the start of a meeting. The three approaches are as follows:

- **Pace and lead.** The facilitator acknowledges (by pacing) the legitimacy of feelings a group is having, then (leading) suggests the temporary suspension of those feelings in order to make the best use of this time. (Costa and Garmston, 2016)
- **Use strategies that acknowledge the resistance as natural and that generate humor, such as Banned Words (appendix A.).**
- **Choreograph an opening.** Imagine you are conducting a before-school meeting with teachers. They are attending because it is a workday at the beginning of the school year. Last year, scores went up across the district. They were promised a classroom day, but the district office decided to send

### Main Content (Left Column):

#### Developing Inclusion
- The section discusses the importance of the first four opening activities: focusing attention, clarifying your role, framing the work, and acknowledging resistance. These activities can be brief and blended together.
- Developing inclusion is described as the seventh activity, which can also be blended with the others. It helps participants transition into the group and space, whether for the full group or subgroups.
- Full-group activities set norms, focus attention, generate energy, and help participants understand their relation to the group. These activities move the focus from self to group.
- Groundings or synectics activities (referenced in appendix A) are examples of full-group activities. Groundings are useful for groups experiencing conflict, merging different groups, or preparing for difficult conversations.
- Synectic activities reveal knowledge and attitudes about a topic and engage the metaphorical brain. An example is given where groups might respond to a question like “assessing student learning is like what household object because . . .” if that is the meeting's focus. An anecdote is shared about a group whose responses mostly related to toilets, indicating their attitude.
- Subgroup activities set norms of active engagement and focus attention on the meeting’s work. Participants take turns speaking to a prompt, such as expectations, positive occurrences, or hopes/apprehensions for an upcoming event.
- The section concludes by emphasizing the importance of clarifying the purpose of inclusion activities, especially at the beginning of a session or when the facilitator is not yet known to the group.

### Sidebar (Right Column):

#### Virtual Inclusion Activities for Remote Teams
- Virtual inclusion activities are as important as face-to-face ones. They help get voices or faces “in the room,” help members learn about each other, and challenge thinking about the topic.
- Activities should be short and goal-oriented. Goals might include getting voices in the room, representing a virtual role call, getting ownership of the agenda, stimulating creativity, or revealing perceptions from different time zones.
- Two example activities are provided:
  - Each person, in turn, says their name, role, organization, and hopes for the meeting.
  - Each member posts a picture of their shoes or an item on their desk, then explains how that item represents their interests.

### Text Excerpt (Top Left):
- The text discusses the importance of language precision when acknowledging resistance in meetings. The facilitator should use vague terms that people can identify with, such as "all of you, some of you, or a few of you" (Zoller and Landry, 2010).

**Activating Knowledge**

Just as teachers engage students by helping them to elicit prior knowledge, the facilitator does this to generate energy and activate information that is relevant to the group’s task. Doing it at the beginning of a meeting and each time new topics are introduced has multiple benefits. First, particularly at the beginning of a meeting, a norm for engagement is reinforced. It energizes the group members as they work and frees the facilitator to observe the group. Second, the relevant knowledge that is activated is instrumental in accelerating the pace of the meeting, for it brings information into play that is necessary to work on a topic. Sometimes this information is as simple as remembering what happened at the last meeting. Many meetings take unnecessary time getting started because group members do not recall what happened in earlier sessions.

Third, eliciting prior knowledge levels the perceived playing field within the group. This is especially true with mixed-role groups when the activity is preceded by a quick writing activity so that each group member has something to contribute. Finally, any initial task has to be structured so that group members feel psychologically safe, confident that they will not be demeaned, attacked, or ridiculed. The “Sort Cards” strategy serves this purpose nicely. Members privately respond to a prompt on 3 x 5 cards, then they display and organize the cards according to criteria that they invent (appendix A).

Other strategies in appendix A that activate relevant information while maintaining psychological safety are “Paired Verbal Fluency”; “Know, Think You Know, Want to Know”; “Four-Box Synectics”; “Three to Get Ready and Card Stack and Shuffle”; and “Give One to Get One.” Keep in mind that members must always feel safe but as the meeting progresses, not necessarily comfortable. Discomfort is often a doorway to learning.

---

**Giving Directions**

Precise directions conserve time and energy. Confusing directions make members feel dumb. When people feel dumb they lose efficacy, energy, and commitment to task. The thinking-processes supporting direction-giving are clear. At the simplest level, they include guidelines such as using declarative statements and a minimum number of words. As we will see later, personal pronouns can be problematic with this function and others. By saying things like “Here’s what I want you to do next” or “Listen carefully to me as I describe this process,” a facilitator conveys the idea that the group is serving him or her rather than the group’s goals. Instead, use phrases such as “Your next steps are . . .” or “This process has three stages . . .” or “Turn to your neighbor and name your concerns about this topic.”

These forms maintain focus on the group and on the task rather than on the facilitator. Directions, like framing statements, can be scripted. Charts and slides that hold directions visually aid retention. In the case of particularly difficult tasks, they focus participants’ attention on the process-task interaction—which is where it is supposed to be—rather than on the person guiding the work.

Adopt the syntactical pattern of “What,” “Why,” “How” when giving directions. The “What” is the name of the strategy, structure, or pattern you are proposing for engaging the group. The “Why” is the intention or purpose of that choice. The “How” includes the details and procedures involved in the process.

**The Confident and Skilled Facilitator**  
**CHAPTER 8**

The “Why” is the most essential element for enlisting group member respect for the process and commitment to following the assigned pattern with integrity. “Why” statements offer principles of practice such as: “This strategy presents opportunities for hearing and considering multiple viewpoints without judgment or comment.” Or, “This paired interaction allows partners to engage with the text and each other’s perspectives in a time-efficient manner.”

Notice that this last “Why” statement also embeds a subtle pacing for those participants who value time efficiency and may not always value their colleagues’ contributions. For those participants who enjoy collaborative interactions, the embedded message for them is that the strategy will be time bound so they should respect the protocol and time frames and not get lost in any meandering conversations during the process.

“Why” statements have both immediate and longer-term intentions. The immediate impact is framing the purpose for the task at hand. The longer-term intention is where facilitation overlaps with group development goals. For groups to be ready to engage with increasing cognitive and relational challenges, the skilled facilitator paces both the strategy choice and “Why’s” to at first meet, and then stretch, the learning capacities of group members. For novice groups, the “Why’s” will be mostly about the intention of the strategy to help those groups develop basic habits of following directions and working successfully with colleagues.

Use a credible voice to give directions—one in which the tonal pattern is flat and tends to curl down at the end of sentences. This voice pattern universally is received as “this is important information, please attend.” Stand upright with head and body still in a posture of calm and centeredness with feet aligned under the shoulders. Drama teachers tell us this is called a neutral position. If there are subsets to the directions, use a visual paragraph for maximum congruence. In this pattern the facilitator gives the first direction, pauses, breaks eye contact by dropping his or her head, moves to a new spot, looks up, and gives the next direction. This pattern can be used for up to four steps in direction giving. Imagine the following statements (with expanded information for each) delivered with the visual paragraph after each of the first three directions. Table 8.1 shows what might be said while giving directions in a meeting and in a sixth-grade class.

A facilitator’s language choices will greatly influence success in giving directions as well as in offering guidelines and leading the process.

An often-overlooked yet powerful attribute of clear directions is pronoun use (Wellman, 2006). Pronouns are substitutes for names. They label the speaker’s place in any relationship and convey expectations of that relationship, such as compliance, affection, and whose group it really is. When a facilitator named Sarah says, “Please give me your attention,” she might as well have been saying, “Please give Sarah, not somebody else in the group, your attention.” One of the authors once heard

**The Adaptive School**

a principal in a meeting refer to “our work this year,” to which a teacher muttered, “No, it’s not ‘our work’; she’s going back to the office, and we’re going to be doing it.” On another occasion a superintendent new to the job thanked one of us for coming to the district to work with “his people.”

Who you are by position and relation to the group should influence your choice of pronouns. If you are a group member who has stepped up to facilitate a session, the work very well might be “ours.” If you are external to the group in any way, referring to the work as “ours” can generate inferences that actually interfere with the group’s work or its development.

It is usually wise to carefully plan and script your comments. For an upcoming facilitation session, consider whether it is “our work today,” “your work today,” or “the work today.” For work that is emotionally charged in any way, it is usually safest to apply the most pronoun-neutral forms and talk about “the work,” “this task,” “the data,” or “the outcome.” Neutral forms, which use articles and pronouns such as the and this, depersonalize the task and make it psychologically safer for group members to engage with the issue and not the person before them.

The neutral pronoun pattern can be supported by the use of charts and visuals that hold important technical, and perhaps emotionally laden, information off to the side (Grinder, 2007). This approach removes the emotion of the message from the facilitator, guiding the group’s emotional energy to the information rather than toward the facilitator. Be sure to keep your eyes on the chart as you use neutral pronouns. If you revert to making eye contact with group members while framing difficult tasks, you run the risk of repersonalizing the task and drawing the emotional energy to the messenger rather than leaving it with the message.

**Suggesting Process**

Fluent facilitators are able to anticipate bottlenecks and common points of confusion. At these points, they succinctly propose targeted procedural tips and offer additional technical resources to move the group ahead. Again, these are situations in which careful pronoun choice can be important to the group’s productivity. Given the wisdom of prior experience and an implicit desire for credibility with the group, you might be tempted to say things like “In my experience the best thing to do is. . . .” Such phrasing has the effect of personalizing the advice or suggestions that follow.

The alternate approach is to drop the personal pronoun and cultivate a repertoire of phrases such as “Groups typically get stuck here and need to . . .” and “At points like this, productive groups tend to . . .” These more pronoun-neutral forms frame the notion of expertise as a capacity of some ideal group, not as a “gift” from the facilitator. In all facilitator functions, the intention must be to place the spotlight on the group, its development, and its task accomplishment—not on the facilitator.

**Facilitating Work**

Facilitators facilitate—that is, they make work easier. Your awareness of the group combines with your repertoire of facilitation skills and knowledge to serve you as you maintain a neutral stance and guide the group through strategies and transitions. Appendix A describes over thirty facilitator moves (often nonverbal) and one hundred and thirty strategies or protocols.

Very small groups cannot afford the luxury of having one person stay in a neutral facilitation role, yet facilitation can still be present. We will discuss the concept of facilitating a small group shortly.

**Transitioning**

A transition is a process of change from one state to another. Managing the shifts between activities or topics or between content and breaks is part of the art of facilitation. Without any warning, momentum can be broken. Group members can be so invested in the

current activity that they feel resentment if the activity is suddenly broken off (Sibbit, 2002). Near the end of a process, help the group to anticipate a transition by announcing that you are beginning to move toward closure or are turning to a different stage in the process. To manage energy and attention, give people time warnings when they are engaged in self-managing activities. The move “Yellow Light” (appendix A) serves as a warning. Another strategy is to move quietly around the group and indicate the remaining time. Timers on the screen will also let people track the time for themselves.

“Closing the Window” is a nonverbal strategy that signals that a full-group conversation is about to end. This often brings out those who have something to say before the time is up. In video 8.4 we watch the facilitator use “closing the window,” a facilitator move learned from virtuoso Suzanne Bailey.

Because the group has not internalized the agenda sequence as you have, reminders about where they are now in relationship to the full agenda can be useful. Saphier, Haley-Speca, and Gower (2008) offer the metaphor of station naming—as if riders are being reminded of what they are leaving and where they are going—to help members know how what they are doing relates to what is completed and the next topic or process. “Now that you’ve identified concerns, the next step will be to explore related assumptions. That will be the first task after a short break.”

Some form of transition is also useful to signal a shift in activity (“OK, that’s it for brainstorming, the next stage is clarification”), pace (“The pace is going to slow down to open an opportunity for reflection”), and level (“Now the task moves from naming assumptions to exploring what inferences they might lead to”).

Use transitions to have participants organize and integrate the work just completed when the ideas have to be carried to a next stage of thinking or when the content should be remembered for a future meeting. Some strategies (appendix A) that accomplish this are “Journal,” “Most Important Point,” “Partners Report,” and “Matchbook Definitions.” Strategies that engage the full group are “Walk About” and “Stir the Classroom.” “Sound and Motion Symphony” brings physical expression to the integration of information (see appendix A).

Closing the Meeting

At the conclusion of the work, the group is ready to close the meeting.

High on the list of frustrations that people express to us is the feeling that at the end of a meeting, nothing was accomplished. A proper closing will eliminate this complaint. The following tasks should be accomplished at this stage: clarify who is to do what by when, test commitments, clarify communications and finally assess the meeting and arrange for the next.

Clarify Who Does What by When

In the heat of conversations, the actionable part of decisions is often overlooked. Left overlooked, they are the cause of confusion, incomplete follow-up, and poor morale. The facilitator is responsible for seeing that this question is asked: Who is to do what by when? If no one else asks, the facilitator must. Names of the responsible parties should be recorded on charts and made a part of the meeting minutes.

Test Commitments

Everyone is busy. In the enthusiasm of the moment, some people overcommit. “I know you would never do this,” the facilitator might say with a smile, “but under what conditions might you be tempted to violate

these agreements?” Although it could be fairly easy—perhaps to go along with the group—to agree to a course of action during a meeting, real pressures can evolve later when one must choose between conflicting commitments. The facilitator’s question brings an awareness of the realities and tensions associated with commitments. When these realities and tensions are articulated, the group has an opportunity to explore strategies that can overcome any barriers to the agreements.

*Clarify Communications*

“What we have here is a failure to communicate” is a line from the movie *Cool Hand Luke*. When people are surveyed about the problems in their organizations, one of the top items mentioned is poor communication. Because work life is so hectic and individuals have interests and responsibilities in so many areas, it is critical to have a communication plan before people leave the meeting.

For leaders, it is desirable to have a meeting summary in group members’ hands within twenty-four hours. This signals that the group’s work is important. Some facilitators and group leaders reserve fifteen to thirty minutes after the meeting to develop a summary draft from the notes on the charts.

Other forms of after-meeting communication include scheduling reports at other meetings, e-mailing summaries to the entire staff, posting minutes in the staff room, or having each member speak to a few colleagues about what transpired. In some schools, grade-level teams or departments post agendas and minutes on the Internet to keep everyone abreast of what is occurring.

*Assess the Meeting*

Any group too busy to reflect on its work is too busy to improve. Taking a small amount of time at the end of each meeting to fill out a meeting survey is a responsible form of professional development. Group members take three to four minutes at the end of a meeting to anonymously complete appendix I, a Likert scale questionnaire about meeting effectiveness. The data are collated by the facilitator or group leader and brought back to the group at the next meeting, with frequency distributions for each item. Small groups look at the data and then engage in a full-group discussion around the question “Given what we said about ourselves last time, what do we want to work on today?” This is a remarkably effective way to elicit concerns and rapidly improve group functioning.

*Arrange for the Next Meeting*

Many groups rotate the facilitation role so that all the members have a chance to develop strength and an understanding of meeting dynamics. This is the time to select a next facilitator wanting to develop skills, and, ideally, arrange for this person to work with the group leader to design the next agenda.

**Facilitating In Small Groups**

Three members comprise a team. If one stands to facilitate, one stands to record, the seated member can make all the decisions. Right? Obviously this does not work. The essential concept for small groups is that facilitation is needed, not a full-time facilitator. The following problems are common to small groups:

- In small meetings everyone is usually seated. *Who* is facilitating often gets lost in this arrangement.
- Two of the meeting standards, one topic at a time and one process at a time, are frequently violated.
- In a group of three, achieving sufficient consensus (80 percent) is artificial with two to one splits. (Try rating an item from one to one hundred to see distinctions in perception.)
- It is difficult to manage a third meeting standard, balanced participation, if one is a dominator and incessantly talks.
- The urgent often displaces the important.

What follows next are ideas to manage the tensions above. Then we will introduce a special role we call the “Citizen Facilitator.”

When all are seated in a group of three to eight people, it is a greater challenge to manage the group’s energy and focus. One solution is for the designated facilitator to position a flip chart or chalkboard nearby. To regain attention stand, pointing to the visual display behind you, and say something like, “Here is where we are now,” or “Are we ready to move to this next item?” or (writing something on the visual display) “This seems to be the sticking point. Talk with a neighbor for a moment and generate some ideas.” A teacher in Mumbai told us she has her group do lots of partner work to keep energy high. After she stands to redirect group energy, she returns to her own partner to engage in the conversation.

To clarify a topic or process in a large group, “TAG/TAU” (topic as given/topic as understood) and “PAG/PAU” (process as given/process as understood) are used. Voice and the visual paragraph are employed. Both can be used in small groups in this manner.

“Next we (now the inclusive pronoun is appropriate) need to ask ourselves the question, ‘What might we be missing?’ Take a moment, jot down names of groups that might be affected by this and prepare to share.” *The facilitator makes a discernable shift—leaning to one side, forward into the group, leans back in the chair, or removes eyeglasses*—and asks in an approachable voice—“So what’s your understanding of what we do now?” The facilitator shown in video 8.5 uses space and voice variation in three stages to check the group’s understanding.

**Right Column:**

Sufficient consensus is mathematically challenging in a group of three or in a two-to-two split. Make a working agreement that disagreements based on principles will be explored; disagreements based on preferences will give way to values-based choices. Use a values matrix on important decisions. Name values important to protect when making the decision. Rate each choice as high, medium, or low in meeting each value. Most often this will clarify the decision-making process.

High talkers often have limited consciousness of their behavior and its effect on others. Two ideas might help. Anonymously ask members to respond to questions on post-it notes. Each should list three to five aspects of the group’s work they value, and three to five practices that make the group less effective. Use the wall of silence strategy (appendix A) in which members place the post-it notes on a flip chart or wall, and silently rearrange them placing them into categories. Allow time for reflection. Now ask, “What are you seeing? What surprises are there? What might we keep doing? What might we change?” Another approach is to use the round-robin reflection strategies in which members silently respond to this prompt. “What are some of the decisions you were making about when and how to participate and what were some of the effects of those decisions on you and the group?” After a minute or so, have members take turns reporting, with no interruptions.

The urgent is always present. Scheduling a special event, determining a response to an emotional event, or responses to an unexpected change in schedule, are some examples. Two approaches help groups keep their major energy on the important items. First post an agenda. List estimated times for each item and what the group is to do. Name each item as a product: develop, assess, decide, understand. Name who is to lead the conversation on each. Place the urgent last on the agenda because if it is first it will consume available time. List hard to talk about topics

early, so members have a chance to recover equanimity. See agenda samples in chapter 7.

**The Citizen Facilitator**

How can small groups, such as those with only three or four members, retain facilitation functions even without a designated facilitator who stays outside the conversation?

One of the authors worked with an elementary school in which grade-level teams met one hour a week to focus on instructional improvement. In each team, one teacher was designated to be the facilitator. Each team’s charge was to set annual grade-level goals, develop units, plan lessons, and assess student work results. Yet by midyear, the teams were struggling. Many teachers were frustrated. Some teams had developed three goals for the year; some had none; some had just one. They were good people, smart teachers with time and resources, yet they were floundering.

The school in this example began its collaborative work without clear intentions. Of course, student improvement is a goal, but how does collaborative work help the group to achieve this? The school leadership established structures, roles, times for the group to collaborate, and a menu of tasks on which to work. Yet tools were not provided. Time without tools is counterproductive.

In conversations with facilitators, other administrators, and one of the authors, the principal began to articulate her intention in having groups work together to make systematic inquiries into the relationship between teaching and student learning. Strategies for collaborative work were learned.

The notion of a citizen facilitator emerged, one who may be designated for any amount of time (i.e., from one meeting to one semester to the life of the group), and has three responsibilities:
- To serve as a two-way conduit between the team and the principal, informing the team of the principal’s priorities and requests, and informing the principal of the group’s ideas and recommendations.
- To serve as professional developer to the group—providing foundation knowledge about group processes, an awareness of the distinction between dialogue and discussion, and the tools for conversing, planning, and problem solving.
- To be the person in the group who maintains a macro perspective, using “helicopter” viewing to anticipate and assess when members are stuck or fatigued, and to be the person who initiates the processes to get energy and information flowing again.

Rather than having a neutral facilitator, the intention in citizen-facilitated meetings is to have facilitated conversations. If the designated facilitator will be an active voice within the room, then the group itself must take on the knowledge and skills base of the facilitator. It is imperative that group members acquire this knowledge, for in a small group led by a citizen facilitator, group members will want to suggest approaches to the group’s work, take on charting responsibilities, or remind the group to get on task.

The following is a list of duties performed by a citizen facilitator.
- Develop the agenda either before the meeting or with the group.
- Open the meeting.
- Achieve role clarification so that members can periodically and informally rise to facilitate or record “I will sometimes want to comment, so will ask someone else to facilitate. While I am facilitating, if someone goes on for too long, what would you like me to do?”
- Describe the task as a product—what the group will see or hear when done.
- Call on others to start the conversation.
- Engage in conversation as appropriate.
- Protect processes, especially one topic and one process at a time.

  - Ask who will do what by when.
  - Call for meeting assessment.
  - Close meeting.

- **Section Title:**
  - **Developing Confidence as a Facilitator**

- **Main Body Text:**
  - The text discusses the importance of self-confidence for facilitators, referencing literature that supports the idea that beliefs about oneself influence actions and results.
  - Facilitator self-confidence is described as a dimension of efficacy specific to conducting meetings.
  - The text emphasizes that self-confidence comes from reflection, experience, and support from others.
  - It notes that everyone starts with unique strengths and things to learn, and that teachers often invent ways to increase their facilitation skills due to fewer opportunities to practice.
  - Suggestions include gathering information, over-practicing essential skills (paraphrasing, pausing, probing, inquiring), and practicing in various settings.
  - The importance of enlarging one’s repertoire by observing others and jotting down useful phrases is highlighted.
  - The difference between knowing and understanding is mentioned.
  - Vicarious experiences, such as watching skilled facilitators, are recommended.

A simple two-minute power-pose manipulation was enough to significantly alter the physiological, mental, and feeling states of participants (Carney, Cuddy, and Yap, 2010). Measurements included electrocardiogram, saliva, and interview data. The daily practice implications are great for mental health. Facilitators could assume a superman (or woman) pose for two minutes before a meeting or important event. Admission: it works. Hint: do this in private.

such people; explore their reasons for certain moves. Ask them to offer you ideas, suggestions, and support.

Hold an object such as a pencil in your hand. For some reason, that helps many people to stay grounded. Focus on the group, not yourself. Focusing on yourself is a sure ticket to discomfort. Know that mistakes are your teacher.

Finally, inquire into your own inferences about others. “The challenging internal work of facilitation,” Roger Schwarz reminds us, “is to identify and explore the core values and assumptions that guide your actions, to rigorously reflect on how they increase or decrease your effectiveness, and to develop a new set of values and assumptions that you can use to increase your effectiveness and that of the groups you work with” (2002, p. 66). Presuming positive intentions, the last of the seven norms of collaboration, influences good work with groups. However, using the language of positive presuppositions (“Given your interest in resolving this . . .”) is not enough if your nonverbal behaviors belie what you say. Presuming positive intentions is a matter of respect for others. Its Latin origin, respicere, means to look again, highlighting the active nature of respect. Developing as an effective facilitator requires reflection and inquiry into your own attitudes, assumptions, and beliefs about others and the potential of group wisdom in a facilitative environment (Ravlin and Prickett, 2014).

According to Ravlin and Prickett (2014) the workings of positive presuppositions are grounded in expectancy theory, first proposed as a model by Victor Vroom (1964), and brought into the twenty-first century by Redmond (2010) and others. Positive presuppositions convey expectancy, in the theory’s terms: the belief that one’s effort can or will indeed result in attaining the stated outcome or stance. We know a facilitator who sometimes starts with a new group by saying, “I’m pleased to be here as I only work with smart groups,” with a gesture drawing the full group into this definition. The group will live up to the expectancy of the facilitator just as teacher expectations influence teacher behaviors, which influence student achievement.

**Conclusion**

Facilitators manage group energy, focus attention, and manage information. They give directions, clarify tasks, frame group perceptions, encourage participation, test assumptions, synthesize ideas, encourage participation, and support the group in its own development. At times they intervene to help groups work more effectively and develop collective potential.

Stakeholders have different perspectives. A facilitator serves the system by bringing consciousness about the different perspectives. As we depart from unproductive school cultures, the facilitation role takes on even more value than it did in the past. It is one of four leadership roles played by all players in adaptive schools, yet it is still the role least occupied by teachers and classified staff. Developing as a facilitator is challenging, because it entails high levels of several skill sets. Improvement resources include self study, modeling, attending workshops, and self assessment with proficiency scales and facilitation rubrics are helpful.

Finally, great facilitators help their groups see themselves not as they are but as they might become. As we shall see in the next chapter, both design and facilitation play important roles in developing groups.

**PART IV   RESOURCES FOR INQUIRY**

By shining the light of consciousness on essential inner structures, skilled leaders help groups articulate the underlying mental models that might be limiting perspectives and possibilities.

Adaptive leaders disturb the system for positive change. They see the group’s potential for working effectively and efficiently on the right work by providing support for steady performance improvements. These leaders move beyond tinkering with surface practices by pushing their groups to work at deeper levels that engage the beliefs and values that motivate collective learning and growth.

Part IV offers a description of six domains of group development leaders can target to assess and modify their practices. These include: “Getting Work Done,” “Doing the Right Work,” “Working Collaboratively,” “Managing Systems,” “Developing the Group,” and “Adapting to Change.”

In addition we will explore group energy as a powerful resource for this type of work. Here we present a model for looking below the surface of group phenomena to seek the underlying drivers of these observable behaviors. This section continues by presenting an intervention model for directing energy as a vital resource to increase the potency of groups as systems. Finally, we describe structures and tools for facilitating inquiry-driven data teams.

**Chapter 9**  
**Six Domains of Developing Groups**

Developing groups is one of three jobs assumed by leaders and professional developers. The other two are the task of getting work done and developing process skills. This chapter describes principles of group development and provides a way for groups to diagnose themselves on six fundamental aspects of group maturity. Chapter 10 provides a systems view of changing groups and reveals ways of working for long-range, sustainable change by assessing and intervening at the level of energy sources driving group performance.

*in which you don’t have to touch everyone to make a difference. Adaptive leaders of groups and within groups—no matter what their title—realize that developing a group is an ongoing, third agenda in their work; the first is getting work done, and the second is improving the processes of accomplishing work.*

**The Premises of Group Development**

**Each Group Is Unique**

History, cognitive styles, setting, mental models, and tasks all contribute to developing a group personality. Each group is not only unlike other groups, it is also different from the sum of its individuals. For example, a group might be composed of efficacious individuals who nevertheless believe that collectively they have little chance of making a difference.

**Some Groups Mature**

Some groups will mature along a continuum from novice to expert performance. Not all groups make this journey, just as not all teachers achieve a state of expertise. David

---

**Text under the illustration:**

All groups work at less than full potential. The best groups regard this not as a deficiency but as a healthy dissatisfaction with their current performance. They consistently commit their resources to working together more effectively. This is the way that research teams become better at researching, that basketball teams win more games, and that theater casts improve from performance to performance. All groups become better at their tasks when they reflect on their work, acquire new knowledge and skills, and practice the fundamentals of their craft. As stated previously, any group that is too busy to reflect on its work is too busy to improve.

All groups are unique. All groups are complex systems in which everything affects everything else, tiny events make major disturbances

The image is a page from a book titled "The Adaptive School." The content is organized into several sections with headings and bullet points. Here is a detailed description and transcription of the text:

---

**The Adaptive School**

Berliner (cited in Calderhead, 1996) speculated that the novice stage in teaching usually lasts for the first year and that most teachers reach the third stage (competence) within three or four years. Only a modest percentage of teachers moves to the next stage of proficiency, and an even smaller percentage, says Berliner, achieves the expert stage. Contemporary teacher education programs are placing a greater emphasis on metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive regulation. This monitoring of one’s own progress in achieving learning goals may abbreviate the novice to expertise journey. This is especially important as programs aim to develop “adaptive expertise” the ability to engage in lifelong learning, especially from others (Darling-Hammond and Bransford, 2005; National Research Council, 2000).

We believe that much the same is true for group development and that groups with collaborative cultures, groups in which members practice group member metacognitive skills will advance faster than groups with cultures of individualization. Expert groups can do increasingly more in less time. They differ from novices in these ways:

- Have more practical knowledge of the social, political, and systems context in which their work occurs.
- Plan, monitor, and revise their approach to problems more effectively.
- Spend more time trying to understand a problem before generating solutions and are more likely to monitor their solution attempts.
- Are more likely to be reflective and continuously learn through experience.
- Do better at distinguishing relevant data from nonrelevant data in problem solving.

**Attrition Does Not Have to Block Development**

With intention and attention it is possible to minimize and overcome the disruptive effects of attrition on group dynamics. Groups that emphasize developing group-member capabilities and norms of collaboration informally provide induction experiences for new members (see chapter 4). We work with many international schools. In these settings staff turnover is high and frequent. Yet, in teams that regularly apply collaborative norms and meeting standards as a matter of course, new members quickly adopt the behaviors of their new school.

**Variables Affect Performance and Performance Capacity**

“Soft” variables, such as morale, work culture, and trust not only influence the performance of a group but also influence the group’s ability to learn from its experience (Hennessy, 1998). As we shall see in the next chapter also, the collective energies of efficacy, interdependence, consciousness, craftsmanship, and flexibility affect a group’s performance. In data-driven climates, it may appear that only student-related metrics such as test scores and graduation rates have value in guiding important efforts. Not so, say a number of organizational developers in the private sector, sociology, and education (Harner, 2015). Variables like trust are being measured (exemplified in the Chicago school research, such as Bryk and Schneider, 2002), work climate, and teacher efficacy contribute to understanding and improvement.

**Learning Organizes Itself in Unique Domains**

Learning occurs through different processes, some centering in the neocortex, others at the limbic system, some a combination of both. Depending on the model one adopts (all models are incomplete) you would say that it is nested in hierarchical levels of environment, behaviors, capabilities, beliefs, identity, and mission. For two decades we have applied concepts from this model with success. A

**Six Domains of Developing Groups**  
**CHAPTER 9**

[newer model (Garmston in Costa et al., 2015), described in the next chapter, regards these domains as interactive within a complex system, in which, as we have explored, everything affects everything else and tiny events cause major disturbances. The greatest benefits of group development efforts come from strategically intervening in the different domains.]

**Metacognition and Style Diversity Accelerate Learning**  
Groups that reflect about their experiences develop the executive consciousness necessary to self-organize and manage the processes used to do their work. In other words they take time to learn about themselves and how they do their work. When diversity in cognitive style exists in groups, such learning is accelerated. Teams that manage the style tensions between experiencing, reflecting, thinking, and acting achieve the greatest growth and greatest accomplishments. Knowledge of the six domains of group development, below, is particularly useful for such groups (Kolb and Kolb, 2009).

**Maturity Manifests in Six Domains of Group Development**  
Group maturity manifests in the ways that a group manages its day-to-day work in order to deal with its external environment. How well it performs in six interacting domains determines the group’s achievement. Each field is informed by the application of domain-specific knowledge, skills, and structures as well as unique combinations of efficacy, flexibility, craftsmanship, consciousness, and interdependence. Each of the chapters in this book highlights the resources for developing these domains. Readers may wish to turn to the end of the chapter now for a description of each field and a diagnostic instrument.

**The Six Fields of Group Development**

The six domains of group development are (1) getting work done; (2) doing the right work; (3) working collaboratively; (4) managing systems; (5) developing the group; and (6) adapting to change.

All groups struggle to achieve a successful balance between managing and adapting to external relationships and maintaining harmonious and effective internal relationships (Schein, 2004). In each dimension, the issues of task accomplishment and process skills development compete for attention. Although it is useful for groups to realize this macroview of their work, it is difficult to assess and intervene with group development at this level. To effectively build strong groups capable of maintaining their own identity and adapting to external environments, groups must be able to function skillfully within each of the six fields. Knowing the knowledge bases, skills, and structures of each is an essential first step. Knowing the assumptions held by the group about each of these theaters of operation reveals the mental models and drivers of group choices.

Before reading this section, think about a group with which you work, and ask yourself the following:

1. What are our strengths as a group?
2. What difficulties do we encounter as we work?
3. How ready are we to take on increasingly complex or emotionally charged tasks?
4. What are some potential growth areas for us as a group?

**THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL**

prevailing mental model in this domain is that the group assumes that its work is manageable. Essential knowledge includes mastering dialogue and discussion (chapter 5), conducting successful meetings (chapter 6), designing efficient and effective meetings (chapter 7), using facilitation skills (chapter 8), and facilitating data teams (chapter 11).

**Doing the Right Work**
Leaders and groups plan work to realize their vision, values, and emerging goals (chapter 2). The organizing presupposition of this domain in that vision, values, and goal clarity focus group energy as well as when and how to talk about each (chapter 5). The necessary knowledge includes understanding adaptivity (chapter 2), facilitating data teams (chapter 11), living effectively with conflict (chapter 12), developing the capacities for change and adaptivity (chapter 13), and creating community (chapter 14).

**Working Collaboratively**
Leaders and groups work to create and maintain an effective environment for collaboration and interdependence. The dominant presupposition in this domain is that diversity is a necessary resource and that subcultures must connect with and value one another. The knowledge that is necessary to effectively work collaboratively and interdependently includes focusing on both things and energy (chapter 2), the four group-member capabilities and the seven norms of collaboration (see chapter 4), the mastery of dialogue and discussion (chapter 5), successful meeting management (chapter 6), time efficient meeting (chapter 7), facilitation skills (chapter 9), facilitating data teams (chapter 11), and the ability to work effectively with conflict (chapter 12).

**Managing Systems**
Groups develop new ways of looking at the world. An organizing presupposition here is that as systems become more complex, the ability to think systematically and know when to set aside linear logic is important. Critical knowledge includes understanding dynamical systems (chapter 2), working effectively with conflict (see chapter 12), developing the capacities for change and adaptivity (see chapters 1, 2, and 10), and creating community (see chapter 14).

**Developing the Group**
Whatever the degree of accomplishment, groups can become better at their work. Individuals and groups need to develop resources for generating ideas and adapting to change. An important presupposition in this domain is that both individual and group orientations are necessary to produce innovations and implement them. The necessary knowledge includes information about two ways of talking (chapter 6), norms of collaboration (chapter 5), about group development (as described in this chapter), the ability to work effectively with conflict (see chapter 12), the importance of professional community (see chapter 4), and the principles of creating that community (see chapter 14).

**Adapting to Change**
An effective group relates to multiple communities that are external to the group. The agendas and resulting demands of these communities are often in flux and inconsistent with one another. The prevailing presupposition within this domain is that for groups to function effectively, they must constantly adapt to external environments. The more turbulent the environment, the more the energy must be focused outward. Critical knowledge includes recognizing schools as complex systems (chapter 2), asking three focusing questions (chapter 2), working with conflict (see chapter 12), developing the capacities for change and adaptivity (see chapter 10), and creating community (see chapter 14).

**Text Below the Table:**

*Assessing the Six Fields*

The six domains are inextricably intertwined; woven together, they make a whole. The knowledge for one domain is also necessary in another. As in all dynamic systems, what affects one variable affects the others. Because of this interactive nature, an assessment instrument that seeks detail about either the “things” or “the energy” in each domain would contain redundancies. Mastery of discussion and dialogue, for example, are requirements in the first and third domains. To be effective at dialogue, individuals must internalize the group-member capabilities and the norms of collaboration; these elements are also a prerequisite for managing conflict in the fourth, fifth, and sixth domains. To maximize discussion effectiveness, successful meeting skills are required, which is a focus in the first and third domains.

In contrast to the energies involved in assessing “hard data,” the energies in system dynamics have traditionally been harder to measure, more prone to measurement error, and therefore less relied upon as a data source for group development. Nevertheless, “the importance of measurement error diminishes when the investigative focus shifts from concern over the system’s current state to understanding the system’s behavior over time, which is often the purpose of a systems dynamics model” (Hennessy, 1998, pp. 6–7). Measurement-error importance also declines when data are used to promote conversations about how a group might strengthen itself rather than being used for external evaluation.

We have found that a simple rating scale such as the following is useful for group self-assessment: 1 = Beginning; 2 = Emerg-

ing; 3 = Developing; 4 = Integrating; and 5 = Innovating.

Organize a faculty group into subgroups of three or four members each. Have them discuss each domain using the descriptions above. Have them rate their group by loose consensus on each domain, using this scale. Suggest that a way of calibrating their place on the scale might be to locate, in general, where the group functions along a continuum of unconscious incompetence (they don’t know they don’t know) to unconscious competence (performing with effortlessness). Rate the major knowledge areas in each domain as follows:

---

**Table:**

| Beginning   | Unconscious incompetence: We don’t know what we don’t know. |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Emerging    | Unconscious incompetence to conscious competence: We are discovering areas in which we want to learn. |
| Developing  | Conscious competence: We are applying skills but with much effort, requiring more attention to how we are using a skill than to the results we are getting and possible needs for modifying our approach. |
| Integrating | Conscious competence to unconscious competence: We are beginning to be able to focus on results and the skill we are employing. |
| Innovating  | Unconscious competence: Our skills are so internalized we can put our full attention on the relationship and the results we are getting, allowing us to effortlessly modify our approach if necessary. |
| Adapting    | Reflective competence: Having gained unconscious competence, we routinely reflect, learn from, and modify future interactions. |

---

Now have the subgroups report their assessments to the entire group. Search for agreement among subgroups and set those aside. Locate areas of disagreement and seek to understand the differences in perception. Come to an accommodation in ratings. From this analysis, have the group select a domain for further study and development (figure 9.2).

### Content Description

#### Title and Section Heading
- The main section heading is: **A Systems Approach for Developing Groups**

#### Main Text
The text discusses the concept of developing groups using a systems approach. It draws an analogy to birds lifting off from far reaches and flocking together, suggesting that ideas for group development come from various sources. The literature on organizational development and school change is referenced, emphasizing the importance of socialization and workplace culture in shaping teacher work and learning.

The text cites several sources:
- Hargreaves and Fullan, 2012
- Newmann and Wehlage, 1995
- Rosenholtz, 1991
- Dilts, 1996
- Costa and Garmston, 2016

It discusses models from anthropology, cybernetics, psychology, and organizational science, focusing on nested levels of learning and the dominance of identity in organizing learning domains.

The following chapter is said to focus on group identity as a catalytic and changeable entity that can dramatically affect group performance. Organizational identity is described as fluid and adaptive, with instability seen as an asset for change (Gioia, Schulz, Corley, 2000).

Four essential questions for organizational identity are listed:
1. Who are we?
2. What do we take to be central to our work?
3. What do we believe makes our group distinct from the perceptions of other groups?
4. What is perceived by us to be an enduring quality of our organization?

Five collective energy sources are mentioned as potential intervention points:
- Efficacy
- Flexibility
- Craftsmanship
- Consciousness
- Interdependence

The text also references newer sciences (quantum physics, cognitive anthropology, complexity theory, fractals) and their influence on views of organizing.

#### Quotation
A block quote from Margaret Wheatley and Myron Kellner-Rogers (1996) is included:

> Identity, then, is another essential condition for organization. It is the self of the system that compels it toward particular actions and behaviors. . . . Organizational structures emerge in response to these imperatives of identity. Identity is at the core of every organization, fueling its creation. (pp. 85–86)

---

**Summary:**  
This page provides a detailed discussion of how group and organizational identity, viewed through a systems approach, is central to group development and performance. It integrates perspectives from multiple disciplines and emphasizes the dynamic, adaptive nature of identity in organizations.

**Chapter 10**  Developing Groups for Sustainable Change

Don’t fix it until it shows. Disappointing test scores, airline arrival records, or accidents due to improper seat belt use spur policymakers to action.

Action too often involves applying fixes to surface events to stimulate changes in the data. Such approaches rarely do much but modify data points, and fail to address the root problems that led to the undesirable results. Also, it is rare that such changes are sustainable. The American saying, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” in practice is really, “If it doesn’t show, don’t fix it.”

Efforts at change often focus more on things than energy. Modifying schedules, making curriculum changes, and adding new instructional materials lead the list. While energy, too, is addressed, it may be in the form of inservice training programs directed at teachers who are seen as workers needing to be told what and how to teach rather than professionals who make decisions about teaching and learning. Thankfully, we see an increase in professional development programs that treat teachers as professionals. These long-term approaches focus on creating collaborative work cultures with attention to follow-up, practice, and coaching.

This chapter examines group development through the lenses of intervening not at the surface practices of groups, but rather at their source. Policymakers, novice groups, and leaders of silo organizations value individuality over interdependence and analyze data in a vacuum. Experts seek patterns and look beneath the surface, seeking driving forces. Natural systems such as schools, departments, and family units cannot be directed, only disturbed. After decades of absence, the reintroduction of disturbances, like the meteorologist’s butterfly metaphor or the reintroduction of the grey wolf to Yellowstone National Park, affect everything else in their systems (Yellowstone Wolf Project, 2013). Maturana and Varela (1987) write, “Systems choose what to notice and how to pay attention.” Leaders disturb systems by bringing attention to what’s being overlooked.

In this chapter we explore a way of inquiring beneath visible behaviors and detectable patterns to search for potential sources of what groups do. Readers will find first, a description of an “iceberg” model (figure 10.1), second, a definition of terms in the lower parts of the model, and finally, ideas for intervening at sources of behaviors, rather than on what is seen and heard.

Later, we examine another model for influencing change below the surface, bringing forward a version of Robert Dilt’s conceptual treatment of nested levels of learning. Dilts organized his thinking in vertical form, like the deep to surface model, and positioned identity as the variable responsible for the greatest change in beliefs, values, and behaviors. We have modified this in keeping with our sense that humans, too, are complex dynamic systems and their developmental processes are subject to the same system principles described in chapter 2.

**The Adaptive School**

**Deep to Surface Structure**
Figure 10.1 has its genesis in the work of Noam Chomsky. In the 1950s Chomsky created a transformational linguistics model that was later elaborated on for work in therapy (Bandler and Grinder, 1975). Since then, applications of this “iceberg” model have been developed in such diverse fields as cognitive-behavioral therapy and architecture. In the 1990s, Costa and Garmston adapted it to their work in “Cognitive Coaching” (Garmston and Von Frank, 2012). It is broadly accepted that humans (and groups) act on internal maps, models, beliefs, and perceptions of the world, rather than what could be considered real. The iceberg figure illustrates how inquiries into the sources of surface behaviors reveal, and can stimulate, changes to core aspects of deep structure.

heard from groups and their members (words, behaviors, norms, policies) and the underlying factors that inform and shape them—the deep structure elements of beliefs, values, identity, and mental models. Below that, reference structure refers to emotionally laden events—like a tornado-ravaged school, or a teacher strike. In this model, anything in surface structure could theoretically be traced to origins below.

By shining the light of consciousness on essential inner structures, skillful leaders help groups identify the underlying mental models that might be limiting perspectives and possibilities. When facilitators or group members pose questions like *“Who are we?” “Why are we doing this?” or “Why are we doing it this way?”* as described in chapter 2, mental models held in deep structure are revealed. Additionally, the practice of dialogue and certain facilitation strategies can illuminate mental models, identities, beliefs, and values. Groups may pose questions to themselves referencing manifestations of the five energy sources:

- “What is it we do not know, that if knowing it, would increase our chances of success?”
- “What might need to happen for us to increase our collective consciousness?”
- “What appear to be our assumptions about this matter?”
- “Whose thinking has not yet been tapped?”
- “What ideas might help us stay the course even through frustration and ambiguity?”

Some groups get stuck in limiting beliefs such as “The administration is unresponsive to our needs,” “These kids can’t learn because of their home environments,” or “We value our autonomy and don’t need to coordinate our efforts with others.” Leaders who listen below the surface, pausing, paraphrasing, posing questions, and presuming positive intentions, structure dialogues that permit group members to inquire about their own assumptions, beliefs, and values. These dialogues explore driving behaviors and choices appearing in the surface structure. One cannot influence what is invisible.

**Reference Structure Content**

The word “reference” is derived from the Latin *referre*, “to carry back.” It means to link back, and in the iceberg model denotes that this is the source for what lies above. The reference structure houses emotionally vivid experiences. A divisive teacher strike and its aftermath affect emotional responses for many years—long after the school board members and the administrative teams have left or retired. Other reference structures might include the closing of a cherished program or school, feelings of betrayal related to continuing misunderstandings in decision making, or a sudden influx of a different type of student. Individuals also carry reference structures that inform meaning making. Some of these storage and interpretive processes begin before speech develops. The reference structure informs collective mental models, beliefs, values, and identities. Of course individual reference structures also exist, making leadership messy enough to be interesting.

**Deep Structure Content**

It is here that the “rules” for how the world works or is supposed to work are encoded. Some of these meanings are held consciously, and some are outside conscious awareness, yet all inform and direct choices and behaviors. Responses to change initiatives, problem-solving models, and the criteria for effective solutions are all rooted in the deep structure of the group.

The actual workings and influences of the deep-structure elements are not always apparent to group members. Like an iceberg, seven-eighths of which lies hidden below water, special tools are necessary to illuminate and mediate what is there. Remarkably, the simple paraphrase is such a tool, and all forms of in-

The image is a page from a book or academic text titled "Developing Groups for Sustainable Change," specifically Chapter 10. The page number is 137.

The content is divided into several sections with headings and subheadings:

---

**Efficacy**

- Discusses perceived collective efficacy, particularly in the context of teachers and educational teams.
- Defines efficacy as the belief that a group can organize and execute actions to positively affect students.
- Cites Goddard, Hoy, and Woolfolk-Hoy (2004), who found that high collective efficacy among group members is crucial for student success and overcoming obstacles.
- Decision-making participation strengthens teachers' beliefs in their peers, commitment to goals, and student achievement.
- RAND change-agent study (McLaughlin, 1990) found staff collective efficacy to be the most consistent variable for school success.
- Bandura (1986, 1997) identifies three sources of efficacy-shaping information:
  1. Accomplishments attributed to group decisions, skills, and hard work.
  2. Vicarious experiences.
  3. Social persuasion.
- Efficacy is described as catalytic for resolving complex problems. Groups with high efficacy are more energetic, set challenging goals, persevere, and learn from experiences.
- Reference: Goddard, Hoy, and Woolfolk-Hoy, 2004.

**Flexibility**

> Efficacy
>
> Perceived collective efficacy refers to the judgment of teachers in a team that the group as a whole can organize and execute the courses of action required to have a positive effect on students. The choices groups make are influenced by the strength of their efficacy beliefs. Goddard, Hoy, and Woolfolk-Hoy (2004) find that to have a high degree of collective efficacy group members must believe that they and others, individually and together, are capable of producing increased student success and of overcoming obstacles to that goal. Participating in decision-making contributes strongly to teachers’ beliefs in the capabilities of their peers, fosters commitment to school goals, and promotes gains in student achievement. The RAND change-agent study (McLaughlin, 1990) found a staff’s collective efficacy to be the most consistent variable related to school success. Bandura (1986, 1997) proposes three sources of efficacy-shaping information relevant to groups: accomplishments in which the group attributes its achievements to its own decisions, skills, and hard work, rather than fate or luck; vicarious experiences; and social persuasion.

> Efficacy is particularly catalytic because it is a determining factor in the resolution of complex problems. If groups feel little efficacy, blame, withdrawal, and rigidity are likely to follow. Teams with robust efficacy, however, are likely to expend more energy in their work, persevere longer, set more challenging goals, and continue in the face of failure. Efficacious groups regard events as opportunities for learning, are motivated by and committed to achieving shared goals, learn from experiences, focus resources where they will make the greatest difference, know what they know and do not know, and develop strategies to learn what is needed (Goddard, Hoy, and Woolfolk-Hoy, 2004).

> Flexibility
>
> As groups develop cognitively, they value and more consistently view situations from multiple perspectives. Piaget called this overcoming egocentrism. Cultivating group member flexibility helps them to see others as more than their roles and not be trapped by constantly checking for agreement with personal views. In this way they form broader perspectives by seeing themselves and others as players in a larger drama in which they all simultaneously play central and secondary parts.

> The peak performers Garfield (1986) studied displayed an ability for flexible attention that he called microattention and macroattention. Microattention involves logical analytical computation and seeing cause and effect in methodical steps. It is important in problem analysis or curriculum planning. It encompasses attention to detail, precision, and orderly progressions. Macroattention is useful for discerning themes and patterns from an assortment of information. It is intuitive, holistic, and conceptual. Macrothinking is good for bridging gaps, and it enables one to perceive a pattern even when some of the pieces are missing.

**ways of thinking, can collectively shift perspective, and utilize a wide array of thinking and process skills. Such groups can also navigate the internal tensions of confusion and ambiguity and become unstuck by generating multiple actions for moving ahead.**

**Flexibility is a prerequisite to demonstrating respect for diverse perspectives. Flexible teachers are empathetic. Flexible groups listen with their ears, eyes, heart, and mind. They are cognitively empathetic with students, which enables them to predict misunderstandings and anticipate the most useful learning experiences. Flexibility, like efficacy, is related to risk taking. Creative groups live close to the edge, pushing frontiers, generating new knowledge, experimenting with new ways, and constantly growing into new abilities.**

**Craftsmanship**
Data from the League of Professional Schools (Glickman, 1991) found that in schools where teachers are the most successful, they have the highest dissatisfaction with the results of their work. Success, for craftsmanlike groups, produces self-imposed higher standards in an ongoing cycle of improvement. In a study using cognitive coaching with university professors, Garmston and Hyerle (1988) found that as craftsmanship increased, the professors grew in their ability to be critically self-reflective and effective in producing self-analysis and evaluation.

To appreciate this energy source, consider the mindset of expert performers such as musicians, artists, teachers, craftspeople, race car pit crews, and athletic teams. They take pride in their work and consistently strive to improve current performance. Craftsmanship—the drive for elaboration, clarity, refinement, and precision—is the energy source from groups who ceaselessly learn and deepen their knowledge, skills, and effectiveness. Groups that access this resource invest energy in honing and inventing better ways to do their work, honor in themselves and others the arduous journey from novice to expert, manage time effectively, and continually improve inter- and intra-group communications. They create, hold, calibrate, and refine performance and product standards for their work.

**Interdependence**
Interdependence is a recognition of the interconnections among individuals, other groups, the school, district, the community and all aspects of cultures in their setting. Interdependence is a key value in communities of practice; groups that share a common interest and meet to extend their learning together to refine their crafts. Teams that have grown in interdependence manage individual differences and trust the group enough to voice dissimilarities (Kolb and Kolb 2009). Sergiovanni (1994) tells us that the German sociologist Ferdinand Tonnies called this way of being gemeinschaft. Gemeinschaft is a community of mental life. Gemeinschaft contrasts with gesellschaft, in which community values have been replaced by contractual ones. The more policies a group has, the less the sense of community. This is the case in most modern organizations. Interdependent peoples’ sense of self is enlarged from a conception of me to a sense of us. They understand that individuality is not lost as they connect with the group; only egocentricity is.

Interdependent groups value and trust the process of dialogue, have an awareness of their multiple relationships and identities with other groups, and regard disagreement as a source of learning and transformation. They regard knowledge as fluid, provisional, and subject to new interpretation with additional experience. Perhaps most important, interdependent groups see the group not just as it is but also for its potential.

offer few cues as to the sources of actions. Language is used to describe behaviors, and the paraphrase is supremely qualified as the first move in intervention. First, it is not as intrusive as an initial question might be, it generates elaboration and clarification, and is a natural bridge to futher understanding through questions. One cannot intervene with the invisible. Opening a window to deep structure content permits even further understanding and mediation.

Kegan and Lahey (2001) propose that work settings are language communities and that group leaders are leading language communities: “[Al]though every person, in any setting, has some opportunity to influence the nature of language, leaders have exponentially greater access and opportunity to shape, alter, or ratify the existing language rules” (p. 8). By attending to the verbal and nonverbal communication cues of group members, skilled group leaders frame their own communication patterns to positively influence the perceptions, choices, and decisions of their groups.

**Deep Structure Content**

Mostly unarticulated in deep structure are five influential entities: identity, beliefs, values, mental models, and energy sources. Others, too, reside there and will be described later.

*Identity.* This is a group’s sense of itself; it is related to beliefs and values. Albert and Whetten (1985) characterized organizational identity as a self-reflective question: Who are we as an organization? They concluded that organizational identity could be summarized in three major dimensions: (a) what is taken by the organization to be central to its work; (b) what insiders believe makes the organization distinct from other organizations; and (c) what is perceived by members to be an enduring quality of the organization.

Melucci (1995) describes collective identity as a shared definition generated by a number of individuals. This collective perception shapes communication models and interactions with outside groups. More recently Polletta and Jasper (2001) defined collective identity as the cognitive, moral, and emotional connections individuals have with the practices of a broader community or institution.

Groups interpret experiences and choose behaviors that are intended to maintain the continuity of self-generated self-concepts over time. Self-concepts are also maintained by comparisons with others. Groups seek positive differences between themselves and other groups as a way of enhancing their own self-esteem. Like individuals, they see themselves as distinct and act as if they are unique.

*Beliefs.* Beliefs are what a group is emotionally invested in based on assumptions and convictions regarding people, concepts, or things. Groups that believe they are effective (efficacy) act that way and actually are. Groups that feel powerless to influence decisions within the school act that way. Behaviors driven by beliefs reinforce beliefs which reinforce behaviors in an endless cycle. School communities who share a sense of collective efficacy provide students with instructional experiences that contribute to higher learning than school groups who do not share this belief. They are more effective and likely to be more effective (Hoy, Tarter, and Woolfolk-Hoy, 2006).

*Values.* Values are about right and wrong, professional or unprofessional, good or bad and most often have a strong emotional component. “We are all in this together,” “Cultural differences are to be valued,” or “Critical thinking is the most essential disposition for students,” are examples of values. They are often grounded in universal “truths” like dignity, compassion, or independence.

*Mental Models.* Mental models can be conceived as “small-scale models” of reality used to explain how things work, anticipate events, and to reason. Mental models are generally founded on unquantifiable, obscure, or incomplete facts. As a result, all mental models are incomplete; they contain distortions, deletions, and generalizations. They serve as perception filters, interpreting the behavior of all people to “see” what they want to. People

make decisions based on their mental models, not on objective reality.

**Intervening at Deep Structures**
All linguistic expressions are incomplete from their total meaning. “Atyaf is a bright student” is incomplete in many ways. The word *bright* is undefined. Also undefined is *student*. “Is,” might also bear elaboration as Mr. Clinton once observed. The speaker, often below conscious levels, has elaborate and detailed models for what is meant by the five words in the sentence. It is only in deep listening that the speaker can articulate meanings, beliefs, or values internally held. The greater the simplicity of a mental model, the less it represents things as they actually are. To become more effective, groups must refine and add the unstated complexity.

Resources for making explicit deep structure content largely rely on the skill sets related to the seven norms of collaboration. These are employed in dialogue posed around penetrating questions—“What might be some evidence we are growing in collective efficacy?”—and strategies like “Card Sort” and “Shuffle” or “First Turn Last Turn” found under the discourse heading in appendix A.

**Identity Interventions**
Identity is not fixed, but rather it is a moving target according to neuroscientist Damasio (2010). Group development approaches that refine collective identity include constructing metaphors that expand senses of identity, and questions designed to stimulate reflection at this level (“In what ways are we a teaching school and in what ways a learning school?”), and meeting practices that shift the spotlight from group members as information receivers to group members as constructors of meaning.

**Beliefs and Values Interventions**
Ask groups to compare their espoused behavior to acted behaviors. They gain clarity and sharpen practice to more clearly align with their values. Conduct a dialogue on group values, then make a criteria matrix with group values on one side and program choices on the other. Conduct the “Assumptions Wall” strategy described in appendix A. In this activity, group members nonjudgmentally illuminate and examine their assumptions about sources, rationale, values, and consequences. This develops a greater understanding of the presenting issue and of one another. Another way to challenge mental models is to hold a values challenge seminar. Best done in a retreat setting, this is a conversation in which the group’s core values are identified and then tested against a variety of increasingly complex scenarios. Other options are the” Card Sort and Shuffle” strategy, “In and Out of the Frame,” “Issues Agenda,” and “Causal-Loop Diagram” (see appendix A).

**Capabilities Interventions**
Capabilities are not described in the iceberg model, but inferred in mental models, and are the metacognitive activities related to behaviors. *To know one’s intention and choose congruent behaviors* is an example of a capability. Engage members in a study of the four group-member capabilities from chapter 4. To start, invite conscious application of one capability at a time with periodic reflection and reports.

**Improving Collective Effectiveness**
Groups cannot improve behaviors of which they are unaware. In this section we offer several lenses and approaches for helping group members to see themselves as a group. Group development is a responsibility shared with each group member. Ultimately it is the group’s group, and leaders support groups in owning the intentions and processes of improvement.

At least five intervention strategies can be used to illuminate and enhance the five energy sources: mediating, structuring, teaching, modeling, and monitoring.

**Mediating**
- Discusses the process of mediating energy sources within groups to foster improvement and self-directed learning.
- Mediation is described as shining a judgment-free "flashlight" on internal or external data.
- Invitational questions may be the entry point, but mediation also involves collaboration norms.
- Mediation often relates to reflecting on experiences, planning, or problem-solving.
- Costa and Garmston (2015) are referenced for detailed coaching maps.
- Figure 10.2 is mentioned as describing effective group behaviors for each energy source.
- Example questions for group members (grouped by themes):

  - *Efficacy*: 
    - "How might we focus our resources to make the biggest difference?"
    - "When are some times when our perseverance led to great success?"
  - *Consciousness*: 
    - "Who are we?"
    - "Why are we doing this?"
  - *Flexibility*: 
    - "How might we incorporate some of the diverse ideas on the table?"
    - "What other perspectives might we take on this?"
  - *Craftsmanship*: 
    - "What parts of our values should inform our criteria for deciding X?"
    - "So the first draft is good. How can we make it better?"
  - *Interdependence*: 
    - "Who might be some of our allies on this topic?"
    - "What could we be doing to align our energies with team 6?"

---

**Structuring**
- Focuses on managing the physical environment, agenda, tasks, and participant grouping to promote learning.
- Modifying the environment can extend capacities, perspectives, and behaviors.
- Examples include:
  - Arranging the room so members focus on a chart, not each other, during problem-solving (promotes flexibility and interdependence).
  - Using the Learning Partners strategy to break up cliques (flexibility and interdependence).
  - Using role diversity for forming subgroups, e.g., placing a parent in each teacher cluster (contributes to flexibility, interdependence, and efficacy).
  - Organizing the agenda so subgroups work on specific tasks (craftsmanship, efficacy).

---

**Teaching**
- Teaching is best for behaviors and capabilities.
- When combined with mediated experiences, teaching can influence belief systems and identity.
- Includes the full range of instructional methods: assessing, explaining, giving examples, scaffolding, practicing, reading, etc.

THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL

Self-assessments provide a starting point for an adult learning experience. This notion is very much in line with the growing literature on the influence of formative assessments as guides to student learning (Stiggins, 2007). To focus on specific energy sources, group developers might share descriptions of the five energy sources and ask group members to share their impressions of which ones are strength areas and which ones are stretch areas for this group. These impressions are starting points for planning group growth goals.

A group inventory has been developed by our colleagues Carolee Hayes and Jane Ellison. (See www.thinkingcollaborative.com/tc-apps/.)

**Modeling**

Leaders and group members practice modeling when they display exemplars of specific skills (like paraphrasing) or complexes of skills (like balancing inquiry and advocacy) in work settings with colleagues. Two refinements add to the potency of modeling as a learning device. First is to talk out loud about one’s rationale in order to have metacognition about the particular behavior being modeled. Second is to practice public modeling, in which for example you announce to a group that in today’s meeting you are going to work on improving your use of pausing. Reveal your reasons and ask the group members to be prepared to share their perceptions on the effectiveness of your application of the behavior.

**Monitoring**

Monitoring involves collecting data on a dynamic of interest to the group and reflecting on how this informs the group of its working patterns and how the group might improve its effectiveness. A critical mindset is that the group is gathering and examining data to improve, not prove or judge, a level of performance. Groups may gather information on their use of the norms of collaboration, the degree of congruence with meeting standards, an assessment of the operating energy sources, the inclusion of members, the value placed on diverse perspectives, and other subjects that interest them.

We have learned that the use of a process observer, a member who gathers data on participant behaviors while the group is working, might generate more negative effects than positive ones. A pattern of externally provided data will often lead a group toward a greater dependence on outside assessment, reduce the capacity for accurate self-assessment, and diminish the capacity for self-directed learning. Work with both students and adults has confirmed this (Sanford, 1995). Observers can effectively support learning when they follow a pattern in which the data are displayed without interpretation and the group is invited to interpret it.

A strategy that employs both monitoring and mediation involves asking two questions of group members for their private reflection: “What are some of the decisions you made about when and how to participate in the preceding conversation?” and “What are some of the influences of your decisions on yourself and others?” “How did your decisions influence yourselves and others?” After silent reflection, the members might write a response, share and interact with a neighbor, or practice a full round-robin reflection.

Expert groups are more likely than novice groups to be reflective. The more reflection, the greater the learning from experience. Non-reflection dooms a group to repeat the same behaviors over and over, regardless of whether they are producing desired results.

Every working group has far more task than time. This contributes to a natural reluctance to use any precious time to monitor or reflect on the group’s working processes. Some groups resolve this tension by committing themselves to a task-process ratio. They budget a certain portion of each meeting to their own learning, exploring how well the group is working and what it might do to improve.

**Description:**
The image is a page from a book titled "Developing Groups for Sustainable Change," specifically Chapter 10. The page number is 143. The section is titled "A Second Intervention Model" and discusses systems thinking, identity, and learning models, referencing the work of Gregory Bateson and Robert Dilts. The text is organized into paragraphs and a numbered list.

**A Second Intervention Model**

In a quantum world, everything influences everything else. Anthropologist and cyberneticist Gregory Bateson was fond of saying that all beings exist within holonomous systems. That is, each person is part of several greater systems (e.g., families, teams, schools) yet maintains a unique identity and palette of choices, both as an independent agent and as the member of a group. Each system influences the individual, and, to a lesser degree, the individual influences the system. Based on work by Bateson and conceived by Robert Dilts (1994, 1996), this model shows identity as influencing all other aspects of learning. Dilts describes four operating principles in this model:

1. Any system (of activity) is a subsystem embedded inside another system. Each system is also embedded in an even larger system.
2. Learning occurs in each subsystem in a manner specifically related to that subsystem.
3. Learning at each level organizes and controls the information on levels below.
4. Learning something on an upper level will change things on lower levels, but learning something on a lower level might or might not influence the levels above it.

Dilts borrowed the “levels” metaphor from Bateson’s work on learning to learn and assumed learning as cascading from one level to the ones below. He identified the levels as follows: identity; beliefs and values, capabilities; behaviors; and environment. We have applied this model to our work with groups for over a decade and found great value in using it as an intervention model, not only with groups but with individuals. Today our agreement with Dilts is that identity influences all the other elements. However, based on our continuing learning about complex systems, our examination of Bateson’s work, and critiques of the Dilts model we are replacing the “levels” metaphor in our thinking with something more congruent with our knowledge of complex systems and holons, referring to the Dilts’ levels, instead, as domains (Armour 2015; Tosey 2006; and Dilts 1994, 2003, 2014).

In Garmston’s view (figure 2.3) of the elements of learning, we see the elements as dynamical in which everything affects everything else. Yet there are two dominant players within this system. Identity, we believe, is the major influence on all the elements within the system, informing beliefs, values, capabilities, and behavior. Next, environment can modify the *expressions* of identity. To show this idea, we have placed environment as the surround and note that one’s environment has a modifying effect on the expression of beliefs, values, capabilities, and behaviors. Changing the environment—say, from one in which mediation is a primary leadership activity to one in which command and control is more common—modifies not only behaviors but also the potential for learning. (Costa and Garmston, 2015)

Our thinking is influenced by Arthur Koestler’s (1972) introduction of holons. A holon is a system in which everything is at the same time a part of something else and a whole in and of itself. In this view a school is a whole and simultaneously part of a district. The district also is part of a larger system. Wilber (2001) extended this idea by introducing the concept of “holoriches,” which are hierarchies of holons.

Dilts held that the levels are embedded in one another and called them nested levels of learning. In his view each level is more abstract than the next and has a greater degree of impact on the individual or group. We agree with Dilts that identity is the most influential of all the domains in this model.

*From the psychological point of view there seem to be five levels that you work with most often. (1) The basic domain is your environment, your external constraints. (2) You operate on that environment through*

> In our current practices, we are finding it useful to regard Dilts’s model not as a hierarchical, linear map that assumes clocklike operation in which the same inputs will consistently produce the same result. Rather, we are seeing it as describing a complex system made of many moving parts operating within environmental systems that are constantly changing. Complex systems are those in which everything affects everything else, tiny inputs cause major disturbances, more data are not a greater predictor of results, and both things and energy matter.

> Two factors in figure 10.3 have the greatest influence on group development: identity and environment. Identity, as in the Dilts model, influences all elements within a system except environment. Equally important, environment can modify the expressions of identity. We have witnessed work cultures transitioning from authoritarian structures to collaborative settings modifying not only behaviors, but also potentials for learning.
>
> Collective shifts in identity, we believe, primarily occur through experiences rich enough to rattle mental models if opportunities are provided for extensive reflection. A community coming together to support one another in response to a tragedy comes to mind. Disruptive events like labor conflicts can also create profound identity shifts for several parts of a school community. More hopefully, processes that challenge or examine assumptions, beliefs, or values—processes similar to the two-hour identity intervention described on page 146—can also be effective.

Keep in mind that these elements interact with one another and additional elements in complex systems.

Adults were uncertain how to communicate with staff, with some waiting behind the counter to interact while others walked around it. In addition, students were required to record tardiness on a sheet that resided on this high counter. Approaching it with the staff on the other side, left students feeling scolded.

of School’s cabinet in a small room with lots of wall space on which to write. Here is the process we used.

1. Individuals listed myths people have about their group; this is the container in which they work and in some ways contributes to the identity they work from.
2. Pairs worked on four flip charts about their responsibilities, purposes, culture, and resources.
3. The full group made refinements and achieved agreement.
4. The group was asked, “Given all this, who are you?” and a list of ideas was brainstormed, then summarized into one tight statement.
5. The group was asked, “What needs to happen next?” Following the admonition in chapter 8, we asked who will do what by when and four specific action steps were identified. The group’s identity was reshaped into that of a proactive leadership team.

**Beliefs/Values**
The “Card Stack and Shuffle” and “Assumptions Wall” strategies in appendix A both require participants to examine beliefs and assumptions. Groups must articulate beliefs and values in order to examine them. These two strategies and asking groups to compare their espoused and actual beliefs take members into this territory.

**Capabilities**
Have members read about group member capabilities described in chapter 4. With others, ask them to identify which are most important and how they will remember to employ them. Periodically pose the self-reflective question, “What decisions did I make about how and when to participate in that conversation and what effect did those decisions have on me and others?”

**Behaviors**
Consistent with the Dilts model engaging persons in examining capabilities improves the related behaviors. The “What decisions did I make?” question above is one form. Another is to invite members to describe the mental processes involved in a behavior. Participants that identify metacognitive processes refine the behaviors driven by those processes.

**Environment**
William Isaacs (1999) tells a story of presenting to a group of Silicon Valley executives. After the presentation, instead of having a question and answer period, he suggested the twenty-five people put their chairs in a circle and say whatever thoughts or feelings were present at the time, a common activity in dialogue. The first few made some comments and then one man said this reminded him of a camping trip with his two sons when he was not sure how they were experiencing the event. From that point forward, each person told a story of heart and meaning. Educators too, influence behaviors and emotions through similar environmental changes. As another example, the third point strategy in appendix A directs disagreements to topics rather than persons. Most importantly, however is affecting the emotional environment by the form of leadership one employs.

The next chapter describes ways teams proactively seek and explore potential challenges to student learning.

**Chapter 11 Facilitating Data Teams**

**D**ata have no meaning. Meaning emerges from collective sense-making by well-structured and skillfully facilitated collaborative groups. Working with data to improve practices and student learning outcomes is a common expectation for grade-level teams, departments, Professional Learning Communities (PLCs), and school leadership teams. Yet, many groups struggle with this essential task. Relational tensions, feelings of vulnerability and the cognitive demands of collective analysis, problem finding, and action planning often overwhelm groups. Given these pressures many groups stumble toward the quick fix for the poorly defined dilemmas in front of them. Groups operating in this fashion lurch from problem to program, slapping remedial bandages on issues and concerns.

Thoughtfully applying many of the concepts, tools, and ideas that precede this chapter helps groups avoid the pitfalls mentioned above. Seeing the system that is producing learning gaps or behavioral issues (chapters 1, 2, and 9), developing group member capabilities, norms of collaboration, and two ways of talking (chapters 3 and 4), and conducting well-designed and skillfully facilitated meetings (chapters 5, 6, and 7) all contribute to better run and more satisfying data team work. In this chapter we will add specific protocols for structuring data-based collaborative inquiry along with tips and tools for facilitating these processes. Collective efficacy (chapter 10) increases when groups learn to manage their external and internal challenges as they come to trust the process and one another.

Districts, schools, and teams have to learn how to improve. This requires looking deeply at the systems that are producing any performance gaps that are of concern to staff and community members. Anthony Bryk and his colleagues (2015) offer three core improvement questions:

1. What specific problem are we trying to solve?
2. What changes might we introduce and why?
3. How will we know whether the changes are actually improvements?

Problem finding is an essential capacity for data teams. Two potential pathways guide teams in this endeavor. One is to start with an issue or concern expressed by some group or other member of the school community and frame this topic in wording that leads to purposeful data gathering. The other approach is to start with available data and query it for the stories they might tell. Both pathways are equally productive.

**Main body text:**

These occur when participants have conflicting mental maps of their worlds. These maps influence what we see, how we see, and how we interpret information in our environment. Since all data are subject to interpretation, the same information that engages some group members may be dismissed, diminished, or denied by others depending on their frames of reference.

Starting with an issue calls for careful framing. This requires skillful facilitation and thoughtful process design. Public recording (chapter 6) is a vital part of the process. There are three basic ways of framing an issue (Lipton and Wellman, 2012). These are (1) constructing a problem statement; (2) crafting an inquiry; and (3) generating a hypothesis. The context, group resourcefulness, and the nature of the specific issue at hand are some of the factors that influence the final choice of the problem frame. It is important that the facilitator avoid imposing his or her preferred frame on the group.

**Constructing a problem statement**

Constructing shared problem definitions is crucial to success. The patterns of both dialogue and discussion support groups in generating and honing thoughtful problem statements. Without these processes problem definitions can be challenging to develop. Completing the stem “The problem is ___________” seems deceptively simple on the surface, but in reality this requires precise thinking and attention to specificity in language. We’ve had the experience, on more than one occasion, of spending forty-five minutes to an hour helping groups sort through their perspectives and coalesce around a statement that all could agree to. This is time well spent since the problem statement greatly influences the data quest. There is a significant difference between “The problem is that many students are floundering when presented with nonfiction texts in the content areas.” And “The problem is that many of our students lack the technical reading skills for comprehending and analyzing nonfiction texts in the content areas.” The first problem statement leads the group to focusing on student performance in the content area. The second problem statement leads to an exploration of the specific skills that students need for grappling with the assigned texts and to the teaching repertoire teachers need to learn to develop these skills. It might also lead to an exploration of successful students and the ways in which they have acquired these essential reading skills.

**Section heading:**
Crafting an Inquiry

Framing concerns, anecdotes, and observations as inquiries opens thinking and widens the potential solution set. The trick here is to avoid either/or thinking and craft open-ended questions that have multiple appropriate answers. A variety of question-generating strategies might be used (see appendix A for examples). Some typical questions include: “What are some essential differences between . . . and . . . ?” “How are we doing with . . . ?” “What are some of the reasons for . . . ?” and “What are the most productive ways to . . . ?” In the reading example shared above, a driving question might be, “What are the essential reading skills that students need to successfully engage with content reading?”

**Section heading:**
Generating a Hypothesis

Anecdotes and observations often lead to proposals for solutions. In the worst cases, this develops into a competition between advocates causing group members to struggle with one another in unproductive conversations. Framing these proposed solutions as hypotheses opens pathways to problem solving. The very construction and labeling of these ideas as hypotheses often reduces tension in the group and invites group members to embrace a spirit of inquiry and discovery. Hypotheses typically follow an if/then format. In our example this might sound like, “If we directly taught reading comprehension and textual analysis skills in the content areas then more students would master the course material.”

**Facilitating Data Teams**  
**CHAPTER 11**

Many groups find that framing their issues with all three approaches is helpful. By crafting inquiries and generating hypotheses they frequently discover that they need to refine their problem statement. Also, offering a group three different ways of framing an issue offers choice that leads to greater ownership and deeper commitment to problem solving

**Starting with the Data**

Starting with the data requires a thoughtful survey of the hard and soft data available in the school (James-Ward et al., 2013). (See table 11.1 for examples of hard and soft data.) Hard data are data that are quantifiable and expressed in numbers and percentages. These data types lend themselves to statistical analysis. Soft data are qualitative and anecdotal resulting from surveys, questionnaires, and observations. The goal is to gather relevant information to triangulate the issues of concern. Once sufficient data have been gathered, groups search for patterns of both strengths and needs. This leads to developing theories of causation and when these are confirmed, clarified, or disconfirmed the group can then move on to crafting theories of action and action planning. The *Collaborative Learning Cycle* described next elaborates specific steps in this process.

Productive data-driven inquiry requires structure and attention to process. “Thoughtfully designed processes increase focus, minimize distractions, and deepen exploration and analysis of data” (Lipton and Wellman, 2012). Group members that lack process attention and process monitoring habits get lost in storytelling, side-talk, and jump quickly to selling solutions to one another.

The *Collaborative Learning Cycle* establishes a forum for collective exploration of data. By embracing a learning orientation within carefully applied protocols, group members engage in collaborative inquiry that leads to problem finding, problem-solving and focused planning for action.

Each phase of the *Collaborative Learning Cycle* is driven by questions that organize and direct specific cognitive processes. The first phase, “Activating and Engaging” surfaces prior experiences, background knowledge, and frames of reference for thinking about the issues at hand. The second phase, “Exploring and Discovering” structures the group’s inquiry into the data in a search for pop-outs and patterns that will then influence the search for deeper causations. The third phase, “Organizing and Integrating” is a two-stage process with an initial drafting of theories of causation and a search for confirming and clarifying data.

Facilitating Data Teams                                                                                   CHAPTER 11

When the group is confident it is on the right track they move to the final stage of drafting theories of action and identifying processes, plans, goals, and monitoring systems for moving ahead. Continuous improvement is a cyclical process so as new data emerge the group then applies the Collaborative Learning Cycle to this information.

**Phase 1: Activating and Engaging**

A central intention of the Collaborative Learning Cycle is to develop a stance of shared curiosity that avoids premature certainty and locking in on the first proposed course of action. This initial phase, Activating and Engaging, sets the scene for exploring the data without the data being present. It starts with dialogue about what group members predict that data will look like and a sharing of assumptions about why people think these predictions are likely. The norms of collaboration (chapter 4) are a vital resource during this phase. The goal is to establish conditions of low threat and full participation so that all group members feel free to contribute their thinking and ideas. When done well, this creates conditions of psychological safety for group members, especially if they are uncertain about the content, the data, or the group processes of inquiry. Psychological safety ultimately means that individuals feel safe enough not to know in the presence of their peers.

When the data to be explored will be presented as tables of graphs the facilitator offers blank copies of the graphic forms upon which to record predictions. These predictions are what people think the data will look like—specifically how high the bars on the graph will reach for specific standards or specific subgroups or what data they think will appear in the cells of the table. As predictions emerge, the facilitator pushes group members to name the assumptions that are informing these predictions. Working with the blank templates also orients group members to the actual data displays they will be working with during the next phase. At times, group members have similar predictions and different assumptions. At other times, group members have similar assumptions but varying predictions based on those same assumptions.

Individuals surface their frames of reference by articulating their predictions and assumptions. These interactions help group members to better understand the mental models that are guiding the teaching practices and instructional thinking of their colleagues.

Distinguishing between assumptions and predictions is difficult for some group members and it can take up to three experiences with the Collaborative Learning Cycle for participants to appreciate the value and importance of this phase. For example, a team member might say, “My prediction is that there will be a 40 percent difference on the writing assessment between the girls and the boys. This is driven by my assumption that the girls are better readers than the boys which shows in their writing.” Activating and Engaging provides the safety of dialogue to encourage participation in data tasks that might be intimidating for some group members. This phase fans the flame of curiosity so that group members want to look at the data and are ready to do so knowing in advance how their colleagues are thinking about the issues involved in a specific inquiry cycle.

*Facilitation Tips for Success*
- Listen for ways that group members are distinguishing between predictions and assumptions. Paraphrase and label predictions as they occur and inquire for the underlying assumptions if they are not provided. Paraphrase and label assumptions and inquire for the specific predictions that these assumptions might produce in the data.
- Use public recording to capture predictions and their related assumptions for all to see. Use separate recording sheets or charts for this purpose.
- Publicly record predictions on a facsimile of the data display. Use a graph or chart that reflects the actual format of the data display. This serves as an advanced orga

nizer and orients the group for viewing the data at the next phase.
- Record more than one set of predictions and their related assumptions. The goal during this phase is to seek to understand, not to persuade. When members struggle for consensus or think they need consensus, group work bogs down. Recording the diversity of predictions increases curiosity, especially when the facilitator encourages clarification of the different driving assumptions that are informing the predictions.

**Phase 2: Exploring and Discovering**

This phase is the heart of collaborative inquiry. Productive *Exploring and Discovering* require collective focus, discipline, and group members who are as interested in the observations of others as they are in their own observations. The goal is to create a shared learning experience in which group members can learn from the data and from one another. In many ways this is a special form of dialogue with data at the center.

Skillful facilitators promote a spirit of purposeful uncertainty during this phase. The goal here is to help group members remain open to possibilities and multiple viewpoints. By exploring several storylines in the data, group members discover patterns and trends that might otherwise remain hidden from view. Cognitively, this is the phase of observing, noticing, distinguishing, sorting, comparing, and contrasting.

Managing working group size is an important consideration. Group sizes of three to four work best. Each data team needs a shared data display and recording materials. This is an essential third point for structuring the exploration (see chapter 4). The data display establishes the third point with group members and the facilitator forming the other two points. When working groups are too large, participants may disengage; this occurs when the data display is difficult to see or there are too many voices in the crowd for shyer members to cut through. An additional barrier to success in this phase occurs when there is too much data present. This leads to overload and fragmentation of group energy.

*Facilitation Tips for Success*
- Provide time to orient to the data displays before encouraging group members to share their initial observations. Two to three minutes of silence allows individual group members to orient to the data displays and provides a space for the varying processing needs of individuals in the group. This leads to fuller participation and increased confidence on the part of group members. This is especially so for the “data shy.” The purposeful pause also slows down the “data enthusiasts” who may inhibit or intimidate others in the group. One way to do this is to provide individual thinking and writing time before people start talking to ensure opportunity for each group member.
- Propose a sequence for exploring the data and designate a starting point. Agreement on initial talking points saves time and energy and establishes focus. This is especially important when multiple data sets or complex displays are on view.
- Apply structures and protocols to balance participation. Structuring group work increases engagement, increases focus, and increases time efficiency. Some possible group member roles include: recorder, process checker, materials manager, and timekeeper.
- Use public recording. Create common charts or recording space for observations. Keep a separate chart for questions or comments that are “outside the phase.” For example, should conclusions or explanations emerge, it is helpful to record them and set these aside, rather than debate them in that moment. This recording and setting

aside process is also effective for questions that are not directly relevant to the data.

- Chart observations in language that is concise, specific, and quantified. Each observation statement should communicate a single idea clearly and numerically. These statements should focus only on observable facts contained in the data without interpretation or inference. Less and more, greater than, and smaller than are concepts. Quantifying these observations reveals the magnitude of differences. Using relevant data terminology, such as mean, median, mode, range, and distribution increases the precision of observations.

**Phase 3: Organizing and Integrating**

The third phase of the *Collaborative Learning Cycle Organizing and Integrating* guides the transition to formal problem finding and problem solving that establishes a foundation for thoughtful and detailed planning processes. During this phase, the group makes the transition from dialogue to discussion to decision making.

This phase is divided into two stages: causation and action. Here the facilitator guides the group in the transition from observing to understanding and then to action planning. During the causal stage of thinking, group members generate multiple interpretations for why the data look the way they do. Generating these theories of causation and then deciding on the most likely avenues of inquiry marks the transition from dialogue to discussion. Here again skillful application for the Norms of Collaboration (chapter 4) supports the group in this quest. Paraphrasing and posing questions for specificity are especially important during this process.

Issues tend to fall within one or more of five causal categories (Lipton and Wellman, 2012). These are:

1. Curriculum: The design and implementation of units of study.
2. Instruction: Teaching methods and materials.
3. Teachers: Knowledge, skills, and dispositions.
4. Students: Knowledge, skills, and dispositions.
5. Infrastructure: Schedules, programming, space, and resources.

Most data sets are incomplete and do not tell the full story. This stage of the *Organizing and Integrating* phase includes the collection of additional data that may be indicated by the theories of causation that emerge. By using these new data to confirm, disconfirm, or clarify the selected causal theories, group members increase their understanding of the deeper causal factors underlying the issue they are exploring. This increases confidence and commitment to any ultimate implementation plans.

When groups have sufficient confirming or clarifying data they then make the shift to developing theories of action. This stage embeds the use of skillful discussion and decision-making language tools and protocols. “Theories of action lead to problem-solving, planning and action research guided by the ongoing use of formal and informal data, thus continuing the learning cycle started by a given round of data-driven collaborative inquiry” (Wellman and Lipton, 2004, p. 49).

Confident facilitation of the Organizing and Integrating phase of the *Collaborative Learning Cycle* helps groups own their challenges and increases collective responsibility for student learning. Effective plans require specific outcomes, clear criteria for measuring progress and success, necessary action steps, monitoring strategies for determining progress and goal achievement, assignment of responsibilities, and projected timelines.

Leadership is a function, not a role. Adaptive leaders orchestrate conflict by initiating conversations about hard to talk about topics central to student success. Conflict is “good” when it centers on ideas, values, and ways of doing things. It is “bad” when it swims in seas of emotion, distrust, and personalization. We present practical tools for dealing constructively with conflict, offer ways of insulating yourself from negative energies, and suggest methods for teaching staffs and teams ways to disagree with grace and respect.

This section frames six capacities for organizational development and six capacities for professional development as lenses for analysis and intervention. We also explore ways to address wicked problems—those that seem to be ongoing, complex, and for which there seem to be no easy, or in some cases good, answers. Finally, we return to the finding that interaction among teachers and administrators that focus on student learning makes large and measurable differences in student achievement and reveals practical methods for energizing and supporting such communities.

And in conclusion, we note that community does not last forever. Yet communities do recover, clarify values, and reengage in the quest for continuing student improvement. We close with a metaphor intended to help each group find their own beat, their own rhythm in the continuing quest for joy in serving others.

**Chapter 12 Constructive Conflict**

Conflict and collaboration are two faces of community. Previous chapters have led us to this point. Getting the right work done and learning to fight gracefully about important things require the capabilities, skills, and tools described earlier in this sourcebook. This chapter offers frames, approaches, and additional tools for seeing and using conflict as a resource for group and personal development. We describe the workings of conflict in complex nonlinear systems such as schools, and present ways to increase your conflict quotient (CQ) and learn to see and avoid energy traps.

As the current generation of teachers and administrators struggles with the cultural shift from working in isolation with norms of autonomy and independence to working in more collaborative ways, conflicts are inevitable. The most important of these are values conflicts, engagement in hearing views different from one’s own, exploring what a cocreated future might look like, and facing difficult truths about current situations. Obstacles for such work include conviviality and surface harmony that mask underlying tensions and differences about the purposes and processes of learning and teaching. Amplifying these differences are accountability pressures, sophisticated data management systems, and rewards for student performance (Newman, King, and Rigdon, 1997).

Individuals approach conflict informed by personal history, and the culture in which they work. Four orientations are common: being passive, aggressive, passive-aggressive, or assertive. Only the last is healthy and effective for individuals, families, and organizations. The passive individual avoids conflict. It is not surprising that fear and resentment might be a part of this person’s internal world. Passive persons accommodate others, placing their own interests last. In aggressive approaches, however personal desires are placed above those of others. Persons acting aggressively often express and stimulate intense emotion in others: sometimes striking out, blaming, belittling, or boisterously demanding their own way.

Of the four approaches, the passive-aggressive is the most destructive. This person throws a rock through your window, then hides the hand that threw it, as if to say, “Who me?” This person uses negative presuppositions, “Even a department head should know that,” leaving the other wounded while not being sure what produced the injury.

Finally, the assertive person is clear about personal outcomes, personal boundaries, and the right to protect his or her values and self. This person engages others with a nondefensive attitude, verbally confident responses, and is open to collaboration. Clinical-experimental psychologist Manuel Smith’s (1975) seminal book on assertiveness included theory and learnable phrases for a range of situations and is still a valuable resource today. The seven norms of collaboration provide assertive language patterns.

passive-aggressive, or assertive? In a study of workplace culture, Ames and Wazlawek (2015) found that we might not perceive ourselves as others do. Test your own perceptions by gathering anonymous assessments from peers and colleagues.

Conflict within groups is made messy because often each of the four orientations is simultaneously present. Additionally, how groups work with and learn from their conflicts is related to their work culture and says much about who they are and who they wish to be. Betty Achinstein (2002) notes the following:

> Communities that can productively engage in conflict have a greater potential for continual growth and renewal. Conflict is a critical factor in understanding what distinguishes a generic professional community of teacher colleagues from a learning community engaged in ongoing inquiry and change. (p. 11)

Four types of information are needed to be at your most effective in situations with conflict: (a) understanding self; (b) understanding of trust; (c) understanding conflict, its dynamics, its dangers, and its opportunities; and (d) knowledge of a variety of conflict tools and ways to use them skillfully.

The sequence in which you will want this information depends on your learning style (abstract or concrete), urgency (are you thinking about conflict in general, or are you in the middle of one), and personal history. If you have an immediate need for learning new tools, move ahead to the section “10 Energy Traps and the related tools.” If you aren’t hurting at the moment, begin here searching for personal descriptions and read on.

**Understanding Self**

“The challenging internal work of facilitation” (and we would add being an adaptive educator) Roger Schwarz (2002) reminds us, “is to identify and explore the core values and assumptions that guide your actions, to rigorously reflect on how they increase or decrease your effectiveness and to develop a new set of values and assumptions that you can use to increase your effectiveness and that of the groups you work with” (p. 66).

In the spirit of reflection, you might ask what is your pattern of explaining things to yourself? Seligman (2006) notes that people have explanatory styles that can lead them to pessimism or optimism and that with awareness and attention they can change these orientations. What are your own patterns? In general, we create what we perceive, which, in turn mirrors back to us what we see. Disaster is occasionally in the eye of the beholder. School yourself to positively presume the intentions of others. Remember that in doing so, you don’t need to know *why* the other person is choosing certain behaviors, just be willing to believe that in some way this person is taking care of themselves.

The seventh norm, presuming positive intentions, is a matter of respect for others. Its Latin origin, *respecere*, means to look again, highlighting the active nature of respect. “Where once we saw one aspect of a person,” explains William Isaacs, “we look again and realize how much of them we had missed” (1999, p. 111).

What do you anticipate from others? Expectations of others often become a self-fulfilling prophecy. One’s perceptions, assumptions, and expectations have a lot to do with the presence or absence of affective conflict.

**Be the Best You**

The best of who you are comes from overcoming your biology and taking action based on self-examination. Adaptive leaders are “open to their own growth and learning that eventually infuse larger change efforts” (Senge, Hamilton, and Kania, 2015, p. 29). The human brain is guided by an overarching survival principle. So, its job is to classify the world around us into two categories: those that hurt you or help you to stay alive (Rock, 2009).

Given the self-protective drive for survival, without conscious awareness, our brains

**Trust Matters**

- This section discusses the importance of trust in productive conflict resolution, citing various studies (Tschannen-Moran, Bryk and Schneider, Meier, Hoy and Sweetland, Goddard, Hoy, and Woolfolk-Hoy).
- Trust impacts standardized test scores, teacher collaboration, decision-making, and teacher efficacy.
- Bryk and Schneider’s longitudinal study of 400 Chicago Elementary schools found that relational trust among teachers, parents, students, and principals significantly affected mathematics and reading gains.
- Trust is described as an interrelated set of mutual dependencies within social exchanges in school communities.
- The “criteria for the discernment of trust” include respect, personal regard, competence, and integrity.
- Mutual dependence and shared understanding of roles lead to satisfaction and effective fulfillment of responsibilities.

---

**Understanding Conflict**

- This section provides five definitions of conflict:
  1. Conflict is the condition in which people’s concerns appear to be incompatible.
  2. Conflict is energy in the system—people bring meaning to conflict, influenced by personal history, cultural norms, family patterns, and group practices.
  3. Conflict presents both danger and opportunity, similar to the Chinese character for "crisis."
  4. Conflict stems from perceived competition for limited resources (budget, power, status, respect, time, air, water, land, food).
  5. Conflict has different meanings to different individuals, so multiple meanings exist within a conflicted group.
- The section concludes that the truth about conflict lies in understanding it from multiple perspectives and being clear about personal goals and values.
- It emphasizes the need for cognitive (task) conflict in groups to produce good work, warning that the absence of conflict can lead to apathy and default decision-making by leaders.

**Trust Matters**

Trust is essential. Trust has a direct impact on productive conflict resolution (Tschannen-Moran, 2004); standardized test scores (Bryk and Schneider, 2002; Tschannen-Moran, 2004); teacher collaboration (Meier, 2002); participation in decision making (Hoy and Sweetland, 2000); and collective teacher efficacy (Goddard, Hoy, and Woolfolk-Hoy, 2004; Tschannen-Moran, 2004). Bryk and Schneider’s (2002) longitudinal study of four hundred Chicago Elementary schools stunned the educational community when they documented the direct role relational trust had on mathematics and reading gains. They concluded that an interrelated set of mutual dependencies are embedded within the social exchanges in any school community among teachers, parents, students, and principals. These create a feeling of vulnerability as each party relies on the others to fulfill their responsibilities (Bryk and Schneider, 2003). They used the term “criteria for the discernment of trust” to describe the dynamics of the social interactions that occur in the school environment. Relational trust, they determined, was composed of four factors: respect, personal regard, competence, and integrity. In a school, teachers, parents, students, and principals are mutually dependent on each other to achieve their goals. This mutual dependence creates a feeling of vulnerability as each party relies on the others to fulfill their responsibilities. Satisfaction results when the parties have a shared understanding of their roles and believe each other to be acting with good intentions (Bryk and Schneider, 2002).

**Understanding Conflict**

The definition of conflict varies, and each variation illuminates a different and useful understanding that provides a framework for constructive conflict. Here are five definitions of conflict:

1. Conflict is the condition in which people’s concerns appear to be incompatible.
2. Conflict is energy in the system—nothing more, nothing less. People bring meaning to conflict. The ways they do so is influenced by personal history, cultural norms, family patterns, and the practices of the group within which they work.
3. Conflict is a situation that presents both danger and opportunity. The Chinese character for crisis combines these symbols and, like conflict, draws attention to each dimension. Danger emerges with the violation of personal needs. Opportunity emerges when clarifying the issues and generating workable solutions.
4. Conflict stems from a perceived competition for limited resources: budget, power, status, respect, time or more universally—air, water, land, or food.
5. Conflict has different meanings to different individuals; therefore, multiple meanings exist within a conflicted group.

The truth about conflict lies somewhere in the vortex of these definitions. Becoming smart about conflict and having it work for you requires an understanding of conflict from all these perspectives as well as understanding yourself and schools as complex nonlinear systems. It also requires being clear about your personal goals and values.

Groups need cognitive conflict—task conflict—to produce good work. The absence of any conflict often leads to apathy, with decisions defaulting to leaders or those with

*Trust as a Three-Legged Stool*

Steve Barone offers a snapshot view congruent with the Bryk and Schneider’s research. Steve is a former New York administrator and international school consultant who uses the metaphor of a three-legged stool to describe three trust essentials: sincerity, competence, and reliability.

The origin for the word sincere is Greek. It means without wax. Earlier in history, the Italians would sometimes melt paraffin into the cracks of marble, let it dry, and polish it. Since top dollar went to perfect marble, this became common for stone damaged in the ground or in the removal process. The Greeks, savvy to this, demanded sincere marble from their suppliers. Sincere means to tell the truth—all the time, about what you think and how you feel. Barone describes his 5-year-old daughter sent to her room for telling a lie and told to stay there until she reasoned why truth is preferable. “When you tell the truth you only have to remember half as much,” she concluded.

Competence means you can deliver on promises. You have the capacity to perform what you offer. Competence, of course, requires prerequisite skills. One of the author’s grandsons needed his appendix out during a trip to Mexico. While his grandfather might have been happy to remove it, he had no competence. Thankfully they found a capable surgeon. Being competent applies to keeping confidences, being on time, honestly assessing one’s instruction when examining student work, and working collaboratively with others.

Reliability means all the time. If the brakes on your car fail, do you trust them anymore? How many hamburgers have to kill someone for McDonald’s to be out of business? How often can a principal fail to keep his word and maintain trust? Being human of course, we make mistakes. When so, ask for forgiveness. Requesting forgiveness involves three steps: admit you screwed up, apologize for the hurt it caused, and resolve to not do it again.

the loudest voices. Yet, cognitive conflict is a slippery slope. What starts as disagreement about ideas will sometimes slip into affective conflict—relationship conflict—when people lack the skills for distinguishing and managing productive disagreements (Rafferty, 2012). Affective conflict is “disagreements, either person-to-person or group-to-group, that involve antagonism. Such interactions sap energy, derail tasks, and block much group work” (Ensley, et al., 2002, p. 369). One major goal of group development is to amplify cognitive conflict and minimize affective conflict. Accomplish this with the seven norms of collaboration and the many strategies referenced in this book that provide psychologically safe ...

**THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL**

(Boxed Section)
**Centering is First: What, Why, How**

**What:** To be the most effective you can be during conflict, use the ancient Aikido visualization art of centering. Centering brings you into the here and now, takes power away from concerns and negative thoughts, and helps you remain stable and grounded. Aikido Master Thomas Crum brought this to our attention recently when he wondered if centering might not be taught in Adaptive Schools seminars (2015). “Center” refers to a relaxed yet focused state of mind and is a productive way of being in conflict or not.

**Why:** The concept of “ki” holds that all physical and mental power comes from the flow of energy around your body. Energy is lost when you are tense.

**How:** In a delightful story about how harried businessman Angus breaks negative habits leading to anger, exhaustion, and poor performance, Crum (2009) describes three profoundly effective and learnable steps. First, focus on breathing in the present moment with balance and energy; next, breathe in the “me I want to be” with power and purpose; and finally, let go of judgment, breathing in the mystery.

structures with which to address hard-to-talk about topics (see appendix A).

**Learning from Social Psychology**

Social psychologists study efforts to resolve human conflict. Advice found in the popular press often has its origins in social psychology. In our explorations of conflict from the perspective of this field, we have identified the following three principles to be of value to educators who work with any form of conflict:

1. Define fairness.
2. Identify and label the social norms for preventing conflict, regulating conflict, and finding solutions to conflict.
3. Address the sources of conflict.

**Defining Fairness**

Agreement is more likely and can be reached more quickly when a single standard of fairness applies than when a group uses multiple standards or no standards. It is best to negotiate the fairness criteria early in the process. Groups usually select from three definitions. Test the working definition of each with “what if” scenarios.

**Equality**

Everybody benefits or contributes equally. Three variations of this criterion have been observed: (a) equal outcomes, (b) equal concessions (i.e., all parties make the same degree of movement toward the middle), and (c) outside precedent (e.g., What are other districts paying their teachers?).

**Equity**

Benefit is proportional to contributions or work done. Merit-pay systems operate with this principle. Ideally, such systems should be based on student learning data and on a teacher’s contribution to the greater good through skillful collaborative engagement.

**Needs**

Benefit should be proportional to need. Federal funding formulas for grants to schools with high populations of low-income children represent this line of thinking. It is striking to us that most local and state governments have left it to the federal system to apply this definition and have chosen not to do so with local funding.

**Identifying and Labeling Social Norms**

People will often attack the process when they are not happy with a resolution. Prevent this by identifying and labeling ahead of time the norms that the involved parties will agree to use.

*Norms for Preventing Conflict*

The norms for preventing conflict are either productive or destructive. Destructive patterns include being excessively polite, avoiding issues, using humor as a distraction, and emphasizing congeniality (i.e., making nice) over professional collegiality. Overregulating the process for resolving issues with an avalanche of policies, forms, and detailed chains of command is a counterproductive approach used by some large organizations. We know of a school overseas in which conflict is “managed” by banning all employee organizations. Such approaches drive expressions of conflict underground, affect relationships, and ultimately destroy personal and collective efficacy and morale.

Productive patterns for preventing conflict include assigning resources and responsibilities on the basis of some agreed-upon definition of fairness (e.g., all teachers rotate yard-duty responsibilities except Mrs. Lopez, who runs an after-school tutorial clinic). Interactive patterns for conflict prevention include the seven norms of collaboration and an agreement to trace rumors back to their sources.

*Norms for Regulating Conflict*

To talk first with one’s adversary before going to a third party is an example of a norm for regulating conflict. Groups define what constitutes fair fighting. Agreements to address issues, not personalities, speak about the future, not the past are examples of ways in which groups might define fair fighting. Agreements to discuss the undiscussable, personal feelings, values, or student achievement in the math department constitute norms for regulating conflict. Groups make regulatory agreements about language. Instead of saying, “You’re wrong,” they agree to say, “I see it another way.” (See the strategy “Disagreement Grid” in appendix A.)

*Norms for Finding Solutions*

Agree first about solution criteria and solution processes (Who will decide?). Identify and explore the assumptions that underlie the different positions. Raise questions like the following to help groups confront conflict:

- What is the worst possible outcome of addressing this?
- What is the best possible outcome of addressing this?
- What are the worst and best possible outcomes of not addressing this?
- What outcome do you imagine that your adversary has?
- Would it be OK if your adversaries achieved their outcomes?

**The Context in Which Conflict Occurs**

The traditional working culture of schools challenges the effectiveness of much of the established knowledge about conflict. Adaptive leaders know that schools are living paradoxes, operating simultaneously as thing models and energy models. In the spirit of “thingness,” schools have been organized for more than a century as machines, a collection of smaller units making a part-to-whole universe: objectives to lessons and units to curriculum, a racecourse of relatively standardized ground that students must cover in their journey to the finish line (Tyler, 1949; Wiggins and McTighe, 2005; Zais, 1976).

In this model, principles of cause-and-effect prevail, values are formalized into contracts, event-level thinking is the norm, and tacit rules govern daily behavior. Transactions tend toward formality and politeness (Sergiovanni, 1994). A teacher once told us that each year students were coming to her without

Drawing from the science of chaos and complexity theory, we get a different picture of the organizing energies of the planet (Gleick, 1987). Using sophisticated mathematical modeling, scientists who study complex systems provide us with images of different and often nonlinear patterns of organization. Such systems are best understood by studying the behavior of the complex whole rather than the behavior of the parts (Gharajedaghi, 2006).

The summer sun beating down on Death Valley, California, produces waves of energy that heat the rock walls of the valley, trapping energy that builds up throughout the day. A similar phenomenon occurs over cities on warm days and nights with cloud cover; heat is trapped beneath the clouds, making the air sticky and uncomfortable. One person who is being grumpy sets up an energy trap if other people respond by matching the grumpiness. A teacher who talks above the volume of the class to get attention simply leads to the students increasing their volume so they can hear one another.

> Recognizing traps in order to release energy is the first step in problem resolution. When they detect energy traps, skilled group leaders can open emotional and cognitive space by establishing new frames for viewing situations for themselves and for other group members. “Frames are mental structures that shape the way we see the world. As a result, they shape the goals we seek, the plans we make, the way we act, and what counts as a good or bad outcome of our actions” (Lakoff, 2004, p. xv).

**Constructive Conflict**  
**CHAPTER 12**

These frames, or mental maps, have two critical features that apply directly to working with conflicts (Kelly, 2006): (1) Faulty maps lead us to faulty actions, and (2) it takes purposeful effort to modify or change a map once it has been established.

Ten common traps, which can be reframed to provide fresh perspectives and additional solution options, are as follows:

1. Operating metaphors, like the “war on drugs.”
2. Time orientations that confuse past, present, and future.
3. Time horizons that are too short or too long.
4. Nominalizations: naming processes as things.
5. The illusion of human separateness.
6. A focus on production to the detriment of production capacity.
7. Fixing what shows, not what is broken.
8. The myth that problems require solutions.
9. Personalization of conflict.
10. Being emotions rather than having emotions.

We were once asked to consult at what we will call the Unhappy Elementary School. The school’s difficulties had reached such proportions that the school board had threatened to remove the principal unless she could “turn the school around” before the end of the year. We were contacted in March.

The previous principal had been at the school for eighteen years and was a laissez-faire leader. The current principal had been there for eighteen months, bringing a strong background in curriculum and instruction and a more directive leadership style to the role. We decided to conduct information interviews with each staff member in preparation for a full-day staff meeting.

Our private interviews revealed that the teachers were not only complaining about the principal, they were also complaining about each other. We learned that many individuals made disparaging remarks about fellow teachers to colleagues, certified staff, and parents. Privately, a stream of vicious communication existed. “We’re shooting at our wingman instead of working together,” one teacher confided. Publicly, the staff wore polite faces to one another and discharged their negative feelings on a common irritant, the principal. Some staff members had pipelines to board members and regularly reported their versions of events at the school.

Several classical features of conflict are present in this example. First, conflict was perpetuating itself, ricocheting around in the energy traps of time orientations, nominalizations, fixing what shows, and personalizing conflict amid a labyrinth of underground communications. Second, conflict is always contextual. In this case, the school’s history, a hands-off principal, and a building organized into pods contributed to separate and disconnected units of teachers, with each unit unique in identity, norms, and team leaders. Third, the teachers were bright, highly verbal, and passionately committed to action. The mix worked reasonably well with a laissez-faire principal who left each pod free to do its own thing, but it became an obstacle when the school was faced with a common crisis.

To release trapped energy, first you must identify the trap. Understand it as a conceptual shape that holds energy within certain configurations. One way to identify the frames through which you are viewing a conflict—whether you are directly involved or simply on the periphery as an observer—is to free-write for a set amount of time about the conflict. Resist the temptation to analyze as you write; keep your pen moving until the time is up. Then read through the descriptions of the ten traps below to see which ones might be operating in your situation. Consider ways to release the energy by changing the frame and opening the trap, allowing the possibility of new resolutions into the situation.

Strategies and tools in the “What to Do” column below can be found in appendix A.

**The Trap**

**1. Operating Metaphors**

- The text explains that the human conceptual system is primarily metaphorical in nature, shaping perception and behavior.
- It discusses how language and metaphors (e.g., "reading wars," "war on drugs") influence group thinking, assumptions, beliefs, goals, and values.
- Examples are given, such as sports metaphors driving competition or war metaphors focusing on attack and defense.
- The text suggests that changing the metaphor (e.g., from a war to a rally for health) can open new possibilities for resolution.
- It encourages either extending concepts within a metaphor or changing the metaphor entirely, as metaphors highlight some realities and obscure others.
- The section concludes that what people name a thing determines their perception and behavior.

---

**What To Do**

- **Listen to the language that group members and group leaders use.**
- **Illuminate and extend unstated images within a metaphor—war… supply lines… training the troops.**
  - Example questions:
    - “If we’re a team, what sport are we playing? Who is the quarterback? Who is the coach? What kind of coach do we have?”
    - “If the faculty is a family, who is the mommy, the daddy, the little brother, or the eccentric uncle?”
    - “If parents are our customers, what are we selling?”
- **Change the metaphor.**
  - Example suggestions:
    - “A rally for health instead of a war on drugs.”
    - “Conducting an orchestra instead of giving orders to the troops.”
- **Surface and label assumptions, values, and goals within the metaphors the group is using.**
  - Example prompt:
    - “You frequently use the term *autonomy*, what are some of your assumptions about the ways that this value influences choices and behaviors in this organization?”

**2. Time Orientation (Past, Present, Future)**
“We’ve always done it that way” identifies a speaker who is focusing on the past. Energy gets stuck when groups focus exclusively on either past, present, or future or when conversations jump randomly across all three time dimensions. Free energy by addressing one temporal zone at a time. In general, we find that in problem-solving conversations energy is most freed when it is directed towards the future. Help groups to describe the desired state. Then back up to the present or the very near future to determine what must be done to achieve the envisioned future.

Some groups get stuck in the past. Free them by providing a vehicle to tell their stories. Our friend and colleague, Suzanne Bailey, teaches a timeline strategy to help groups get themselves unstuck. The group designates “eras” in history: the year the new superintendent came, the years of declining or increasing enrollment, the period of a major reorganization. Chart paper is hung on walls in the form of a timeline and icons used to illustrate different eras and the significant events that occurred. Groups of people complete the timeline with words, icons, and their memories delivered to one another as verbal histories. As a result, people hear about the same event from different perspectives, forming a more complex history with greater understanding of conflicting perceptions. What is expressed and understood is released.

Time confusions occasionally cause meeting energy carom off the walls like the rubber ball in a racquetball court. In such cases, a skilled facilitator directs the conversations to one time zone at a time.

---

**What To Do**

- **Focus group members on one temporal zone at a time.**
  In meetings say, “First, we will address what outcomes we want and then we will explore strategies that might help us to achieve those outcomes.”

- **Adhere to the meeting standards of one content and one process at a time.**

- **Use facilitator interventions to maintain energy focus in the group.**
  By focusing and directing energy, the facilitator maintains one content and one process at a time.

- **Introduce the Existing State-Desired State Map.**
  This tool brings the future into the room and links it to present actions.

- **Teach and apply Outcome Mapping to the situation.**
  This tool links the present to the future.

- **Teach and apply The Futures Wheel to the situation.**
  This tool provides images of possible future effects of issues and innovations.

- **Teach and apply a Histomap with groups that are stuck in the past.**

**The Trap**
**3. Time Horizons**

The unit of time within which parties plan to resolve a conflict limits solutions options. Negotiations literature advises that everything is negotiable, including deadlines. Our friend and colleague Laura Lipton intuitively knows this and frequently moves to extend deadlines on projects. In return, she gets release from deadline stress, more time for reflection, finer detail in her work, and better products.

Many time horizons are taken for granted because of past practices. Take, for example, the practice of assigning teachers to students for a single year. The moment a teacher decides to follow a class from second to third grade or from fifth to sixth grade, everything changes. Perceptions of student development burst from a 9-month window of growth to 2 years; diagnostic and relationship-building time at the beginning of the second year is practically eliminated; social norms of the class are understood and can be more effectively utilized; and parents’ relationships with the teacher carry on into the second year.

Either lengthening or shortening time horizons modifies energy. A group of parents in a Colorado school wanted a principal removed. Stretching out the time period for seeking resolution to this controversy would have stirred up more problems as more people became involved and rumors multiplied. Keeping the processing time tight, kept attention focused on facts and issues and not on hearsay.

Extending time horizons also provides benefits. Plotting a multiyear curriculum revision allows full communication with all parties, reliable baseline data, and judiciously set expectations.

---

**What To Do**

• **Assess the consequences of a longer or shorter time line.**

• **Lengthen time lines when deeper dialogue will allow group members to work through options, emotions, and obstacles to change.**

Provide a year for a faculty to dialogue about block scheduling instead of a month before making a decision.

• **Shorten time lines when issues are of lower order importance.**

For the question, “What color should we paint the staff room?” take exactly one meeting with the principal making the decision based on what she has heard if group members cannot come to agreement.

• **Teach and apply Outcome Mapping to the situation.**

Carefully calculate time requirements for implementing the strategies required for goal achievement.

Teachers at one school said that the principal didn’t “respect” them. *Respect* is a noun and is static, or unchanging; *respecting* is a process that is active in time with observable manifestations. Verbs are process words and imply active participation by persons or elements. As such, they imply choice and point to behaviors.

Some groups tell us that “trust” is missing in their organization. Groups cannot improve trust, they can only increase trusting behaviors. We’ve learned to ask what people will be doing and saying when they are trusting.

“Conflict” is another nominalization. With conflict—as with love, anger, happiness, fear, or any emotion we tend to nominalize—there is a starting point, varying levels of intensity, a cooling off, and transition into another emotional state. In each case, the language that labels these processes as things freezes these dynamic flowing activities into static conceptual abstractions. When groups act on the abstraction instead of the real issue, they experience failure and frustration.

Conversely, the more groups use the language of logic, emotion, and process, the greater their awareness and ability to direct and control conflicting energies.

**The Trap**

**5. The Illusion of Separateness**
During intense periods of Middle Eastern shuttle diplomacy, then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger used to say that he would remind himself of three things. First, he would remember to forget his culture; second, he would remember to forget his agenda; and third, he would remember his humanness. From such perspectives, conflicts remind people that they are irretrievably connected and that any sense of separateness is illusion.

Randy Swigert, an astronaut in the Apollo program, tells this story about one mission. For several days, they orbited the Earth until conditions were right for reentry. With relative leisure, he now had time to gaze from the spaceship to the Earth below. Hurtling over the Pacific Ocean, the West Coast of the United States suddenly appeared below them. He was aware of a visceral reaction, a sense of joyful belonging as he recognized his “home.” Then a little later, Cape Canaveral appeared, and he had another gut reaction of connection as he viewed the place from which the spaceship had been launched. Soon, he noticed, that he began to anticipate the view of the West coast and the launching site, and his sense of connection grew.

Around and around the globe he orbited, each time anticipating the joy of recognition a little earlier, until finally he realized that he was connecting with the entire planet. He came to realize that all the lines that separate us on Earth are artificial.

**What To Do**

• **Use inclusion activities to help group members learn the ways that they are connected, such as:**
  • First job
  • A job I might have taken if I had not become an educator
  • Cross interviews among group members to discover “some things you might not know about _____”

• **Use fishbowl conversations**—administrators in the center, teachers outside listening. The inner group describes desired outcomes, the outer group listens. Then, the groups switch positions and tasks.

• **Share stories such as the examples in the left hand column.**

• **Share information about another group, such as single parents who are just making ends meet, have two jobs, and are intimidated about coming to school to deal with issues there.**

• **Use In and Out of the Frame to surface and label the frames of reference through which group members are viewing an issue. Then surface and label frames of reference through which others might be viewing the situation.**
  • Parent
  • College graduates
  • Veteran staff member
  • Administrator
  • Male / female
  • Local tax payer
  • Newcomer to town
  • Elected official

**The Trap**

**7. Fixing What Shows, Not What is Broken**
One common energy trap is a tendency to fix what shows rather than what is broken. Ours is a quick fix culture. Television mysteries are solved in 30 to 60 minutes, minus time for commercials. Daily newspapers headline new solutions for school improvement, poverty, and crime. Legislative bodies adopt simple fixes for complex problems, and in many cases the answers have nothing to do with the problem.

Teacher evaluation systems are another case in point. As a profession, we’ve spent millions of dollars and as many hours learning and applying teacher evaluations systems, yet there is no clear evidence that such efforts improve instruction.

When groups fix what shows, it often leads to new problems. Fixing the new conflict that then shows merely leads to another. Since work is being done only at the level of appearances, the underlying tensions are left unattended and will erupt again at the next fissure.

The airlines’ decision to monitor and report on-time schedules resulted in air carriers padding their flight times between cities to produce higher percentages of on-time arrivals. Air traffic efficiencies, group crew turn around procedures, baggage handling, and the like could then be ignored. What showed was the on-time arrival data.

Fixing what is broken requires a deep understanding of the interacting energies that are creating the undesirable conditions. Experienced problem solvers spend the bulk of their time on problem finding not on solution generation.

**9. Personalizing the Conflict**

A wise person once said that you will never grow up until you stop thinking that your parents’ life was about you. To ruminate on childhood memories, pretending that we were the central character in the play, is natural but is only one version of the story.

Conflicts are hardly ever about you. They most often arise from some surface interference with another person’s needs or desire. To release yourself for the personalization trap, step onto a mental balcony and regard the conflicting interactions as part of a system. What might possibly be going on for that other person that could open up a feeling of threat, uncertainty, or anger? Ask yourself what is the most generous interpretation of the outcome. Would it be OK with you if the person were to achieve that outcome?

**What To Do**

- **Allow your self-regard to be stronger than your critical self-voice.**

**How to Double Your CQ**

When you are presented with conflict, you bring your entire personal history to the stage. You also bring consciousness, the human capacity to overcome conditioning and to work effectively with your physiological responses to fear, anger, disagreement, discomfort, and discord. When you notice that your response to conflict and your strategies for dealing with it change according to whom you are in conflict with, it is a reminder that conflict begins inside you.

We’ve experienced tremendous value by freeing ourselves from energy traps. Groups can easily learn to apply these ideas in order to learn from discord. By honoring deeper principles they will double their capacity to live and work more gracefully with conflict.

Principles are important because maximum success in any enterprise is guaranteed by clear outcomes and by applying principles—not rules—to achieve them. Rules are principles in chains. Rules restrict; they are useful some of the time, but disastrous at other times. To start and end meetings on time is a rule. To honor a group’s time and energy is a principle. Sometimes you must break the rule to maintain the principle. At a community meeting in a western state, for instance, a parent raised an important concern, about the district’s effort to set student learning standards, ten minutes before the announced closing time for the meeting. The superintendent wisely asked the group’s permission to stay and engage this topic for the next forty-five minutes. By doing so, she averted three months of potential community upset and untold hours of communication and conflict-resolution efforts.

Both the literature and our own experiences provide several important principles for using conflict as a resource within groups. Betty Achinstein (2002), building on the work of Louis and Kruse (1995), reminds us of the importance for leaders to do the following:

1. Develop forums for teachers to explore their differences.
2. Reinforce community values to set the frame for what to talk about and how to talk about issues and differences.
3. Demonstrate a willingness to live with ambiguity and reinforce the idea that all problems don’t have neat solutions.
4. Model critical self-exploration and vulnerability.
5. Foster openness to different perspectives.
6. Don’t become the final authority; support teachers in resolving conflicts themselves.
7. Provide structures, resources, professional development, and practice in the skills of inquiry and shared decision making.

The ultimate principle for seeing and using conflict as a resource is to listen well to yourself and others. By calming down and calming others, we develop empathy for both ourselves and them. Then we can maintain our own resourcefulness and develop shared capacities for graceful fighting about the important issues that are at the heart of true community in schools.

**Chapter 13 Capacities for School Change**

The essential notion of adaptivity (see chapters 1 and 2) frames the work of developing the underlying capacities for school change. To be adaptive, schools and school personnel must continually clarify their identities and not be attached to form. Earlier chapters examined fundamental strategies for carrying out this work. In this chapter we expand on the *what* of adaptivity—the twelve capacities for school change. The first six capacities are organizational, and the last six are professional. They are as follows:

1. Vision, values, and goal focus;
2. Systems thinking;
3. Initiating and managing adaptation;
4. Interpreting and using data;
5. Developing and maintaining collaborative cultures;
6. Gathering and focusing resources;
7. Collegial interaction;
8. Cognitive processes of instruction;
9. Knowledge of the structure of the discipline;
10. Self-knowledge, values, beliefs, and standards;
11. A repertoire of teaching skills;
12. Knowledge of students and how they learn.

The twelve capacities for school change interact with one another and cannot be addressed in isolation if schools and professionals are to become increasingly adaptive in response to the changing needs of the students they serve. These capacities are living examples of the dynamical principle that everything influences everything else.

The six organizational capacities and the six professional capacities form a synergistic whole that must be continually addressed. It is never a case of either–or, but always a case of both–and. We are persuaded that all the staff development in the world, and all the knowledge and skill building that we provide to individuals, will have only minimal impact if districts and schools do not also put energy and resources into altering the deep structure of the organization.

At the beginning of this book (see chapter 2) we introduced three focusing questions: Who are we? Why are we doing this? Why are we doing this this way? The answers to these questions are the short response to the *how* of adaptivity in schools. The twelve capacities make up the long answer.

Steven Covey (1989) reminds us of the need to balance production and production capacities. His retelling of the fable of the farmer who killed the goose that laid the golden egg points to the ongoing need to develop the *capabilities* to do important work as much as the need to do the work itself. If we are not careful, the “goose” of school improvement will die from a lack of food and water.

This is a perennial problem in schools that are starved for time: to do the important work for students and to support continual adult and organizational learning. We will make the case here that time is just one element in the

> Schools are living organisms, and like all healthy living organisms they are characterized by continual flow and changes in their metabolism that involve thousands of biochemical reactions. Stable systems are dying systems (Capra, 1996). In scientific terms, chemical and thermal equilibrium leads to death. Vital schools, like all living organisms, continually maintain themselves in a state far from equilibrium. This is the state of life. Stability emerges through the average, over time, of the ebb and flow of energy through the system. Attention to the six organizational capacities for adaptivity and the six professional capacities for adaptivity helps this energy flow.

> As you read this chapter, please have in mind some of the persistent problems you see in the schools around you. As with the languishing high school profiled earlier (see chapter 3), you may notice particular capacities that are underdeveloped. We hope that you also notice specific capacities that are well-developed in your settings. The essential question, then, is: Where should leaders now focus the system’s attention to make a difference in the situation?

**Section Heading:**
> The Organizational Capacities for Adaptivity

**Section Text:**
> Schools do not develop organizational capacities as abstractions. They do so by addressing meaningful problems. Skilled leaders use problems as opportunities for learning. This approach meets both production and production capacity needs. Working alongside leaders who understand this informs our learning as well. Recently we spent time with a school that addressed the six organizational capacities (figure 13.1) in the manner described below.

> A school that we will call Sea View Elementary tackled the issue of low scores on a statewide fourth-grade writing assessment. The test was new to both this school and others in the state. It emphasized expository writing and using evidence from the text to support one’s argument. Although the fourth-grade teachers were not happy about the scores, they were not terribly surprised. When they first saw the test, they realized that the school’s writing program had some gaps, given the expectations embedded in the examination. As a clearer picture of student writing performance began to emerge, the principal organized a series of meetings. We were fortunate enough to participate in some of them. Chapter 11 offers some practical approaches to engage others in collecting and analyzing data and ways to structure conversations about data.

term systemic improvements in the teaching of writing. In fact, she was willing to take some political heat from parents and central office administrators, if necessary, to keep the focus long-term and not just fix what was showing.

Several other values contributed to the project’s success, such as a belief in the power of cumulative effects for learners. As we describe in the systems thinking section, collective efforts matter. September of the fourth grade is much too late to start a concentrated writing program. The assessment of the system at that point was viewed by the school as an assessment of the whole, not that specific part.

The other operating value and vision was an image of continual improvement for all students. The emerging writing-skills matrix was seen as a developmental road map, not as a curriculum to be covered by each grade level in turn. If a third grader had difficulty crafting simple sentences, that is where the teacher started. Paragraphs could wait until foundational skills were in place.

**Systems Thinking**

The writing problem at Sea View Elementary was soon seen by the teachers as a systems problem. A fledging sense of collective responsibility for student learning motivated the work of vertical teams. K–3 staff members were openly supportive of their fourth- and fifth-grade colleagues and agreed to work collaboratively on an improvement plan and effort.

One of the vertical teams produced a draft-skills matrix for the teaching of expository writing and reasoning with textual evidence. This systems view was developed through rotating two-hour planning sessions, with each new team adding to and filling in the gaps in the work of previous teams. Several teachers even came back during their lunch breaks to participate with colleagues on other teams.

One byproduct of this work was increased confidence on the part of the lower-grade teachers that their efforts in developing fundamental writing skills would be appreciated by their upper-grade colleagues. When they could see the system of which they were a part displayed in matrix form on the wall of the meeting room, they could see where their efforts led and view with ease their part in the whole.

Upper-grade teachers also benefited when they spotted the gaps in the writing instruction on the grid. One glaring example was the lack of emphasis on expository forms. The state assessment first pointed this out, and the skills matrix reinforced it. This also inspired changes in another part of the system, because the district writing rubric did not provide guidance or standards in this area. Several Sea View Elementary teachers volunteered to be on the revision committee to tackle the rubric. With their draft-skills matrix in hand, they greatly influenced the process. In the course of this work, they shared their efforts informally with several other schools and engineered a resource swap with teachers in other buildings who were working on different parts of the writing and literacy-development puzzle.

Systems thinking is a critical skill in a world of messy problems. In this emerging field, practitioners model systems using mathematics, complex diagrams, and rigorous analysis of variables. Ultimately, such work leads to leverage points in the system that can be modified or perturbed enough to positively influence systems change. One challenge here is that both thing and energy models apply to the same system. Finding and modifying systems requires ways of both seeing and acting.

**Initiating and Managing Adaptation**

The principal at Sea View Elementary intuitively knew that shared dissatisfaction is the first step in initiating change. This, along with shared vision and knowledge of practical tools and strategies, must be strong enough to outweigh the cost of any change.

The following simple formula (adapted from Beckard and Harris, 1997) captures these factors:

It explains the formula for change, the importance of shared dissatisfaction, vision, and practical tools, and the psychological transitions involved in organizational change. The text also provides an example from Sea View Elementary and discusses the importance of supporting staff through transitions. The section ends with a heading titled "Interpreting and Using Data."

**THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL**

Change = (A × B × C) > X

X = the cost of change  
A = shared dissatisfaction  
B = shared vision  
C = knowledge of practical tools and strategies

Without shared dissatisfaction, all the vision and strategies in the world do not promote a desire to change. Too much dissatisfaction without practical tools will shut down the system. Vision that is neither shared nor connected to the other two resources sputters out into inspirational vagueness. All change has a cost for both individuals and organizations. The left side of the change formula must overcome the right side.

The work of William Bridges (1991) is a useful guide in this area. He points out that *change* in organizations is not the problem; it is *transitions* that are bewildering. Transitions are the psychological readjustments to change. They have three phases: (1) endings; (2) a neutral zone; and (3) new beginnings. Each phase has special characteristics and special requirements if it is to be navigated successfully.

Endings must be marked concretely and symbolically. Many change processes stall because the people in the organization have not let go of the old. Curriculum changes in schools often meet this difficulty. Teachers cling to the tried-and-true, and in some cases they hope to leap to the new like a trapeze artist high above the crowd. They are often unwilling to let go and hang suspended in midair with one hand on each trapeze.

At Sea View Elementary, the writing meetings that were initiated marked a transition from old ways of working to new ones. They were symbols of a new order and at the same time marked the ending of isolation and scapegoating. The principal did not have to explain this. Freeing teachers for these meetings with substitutes symbolically and practically conveyed this message.

During an ending, a group needs to ask, “Who is losing what in this change?” and “Who needs what support to work through the transition?” At Sea View Elementary this took the form of a change in curriculum materials for the language arts program. Although it was widely recognized that the textbooks were outdated and falling apart, some teachers still needed an opportunity to express their concerns about the new materials and the need for greater planning and lesson preparation time. Early meetings provided the opportunity for these conversations and the emotional support that was needed by these staff members.

The neutral zone is a time of anxiety and discomfort for many participants, but it is also a time of great creativity. At Sea View Elementary, dialogue, reflection, and the sharing of practical materials and tools organized this phase. The principal was always supportive and nonjudgmental, allowing teachers to express their feelings and concerns about increased accountability and their work in progress.

Bridges (1991) reminds us that new beginnings require an acknowledgment of the problem, not a solution. At Sea View Elementary, the writing issue was owned by the staff. In fact, as the teachers began this project, they knew much more about the shortfalls in student writing performance than they did about the solutions.

Bridges (1991) also admonishes readers to remember the marathon effect. Thousands of runners compete in the Boston Marathon each year. The world-class runners, with their faster qualifying times, line up at the start of the pack. By the time the runners in the rear cross the starting line, these leaders are several miles up the course.

In school-change processes, early adapters must remember and pay attention to those who follow. To produce cumulative effects in schools, these people must pace themselves and support the learning of their reluctant colleagues. The race is not fully under way until everyone crosses the starting line.

**expectations of low performance by their students. Thus, rather than discounting the results or questioning the validity of the test, these teachers began an informal dialogue with the principal and other teachers. Part of this dialogue explored comparisons between the state assessment and writing samples collected from the fifth-grade students. This in turn led to conversations with the third-grade teachers and an examination of writing samples from their students. These explorations motivated teachers’ desire to learn and apply more consistent formative assessments with their students.**

**As this example illustrates, data can be both quantitative and qualitative. The number of Sea View Elementary students in each performance quartile carried some meaning for the teachers. Actual samples of student writing carried other meaning. In these ways, teachers with a variety of mindsets had the opportunity to engage with the problem in the manner that was best suited to their preferences. Numbers spoke to some people, whereas artifacts of learning spoke to others.

**Developing and Maintaining Collaborative Cultures**

A sense of collaboration governed this project from the beginning. A leadership team composed of a cross-section of teachers and the principal organized the project and monitored its progress. This team steeped itself in the norms of collaboration (see chapter 4). They kept communication open among grade levels and provided a bird’s-eye view of the school and the project.

Vertical teams attended the meetings. In this way, each group had information about K–5 writing approaches and access to knowledgeable practitioners from every grade level.

At one point it became obvious that all the teachers in the school were not teaching and using the same proofreading marks. Group members said, “You know, we all don’t need to talk about this.” So we asked them to name three people in the school whom they all respected and who had the technical knowledge to handle this task. They quickly named three people, who agreed to develop a simple set of grade-level appropriate proofing marks for faculty approval at the next whole-group meeting.

**Gathering and Focusing Resources**

This project demonstrates the power of the capacity to gather and focus resources. Our contract with the district and the school emphasized the development of collaborative skills and process tools. Schools need an engaging vehicle to carry this work. At Sea View Elementary, the principal and leadership team used the writing issue as their mode of transport.

Time and money were budgeted for meetings, for some staff members to attend in-depth training in expository writing, and for new curriculum materials. Other issues in the school that could be set aside were set aside. A bulletin board in the hallway near the office proudly displayed an ever-changing sampling of student work in this area. The parent newsletter provided updates and progress reports.

One of the innovations that most contributed to project success was the use of substitute teachers and a careful scheduling of the vertical-team meetings to best align with teacher preparation periods. In this way the teachers were free, while school was still in session, to participate in two-hour sessions for planning and problem-solving purposes. On most project days this required the services of six to eight substitutes.

The district staff-development director understood the nature of this work and readily agreed to cover the cost of substitutes. District staff-development practices are moving beyond the notion of course-based training as the only means of professional development. Time with peers in focused work sessions contributes to learning for all participating adults and simultaneously supports direct payoffs for student learning.

**The Professional Capacities for Adaptivity**

The professional capacities for adaptivity (figure 13.2) work in tandem with the organizational capacities. In the example from Sea View Elementary School, improvements in the writing program arose from attention to both areas. Within this arena, individual teachers and teams of teachers set out to become smart about both writing and the teaching of writing.

**Collegial Interaction**

Who teachers are to one another matters. In a sometimes lonely profession, isolation in the individual cells of an “egg-crate” school does not promote personal or professional growth. Parallel play might socialize youngsters in sandboxes, but it limits learning for adults.

To be a colleague requires sharing one’s knowledge and sharing when one does not have knowledge. It means sharing and creating materials together. It means teaching one another about the craft of teaching. We are still somewhat surprised when we find out how many teachers in a given school have never seen another teacher teach. Their experiences of the other teachers consist mostly of passing in the hallways, with or without students in tow.

Study after study (e.g., Little and McLaughlin, 1993) stresses the importance of collegial interaction for growth in teaching and growth in student achievement. Adult learning, like all learning, is both an individual and a collective act. Where collegiality is strong, communities of practice bloom (Brown, 1994). These communities support distributed cognition, which means that people become smarter together.

At Sea View Elementary School, it was safe not to know everything there was to know about teaching writing. Several teachers immersed themselves in learning to teach expository writing. As they tried out these ideas in their classrooms, they shared their successes and shortfalls with other teachers and encouraged them to adopt the techniques that seemed to be working.

A new kindergarten teacher brought a wealth of experience in language development for early childhood programs. The first- and second-grade teachers opened up a dialogue with her as they eagerly awaited the next school year(s) and the arrival of these youngsters in their classrooms.

The hallway bulletin board, with its rotating display of student work, became a focal point for conversations about student writing and teaching students to write. These conversations led to lesson swapping and more conversations.

Collegiality is different from conviviality. The teachers at Sea View Elementary had both, but they didn’t confuse lunch-table chatting with professional dialogue. Mindfully talking about one aspect of the instructional program allowed the school as a community to focus its energy and use talk as a vehicle for learning and productive change.

failure in the classroom. Many variables add to the complexity of the thinking tasks that confront teachers every day. Planning and reflecting skills energize and organize good teaching.

In planning, teachers consider the following (Borko, Livingston, and Shavelson, 1990):

1. Information about students—who they are, what they know and can do;
2. The nature of the instructional task—subject matter, activities, materials;
3. The context of the school—class size, scheduling, grouping;
4. Their own beliefs—their conception of learning, of teaching, and of the particular subject or topic.

In reflecting, skilled teachers consider three areas: the technical, the practical, and the critical (Calderhead, 1996). Technical reflection focuses on whether the objectives were met, based on specified criteria for success. Practical reflection focuses on the effectiveness of the actions and the ends to which those actions led. Critical reflection focuses on the purposes of education and the assumptions that underlie practice.

The “bookends” of planning and reflecting frame lesson execution. It is here that additional cognitive resolving power pays off for students and teachers as learning comes into focus. A teacher’s “with-it-ness” supplies the necessary cognitive and emotional flexibility for maintaining concentration on the big picture while modifying and adjusting along the way. One of the early and ongoing challenges for the Sea View Elementary writing project was to not get hung up on a lesson plan during the actual lesson. Learning to write is a messy business. Following the students and their needs is much more important than following the plan.

Sea View Elementary teachers are still hard at work learning to plan, teach, reflect on, and apply new understanding from their writing-skills matrix. Becoming better teachers of writing calls on all their cognitive processes of instruction.

**Knowledge of the Structure of the Discipline**

What teachers know and can do greatly influences student learning. A teacher’s knowledge of the structure of a given discipline translates directly into daily instructional decisions, curriculum choices, and lesson designs. Individual teachers teach different subjects differently (Shulman, 1987). An elementary teacher’s math lesson will be structured and conducted in a manner different from the same teacher’s literature circle.

Expert teaching calls for an understanding of the subject matter that is thorough enough to organize the topics so that the students can create meaningful cognitive maps (Darling-Hammond, 1997). Teachers with such a level of knowledge can use it flexibly to address ideas as they come up in the course of teaching. Real learning is messy. Students do not always stay within or even fit within the boundaries of a lesson plan. Teachers’ knowledge of content topics and of fields of learning must therefore always be wider and deeper than that of their students. This enables fluid movement within subject matter and enables responsiveness to student questions and perceived student needs.

Shulman (1987) breaks down knowledge of the structure of disciplines into several important subsets. One is content knowledge itself. If the teacher does not know a subject, the students will not come to know it. Another area is knowing the structure of the subject matter—the organizing principles and concepts.

A second grader sorted out an important idea in mathematics one day when he observed with excitement, “Numbers are made up of other numbers—you can take them apart!” Many second graders never reach this conclusion on their own. It is more likely to happen if their teachers understand this big idea themselves.

It is also important to know the habits of mind in a given field. The principles of inquiry are different in literature than they are in the physical sciences. How are ideas developed in social studies? Who is a valid source in liter-

...ary criticism? How do mathematicians solve problems? These are all examples of this idea applied to different content areas. This supports students in understanding how new ideas are added to a field and how deficient ones are dropped by those who produce knowledge in a domain.

Students, too, have habits of mind. Each content area is a minefield of misconceptions and error patterns. Knowing these allows the expert teacher to anticipate, carefully structure lessons and units, and respond appropriately to the fragile half constructions of their novice learners. Shulman (1987) calls these adaptations pedagogical content knowledge. This blending of content knowledge, learner knowledge, and teaching knowledge binds the subject matter to specific learning devices. Expert teachers draw from a rich menu of analogies, models, and explanatory devices that support them and their students in representing ideas and understanding in a variety of ways.

The writing project at Sea View Elementary struggled with all these issues. The teachers’ knowledge of writing and writing processes grew alongside that of their students. A practical developmental continuum for the stages of student writing began to emerge, and the teachers forged important connections between student writing and other areas of literacy, such as student reading difficulties. This triggered an inquiry into the structure of the reading program as the teachers wondered aloud about the most appropriate balance of fiction and nonfiction books to use with students at all grade levels. They are still exploring the connections between exposing students to quality nonfiction through guided reading experiences and translating that into writing lessons.

**Self-Knowledge, Values, Standards, and Beliefs**

Little children playing school vividly demonstrate beliefs about teaching that shape the rules of this play and the power relationships among the players. When some of these children grow up and become real teachers, their beliefs, values, and personal standards will implicitly and explicitly guide their decisions about what and how to teach.

Values and beliefs influence the perceptions and judgments that carry teachers through their days. They are not always consciously understood or named by individuals, but their presence simmers beneath the surface of a teacher’s practice. Values shape the standards that teachers hold for their own work and for that of their students. Values are filters for what elements of the vast subject matter are emphasized and reinforced. Ultimately, they are each teacher’s true curriculum and true lasting lessons.

One of the central issues at Sea View Elementary was—and is—What is good writing? This standards issue is an interactive construction forged by individual teachers and their collaborative colleagues. The ebb and flow of changes in their students’ writing focuses this clarification process while challenging their beliefs about teaching and learning. This clarification process is the deepest level of inquiry at Sea View Elementary. Teaching writing is a vehicle for exploring the ways and means of learning about learning, both for students and for adults.

**Repertoire of Teaching Skills**

Teaching is a craft skill built on action—knowledge honed by trial and error. It begins with the teacher’s own understanding of what is to be learned by students and how this learning is most appropriately orchestrated for the population that is being served. Understanding teaching is a lifetime journey. There is always something new to learn about oneself, one’s students, the content, the process, and the dynamic interactions of these elements.

Master teachers, like concert artists, consciously expand their performance repertoires. They develop and assemble micro-routines that can be combined and reconstituted to fit a variety of settings. These experts automa-

tize many routines to free cognitive space for more complex perceiving and more sophisticated instructional problem solving. This unconscious competence is the hallmark of an expert in the classroom.

One of the tensions and energy drains for the novice writing teachers at Sea View Elementary was this very lack of automaticity. Daily writing tasks demanded that conscious attention be placed on seemingly mundane lesson details. When everything is important, sensory overload sets in. Peripheral vision, both literal and metaphorical, was not a sufficient resource for managing the physical, emotional, and cognitive demands of high-quality writing instruction at this stage of teacher learning.

**Knowledge of Students and How They Learn**

Learners and teachers need each other. Each is incomplete without the other. Who they are in this relationship forms a delicate balance of minds, hearts, and souls. The desire for smaller class sizes and smaller schools is a response to the need to know each other. In an increasingly diverse world, direct and personal knowledge is even more necessary as old assumptions and operating rules lose their guiding power.

All the teaching repertoire in the world is wasted if it is not well-matched to the needs of learners (Saphier, Haley-Speca, and Gower, 2008). The exploding knowledge about learning styles, multiple intelligences, developmental differences, and cultural variation supports Shulman’s (1987) notion of the need for pedagogical learner knowledge on the part of all teachers.

Developmental differences do not end in the third grade. Grade by grade, the span, in Piagetian terms, widens. Many learners in middle school and high school operate at a solidly concrete operational level. They often stumble when they bump head-on into a curriculum organized by abstraction and taught through symbol systems. When flexible teachers start with the concrete and scaffold learning to the abstract, these same students grasp complex ideas and perform at high levels.

Developing culturally respectful teaching approaches is an increasing need in many schools. Methods and materials that work with one population might confuse or offend another. Language differences play an important role here. One often unnoticed variable is the difference between students’ social discourse and their knowledge of the structure and norms of academic discourse. Lee and Fradd (1998) refer to this sophisticated matching as instructional congruence. This means that teachers mediate the nature of academic content with students’ language and cultural experiences. This makes content accessible, meaningful, and relevant.

Learning about student writers at Sea View Elementary energized and at times terrorized the teachers. The more they looked, the more differences they spotted. This led to dialogue and discussions about the best ways to intervene with individuals—when and how do you coach young writers, and when and how do you consult with them in a more directive manner? Other conversations explored alternative ways to group students for instruction. One direction this took was to experiment with cross-grade groupings for targeted mini-lessons.

**A World of Both–And**

Neither the organizational nor the professional capacities for adaptivity would have sufficed on their own to make a difference at Sea View Elementary School. In this world of both–and, the twin goals reinforced one another. Developing each capacity within a spirit of collegiality and inquiry led to a natural flow within and among the areas.

These twelve capacities frame the windows through which we can look at schools and districts. Current project successes can usually be located here. Current logjams in the system also have their roots in these areas. This, then, is a diagnostic tool and a curriculum for organizational and professional development.

**Chapter 14  Community Doesn’t Just Happen**

*Through community character is built. The schools that do it best “are those that cultivate intense, think community. Most of the time, character is not an individual accomplishment. It emerges through joined hearts and souls. And in groups.”*

—Brooks, 2015

Community doesn’t just happen in schools. It is simultaneously a fragile resource and a state of being. “Community is an outward and visible sign of an inward and invisible grace, the flowing of personal identity and integrity into the world of relationships” (Palmer, 1998, p. 90). These networks of relationships bind people to one another and to important ideas and work.

The modern sense of schools as communities is relatively new. Not long ago, the individual teacher was the center of most attempts to improve the quality of teaching and learning in schools. Today, new promise is held in the growing recognition of the power of school-based professional communities to support teacher development and improve student learning. Louis, Marks, and Kruse (1996) found that professional communities in schools are characterized by a shared sense of purpose, a collective focus on student learning, collaborative activity, deprivatized practice, and reflective dialogue. Such communities develop collective responsibility for student learning, producing schoolwide gains in student achievement.

Rosenholtz (1989) found that a major difference between stuck schools and moving schools is teacher talk and teacher efficacy. Studying secondary schools, Little and McLaughlin (1993) found that teacher membership in a learning community is strongly related to student learning in specific subject areas and at entire schools, significantly exceeding the learning of control groups. However, Elmore (1995) cautions that efforts at school restructuring do not necessarily result in student learning. In fact, he finds only a weak relationship between the two. Reorganizing the school by modifying schedules, grouping patterns, and teaching arrangements does not automatically ensure a collaborative climate.

True collaboration arises from beliefs and skills. In this dynamic, teachers are reinventing instruction and cocreating responses to educational dilemmas. We have stressed that for professional community to exist, teachers must talk. Equally important, however, is what they talk about. We have identified the sources for professional conversations that lead to improved student learning. It seems that when teachers talk about real students, real student work, and ways to reinvent instruction to support greater student learning, achievement soars.

Developing school communities is even more complex, because all group members belong to other groups as well. The site-based decision-making team has members who think of themselves as primary teachers, special education teachers, parents, administrators, taxpayers, and many other roles. To be a member of a given group, each individual must sort

out and resolve conflicting loyalty and identity issues. This is a central “Who am I?” question that each group member must clarify.

David Brooks (2015) notes that community contributes to character development for students and cites the Denver School of Science and Technology (where one of us has a niece) and the Leaders School in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, as exceptional examples. Patterns we have described in Adaptive Schools forge similar benefits. Just a few of these are allocentrism, working for the benefit of the whole, valuing differences, norms emerging not from rules but from shared understandings of one another, and effective ways of working together.

**The Principles of Community**

Creating communities requires vision, values, perseverance, hard work, and time. Community doesn’t just happen. Sergiovanni (1994) notes that schools are more like a functional family than a fast-food chain. Like any healthy family, a community requires work to develop it and keep it together. We offer the following seven principles in this important journey:

1. Community doesn’t just happen.
2. Community is the other face of conflict.
3. Diversity enriches community.
4. Both things and energy matter.
5. We cannot not be connected.
6. Community lives within.
7. Community doesn’t last forever.

**Community Doesn’t Just Happen**

If values are the heart of a community, communication is the pulse, bones, and physiology. Most teaching groups, isolated from peers for so many years, need to learn ways of talking together. The task is complicated, because it requires at least four languages. First is the language of emotion and passion, providing speech for what moves us. After nearly two thousand years in Western civilization, the role of emotion in professional life and its necessity for sound decision making is finally being legitimized by Goleman (1995), Damasio (1994), and others. Second is the language of logic and analysis, to apply a variety of perspectives in reasoned reflection and planning. Third is the language of dialogue, to develop shared understanding; and fourth is the language of discussion, to make decisions that stay made. Dialogue and discussion are ways of talking that are fundamental to the success of any community (see chapter 5).

Developing community also requires paying attention to the environmental aspects described in chapter 8. Teachers need space and time to collaborate. Darling-Hammond (1997) describes how “push-in” efforts in a number of restructuring elementary and high schools allow more time for collaboration, involve staying with the same students for two or more years, and provide teaching teams with distributed expertise. These schools are eliminating “pull-out” services to students, and special staff members are reassigned to reduce teacher-pupil classroom ratios. Darling-Hammond describes an elementary school in Chicago in which the teachers teach four full days of academic classes each week and spend the fifth day planning in multigrade teams as the students rotate to resource classes in music, fine arts, computer lab, physical education, library science, and science lab.

At an elementary school in South Carolina, the teachers have eighty minutes per day for planning. In Cincinnati, an elementary staff reorganized the schedule to free up five and a half hours per week for planning time and reduced the pupil-teacher ratio to fifteen to one by using push-in strategies. We’ve even heard of a school in the central valley of California where an impenetrable fog sometimes delays the start of school. Buses are delayed until visibility is safe. School leaders realized that if fog could keep the kids home, so could the teachers’ need for collaborative work time. Once a week, now,

### Detailed Description:

#### Left Column:
- The text discusses the allocation of instructional staff time in traditional high schools, noting that only 32 percent is spent teaching, compared to 60-85 percent in elementary, intermediate, and alternative high schools (citing Cooper, Sarrel, and Tetenbaum, 1990).
- It mentions that high schools are increasingly dedicating more time to their primary purpose—teaching—but that nonteaching time is not spent on collaborative planning and curriculum work as it is in other countries.
- The text references Darling-Hammond (1997), who describes International High School, where staff work with students in advisory councils, and guidance counselors are attached to teaching teams. Full-time teachers make up 67 percent of the staff, and at Central Park East Secondary School, 73 percent.
- A block quote from Darling-Hammond (1997, p. 185) describes the extensive shared time for planning, professional development, and governance in restructured schools, with cluster teachers sharing 70 minutes of planning time daily and a half day each week for staff development and collective work.
- The text concludes that accomplishing these structural changes requires more than communication skills; communities must maintain their values and develop resources such as efficacy, flexibility, craftsmanship, consciousness, and interdependence.

#### Right Column:
- The section is titled **"Community Is the Other Face of Conflict."**
- The text explains that community and conflict are intertwined; conflict arises from interdependence and is necessary for community. Conflict forges new lifeforms, and human conflict is uncomfortable, so groups often avoid it, resulting in what Scott Peck (1987) calls "pseudocommunity," characterized by extensive politeness and avoidance of real issues.
- Groups move past pseudocommunity by asking transition questions like “Who are we?” “Why are we doing this?” and “What is our purpose?” This leads to the next stage: chaos.
- Peck’s concept of chaos is compared to a dynamic system in quantum physics, where many variables interact. Chaos is a time of fighting and struggling, with differences exposed. Most fighting is not respectful or skillful, and members try to convert others or resist attempts to change, leading to blame and cliques.
- At this point, groups can either move toward community or away from it. Leaders may try to achieve peace by overregulating or resolving differences through policies and committees, but these only address surface issues.

#### Block Quote (Left Column):
> Shared time for planning, professional development, and governance is much more extensive in the restructured schools. In International High School, cluster teachers share 70 minutes of planning time daily and a half day each week for staff development and collective work while students are in clubs. (1997, p. 185)

**The Adaptive School**

The way toward community at this point is through engaging conflict and embracing it with special tools. Peck calls this stage emptiness. Members empty themselves of the need to convert or fix others. They empty themselves of the need to control, of the sense that there is one right way, of ideologies, and of prejudices against other people. Members empty themselves of barriers to communication and work to make a transition from rigid individualism to an acceptance of interdependence. Individualism is valued, but so is collegiality. Ways are sought to achieve the best of both worlds. Silence is an asset. Also prominent in the toolkit are the metacognitive strategies of suspension and the balcony view (see chapter 5). Concepts about and tools for conflict (see chapter 12) are also helpful.

At Peck’s next stage, groups realize true community. Here people are open, lucid, vulnerable, and creative. They bond together across their differences for common purposes.

**Diversity Enriches Community**

Healthy biological cultures are diverse. Monocultures are at greatest risk for disease and trauma. If only one type of pine tree grows in the forest, then one species of insect, fungus, or other parasite can destroy all the trees. Botanists cross-pollinate, splice genes, and graft stems to different root stocks to increase the resistance to pestilence and disease. On the edges of ecosystems, at points of transition between habitats, lifeforms are the most profuse and evolving.

As long as the group and its subgroups know that they are a system, diversity of cognitive style, educational beliefs, ethnicity, culture, gender, role, and age increase the quality of group decisions and offerings to students. In fact, there are some indications that a staff that is too heavily weighted with males will have greater difficulty working collaboratively than a group that has more gender balance (Louis and Kruse, 1995).

Diverse ideas help groups to form rich responses to educational perplexities. Disagreements that focus on substantive, issue-related differences of opinion actually improve team cohesiveness, commitment, and effectiveness. Disagreements that become expressed as personal attacks or judgments about others, however, insert a destructive energy flow into group work. What groups need to know and be able to do in order to engage in cognitive conflict without affective conflict includes the collaborative norms (see chapter 4), dialogue and discussion (see chapter 5), and using conflict as a resource (see chapter 12).

**Both Things and Energy Matter**

Throughout this book we have advocated building the energy resources of schools; yet energy is not enough. Prairie Ridge High School in the Crystal Lake District in Illinois was designed as an adaptive facility, capable of supporting independent and interdependent activities within the building (Saban et al., 1998). Constructed to operate as an 1,800-student high school, the building can also be transformed to work as two 900-student schools or four 450-student schools. The thoughtful placement of special spaces, such as science labs, and the flexibility of interior walls that are not weight bearing make this so. Prairie Ridge was designed to serve the relationships among the mind (classroom and academic areas), the body (physical education and athletic areas), and the spirit (the theater and art area).

Each of these areas is zoned to be able to act independently from the others, yet in the course of a normal school day the three areas interdependently form a total learning community. In addition, each area contains design elements to support the staff and the students in developing the five energy sources of high performance: efficacy, flexibility, craftsmanship, consciousness, and interdependence. A prime example of this is the lack of separate offices for each academic department. Teachers share a well-provisioned common preparation area.

Although this example is exceptional in its scope and execution, things do matter in

CHAPTER 14

achieving educational aims. The “surround,” as David Perkins (1992) terms it, is tantamount to being a thinking member of the human community, interacting in countless ways to influence human learning.

One of the authors is reminded of his first year as a fully credentialed teacher. The principal met him outside the building on the first day of school and asked, “Are your desks in rows?” Trembling with anger and anxiety, the young teacher asked if the conversation could be continued in the principal’s office. Once there, he asserted that he understood his role to be the responsibility for learning in that class, and if that was the case, he would decide the furniture arrangement that would best suit that purpose.

Values matter. Values have life as energy. Statements of mission and beliefs are things that are printed, framed, and hung on the wall. Things without energy are not enough; the things must support the energy. To focus group energy we offer the following tips—based on our work over the last decade with many seminar participants and group leaders in a variety of settings—for setting and maintaining goal focus:

1. Adopt the meeting standards (see chapter 6).
2. Rotate the facilitator and recorder roles (see chapter 6).
3. Select one or two of the collaborative norms to develop (see chapter 4).
4. Decide what is nonnegotiable.
5. Teach the essentials of group development (see chapter 9).
6. Provide space, tools, and time.
7. Lighten up: Laugh a lot, learn from experience, and locate power within the group.

**We Cannot Not Be Connected**

If there is no other, there will be no self. If there is no self, there will be none to make distinctions.

—Chuang Tzu, Chinese philosopher

Wherever we look, we find only ourselves. This appears to be true at every level of organization of which we can conceive.

Physicist Fritjof Capra (1982), writing about quantum theory, explains that subatomic particles are not isolated grains of matter. Rather, they “are probability patterns, interconnections in an inseparable cosmic web that includes the human observer and her consciousness” (pp. 91–92).

Albert Einstein disclosed that even space and time are products of our five senses. We see and touch things and experience events in sequential order.

Depak Chopra (1993) advises that the atoms of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen that you exhale were, just a moment ago, locked up in solid matter. “Your stomach, liver, heart, lungs and brain are vanishing into thin air, being replaced as quickly and endlessly as they are being broken down” (p. 9).

Scientists and sages seek to understand a universal connectedness in which individual entities exist but have no separation. About the process of self-creation, Wheatley and Kellner-Rogers (1996) say the following:

Differentness comes into the world, a desire to be something separate. From a unified field, individual notions of self arise. This process, like all those that describe self, is enticingly paradoxical. First, something appears for which there is no known antecedent. Where does the self that is organizing originate? Or why does it attempt to separate itself from the unified fields? Why does this movement toward differentiation even start? (p. 51)

Aikido master Thomas Crum recommends that personal boundaries not determine our identity. Boundaries are misperceived if we interpret them as separations from others. If the self does not remember its connectedness, it will expire. Each act of ours creates the conditions for other lives.

Capra (1996) reminds us that to understand our essential interdependence is to understand our relationship to other people and other

> things. “It requires the shifts in perception that are characteristic of systems thinking—from parts to the whole, from objects to relationships, from contents to patterns” (p. 298).

---

#### Community Lives Within

As a friend of ours used to say, “This one is an inside job.” Being in community involves a tension, nearly always present, between self-assertion and integration. It requires an acceptance of the self as both whole and part, a dichotomy described by Arthur Koestler (1972) as holonomy. The word *holonomy* comes from the Greek *holos*, meaning “whole,” and *on*, meaning “part.” This conveys a combination of opposites, functioning autonomously while working interdependently. Although all five energy sources contribute to consciously holonomous living, interdependence makes the most direct contribution.

Ultimately, the success of individuals depends on the success of the community as a whole, and the success of the community depends on the growth and development of each member.

There seems to be no objective reality; perception combined with intention creates reality. As you see a thing, that is what you will have. As you describe a thing, that is what you will see.

---

#### Community Doesn’t Last Forever

Of one thing we are certain: Things change. Experiences accumulate; learning occurs at different rates in different areas for different people. Life stages bring new developmental challenges to the young adult, the middle-age professional, and the person near retirement. Although community is robust and can prevail for long periods, it is also fragile and subject to changing conditions. Groups that lose their capacity to work effectively with conflict plunge back into chaos. They can recover, move back toward organizing conflict away, or move into pseudocommunity. Wheatley and Kellner-Rogers (1996) ask the following questions:

> As we act together in the world, our organization’s identity grows and evolves. It helps periodically to question what we have become. Do we still love this organization? Do we each organize our work from the same shared sense of what is significant? We return to the place where our community took form, where we first became inspired by what we could be in the world. From remembering that place, together we can decide what we want to be now. (p. 62)

---

#### Widening Our View

We’ve been talking about collaboration and being in true community as the cutting edge of our work, the leading edge of professional learning. Yet it might be the oldest story of all human stories. Our ancestors on the plains of Africa lived in collaborative communities: the hunters and the gatherers, the fishers and the cooks, the weavers and the spinners, all working together and sharing a life.

What are the organizers for community? For West African cultures, it is the drum. It is from these cultures that drumming music has become an essential element in the music of much of the world: In South America, Central America, and North America, the beat is present. The Afro-Cuban rhythms sound through salsa, blues, jazz, rock, and country music. The essential difference in the music of the villages of West Africa is that the beat is polyrhythmic—twos, threes, and fours, interacting, intertwining, setting the rhythms for the dance. As West African women pound corn, the children don’t mimic the beat, they clap and pat counter rhythms, seeking their voice within the village.

To be a drummer in this culture is to be a person of distinction. For the drummer not only keeps the rhythm but also knows the history of the people. The drummer calls people to the dance by naming their ancestors: Bring all of who you are to the center and dance.

**Community Doesn’t Just Happen**  
**CHAPTER 14**

The tradespeople are called to the dance with their own signature rhythm—the carpenter, the potter, the weaver, the shepherd. The dancers, too, play off the beat, adding their own rhythm to the mix. The African dancer picks up and responds to the rhythms of one or more drums, depending on his or her skill. In the best dancing, the dancer, like the drummer, adds another rhythm, one that is not already there. The dancer’s ear is tuned to hidden beats, responding to gaps in the music (Chernoff, 1981).

You don’t have to dance on the beat to be part of the village, but you are expected to honor the beat and blend your movement with the movements of others. In fact, to dance with disregard for the beat is considered to be mentally disturbed, because this represents a breakdown of communication, awareness, and community. The goal is to find the beat, honor the beat, add your voice, and dance. Welcome to the dance!

### Appendix A
**Facilitation Strategies and Moves**

---

#### Introduction

Readers of this section will find two sets of protocols for leading groups. One set we will call “Facilitation Moves” and they are labeled as:

| Focus and Maintain Attention | Manage Energy | Grouping |

The 35 moves are distinguished from strategies in that they are often, once learned, used intuitively to support a group, and usually have not more than two parts in contrast to the several steps necessary in most strategies.

Another set we are labeling Facilitation Strategies and includes 125 entries in the following categories:

| Activate and Engage | Process Text & Information 1. Activate and Engage 2. Explore and Discover 3. Organize and Integrate | Generate Ideas | Discourse 1. Dialogue 2. Discuss 3. Decide | Plan | Summarize |

Clear intentions, the ability to read groups, and flexibility are keys to selecting processes to facilitate groups. This compilation of 160 protocols is a resource for varied and flexible approaches to situations encountered by groups: bonding, information processing, marking transitions, giving directions, dialoguing about data, converting negative energy, making decisions, surfacing assumptions, problem solving, starting sessions, and much more. An ultimate goal for facilitators is to invent their own strategies, and familiarity and application of processes in this collection should help build this capacity.

---

#### A Word about Moves

Facilitators make a number of subtle “moves,” perhaps not noticeable unless one is looking for them, that increase or deflect group energy, direct attention, affect information flow, promote memory, communicate respect, and create psychological safety. These are largely nonverbal. We classify them as moves in contrast to a strategy when they are unplanned, executed spontaneously and have no more than one or two parts to them. “Choose Voice,” “Visual Paragraph,” “Finger Minutes,” and “Most Important Twenty Seconds” are examples in this appendix. These, and the majority of nonverbal ideas in this collection emanate from the work of our friend and mentor Michael Grinder (Grinder, 2007).

**What–Why–How**

The fundamental format for offering directions is to use the syntactical pattern of “What,” “Why,” “How.” The “What” is the name of the strategy, structure, or pattern you are proposing for engaging the group. The “Why” is the intention or purpose of that choice. The “How” includes the details and procedures involved in the process. These directions are offered visually whenever possible.

The “Why” is the most essential element for enlisting group member respect for the process and commitment to following the assigned pattern with integrity. “Why” statements offer principles of practice such as: “This strategy presents opportunities for hearing and considering multiple viewpoints without judgment or comment.” Or, “This paired interaction allows partners to engage with the text and each other’s perspectives in a time-efficient manner.”

Notice that this last “Why” statement also embeds a subtle pacing for those participants who value time efficiency and may not always value their colleagues’ contributions. For those participants who enjoy collaborative interactions, the embedded message for them is that the strategy will be time bound so they should respect the protocol and time frames and not get lost in any meandering conversations during the process.

“Why” statements have both immediate and longer-term intentions. The immediate impact is framing the purpose for the task at hand. The longer-term intention is where facilitation overlaps with group development goals. For groups to be ready to engage with increasing cognitive and relational challenges, the skilled facilitator paces both the strategy choice and the “Why’s” at the first meeting, stretching the learning capacities of group members. For novice groups, the “Why’s” will be mostly about the intention of the strategy to help those groups develop basic habits of following directions and working successfully with colleagues. For emerging groups, give the “Why’s” to offer opportunities to stretch collaborative skills so that the group can engage confidently with cognitively and emotionally challenging content.

Finally, all highly evolved processes reoccur in simpler, repeating processes. It is better to know a few processes well than attempt many poorly.

---

**Strategies**

Strategies provide structures for conversations that might otherwise meander, cost unnecessary time, and are less productive. Effective strategies provide four functions: focus, efficiency, development of social skills, and psychological safety. Participants need a certain sense of safety to risk putting one’s ideas on the table, to acknowledge when they do not know, and to participate. Safety is different from comfort. Members should occasionally be uncomfortable in work conversations; if they are not, they are probably not talking about the right issues. Discomfort is the expression of disequilibrium experienced when current knowledge and conceptions give way to new perceptions and solutions. It is a doorway to learning. Yet conversations must be safe enough to learn, contribute, decide, and plan.

To cognitively engage with others, especially in hierarchical groups, requires psychological safety. For some this means an opportunity to talk and not be overridden by others. It means having a sense that one’s contributions are recognized. It means being free of losing face, embarrassment, and feelings of inequality. Very importantly, it also means freedom from having to be certain. To speak always with certainty is one of the greatest barriers to deeply understanding situations and generating informed theories of causation and solution. These four attributes and the simple pattern of turn-taking are characteristic of high-performing groups.

**Selecting a Strategy**

Two considerations are important in selecting strategies. First is the degree of tightness or looseness. Facilitators develop a repertoire of tight to loose structures. When hard-to-talk-about topics are on the table, the facilitator tightens the degree of structure to provide greater emotional safety and more focused thought. Cognitive complexity, high emotion, or new content may call for tight structures. “First Turn/Last Turn” in this appendix is an example of a tight structure. It gives shape to the conversation by providing a focus for talking, naming processes to be used, indicating the cognitive skills required, and setting boundaries for behavior and topic.

When the topic is easier to discuss, less restrictive strategies are used. “Tell the person next to you one of your experiences with this idea.” This is a very loose structure, in which the only musts are the topic and with whom to talk.

Group size also influences safety. In general, pairs are safer than trios, which are safer than quartets and so on. The least safe is the full group conversation.

---

**Task, Relationship, or Process**

A second consideration is the degree of focus on task, relationship, or process. Wellman and Lipton (2004) offer a metaphor of a street entertainer spinning plates. In selecting processes facilitators may choose to give more support to one of three “plates”: task, process, or relationship. As in a vaudeville act, all plates do not require constant attention. The facilitator notices which plate is wobbling and gives that one a little more spin, noting the spin by saying something like, “This interaction has been structured so that you can appreciate the views of others at your table. Notice how others at the table give you ideas you did not have on your own.”

**Main Content (inside a bordered box):**

### Focus First Moves
*Outcome: Members attend to speaker*

Michael Grinder was the first to formulate the *focus attention moves*. He called this concept attention first. The concept is supported by the following moves: stance, freeze gesture, credible voice, and then break and breathe described below. The first three occur simultaneously. While it is common sense to wait for a group to attend, other considerations sometimes improperly override this function. Facilitator fatigue, feeling pressed for time, or having a number of subgroups conversing all at once will sometimes lead to poor practice.

---

#### Break and Breathe✓

**PROCESS**
- When over 90 percent of the group is attending, momentarily break eye contact, perhaps by looking down, then step to one side, engage eye contact again and say “Thank you” in a credible voice.

---

#### Choose voice✓

**PROCESS**
- Use a credible voice. This is congruent with messages that give information and increases the “authority” of what is said.

**NOTES**
- A credible voice has a limited range of modulation and tends to drop at the end of a phrase or sentence. This voice communicates information. An alternative voice is the approachable voice with a higher range of modulation. The approachable voice is somewhat melodic and tends to rise at the end of sentences. This voice is used to elicit responses rather than for gaining attention.

---

#### Stance✓

**PROCESS**
- Assume a credible stance, with an erect posture, arms to the side and straight legs—knees slightly bent--in alignment with shoulders.

- **Freeze Gesture✓**

**PROCESS**
- Hold one gesture still as and after making a call for attention. A gesture might be one or two hands pointing to self, accompanied with the words, “Look this direction, please,” (or words of the facilitator’s choice) delivered in a credible voice.
- Other gestures could include pointing to a chart while maintaining the frozen body. The only principle for selecting a gesture is that the gesture should be above elbow level.

The content is organized into three main facilitation strategies, each with sections for OUTCOME, PROCESS, and TIPS:

---

**Manage Attention**  
*Outcome: Members maintain focus on topic or process*

---

### Above, Pause, Whisper

**OUTCOME**  
Members return attention to facilitator

**PROCESS**
- “Above” in this context means the facilitator’s voice briefly starts above the volume level in the room.
- Listen to the collective voice volume in a group rise and fall.
- As the volume begins to drop from its loudest point, speak a partial phrase in a voice just louder than what you are hearing. Examples are: “As you stop…” or “This next stage…”
- Pause as a momentary hush fills the room, then in a whisper finish your statement. For example, “As you stop….and look this way, the next step will be to locate a new partner and share what you are learning.”

**TIPS**
- The volume of voices in a group cycle every 8 to 10 seconds from high to low. Listen until you can identify these ranges. Timing is essential to achieve the desired effect. The pause in this sequence provides a break in pattern, which brains are hardwired to detect, causing the momentary silence into which you interject directions.

---

### Applause

**OUTCOME**  
Break rapport in subgroups, bring focus to full group

**PROCESS**
- At the close of small group work, ask participants to give themselves a hand.
- Model by clapping your hands.

**TIPS**
- Collective applause generates electro-chemical energy in the brain that contributes to a resourceful learning state.

---

### Cape

**OUTCOME**  
Member returns to topic under discussion

**PROCESS**
- Should a member offer an idea unrelated to the topic being discussed, the facilitator records the idea on a chart and says, “That’s an important idea. Let’s come back to it when we can give it full attention.”

- Some may know this strategy by the name “Parking Lot”.
- Encourage self-directed recording.

**Section: TIPS**
- It is important to return to this item in some way. Options include: at the end of the meeting, in a subgroup after the meeting, or on the next agenda.

---

**Section: Eye Hand Coordination** (bolded and centered)

**OUTCOME**
- Members’ eyes go to where facilitator points

**PROCESS**
- Presenter looks in the direction (s)he points.

**TIPS**
- Member’s eyes look in the direction in which the facilitator looks. Facilitators err when they look at the group while pointing to a chart. This becomes especially important when a facilitator/recorder team is at work. Recorders avoid eye contact with the group so as not to split the group’s attention between the facilitator and recorder.

---

**Section: Finger Minutes** (bolded and centered)

**OUTCOMES**
1. Subgroup awareness they are part of the full group
2. Facilitator has data with which to announce additional time to be allotted the activity

**PROCESS**
- During an activity, ask the group to pause.
- Participants in a group decide how many minutes they need to finish and designate one person to raise his/her hand indicating how many minutes the group needs to finish the activity. Set a limit by indicating a fist (0) to the maximum number of minutes you want to allow (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).
- Name the finger numbers you see so the large group is aware of variation.
- Estimate an average time that you think will allow most groups to finish without frustrating those groups already done.
- Report the remaining time to the group.

**VARIATIONS**
- Without giving a time range, ask groups how much more time they need.

**Description:**
The image is a page from a document or book titled "Facilitation Strategies and Moves" and is labeled as "Appendix A" at the top right. The page is divided into two main sections, each describing a facilitation strategy: "Hand Signal" and "Relevancy Check." Each section is organized into OUTCOME, PROCESS, TIPS, and, for the second section, VARIATIONS.

---

**Transcription:**

---

**Hand Signal**

OUTCOME  
Members return attention to facilitator

PROCESS  
• With frozen body and a frozen gesture, and with eyes downcast, the facilitator raises one hand at right angle to the body and waits until the room is quiet.  
• Members raise their hands, finish their current thought, then silently attend to the facilitator.  
• The facilitator breaks and breathes, says “Thank you” and makes a transition statement to the next order of business.

TIPS  
• Explain this is the most respectful signal you know, as it allows adults to finish their thought before attending to full group business.  
• Using the same spot to do this will begin to anchor the space as a signal to fall quiet and attend.  
• Visually oriented members are first to notice the hand signal, begin to quiet, and then the more auditorily oriented members notice the decrease in volume, and also fall quiet.

---

**Relevancy Check**

OUTCOME  
Member adjusts behavior to match topic

PROCESS  
• A group member says something unrelated to the group’s topic.  
• The facilitator, with an approachable voice, says, “Name, help us understand how your comment relates to the topic being explored?”  
• Speakers will either explain the relevance, in which case the conversation proceeds, or takes it off the table.

VARIATIONS  
• The facilitator records the item on chart paper announcing the group will return to it at an appropriate time.  
• See the strategy Cape elsewhere on this list.

TIPS  
• A topic delayed must be returned to at some stage. Options include: subgroup after the meeting, added to this or next meeting agenda, or a subgroup drafts a statement about the topic to be talked about at the next meeting.

**The Adaptive School**

---

**Stand and Share**

**OUTCOME**
Members self-organize group reporting: Rather than depend on the facilitator to choose who speaks next, members look to who else might be standing and adjust reporting sequences accordingly

**PROCESS**
- The facilitator explains that when members hear the direction “Stand and Share,” the group manages the order in which members report.
- When a member stands, if no one else is standing, the member shares. If others are standing, by verbal or non-verbal communication they arrange the order of reporting.

**TIPS**
- Any move that releases member dependency on a facilitator contributes to self-directed learning and the reality that it is the “group’s group”. Facilitators reinforce this by assuming members will read page numbers on slides and not need to hear the facilitator’s voice.

---

**Show, Don’t Say**

**OUTCOMES**
1. Attend to facilitator’s instructions or
2. separate facilitator from data

**PROCESS**
- The facilitator holds two fingers in the air and says, “You have this many minutes.”
- Hold the posture and gesture until members have visually acknowledged the signal and have gone back to work.

**VARIATIONS**
- Stand to the side of a chart (or whatever the visual focus is to be) so that you, the chart, and the group form a triangle. Swing your shoulders and arm into a pointing gesture toward the chart. Keep your eyes on the chart. Be silent.
- Use in a conference when presenting difficult to accept data (e.g., with a parent to document student’s late assignments).

**TIPS**
- Use the variation when you want to direct energy away from you or toward important information the group can read by itself. Look at the data, not at the group. The group’s eyes will go where yours are focused; you want them to be examining the data toward which you are pointing.

The image is a page from a document titled "Facilitation Strategies and Moves" from Appendix A. The page number is 207. The content is organized into sections with headings, subheadings, bullet points, and tables. Here is a detailed description and transcription of the text:

---

**Facilitation Strategies and Moves**  
**APPENDIX A**

---

**PROCESS**
- Stand in one space and speak.
- Without speaking, break eye contact, move to a new space, pause and resume speaking.

**VARIATIONS**
- If seated, change position in chair by leaning forward, to one side or backward.

---

**Yes, Start**

**OUTCOME**  
Members confirm they are ready to start

**PROCESS**
- After giving directions for an activity, the facilitator remains standing, motionless, and visually scans the group for about 20 seconds.

**TIPS**
- When the facilitator remains motionless after giving directions, members get the message that they are to start the activity. Should members glance at a facilitator who is moving during the first 20 seconds, the message is that it is not necessary to start yet. Michael Grinder discovered this and named it *The Most Important 20 Twenty Seconds*.

| Focus and Maintain Attention | **Manage Energy** | Grouping |

---

**Airplane Stacking**

**OUTCOMES**
1. Reduce or eliminate member anxiety when facilitator calls on speakers
2. Members hear ideas of others because they’re not worried about their place in a queue

**PROCESS**
- Explain metaphor related to control tower at airport directing the order in which planes are to land.
- Assign numbers to those with raised hands. Advise them to remember their number.
- Call on #1, then #2 and so on.
- Do not comment on participant responses. If a question is posed, list on a flip chart for later attention.
- When more hands are raised, add these to this list or start another list.

**Choreograph an Opening (Kendall Zoller)**

**OUTCOMES**
1. Acknowledge resistance
2. Members achieve states of neutrality or acceptance

---

The page is formatted with clear headings, bullet points, and a table, making it easy to follow the facilitation strategies and their intended outcomes.

--- Page Break ---

Certainly! Here is a detailed description and transcription of the content in the image:

---

**The Adaptive School**

---

**PROCESS**
- “Thank you for coming.” High eye contact with group. Use credible and approachable voice. Open, palms up gesture.
- “On the agenda are four topics.” Credible voice, look at agenda, pause after reading each topic. Turn to the group, freeze body, and count internally 3,2,1.
- “Before we start.” Walk a few feet from the flip chart (presentation space).
- “I imagine some of you would rather be in classrooms today. And for good reason. Rooms need to be set up, final touches done for opening day and materials need to be organized.” Gesture outside, toward classrooms. Pause periodically. Use credible voice, pause, and internally count 3,2,1. Then move halfway back to the flip chart.
- “At the same time, given your passion for serving students in the most complete ways possible, you may be wondering what can happen here that can make this worth your while.” Approachable voice. Palms up gesturing to group. Inclusive language.
- “The first topic today is _________.” Walk back toward flip chart. Look at and point to flip chart. Credible voice.

**VARIATIONS**
- Language choices: some of you, all of you, a few of you, many of you.

**TIPS**
- Language for reasons for being in classrooms and passion for students needs to be artfully vague. If it is too specific, you will lose some listeners, as they say to themselves, “That is not me.”

---

**Closing the Window**

**OUTCOMES**
1. Alert group time is ending
2. Members know time for process is ending

**PROCESS**
The facilitator says, “You have this much time left on this topic,” while moving hands closer together starting at shoulder width apart.

**TIPS**
- Move hands slowly together while scanning the group for any signals someone wants to speak.
- This strategy may stimulate contributions from people who have been sitting on an idea but have not yet said it.

---

**Decontaminate Problem Space**

**OUTCOMES**
1. Regain positive energy
2. Members regain resourcefulness, often evidenced by posture, facial expressions, etc.

---

### PROCESS
- Locations evoke memory. When a negative or counterproductive statement has been made, the location from which it was made evokes emotional recall.
- Step away from any location in which a statement distressing to the group was made by anyone.

**VARIATIONS**
- If the person introducing you is disliked by the group, or says something that causes distress, begin your work in any space other than the space occupied by the introducer.
- If you say something clumsy or offensive, step out of the space in which it was said, point back to the space and say, “Did he say that?” Or “That was wrong, I apologize for that.”
- Rooms also evoke memories. If required to work in a room in which participants have negative reactions, redesign the workspace and change furniture arrangements.

**TIPS**
- The stronger the emotional message, the greater the decontamination effort. Move to the back of the room to decontaminate the effect of intense negative messages.

---

#### Foreshadow

**OUTCOMES**
1. Signal a transition
2. Members anticipate next events

**PROCESS**
- Before a break, name the next topic or activity to occur.

**VARIATIONS**
- Build suspense by not naming the topic but suggesting that the information will be surprising.

**TIPS**
- Anticipation serves the function of an advance organizer.

---

#### PAG/PAU (Process as Given, Process as Understood) (Doyle and Strauss)

**OUTCOMES**
1. Check for understanding
2. Members are clear about the next process(es)

**PROCESS**
- With a credible voice, the facilitator gives directions for the next activity.
- Next, the facilitator pauses, breaks eye contact, silently moves to a new space and in an approachable voice says, “Just to be sure that I stated that clearly, what are you about to do?”

**VARIATIONS**
- Ask specific questions such as “What will you do first, next, etc.?”
- Invite pairs or table groups to clarify directions.

THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL

---

**TIPS**
- This strategy respectfully places any failure of communication with the facilitator.
- The effectiveness of the message is enhanced because it is communicated in space, voice and language.

---

**Satisfy, Satisfy, Delay (Michael Grinder)**

**OUTCOMES**
1. Recover positive energy
2. Members attention are diverted from distressing member

**PROCESS**
- The facilitator notices that when one particular group member speaks, the group appears annoyed. The signals might be eye rolling, deep sighs, or facial expressions.
- Noticing this is a pattern, at the third time this member asks to be recognized, the facilitator does NOT call on the member, but calls on another, or closes the conversation.
- Later, make an attempt to rehabilitate this member’s status in the group by calling positive attention to a later contribution.

**VARIATIONS**
- Move to another part of the room and ask if anyone from that area would like to add something.
- Direct pairs to talk on a related topic.

**TIPS**
- The facilitator’s relationship is with the group, not an individual.

---

**Signal Role Change**

**OUTCOMES**
1. Role clarity
2. Members know the person facilitating has left that role

**PROCESS**
- When facilitating a meeting and wanting to contribute content, ask, “May I add something?” The group usually will concur.
- Move off to the side of the group. From this space, make a contribution in a credible voice.
- Without speaking, return to the facilitation space. In an approachable voice ask. “OK. Let’s move on,” or “How does that add to your thinking?”

**VARIATIONS**
- Instead of moving off to the side of the group, ask a participant to stand in your place while you occupy that seat and make your contribution.
- If seated, signal the change by broad changes in posture, e.g., leaning back, removing glasses, briefly standing.

The image is a page from a document titled "Facilitation Strategies and Moves" from "Appendix A." The page number at the bottom right is 211. The content is organized into sections with headings, outcomes, processes, variations, and tips.

---

**TIPS**
- Physical signals are essential. Without them, some will not realize you are temporarily stepping out of the role and feel the processes are less than honest.

---

**Stop. Redirect**

**OUTCOMES**
1. Maintain one topic at a time
2. Member off topic will save comment for more appropriate time

**PROCESS**
- In a credible voice say, “Name, please hold on to that idea. We will return to it in a moment”.
- Accompany words with slight move toward the participant with arms hugging opposing arms as in “holding on”.

**VARIATIONS**
- See Caping and Relevancy Check.
- Vary language and non-verbal expressions to match the culture of the group.

**TIPS**
- Use when a group member has violated the one topic at a time standard.
- You have permission to use this only when the group is clear about the topic and the one topic at a time standard.

---

**Third Point**

**OUTCOME**
- Direct attention

**PROCESS**
- Get the group to look at a screen or flip chart by using a frozen hand gesture pointed toward the screen and directing your own eyes at the screen.
- Walk away without making eye contact with the group. The group will continue to look at the screen.

**VARIATIONS**
- Direct attention to a section of text for members to interact with.

**TIPS**
- The group’s eyes go where the facilitator’s eyes are directed. When the facilitator maintains eye contact, this is two-point communication.
- Three-point communication separates the message from the messenger.
- When two-point communication is used related to hard-to-talk-about data, the facilitator is considered to be connected to the problem.

The image is a page from a book titled "The Adaptive School." The page contains structured instructional content for facilitators, divided into three main sections: **TAG/TAU (Topic as Given/Topic as Understood)**, **Volunteer Stand**, and **Yellow Light**. Each section outlines outcomes, processes, variations, and tips for group facilitation techniques.

---

### TAG/TAU (Topic as Given/Topic as Understood) (Doyle and Strauss)

**OUTCOMES**
1. Check for understanding
2. Members are clear about the next topic

**PROCESS**
- With a credible voice, the facilitator names the next topic or task, with the information clearly displayed on a chart.
- The presenter defines key words.
- Next, the facilitator pauses, breaks eye contact, silently moves to a new space and in an approachable voice says, “Just to be sure that I stated that clearly, what is the next topic (or task)?”

**VARIATIONS**
- Ask pairs or table groups to restate the topic and report to the group.

**TIPS**
- Like PAG/PAU, the effectiveness of the message is enhanced because it is communicated in space, voice and language.

---

### Volunteer Stand

**OUTCOMES**
1. Redirect energy
2. Surprise and laughter

**PROCESS**
- Announce the need for a spokesperson for each group.
- Ask a volunteer from each group to stand.
- Ask for applause for the standing members’ willingness to serve.
- Instruct standing members to raise their right hand, move in a circle above their heads, and allow the hand to drop on the shoulder of the person who will be spokesperson for the group.

**VARIATIONS**
- Add anything that will add to the suspense and light atmosphere of the instructions.

**TIPS**
- It is not necessary for members to remain standing.
- You may have to coax volunteers from some groups.

---

### Yellow Light

**OUTCOMES**
- Signal transition
- Members mentally prepare for transition

---

**Header:**

- "APPENDIX A" (top right)

---

**PROCESS**
- Stop the group and gain attention.
- Indicate how many minutes are left in the activity.

**VARIATIONS**
- Use Show, Don’t Say in this appendix instead of verbally announcing the remaining time.
- Indicate that if groups have not started on ____ task they should do so now, as only _____ minutes remain.
- When groups are deep at work in lengthy tasks, move to groups silently and show a large sign showing the remaining minutes.

**TIPS**
- Use this to prepare members for transitions.

---

There is a table with three columns:
- Focus and Maintain Attention | Manage Energy | Grouping

---

**Grouping To Regroup and Energize**

**COMMENTS**
- When seating is modified, members extend their conceptual horizons by interacting with people with differing experiences, perspectives and roles. Regrouping participants has the additional advantage of adding energy when members have been engaged in an activity for a length of time. Four principles apply in regrouping:
    - First alert members that a partner change is ahead. The Pack and Stack signal described below accomplishes this.
    - Choice is the second principle. Repeated choice supports perspectives of self-directedness and efficacy.
    - The third principle is diversity. Over the course of a meeting provide opportunities for members to meet with others least likely to encounter in the flow of their work.
    - Fourth and finally is an immediate prompt. Assigning people a topic can be used to either summarize what just occurred or activate and engage members on the topic to enter. A prompt also preserves meeting time by directing immediate attention to the next task.
- If energy is needed, create pairs through use of learning partners, eye contact partners, shoe partners or any device that will get people to move about the room.
- First, give instructions on the structure of the task, then name the partner with whom they will be working.
- Participants need to stack, pack and move their possessions.

**PROCESSES**
- Distribute playing cards in a specific fashion. For example, place sets of three similar cards (e.g., Aces) randomly throughout the room, or sets of two distributed in a similar manner.
- Instruct members to locate a card partner, sit and respond to a prompt.

---

**High Fives**

**OUTCOME**
Energize and randomly regroup

**PROCESSES**
- Demonstrate three persons grasping hands above their heads for a “high five.”
- Instruct members to stand with one hand in the air. Locate and grasp a hand of two other persons. This is the group for the next task.
- Sit and respond to a prompt.

---

**Learning Partners**

**OUTCOME**
Members choose four partners for future paired work

**PROCESSES**
- Provide a page displaying four partner choices. These might be seasons, places on a clock, sports teams or other symbols meaningful to the group.
- Instruct members to make appointments with four people. If using a clock, for example, members would choose a partner for 3, 6, 9, and 12 o’clock and record the appointments on the provided page.
- Check to see that each has a partner for each partner space. Form partnerships from those indicating they are missing the same partner slot.
- Indicate a space to which members can move if they cannot locate their partner. If no one is available to pair with, advise them to join the brightest group.

---

**Mix-Freeze-Pair**

**OUTCOME**
Energize and regroup

**PROCESS**
- Instruct members to stand and move around the room.
- At a signal, freeze and pair with the nearest person.
- Sit together and respond to a prompt.

The image is a page from a document titled "Facilitation Strategies and Moves" (Appendix A). The page contains detailed descriptions of several facilitation strategies, including their outcomes, purposes, intentions, and processes. Here is a detailed breakdown:

---

### **Stack and Pack**
**OUTCOMES**
- Alert members that a transition is coming in which they will be moving their materials to work in a seat different from the one in which they are now seated.

**PROCESS**
- Display a stack and pack slide.
- Initially, explain that this slide indicates a transition is about to occur in which members will bundle their materials in readiness to sit with new partners.

---

### **Facilitator Strategies**
- Purposes and intentions are shown for each strategy. These are the rationale a facilitator would have for using the strategy.

| Activate and Engage | Process Text & Information | Generate Ideas | Discourse | Plan | Summarize |
|---------------------|---------------------------|---------------|-----------|------|-----------|
|                     | 1. Activate and Engage    |               | 1. Dialogue |      |           |
|                     | 2. Explore and Discover   |               | 2. Discuss  |      |           |
|                     | 3. Organize and Integrate |               | 3. Decide   |      |           |

---

### **Analogy Prompts**
*Activate Ideas Corresponding to a Challenge*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
- Access and transfer concepts to a current situation.

**PROCESS**
- Pose prompts as analogies such as:
  - How do runners manage to have a speed-up kick left for the finish?
  - How did the stagecoaches of the American West manage to race across great distances in just a few days?
  - How do the answers to the above relate to a challenge faced by the group?

**EXAMPLE**
- Making the observation that stagecoaches changed horses frequently, might lead to the idea of rotating and delegating school improvement tasks.

---

### **Banned Words**
*Inclusion*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
- Evoke humor, playfulness, and efficacy in reluctant or discouraged group.

**PROCESS**
- Table groups identify a few words they would like banned from this session.
- One or two words are heard from each group and charted.
- The group agrees to collectively groan whenever one of these words are heard.
- The group practices the groan.

| Thank you for coming | Eye contact with group. Mix credible and approachable voice with an open, palms up gesture. |
| As if you had a choice | Pause with the hands vertical. Stand still and wait for a laugh. |
| On the agenda are four topics | Look and gesture toward the agenda. Use a credible voice and pause after each topic. After the last statement, turn to the group, stand still and count internally 3,2, 1. |
| I imagine a number of you would rather be prepping your classrooms today and are disappointed that this has turned out to be a work day instead of a classroom day as promised. | Without talking, walk a few feet from the easel. |
| There is good reason to want to be in classrooms, it is where our passion lies, directly supporting students. | Gesture outside toward the classrooms. Pause periodically. Use a credible voice. At the end, stand still, pause, and silently count 2, 3, 1. Then move halfway back to the easel. |
| As you know, there is the passionate part you have for your students’ well being. At the same time you may be wondering what information I could get here that would even increase the value of my support. How long might you be willing to listen to determine if the information is useful? What might it take to see how useful the information might be? | Approachable voice. With palm up gesturing, use inclusive language. (our). Take a few steps toward the front center of the group. Approachable voice. Gestures of inclusion, palms up. Use downward beat gestures to accompany the words of your message like a maestro directing an orchestra. (passionate – part – of you – students). Pause, stand still, and silently count 3-2-1 . . . |
| And out first agenda item is - | Turn and walk toward easel, point to first agenda item using a new voice pattern, state the first agenda item. |

---

**Section: Diversity Rounds (Inclusion)**

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Seek and identify likenesses in others, understand sameness and differences within group, and relate personal experience to topic.

**PROCESS**
- Indicate directions will be purposively vague so members can decide which subgroup they will report to.
- The facilitator chooses categories that fit the group’s purpose going from lesser to greater levels of sensitivity. Examples: birth order, decade of birth, gender, cognitive style, time in the organization, ethnicity.
- As each category is named stand and search for three or four people that fit criteria.
- How has this identity criteria shaped or influenced you as a professional?
- Eight to ten minutes.
- Hear reports from group.
- The facilitator names a new category and the pattern is repeated three or four times.
- Next, members write responses to prompts such as: “What I am noticing about myself, the group, and the effect of being in various subgroups”; “How I feel about the various subgroups that I selected; and what might we do to maximize the attributes of the various subgroups.”
- Responses are shared in heterogeneous groups.
- Each group develops a summary paraphrase of their findings and recommendations.

**ALTERNATIVES**
- Instead of journal entries, small groups might converse about their responses to the prompts.

**TIPS**
- Best for a group of at least twenty people. If group becomes too large, divide into smaller subgroups.

**Section 2:**

**Four Box Synectics**  
*Activate and Engage*

**PURPOSES AND INTENTIONS**  
Evoke energy, creativity, and humor related to new topic.

**PROCESS**
- On chart paper, draw a 2 × 2 box. Post.
- A recorder at each table group draws a similar box to collect table group’s thinking.
- Elicit recommendations for an object or concept to place in each of the boxes. Suggest each time that the next recommendation be as different as possible from the previous recommendation (Ex: lamppost, sailboat, hammer, daisy or shopping, sailing, cleaning, fishing).
- Instruct table groups to brainstorm three or four responses for each box to the prompt you provide. (Ex: “Professional communities are like a lamppost because ____________.” “Professional communities are like a sailboat because ____________.”)
- Give groups two minutes to select their best items and a spokesperson.
- Elicit responses from table groups using the full phrase: “A professional community is like a lamppost because __________.”

**VARIATIONS**
- People synectics. Provide each table group with three to five postcards that have images of famous persons. Ensure that postcards represent diversity.
- Direct table groups to talk about what they know about each person on the cards.
- Have table groups select one card and complete the phrase: (name the person) is like (the topic you are working on) because __________.
- Complete the phrase: (name the person) is NOT like (the topic you are working on) because __________.
- Synectic questions can be posed. “What game are you playing in this organization?” Responses carry insights and humor, as, “We are playing badminton in a hurricane.”

**TIPS**
- Explain that “Synectics” is derived from two Greek roots: *syn* (bringing together) and *ectics* (diverse elements). This activity draws from the metaphoric brain which holds information holistically.

### PROCESS

- Individuals write data on 3 × 5 card. (Ex: name, role, agency, time I spend doing __________, a trick of the trade about __________, a technique that works for me during __________.)
- Members move about room and share the information on their card with another person. Members paraphrase and inquire so they can, in a moment, share their partner’s card and information with another person.
- At signal, members trade cards.
- Members then locate a new partner and share the new card and information they just acquired with their new partner.
- At a signal, return to table groups. Share what you learned.
- As a group, identify what patterns or themes you detected.

#### VARIATIONS

- Go a third round.
- Provide a template for the sharing of patterns. “There were three themes here, __________, __________, and __________.”
- Use to activate concepts such as, “A belief I have about adult learners is. . . .”

### Greeting Circle
*Inclusion*

#### PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS
Access affective states and establish a sense of group and self within group.

#### PROCESS

- Form a circle.
- The facilitator (or designated person) moves inside the circle and greets the person to his or her left.
- They continue inside the circle greeting each person in turn.
- Those who have been greeted follow the person who greeted them inside the circle.
- When the facilitator returns to his or her original location, those inside the circle continue to greet them, a second time.
- This time, the person inside the circle is the greeter, not the greeted. This balances the circle.
- When the greeting is complete, ask two questions. (1) How do you feel about the activity? (2) What did you learn from it that will make you successful?

#### VARIATIONS

- Moving right around the circle.

#### TIPS

- No ritual is older, and none more anxiety-ridden, than that of greeting each other. The natural tendency is to seek out those one is comfortable with, those who are like them.

**Image Description:**
The image is a page from a book titled "The Adaptive School." The page contains structured text with bullet points and headings, focusing on group facilitation techniques. The content is divided into sections with bolded headings and subheadings, and there are two main activities described: "Group Groan" and "Grounding." The page number at the bottom is 220.

---

**Transcription:**

---

- The greeting circle allows the anxiety and apprehension of the individuals to be encountered. It releases energy into the room in the sound of high voices, and laughter.
- The emotional material must be expressed first to allow learning to take place. It grounds the person in the moment and allows people to be real.
- Useful as a grounding for sessions on conflict, hard-to-talk about topics and, or when, two or more groups are brought together for difficult conversations.

---

**Group Groan**  
*Inclusion*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Through humor, induce ownership and responsibility for personal reactions in the session.

**PROCESS**
- Table groups list what are the best and worst things that can happen in this session.
- Hear a few and record them on flip charts.
- Make an agreement that should any of the worst things occur, all will participate in a group groan.
- Practice the groan once.

**VARIATIONS**
- Give think time before receiving items.
- With groups of twelve or less, elicit both best and worst from the full group. Record in two columns.

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Activate internal resources for addressing sensitive topics with respect and skill.

**PROCESS**
- Form groups of four, six, or eight.
- Explain that the purpose for this activity is to set a norm for respectful listening, to get everyone’s voice in the room in a manner that is nonconfrontational, to allow people to connect with one another, to allow for the expressions of hopes and apprehensions, to value thinking and feeling, and to surface agendas that might not otherwise be heard.
- Explain the procedure:
  ◦ Members take turns talking.
  ◦ When one member talks, all others are silent.
  ◦ Full non-verbal attention is given to the speaker.
  ◦ After everyone has talked, the first speaker will summarize what was said.
  ◦ When the members indicate that they understand the process, the facilitator names the first speaker. Alert in advance.

**Facilitation Strategies and Moves**  
**APPENDIX A**

- Post on a flip chart what members are to talk about:
  ◦ My name is . . .
  ◦ My relationship to this topic is . . .
  ◦ My expectations are . . .
  ◦ How I feel about being here is . . .
- When all groups are finished, the facilitator calls on the first person in each group to give a summary statement to the full assembly.

**VARIATIONS**
- Another prompt might be: What is the commitment that brought you into this room?
- With twelve members, the grounding can be done with the full group.

**TIPS**
- Since this activity’s primary purpose is to provide participants’ with an opportunity to be heard, this activity operates on earth time, not clock time.
- Use when a meeting is going to address hard-to-talk-about topics. The harder the topic is to talk about, the more valuable the full group grounding is.
- With a group size of forty to fifty people, this activity might take as much as forty-five minutes.

---

**Hopes and Fears**  
*Inclusion*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTION**  
Establish common ground and normalize member’s reaction to setting or topic.

**PROCESS**
- Briefly write your fears and hopes about this session or topic.
- Pairs share their greatest fear and greatest hope.
- Quartets meet (pairs squared) and identify themes in fears and hopes.
- Report themes to full group.
- Facilitator makes comments to normalize fears and identify common hopes.

**VARIATIONS**
- Pairs report all fears and hopes.
- Conduct process as full group with facilitator eliciting and charting.

**TIPS**
- With either alternative, start with private reflection.

**I’m In**  
*Inclusion*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**

**The Adaptive School**

---

**PROCESS**
- Members go around the circle briefly naming anything on their mind. (Examples: “I’m concerned about my eighth grader. She says she doesn’t have any friends. I know she is just down and does have friends. I’m figuring out how to handle this. OK. I’m in.” or “I’ve never had a third grade class so excited about creative writing. Their enthusiasm lifts me up every day. OK. I’m in.”)
- Stress that there is no side talk.
- At the end, make a summary paraphrase.

**VARIATIONS**
- Be the first speaker to model brevity.

**TIPS**
- Stop anyone who interrupts a speaker.
- Should someone ask to pass, that is OK, though we suggest not offering that as an option as you set up the activity.

---

**Knots (Bob Chadwick)**
*Inclusion*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Leaving the familiarity of words, kinesthetically forming a working group. Evoke humor and energy.

**PROCESS**
- Form groups of eight. Form a circle.
- Everyone places left hand in circle and grasps the hand of ONE other person whose hand is in the circle.
- Now place right hands in circle and grasp the hand of ONE other person whose hand is in the circle.
- Everyone now should be holding the hands of two other people.
- Without letting go of the grips, untangle the human knot.

**VARIATIONS**
- Place the right hand in first.

**TIPS**
- Groups of six to eight are ideal. Ten are possible. Twelve are too many.

**Section 1:**
- **PROCESS**
  - Label chart paper with three columns: Know; Think You Know, Want to Know.
  - Give topic to groups and have them complete the charts.
  - Post charts and have group look for patterns and themes.

- **VARIATIONS**
  - Facilitator responds to the Want to Know columns by providing responses to the large group.

- **TIPS**
  - If groups disagree on the “Know” column, encourage them to place content in the “Think You Know” column.

---

**Section 2:**
- Centered, bolded and italicized title:  
  **Like Me**  
  *Inclusion*

- **PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
  - Recognize sense of self within community.

- **PROCESS**
  - Participants move chairs back from tables so it will be easy to stand if appropriate.
  - Name categories like “my work is done at the elementary level, high school, middle school central office,” or “I have been in this district five or more years, ten, twenty, thirty, more,” or “I am a teacher, principal, consultant, etc.” or I am typically up before 6:00 a.m.”
  - As people stand, remind them to look around and see who else is also in that group.
  - Finally ask the question “other” regarding roles. In other words if your role has not been called, please stand. The facilitator asks standing members to state their roles.

- **VARIATIONS**
  - For parent groups change the prompts. My first child in this school, I attended this school, I speak a language other than English, etc.

- **TIPS**
  - Because this strategy is done as an inclusion activity when you do not yet have relationship with the group, it is important to state the multiple purposes of inclusion activities like this: They include setting norms of participation, focusing mental energy inside the room, answering the question who am I in relation to others in the room and beginning the journey from an aggregate of individuals to a group.
  - The category “other” is essential. People feel left out if their role is not acknowledged.
  - DO NOT ask participants to say “like me” when they stand. Perhaps appropriate for elementary children, it is embarrassing for adults.

--- Page Break ---

The image is a page from a book titled "The Adaptive School." The page provides detailed instructions for several group activities designed to energize and engage participants. Here is a detailed description and transcription of the text:

---

**PROCESSES**
- Announce that the purpose is to regroup and energize.
- Designate a space in the room for members with low responses to stand and members with high responses to stand. Others will form a line representing their response in relationship to those two points.
- Provide a topic [e.g., how hot people like their salsa, birthdates (not year), alphabetically by desired profession or other topics.]
- Sample responses from different parts of the line-up.
- Cluster people into working groups by counting off, or moving along the line by threes, fours, or whatever group size desired.

**VARIATIONS**
- Have one-half of the line step forward. They walk toward the other half forming a double line with people facing each other. Facing members become partners for the next activity.

**TIPS**
- Structure line-ups around the perimeter of the room for the best use of space.
- Choose topic based on group’s knowledge of each other; intact groups might be more interested in alternative professions than groups who do not know each other.

---

**My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean**
*Activate and Engage*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Recover energy as it begins to wane.

**PROCESS**
- Describe the purpose of this activity is to promote energy for the next portion of the meeting.
- Lead the group in singing “My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean.” When the letter “B” is used in the song stand if you have been seated, and sit if you have been standing.

**TIPS**
- Advise members to take care of any physical needs during the activity. Protect knees, back.

---

**Pair-Share**
*Activate and Engage*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTION**
Quickly energize a group to stimulate engagement on a topic. Facilitators use this to energize, activate, and engage or to give self-recovery time when stumped.

**PROCESS**
- Assign pairs.
- Direct them to “Talk with the person next to you for three minutes about ________.”

---

**VARIATIONS**
- Have members work with the “person behind them” for novelty and added energy.
- Use trios.

---

**Paired Verbal Fluency (see also Generate Ideas)**
*Activate and Engage*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Recall prior knowledge.

**PROCESS**
- Form pairs.
- Describe the process:
  - A and B will take turns responding to a prompt.
  - At a signal one will speak and one will listen.
  - At a signal the other will speak while the first speaker listens.
  - Each time, no one is allowed to repeat anything that was said by the other.
  - Check for clarification.
- Repeat the cycle two or three times. For activating prior knowledge:
  - First round twenty seconds each.
  - Second round forty seconds each.
  - Third round sixty seconds each.
- For organizing and integrating:
  - First round sixty seconds each.
  - Second round forty seconds each.
  - Third round twenty seconds each.

**VARIATIONS**
- Gauge the time allotted for the second and third round by the level of participant engagement. The purpose for the declining amounts of time is to focus thinking. The purpose of the increasing amounts of time is to broaden thinking.

**TIPS**
- Announce the time allotted for rounds only after the exercise is completed so participants can apply this strategy elsewhere without knowing the structure until experiencing it.

---

**People, Places, Things Cards (PPT Cards)**
*Activate and Engage*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Provide a variation of an A/E activity through attention to third point objects.

**PROCESS**
- Place cards on each table. These may be postcards of famous people, pictures of places or things cut out from magazines.

**Description:**
The image is a page from a book titled "The Adaptive School." The page contains structured text divided into sections with headings, bullet points, and tips. The content focuses on group activities and processes for engaging participants, such as using cards for questions, conducting a "People Search," and proposing working agreements. The page number at the bottom is 226.

---

**Transcription:**

---

**THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL**

- Ask table groups to engage in a question regarding the cards. (See variations below.)
- Share with large group.

**VARIATIONS**
- Put enough People, Thing, or Place Cards on a table so that each person can chose one. Ask a processing question (e.g., “Which picture best describes where you are in your journey right now?”). Ask each person to share their response with their table.
- Put one Person Card on each table and ask table to fill in the blanks with a stem. (E.g., ______ is like a facilitator because: ______ ; ______ is not like a facilitator because ______.) Each table shares with large group.
- Use Thing Cards for a Visual Synectics.

**TIPS**
- Be sure People Cards represent diversity.

---

**People Search**

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Information Processing: Activating and Engaging/Organizing and Integrating.

**PROCESS**
- Construct a handout listing content information being learned (e.g., can name seven norms of collaboration) or ways in which participants might have applied content (e.g., used a norm in a meeting) or interesting information about participants (e.g., drives a sports car). Provide a space by each item for a name to be recorded.
- Ask participants to stand and find one person who can respond positively to an item on the page. The participant places the person’s name beside the item, thanks the person, and then finds another person who can respond to another item.
- Continue until time is called, filling blanks with different names.

**VARIATIONS**
- Provide a prompt with each item so that participants engage in a brief conversation about the effect of that item.

**TIPS**
- Be sure participants understand that they must ask each other questions; they cannot just hand their sheet to a person and ask them to sign one of the lines.
- Use information about participants to help people get to know each other.
- Use content information to connect people to their learning.

**PROCESS**
- Display and describe posted Working Agreements as shown below.
- Describe Sufficient Consensus and its benefits as shown in this appendix.
- Ask if members can agree to these during this meeting.

**ALTERNATIVES**
- Eliminate sufficient consensus.
- Have the group develop meeting Working Agreements.
- Once a group has agreed to these Working Agreements, print them on each succeeding agenda.

**TIPS**
- Working agreements are not always needed or wise as they might signal negative presuppositions about a group’s working capacity.
- When time is short and the meeting routine, this process can respectfully set agreements.
- Group-developed agreements may be useful when little working experience or trust exists.

**Paragraph:**

Strategies in this section are conversation containers. They support learning in that learning takes place only when processed by learners. They are valuable because they provide structures for talking about information making it more likely that conversations are efficient, focused, and safely allow full participation. They are designed to draw meaning from text or other sources, analyze, infer, develop hypotheses, extend ideas, relate content to selves, entertain questions, or reconsider and tentatively refine new ways of understanding. Because members come to a group with multiple cognitive styles and various levels of social skills and interests, strategies that name specific ways of talking and the cognitive processes to be used bring these diverse styles of individuals to common working focus.

The image is a page from a book titled "The Adaptive School." The content on the page discusses strategies for facilitating group learning, specifically focusing on the final phases of Lipton and Wellman’s (1998) learning model. The text is organized into paragraphs and a structured activity description.

**Detailed Description and Transcription:**

---

**Main Body:**
- The text explains that strategies from the previous section (Activate and Engage) are used to include activities or trigger prior knowledge before new learning. The current section introduces the final two phases of Lipton and Wellman’s learning model, where learners process data in various ways to make it their own. These phases are:
  - **Explore and Discover**
  - **Organize and Integrate**

- **Explore and Discover** is used when new content is introduced and must be processed by learners. Various methods are suggested, such as paired reading, lecturette, case study, demonstration, and inventories. Learners must use cognitive processing to explore new content, often using strategies like “Key Concepts/Key Ideas,” which involve identifying and reflecting on important parts of a text.

- The third phase, **Organize and Integrate**, involves participants organizing and integrating their learning to make it uniquely their own. This includes developing personal organizational schemas, cataloguing and indexing new understandings, developing frameworks, synthesizing, and evaluating learning.

- The text also discusses the role of skilled facilitators in selecting strategies, considering factors such as group skill, topic complexity, group composition, time, and group size.

---

**Activity Section:**

**3-2-1 Plus 1**
*Explore and Discover*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Recall and explain previous learning or what occurred at a recent event.

**PROCESS**
- Members draw a right-hand margin on a piece of paper. Label the margin “Plus 1.”
- Individuals in groups of three or four write three key ideas they remember from the last meeting, two things they want to explore, and one point to ponder.
- Next, round-robin sharing of one idea from each category. As members share, listeners may record personal notes in the right-hand margin.
- Plus 1 refers to notes members take as they listen to others.

**VARIATIONS**
- Start the sharing at the second item (Two things to explore) as more value probably comes from the second two categories.
- Process the activity with the full group.

The content is divided into two main sections, each describing a different facilitation strategy:

---

**5-3-1  
Organize and Integrate**

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Interdependently synthesize information.

**PROCESSES**
- Members identify five words that represent today’s learning.
- Share the ideas, one at a time, in round-robin fashion. Explore the ideas as they emerge.
- Select three central ideas.
- If these three ideas were to go into a container with a label, what would that label be?

**ALTERNATIVES**
- Use for what you want to remember from today’s meeting or accomplishments.
- See “Most Important Point,” “Scrambled Sentences,” or “Three Balloons” in this collection.

**TIPS**
- Foreshadow several steps, but do not tell name of strategy.
- Use as follow-up to instruction.
- Vary the prompts.

**TIPS**
- Assign time, perhaps twelve minutes, so the group stays focused and brief.

---

**A B Each Teach  
Explore and Discover**

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Explain content from text or other input.

**PROCESS**
- Pairs designate one partner as “A” and one as “B.”
- Person “A” reads one section of text.
- Person “B” reads another section of text.
- When both are ready, they “teach” their section to their partner.

**VARIATIONS**
- Pairs conclude by developing a summary of the text essence.
- Pairs join another pair and develop a summary.

**Header:**  
*The Adaptive School*

---

**Section 1: Tips**
- If energy is needed, create pairs through use of learning partners, eye contact partners, shoe partners, or any device that will get people to move about the room.

---

**Section 2: Expert Jigsaw**  
*Explore and Discover*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Interdependently acquire, summarize, and communicate information.

**PROCESS**
- Cluster members into home groups of five (if five topics are to be studied) and number off one to five. Each number is assigned a reading.
- Have all the number ones, two, threes, etc., move into expert groups of like numbers.
- Provide questions to expert groups to help them process information.
- In the expert groups, members read the material, report on the questions, then converse about its meaning.
- Members determine what ideas they will share and how they will share the ideas in their home groups.
- Return to home groups and share what has been learned in the expert groups.

**VARIATIONS**
- Expert groups develop an image or perform a skit to convey information.

**TIPS**
- While there is value in member choice, assigning topics takes less time than allowing members to choose their own topics.

---

**Section 3: Key Concepts/Key Ideas**  
*Explore and Discover*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Select and interpret information and relate to member’s experience.

**PROCESS**
- Organize members into pairs.
- Assign a reading.
- Individuals read text, marking key concepts and ideas.
- When both have finished reading, take turns sharing and exploring concepts/ideas marked by each partner.

**VARIATIONS**
- Assign the reading in sections. After each section, share concepts and ideas.
- See the “Say Something Strategy.”

---

**Facilitation Strategies and Moves**  
**APPENDIX A**

---

**TIPS**
- As with all text-based learning, remind members that a key value of this strategy is the different experiences and perspectives each member brings to the topic.

---

**Modified Jigsaw**  
*Explore and Discover*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
A high-energy and time-saving alternative to “Expert Jigsaw” that also requires members to acquire, summarize, and communicate information.

**PROCESS**
- Form a team.
- Apportion a reading to members of the team.
- Each member reads an assigned section and plans how to teach it to the team.

---

**Partners Report**  
*Explore and Discover*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Synthesize constructed meaning.

**PROCESS**
- Partners engage in conversation knowing they may be asked to report their partner’s ideas.
- Provide two minutes for each to be sure they can paraphrase their partner correctly.
- Ask for a volunteer to share.
- Repeat the pattern as time permits.

**VARIATIONS**
- To increase energy, partner people from different locations and have them stand throughout this exercise.

**TIPS**
- It is not necessary for both partners to share. One speaker does not obligate the other.
- When possible, sequentially call on persons from different quarters of the room because this causes listeners to adjust body positions to hear, thus maintaining energy.

---

**Read and Example**  
*Explore and Discover*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Summarize, interpret, and construct examples.

**Say Something (Jerome Harste)**
*Explore and Discover*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Select and interpret information and relate to member’s experience.

**PROCESS**
- Choose a partner.
- Read silently and simultaneously to designated stopping points.
- When each partner is ready, stop and “say something.”
  - The something might be a question, a brief summary, a key point, an interesting idea, or personal connection.
- Continue the process until you have completed the selection.

**VARIATIONS**
- See the “Key Concepts/Key Ideas” strategy for a more holistic approach to the construction of meaning.

**TIPS**
- Stop and share at the end of each paragraph for an incremental approach to the social construction of meaning.
- Do not use with readings longer than four to five paragraphs.

---

**Sort Cards**
*Explore and Discover*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**

The image is a page from a book titled "The Adaptive School." The page provides detailed instructions for group processes and activities designed to facilitate meaningful discussion and analysis of documents or texts. The content is organized into three main sections, each with its own heading, purpose, process, alternatives, tips, and variations. Here is a detailed description and transcription of the text:

---

**PROCESS**
- Members review a document and highlight a sentence, a phrase, and a word that are meaningful.
- Provide strips of paper of varying lengths to accommodate a sentence, phrase, or word.
- Each member, in round-robin fashion, posts and explains his or her strips.
- Once all the strips are posted and explained, the group agrees on one sentence, one phrase, and one word that are most meaningful.

**ALTERNATIVES**
- Instead of sentence strips, have a facilitator guide a conversation as first a sentence is shared by each, then a phrase and a word. Record the phrase and word on chart paper. The group shares insights about the document.
- In either alternative use summarizing insights or selection of final sentence, phrase, and word.

**TIPS**
- When working with a large group, divide into clusters of about six, allowing the small groups to share results.

**PROCESS**
- Trios read and highlight first section of text.
- Person A says, “A key point for me is___.”
- Person B pauses and then paraphrases.
- Person C pauses and then asks, “What are some things that make that important to you?”
- Rotate roles and continue process with remaining sections.

- Direct members to write one word on a 3 × 5 card indicating how they want to feel at the end of this meeting.
- Next, on the other side of the card, members write a short phrase or “self-talk” that they will use to guide their choices and attain their outcomes.
- In small groups and in round-robin fashion (one speaker at a time with no responses or comments from others) members share side one of their cards.
- Next, in round-robin fashion (one speaker at a time with no responses or comments from others) members share side two of their cards.

**TIPS**
- After about an hour, invite members to examine their cards and in small groups, report in round-robin fashion (one speaker at a time with no responses or comments from others) their goal, strategy and current progress.
- At the end of the day, members may, in small groups, reflect on their strategies, outcomes, and transferable learning.

**Vocabulary Review**  
*Organize and Integrate*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Recall.

**PROCESS**
- Ask individuals to brainstorm and list words they’ve learned in the work so far. The words can be new or have new meanings as a result of their learning. The more words the better. Participants should try to think of words others might not remember.

The image is a page from a book titled "The Adaptive School." The content is divided into two main sections, each describing a different group activity or process.

---

### Section 1: (No specific title given, but it describes a points-based sharing activity)

- **Instructions:**
  - After a few minutes, instruct participants to stand up, take their list and a pencil, and share their list with another person.
  - For every word that one person has on their list that the other does not, a point gets tallied. After sharing lists with one person, participants continue sharing until time is called.
  - At the end of ten to fifteen minutes, participants sit down and tally their points.
  - Share at the table and determine who at the table collected the most points. (Do not ask for a table total.)
  - Survey the room by asking each table to identify the person with the most points.
  - Acknowledge the highest point person and ask them to identify the words on their list that received the most points.

- **Variations:**
  - Provide a small prize to the winner.

- **Tips:**
  - If more than one person in the room has close to the same number of points, acknowledge all of them.
  - Be sure to emphasize that the brainstorm includes both new words and words that have new meanings.

---

### Section 2: "What Comes Up" (Organize and Integrate)

- **Purpose and Intentions:**
  - Investigate, compare, and apply instructional concepts to student work.

- **Process:**
  - Arrange six to twenty people seated in a circle with two or three pieces of recent student work.
  - Presenter offers the first piece of student work (read or posted or copies distributed). Participants review.
  - Presenter asks, “What comes up for you when you examine this piece of work?” and provides a few moments of think time.
  - Each responds to the question in turn. No repeats.
  - Open conversation in which members compare observations, relate elements of student work to local standards, hypothesize about student thinking, and generate teaching ideas.
  - The process is repeated with a second piece of student work and perhaps a third.
  - Close the conversation with a summary of new understandings or learnings.

- **Tips:**
  - Allow about thirty to forty-five minutes.

#### Main Content

**1-2-6**  
*Generate Ideas in Large Groups*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
In large groups of sixty to two hundred, engage each member in generating ideas for decision making.

**PROCESS**
- Give a written task to individuals such as, name one area we could work on this year (two minutes).
- Pairs meet, share, and agree to one statement (six minutes).
- Each pair meets with two other pairs, shares and agrees to one statement (twelve minutes).
- Each group of six records their one idea on a sentence strip (eight to twelve words) and posts in the front of the room.
- The facilitator leads an inquiry session, in which members can ask questions for clarification. Authors of the item being questioned respond.
- Next the facilitator leads an advocacy session in which members advocate for items they feel are most important.
- Rank ideas by using the rule of one-third (see in this appendix) to determine the few items of greatest interest to the group.
- Name a subcommittee to gather data on these items and bring back information or recommendations on which should be pursued.

**VARIATIONS**
- Have pairs converse before either inquiry or advocacy.

**TIPS**
- Individuals, not groups, should inquire, advocate, and rank.
- See the “Focusing Four Strategy” for details of this structure with smaller groups.

**Section 1:**

**Around the Room and Back Again**  
*Generate Ideas with Physical Activity*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Use novelty and physical activity to energize idea generation.

**PROCESS**
- Write one response only to a prompt.
- Next, without taking notes, move about the room and share your response, mentally cataloguing the responses of others.
- When your head is full, or when signaled, return to your seat and list the responses you heard from others.
- Next, table groups pool responses.

**TIPS**
- Connect the prompt to something being studied (e.g., things that go wrong in meetings) and refer back to the pooled list during the presentation.

---

**Section 2:**

**Brainstorm**  
*Safely Generate Ideas*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Collective creativity without debate.

**PROCESS**
- Members call out ideas while a recorder charts them.

**VARIATIONS**
- Post topics or questions on charts.
- Cluster members into groups of three to five and have each group stand before a chart with a marker color that is different from other groups.
- Each group calls out ideas that are recorded on the charts.
- Each group moves clockwise to the next chart, reviews what the previous group(s) has written, and adds ideas with the color pen with which they first recorded.
- Members take a gallery walk to read all posted ideas.

**HISTORY AND WARNING**
- Brainstorming was invented in 1984 by Alex Osborne who theorized that a squad could generate more ideas than individuals by “storming” the objective without criticism of others’ ideas. More recent studies have found that free association activities without dissent lead to mostly predictable ideas and that imagination can be stimulated by conflict. A 2003 study by Nemeth at the University of California at Berkley found that teams encouraged to debate brainstormed ideas generated 20 percent more ideas than those that withheld criticism. This does not mean that traditional brainstorming processes should not be used. On the contrary, most people are more creative when working in teams. Familiar brainstorming processes provide voice, they

---

**Section 1:**
- The text at the top discusses the importance of starting projects from members’ concerns and information, referencing a brainstorming format that safely includes criticism.

**TIPS**
- Stress that brainstorming means that there is no talking about the items, but rather the groups are to just list items. Even mature groups tend to forget this.

**Section 2:**
- A bolded, centered heading:  
  **Brainstorm Modalities**  
  *Safely Generate Ideas*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
- Collective creativity on a topic using modalities as a lens.

**PROCESS**
- Define the subject.
- Give everyone a minute or two to think.
- Invite members to call out ideas.
- A member records ideas on flip chart.
- Code the first ten ideas as either visual, auditory, or kinesthetic.
- Compute a ratio for each modality.
- Brainstorm again, focusing on the least represented modality.

**VARIATIONS**
- Use paired conversations for think time.
- Have pairs or small groups brainstorm; code and brainstorm again instead of working as a full group.

**TIPS**
- Explain that considering the topic from the least used perspective will bring fresh ideas to the surface.

---

**Section 3:**
- A bolded, centered heading:  
  **Brainstorm Questions**  
  *Safely Generate Ideas for Inquiry*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
- Develop lenses for inquiry.

**PROCESS**
- Define the subject.
- Give everyone a minute or two to think.
- Invite members to call out questions.
- A member records questions on flip chart.
- Categorize the questions and determine what information is needed and how it might be gathered.

**Transcription:**

---

**THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL**

---

**VARIATIONS**
- Use paired conversations for think time.
- Have the work done in pairs or small groups.
- Precede the activity with dialogue.

**TIPS**
- Explain that generating questions can illuminate the group’s work.

---

**Brainstorm and Critique**
*Generate Ideas*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Enrich idea generation with psychologically safe critiques.

**PROCESS**
- Instruct the group of brainstorming research (see chapter 6 and “History and Warnings” under the brainstorm strategy). Brainstorming as commonly practiced has been found to be only partially effective, asserts Paulus (2000). Researchers find that idea generation and idea quality increases when after traditional brainstorming, members individually study the list thinking of downsides or alternatives.
- Define the subject.
- Give everyone a minute or two to think.
- Brainstorm in which members call out ideas without commenting or questioning other items on the list.
- Provide time in which members silently critique items, and then share and discuss.

**ALTERNATIVES**
- Instruct trios to offer critiques, downsides or counter arguments for as many ideas as possible within a time frame (twelve to fifteen minutes), report, and process by full groups.
- Arrange the recording sheets in such a way that small groups can move to the sheets and record their ideas.
- Use the rule of one-third to identify the top few ideas. Critique these.

**Carousel Interview**
*Generate Information About a Group*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Survey and explore a group’s concerns or interests.

**PROCESS**
- Prepare interview-recording sheets, one for each question.
- Groups of six, each person with one question.
- Round 1—write a response to your own question in the top space.

- Round 5—1 and 5; 2 and 4; 3 and 6.
- Round 6—1 and 6; 2 and 3, 4 and 5.
- Join others with the same question. Share the responses and create a synthesizing statement. Be prepared to share your statement with the large group.

---

**VARIATIONS**
- Groups of four, each person with own question.
- Have groups create a graphic to share with the large group, rather than a statement.

---

**TIPS**
- Provide recording page for each question, six spaces on each page.
- Make sure questions are open-ended and varied.

**In and Out of the Frame**
*Generate Information Key to Planning or Problem Solving*

---

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Identify and explore frames of reference other groups and members of this group may be holding.

---

**PROCESS**
- Form groups of four to six persons.
- Stand before charts showing large rectangle.
- Group members brainstorm associations with the topic. Use only one pen color.
- Stop. Categorize the brainstormed items. Record categories in the top portion of chart.
- Assign each group another frame of reference as a lens, based on other perspectives that might need to be considered such as parents, students, community members, etc.
- With a new pen color, circle the ideas in the frame that this new group might have named had they been present.
- Below the frame add ideas this new group might have added.
- Reflect. Ask, “How might knowledge of these other perspectives influence planning and action on the topic under consideration?”

---

**TIPS**
- Use to plan new initiatives.
- Think about this framing map as a way of anticipating different perceptions and using knowledge of those perceptions in communicating, planning, and action.

**Paired Verbal Fluency** (see also under Activate and Engage)  
*Generate Ideas*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Primes the pump for full group conversation.

**PROCESS**
- Form pairs.
- Describe the process:
  - A and B will take turns responding to a prompt asking for ideas on a topic.
  - At a signal, one will speak and one will listen.
  - At a signal, the other will speak while the first speaker listens.
  - Each time, no one is allowed to repeat anything that was said by the other.
  - Check for clarification.
- Repeat the cycle two or three times:
  - First round sixty seconds each.
  - Second round forty seconds each.
  - Third round twenty seconds each.

**VARIATIONS**
- Prompts might ask for solutions, concerns, assumptions.

---

**Pyramid**  
*Find Common Elements in Member Thinking*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Give individual input to develop group thinking.

**PROCESS**
- Give a written task to individuals.
- Pairs meet and share common elements.
- Quartets meet and share common elements.
- Octets meet and share common elements with large group.
- The work of the octets can be charted for large group processing.

**TIPS**
- It is difficult for groups larger than eight to find common elements. If there is lack of consensus when charts are shared with the large group, time for dialogue should be scheduled.

--- Page Break ---

The image is a page from a book or manual titled "Facilitation Strategies and Moves" from Appendix A. The page number is 243. The content is organized into sections describing different facilitation strategies, their purposes, processes, variations, and tips.

---

### Section 1: (No explicit title, but describes a facilitation process)
**PROCESS**
- Arrange for thirty-minute confidential interviews with affected individuals.
- Advise that sources of information will remain confidential, but if the same idea is heard from three or more people it will be shared with the full group without identifying authors.
- Ask: “What are you feeling good about here? What problems exist? What recommendations do you have?”
- Organize the data and “publish” it with the full group. Display ideas on flip charts.
- Ask if you got the information right in order to start conversation about the data.
- Paraphrase and inquire as members offer “corrections” to the data. If appropriate, change the text on the flip charts.

**VARIATIONS**
- Publish the data in text for pairs to read and explore before full group conversation.
- Share the data with the leader; the leader shares the data and his or her analysis with the group.
- Facilitator might engage in “Public Coaching” with the leader.

**TIPS**
- Have small groups talk about the data if comments are not easily forthcoming; then engage the full group in conversation.
- Use when entering a new group as a leader or when problems exist within a group, but information is not being shared about it.

---

### Section 2: Stem Completion (Explore and Discover)
**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
- Generate and report a group’s perceptions of itself.

**PROCESS**
- Members complete a thought from a prompt. For example: “I believe my culture affects my coworkers by . . .” or “In order to be more inclusive we should . . .”
- Pairs or small groups share and explore meanings from responses to the prompts.
- Small groups summarize and report.

**VARIATIONS**
- Change groups and share again.

**TIPS**
- Select stems that would be psychologically safe for members to talk about.

---

### Section 3: Stir the Classroom (Recover Ideas and Concepts)
**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
- Recall, discern, integrate, and report information.

**THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL**

---

**PROCESS**
- Arrange group members around the perimeter of the room in groups of four.
- Number off one to four in each cluster.
- Clusters respond to prompt.
- At a signal, one member moves to the next cluster to bring information from the home group and learn information from the new group.
- Repeat the pattern with new prompts for the new group.

**VARIATIONS**
- Conduct the strategy with clusters seated at tables instead of standing.
- Can also be used to review learned material—prompts would include recall, apply, and assess questions.

**TIPS**
- Draw from a deck of playing cards to randomly select the next person in each group to move.
- Benefits wane after three or four rounds.

---

**Dialogue – Discuss – Decide**

The term “discourse” with origins in Middle English (denoting the process of reasoning) encompasses both dialogue and discussion. While the outcome of discussion is decision, the processes of discussing and deciding are distinct. For example, in discussing one may compare features of a program, is deciding, one chooses one over the other in part from what was learned in the comparisons. We have clustered the three functions of dialogue, discuss and decide under the broad category of discourse.

*There is a small illustration of people sitting and one person standing at a board, indicating a group discussion or presentation.*

The image is a page from a book or manual titled "Facilitation Strategies and Moves," specifically from "Appendix A." The page number is 245. The content is organized into sections with headings, subheadings, and bullet points. It provides detailed facilitation strategies for group discussions, focusing on agreements, assumptions, and idea testing. Here is a detailed transcription and description:

---

**PROCESS**
- State the agreement the group has made.
- Say, “I know none of you would ever deliberately sabotage this agreement, but if you were to, under what conditions might you make that choice?”

**VARIATIONS**
- Ask pairs or small groups to talk about this question.

**TIPS**
- Brings to the surface hidden reservations or unconsciously held conditions under which members would not keep an agreement.
- This data provides an opportunity to clarify misunderstandings, develop ideas to overcome perceived obstacles, or reshape the decision.

---

**Assumptions Inquiry**  
*Test Ideas for Workability*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Push beyond first easy and simple solutions.

**PROCESS**
- Participants set aside two to four “good ideas” from a generated list.
- Each idea is explored for conditions in which the idea would be productive and conditions in which it would be counterproductive.
- Discuss how good ideas are rarely rules, but instead represent principles.

**VARIATIONS**
- Use the process above to select ideas that address the needs of the group.

**TIPS**
- Especially when the group has generated the idea list, stress that this is not a right or wrong conversation.

---

**Assumptions Wall**  
*Locate Assumptions Sources*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Understand own and others’ assumptions on a topic.

**PROCESS**
- Individuals list assumptions about a topic.
- Have participants choose one that most informs their behavior.
- Participants write their choice on sentence strip in eight to twelve words.
- Post assumptions on wall.

--- Page Break ---

The image is a page from a book titled "The Adaptive School." The page provides detailed instructions for two group facilitation strategies focused on exploring assumptions: one unnamed strategy and another called "Card Stack and Shuffle."

---

### Section 1: Inquiry into Assumptions

- **Facilitator models inquiry** using an approachable voice, plurals, invitational stems, and positive presuppositions. Inquiry categories include importance, conditions, source, data, beliefs, and values.
  - Example prompt: “I’m curious about that assumption. Whose is it? Help me understand what may be some reasons you value that highly.”
- **Individuals inquire** about posted assumptions in a round-robin fashion.

**VARIATIONS**
- The group lists assumptions related to a topic. One to three assumptions are selected. The group inquires about these assumptions and identifies their implications.

**TIPS**
- Use groups of four to six.
- Caution the group not to over-focus on the first assumption.
- Model an approachable voice.
- Intervene if inquiry turns into interrogation or disbelief.

---

### Section 2: Card Stack and Shuffle  
*Clarify and Understand Members’ Thinking*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
- Identify implications of assumptions.

**PROCESS**
- Participants complete two stems, such as “Good student writers…” and “Good teachers of writing…”
- Each response is written on a separate 3 × 5 card.
- Table groups stack and shuffle the cards, then pass them to the table on the right.
- Person “A” selects a card and reads it to the group.
- Members identify possible assumptions related to the response on the card.
- Group members explore the implications of those assumptions.
- Repeat the pattern with “B,” “C,” and “D” drawing cards in turn.

**VARIATIONS**
- Use only one stem.
- Preface the activity with instruction about assumptions and implications.

**TIPS**
- Demonstrate drawing a card and eliciting assumptions.
- Demonstrate exploring implications of one of those assumptions.
- Encourage paraphrasing and inquiring.
- This can be a scaffold for dialogue.

### Causal Loop Diagram
*Recognize that the Way a Problem Is Defined Can Be the Source of the Problem*

**PURPOSES AND INTENTIONS**  
Examine underlying values, beliefs, and goals when repeated attempts at resolution are unsuccessful.

**PROCESS**
- Advise members that:
  - In single-loop learning groups modify their actions according to the difference between expected and obtained outcomes.
  - In double-loop learning groups question the values, assumptions, and policies that led to the actions in the first place.
- Identify and list the intended and unintended results of an action.
- Identify and list the mismatches between intentions and outcome.
- Through dialogue, question ways in which the framing of the problem, assumptions, values, and policies might have affected the outcome.

**TIPS**
- This can be an appropriate time to talk about other language forms such as using “and” instead of “but” when responding to a previous speaker. “But” conveys the message that the previous speaker was wrong.

### Corners
*Reveal Preferences*

**PURPOSES AND INTENTIONS**  
Identify, make public, and process members’ preferences.

**PROCESS**
- Post labels in corners of room.
- Participants move to corner of greatest interest.
- Form clusters of two or three. Ask participants to explore and share their reasoning for selecting this topic.

**VARIATIONS**
- Can also use three or five “corners/locations” instead of four.
- After a period of time, instruct people to move to the corner of their second choice and repeat the sharing in clusters of two or three.
- Ask people to stand in the corner that represents their position on an issue.

**TIPS**
- Learning is enhanced when participants identify interests within a topic.

**ALTERNATIVES**
- Use corners to represent different levels of agreement with a proposal.

---

**Delve and Dialogue**
*Text-based Learning*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
- Deepen understanding of concepts and others through a structured dialogue.

**PROCESS**
- Read a selection of text and make connections to some aspect of your work.
- In groups, share some of your connections.
- Honor the spirit of inquiry with pausing, paraphrasing, and posing questions.

**VARIATIONS**
- Assign this to trios instead of a group.

**TIPS**
- Review principles of dialogue prior to starting this process.
- Because speaking, not listening, is a common default pattern, you may want to periodically stop the action and ask people to notice what is happening in the conversation, or engage them in the Round Robin Reflection described in this appendix.

**Energy Sources Team Survey**
*Self-assessment*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
- Self-monitor and self-modify five group energy sources.

- It may be useful to calculate a mean, median, and mode.
- Use the instrument in a prescriptive manner to determine what actions might be taken to increase certain Energy Sources in the group.

**Section: TIPS**
- Emphasize the data is non-evaluative and serves as baseline impressions.
- Use the data to dialogue about its meaning.
- Consider the strengths of the group as well as discrepancies.
- It is particularly useful to do item analysis.
- When items are considered, they become sources of understanding for goal setting.

- Centered and bolded:  
  **First Turn/Last Turn**  
  *Dialogue Scaffold*

---

**Section: PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
This scaffold for dialogue enlists many cognitive and affective skills necessary for dialogue. This activity requires cognitive, emotional, and social skills including turn-taking, self-management, comprehension, interpretation, application, relating, integrating, metacognition, and appreciation of others.

---

**Section: PROCESS**
- Form groups of four to eight.
- Silently and simultaneously, members read a section of text and highlight three to four items that have particular meaning for them.
- Facilitator names a person to start in each group.
- In turn, members share one of their items but do not comment on it. They simply name it.
- In round-robin fashion, group members comment about the identified item WITH NO CROSS TALK.
- The initial person who named the item now shares his or her thinking about the item, and therefore, gets the “last turn.”
- Repeat the pattern around the table.

---

**Section: VARIATIONS**
- When possible, have members read the text before coming to the meeting. When they have read prior to the meeting, allow three to four minutes for them to “review” what they marked. This can save face for those who forgot to read.
- Reading sources can include journal articles, policy statements, mission statements, a sample of student work, or original writing by members on a common topic.

THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL

---

**TIPS**
- Select the first speaker geographically (e.g., the person sitting with their back most directly against that wall). Selection that is both structured and random can interrupt problematic patterns that occur in group dynamics, such as having one person always be the first responder.
- Stress that there is no cross talk. Explain that when cross talk occurs, it takes the focus off the speaker, changes the topic, diminishes the speaker’s influence, and interferes with listening.
- Explain that structured dialogue allows members to develop the emotional skills and values needed for high-quality dialogue. This experiential learning will serve as a scaffold as participants learn to dialogue.
- Monitor and intervene when cross talk occurs as groups begin.
- Groups of six are ideal, sometimes four as a first experience.

**Here’s What, So What, Now What**  
*Data Analysis*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Move beyond data to implications.

**PROCESS**
- Distribute a three-column worksheet.
- Explain the purpose of each column: Here’s What Is for specific data the group is working with; So What Is for an interpretation or meaning of the data; Now What can be a predication, implication or question for further study.

**VARIATIONS**
- Structure the task to provide skills practice in paraphrasing and posing questions.

**TIPS**
- Provide an example and elaborate a response for each column.
- Provide specific Here’s What data such as “60 percent of female students scored X while 40 percent of male students scored Y,” or have groups generate their own data for this column.
- In pairs or in small groups, members complete the Now What and So What columns.
- Conduct a full group dialogue.

**Inside Outside Circle (Spenser Kagan)**  
*Explore and Extend Ideas*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
In the spirit of dialogue, small groups augment concepts.

**PROCESS**
- Form inner circle facing outward and outer circle facing inward with one-to-one correspondence.

**Facilitation Strategies and Moves**  
**APPENDIX A**

---

- Provide a prompt such as “Students in grade six should be able to . . .” or “We could enhance student’s sense of belonging by . . .”
- Inner circle persons generate a response.
- Outer circle persons paraphrase and extend the idea.
- Outer circle people rotate clockwise three or four persons.
- Outer circle people respond to the same prompt, while the inner circle paraphrases and extends.
- Repeat the pattern with another prompt, if desired.
- Have members be seated and respond to the prompt “We are learning . . .”

**VARIATIONS**
- If space does not permit one large set of circles, run activity in more than one circle.
- Use to review or refine other skills such as pausing or posing questions to specify thinking.
- Use as a preface to extended dialogue.

**TIPS**
- Demonstrate the double circle configuration with eight participants.

**Left-Hand Column (Chris Argyris)**  
*Self-assessment*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Increase awareness of personal assumptions, thoughts, and feelings that govern one’s thinking and contribute to blocking hearing others.

**PROCESS**
- During dialogue, members maintain a split-sheet format for recording items in either a right- or left-hand column.
- Record in the right-hand column data or ideas one wants to remember.
- Record in the left-hand column what one notices about self-talk and reactions to the conversation.
- Examples include, what I need to set aside in my listening in order to stay present; what are my intentions; what are my judgments; what am I feeling in the moment, and is the feeling evoked by a correct interpretation of the interaction, or am I responding to “noise in my head” or personal history in some way; what are my assumptions; what can I learn about me from my reactions.

**ALTERNATIVES**
- Provide members with two-column recording sheets with prompts in the left-hand column like assumptions, feelings, judgments, and supportive data.

**TIPS**
- Invite members to keep right-hand column, then reflect together on what they learned about themselves and dialogue.

The image is a page from a book titled **The Adaptive School**. The page contains two main sections, each describing a reflective process for group or team meetings. Here is a detailed description and transcription of the content:

---

### **Round-Robin Reflection**
*Self-assessment and Self-modification*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Discover thoughts, feelings, and internal talk influencing participation.

**PROCESS**
- At a stopping point or at the end of the meeting the facilitator asks, “What were some of the decisions you made about when and how to participate, and what were some of the effects of those decisions on you and the group?”
- Members reflect privately.
- In round-robin fashion, each member shares one decision and the effects of the decision.

**VARIATIONS**
- During the round-robin the facilitator paraphrases and inquires: “How did the effects of your decision compare to what you intended?” “How might this be a pattern for you?” “What might be some ways you can apply this learning to future meetings?”
- Pairs share instead of full group.
- Journal writing only.

**TIPS**
- Be clear that the prompt refers to decisions about participation, not the meeting content.
- Members self-direct performance improvements through this process faster and more permanently than having process observers report participant behaviors. Teams become more accomplished.

---

### **Success Analysis**
*Reflection on Practice*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Gain insights into improving practice.

**PROCESS**
- In advance of the meeting, participants develop notes describing an area where they are finding success or making progress.
- In the meeting, participants share their “case studies” of successful work with a student or with a group of students.
- In round-robin fashion, members share while colleagues take notes.
- Next, colleagues paraphrase, then ask questions of clarification seeking specificity related to the presenter’s language such as, “When you said ‘those students,’ to which ones were you referring?”
- Next, colleagues paraphrase then ask questions seeking elaboration such as, “How did you know to move on at that point?” or “What is your sense of the most catalytic decision you made?” or “What are some learnings you are taking from this situation?”
- Next, colleagues offer thoughts and ideas while presenter takes notes without responding.

**Bulleted List:**
- Finally, the presenter initiates conversation with colleagues inquiring more deeply about their thoughts.
- After the last round, the group summarizes what was learned and what can be applied from this session.

**VARIATIONS**
- Use this process for events that were not successful.
- Use with trios.

**TIPS**
- A total round for one person should take about thirty minutes.
- Use small groups of three to six members.
- Expressed judgments, positive or negative, are more threatening than data or open-ended, nonjudgmental questions.

  - Summarize

---

**Section: Discuss**
- "To discuss is to talk about something with a group. Synonyms include converse, confer, exchange views, and deliberate. Its Latin root is discussus for struck asunder, or shaken. In organizations, discussions lead to decisions and are properly preceded by dialogues in which the purpose is to build understanding."

---

**Section: Appoint a Devil’s Advocate (Doyle and Straus)**
- Subtitle: *Hear Differing Views*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTION**
- Break “Group Think.”
- Many people will not speak out at meetings for fear of retribution, low group trust, or just the fear of looking stupid. As a result “group think” becomes the norm and poor decisions result. By appointing a devil’s advocate, you give official permission for raising differing views.

**PROCESS**
- For each issue discussed, appoint the role of “devil’s advocate” with the function of offering differing views.
- Rotate this role. Change for each topic or meeting.
- At the end of the meeting explore the effects this role had on group thinking and make revisions if necessary, for the next time the role is used.

### Close the Discussion  
*Clarify and Flexibility*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTION**  
Members are clear about when a discussion is to be closed.

**PROCESS**
- Person in charge displays decision options:
  - Participants can vote on whether to keep discussion going or not.
  - Person in charge decides whether to end the discussion or extend it.
  - Everyone gets one more chance to make a point.
  - Continue the discussion, but limit it to a specific topic.
  - Close the discussion if someone calls for closure and two others agree.
  - Delegate the decision making to a subgroup.
  - Talk until a predetermined time limit has been reached. Person in charge makes an executive decision if group hasn’t decided by then.
- Members explore advantages and drawbacks of each option.
- Group selects an option to use on a regular basis.

**VARIATIONS**
- Group selects a few options for consideration when approaching a decision.

**TIPS**
- The goal is efficiency, consistency, clarity, and flexibility.

---

### Criteria Matrix  
*Group Decision*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Decisions based on identified values.

**PROCESS**
- Identify a decision you wish to make and the alternatives you are considering.
- Identify the criteria you consider important.
- Assign each criterion an importance score.
- Determine the extent to which each alternative poses each criterion.
- Express as High, Medium, or Low.
- Assign number values such as High = 3, Medium = 2, and Low = 1.
- Record on criteria matrix and analyze scores to see which alternative has the highest total points.
- Based on your reaction to the selected alternative, determine next steps.

---

**Section: ALTERNATIVES**
- Assign point value to each criterion if some are more important than others.

**TIPS**
- Group needs only rough agreement on High, Medium, and Low ratings.
- Should two alternatives appear to be equally desirable, add other criteria.

---

**Table:**

| Criterion                                   | Alt. A | Alt. B | Alt. C |

| Available resources                         | H      | H      | H      |
| Could serve as stimulus to another desired change | H      | M      | M      |
| Staff readiness                             | M      | L      | L      |

| Numerical Values                            | 10     | 7      | 8      |

---

**Section: Decision Options**
*Clarify Decision Authority and Strategy*

---

**PROCESS**
- Executive decision:
  - Clarify whether the group’s function is to inform or to recommend.
  - Announce when decision will be made and the manner in which it will be communicated to the group.
- Fallback position:
  - Limit group decision making time.
  - Define a decision process if group cannot decide within allotted time.
- Subgroup decision:
  - Clarify whether subgroup will be bringing back a decision or a recommendation.
  - Provide decision parameters.

---

**VARIATIONS**
- Specify the decision-making strategy to be used. (See “Criteria Matrix” in this appendix.)

**TIPS**
- Select an option before discussion begins.

---

**Section: Disagreement Grid**
*Disagree Agreeably*

---

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**

---

**The Adaptive School**

---

**PROCESS**
- Ask participants to participate in the next activity as a warm-up to conversations in which diverse opinions are held.
- Draw a four-by-four grid on a chart. Ask participants to assume that each square is equal in dimension to the other squares.
- Ask participants how many squares they see.
- As each number is offered, write it on the chart margin without comment.
- After several numbers are recorded, stop. Ask, “Who saw (one of the higher numbers of squares)? Would you please explain to the group where you see these squares?”
- Mark on the grid as a member explains what they see.
- Ask: “Was the person who said sixteen wrong? Seventeen? Twenty-four?”
- Addressing the whole group, say, “As we move into the conversation that follows, let me suggest that when you have a difference of opinion you say, ‘I see it a different way.’”

**TIPS**
- This can be an appropriate time to talk about other language forms that can be used when disagreement occurs. Suggest participants use the word “and” which implies addition, instead of “but” which implies the first speaker is wrong.

---

**Focusing Four**
*Achieve Agreement*

(See Garmston, Dolcemascolo (2009) The Focusing Four: A Consensus Seeking Activity For Prioritizing: DVD Viewers Guide. www.thinkingcollaborative.org.)

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Each member feels heard, understood, and contributes to decision.

**PROCESS**
- Explain task, topic and process.
- Check for understanding.
- Brainstorm ideas and record on chart paper.
- Push for between twelve and eighteen ideas.
- Next, members ask questions of clarification. The “author” responds.
- Next members advocate for items.
- Finally, use the rule of one-third to determine which items are of greatest interest to the group. Use a hand count. (See p. 261 for details)
- Conclude by determining a process to narrow the choices down to one or two if necessary. See “Close the Discussion” options in this appendix.

**VARIATIONS**
- Occasionally have partners confer before a new step in the process begins.

**Header:**
- Title: Facilitation Strategies and Moves
- Section: Appendix A

---

**TIPS**
- Each step in the process must be kept separate.
- Statements of advocacy must be stated in the positive, as in, “I advocate for this because . . .” and never “I don’t like this because . . .”
- Tell group they will be guided, not bound by the numbers. For example, in a group of fifteen members, item A gets nine counts and item B gets eleven; that may not be a sufficient enough difference to select B. In cases like this, the facilitator will ask the group how it wants to handle the situation.
- See a detailed description of this process in the “Adaptive Schools Syllabus,” useful for instructing groups.

---

**Gatekeeping**
*Invite Participation*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Open opportunities for quiet members to speak

**PROCESS**
- A member notices that a colleague has not talked.
- The member says, “Booker, I’m aware you have not talked for a while. Is there anything you would like to add?”

**VARIATIONS**
- “Monica, I know you served on a committee addressing this. Do you have anything you’d like to say?” or “What might you like to add?”
- “Ken, from where I’m sitting, your eyebrows look furrowed. What comments might you like to add?”

**TIPS**
- Phrase the questions so that the colleague can gracefully decline to speak.

---

**Issues Agenda**
*Identify Issues*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Illuminating issues

**PROCESS**
- Brainstorm issues related to a project.
- Dialogue on degrees of importance, desirable attention sequences, and connections.
- Develop and agree to a timeline.

**ALTERNATIVES**
- After brainstorming, develop a criteria matrix (appendix A) to analyze importance and attention sequences.
- An issues agenda can be conducted informally focused only on topics to be addressed during the current meeting.

---

**Jigsaw Carousel**  
*Information Processing: Exploring and Discovering*

**PROCESS**
- Form groups, one for each concept (ex: If working with four concepts, will need four groups).
- Each group describes a concept in its own words.
- Give behavioral examples: what they would see and hear as indicators of this concept.
- Have table groups identify and describe situations in school, life, or work in which it would be important to draw on this concept.
- Pose questions intended to help others become aware of this concept in their life or work.
- Have table groups create a logo or simile as a reminder for this concept (e.g., “Complete the simile: This concept is like a _______ because _______”).
- Compose a brief statement or slogan that summarizes the concept.
- Report work to full assembly.

**TIPS**
- Provide an advance organizer for the entire process.
- Have each member be responsible for learning one concept and then teaching it to others.

---

**Lasso (Doyle and Straus)**  
*Language Specificity*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTION**  
Members gain clarity on terms.

**PROCESS**
- Circle or lasso words on flip chart that lack specificity.
- Invite members to define the words within the context of the group’s work.
- Ex. “How to solve drug use at schools.” Ask what do you mean by drugs, which ones, which schools, what age levels, and even what do you mean by solve: reduce, eliminate entirely, prevent, etc.

**ALTERNATIVES**
- Ask pairs or small groups to define the words and report out for group reinforcement or adoption.
- Record the definitions on chart paper.

**TIPS**
- Classes of language most useful to question for specificity: vague nouns or pronouns; vague verbs or action words; universal quantifiers like all, everyone, never; modal operators like must, have to, can’t; and comparators like better, worse, greater.

**Section:**
**Naïve Question—(also a group member strategy)**
*Direct Topic or Process Back on Track*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Members influence group’s fidelity to meeting standards (one process at time, one topic at a time, clarity about decision making, etc.). (See chapter 4.)

**PROCESS**
- A group member asks a naïve question to which the group responds. Examples are: Who is making this decision? How much detail do we need to move this item? What parts of this issue live in our area of responsibility? Who will do what by when? And is there something we are not talking about?

**VARIATIONS**
- The facilitator says to the group: “Given what you know about meeting standards, what seems to be going on right now?”

**TIPS**
- A naïve question is one asked with innocence, a desire to know, and in a melodic approachable voice. This is a powerful way for group members to offer corrections to group work.

---

**Section:**
**Set and Test Working Agreements**
*Generate and Adhere to Agreements*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTION**
Members influence group process.

**PROCESS**
- A group member says, “I notice that our meetings are not starting on time. Could we make an agreement to start on time? (*Set agreement.*)
- The facilitator leads a conversation in which the group develops an agreement.
- In a later meeting a group member says, “I’d like to talk about the agreement we made to start our meetings on time. I notice we are not doing it. What needs to happen to keep our agreement?” (*Test agreement.*)
- The facilitator leads a conversation in which the group develops an agreement.

**VARIATIONS**
- A group member requests this topic be placed on the agenda.

**TIPS**
- This relates to the group member capability—know when to self-assert and when to integrate.

The image is a page from a book titled "The Adaptive School." The page provides detailed instructions for two group facilitation strategies: "Setting Group Working Agreements" and "Thumbs-Up."

---

**Setting Group Working Agreements**
*Establish Ground Rules*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
- Member ownership of working agreements.

**PROCESS**
- Sometimes, when a group is beginning a long-term relationship, invite the group to develop their own working agreements.
- Brainstorm and record possible agreements.
- Clarify brainstormed items.
- Select the five to seven most important to group success.
- Post these at each meeting or place on each printed agenda.
- Later, should members stray from an agreement, the facilitator or a member intervenes.

**ALTERNATIVES**
- For mature groups this might convey negative attitudes about the group’s capacity. When this is so, or when a group is working well, do not use this.
- For ad hoc groups suggest a set of predetermined working agreements such as demonstrate mutual success, employ skillful listening, develop sufficient consensus, and ask if the group is willing to adopt them. Define each set of terms.

---

**Thumbs-Up**
*Poll the Group*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
- Dip-stick group sentiment.

**PROCESS**
- The facilitator or any member can call for a thumbs-up to determine the degree of agreement the group has on an item.
- Thumbs up means yes, thumbs down means no, thumbs held sideways means not sure or it doesn’t matter.
- Call for a show of thumbs.
- Announce the result.

**VARIATIONS**
- Use as a poll to learn what direction/thinking the group is favoring prior to further conversation.
- Use as a mechanism for sufficient consensus.

**TIPS**
- Ask members with thumbs held sideways to explain their reasoning.
- Ask members with thumbs held down what would need to be modified in the proposal for them give it thumbs-up.

Discussions often culminate in decisions. This set of strategies is used when the leader desires that a group be involved in either recommending a decision, making a decision, or having subgroups decide and bring a decision back to the full group for approval. Decisions by vote are perceived as the least useful, and often counterproductive in that issues are often not fully explored and votes produce both winners and losers. Those who did not vote on an item typically have low commitment and motivation to follow through. Sufficient consensus is the most practical participative approach to decision making in school settings. Rarely would a group have the time to reach full or 100 percent consensus on an item, so reaching a level in which 80 percent agree is considered sufficient to move along. Critically important in this approach is that the voices of those who do not agree are heard, and they know others understand their reservations. Sufficient consensus, or full consensus for that matter, is not designed to make people happy but rather to reach a decision that represents the best feasible course of action.

This form of decision making involves everyone clearly understanding the situation at hand, analyzing the relevant facts together, and then jointly developing solutions that represent the group’s best thinking about an optimal decision. Dialogue, a lot of listening, and the understanding of divergent opinions precede it. Sufficient consensus generates a decision about which everyone says, “I can live with it.”

Participative decision-making takes longer than decisions made independently from a leader, but requires very little time in gaining acceptance by a group. Participant decision-making is used in situations in which choices affect behaviors of members; complex decisions are under consideration affecting several groups of people; and when understanding, commitment, and motivation to implement are desired.

**100% Consensus (Bob Chadwick)**  
*Full Consensus on Guiding Documents such as Mission Statements or Values*

**PURPOSES AND INTENTIONS**  
Commitment of each member to adoption of a document.

**PROCESS**
- In a group of six or less, invite someone to volunteer to be a facilitator and someone to be a scribe.
- Define the facilitator’s role as calling on people and keeping the process intact. The scribe’s role is to chart exactly what each person says, then make the exact corrections requested by subsequent group members.
- The facilitator poses a question such as, What should be the role of the project leader?” or “How shall we define completion?”
- In round-robin fashion, members are called on to contribute one sentence which is recorded word-for-word by the scribe.

Certainly! Here is a detailed description and accurate transcription of the text in the image:

---

**The Adaptive School**

- Before the process is complete, both the facilitator and scribe can have someone briefly take their roles while they contribute a sentence.
- When all sentences are charted, the facilitator asks, “Is there anyone who cannot live with this as stated?”
- Members may raise their hand, and offer different wording for parts of the sentence. Without consultation, the scribe scratches out the original and adds the new.
- The facilitator asks again, “Is there anyone who cannot live with the first sentence?” The process continues until no more changes are suggested for the first sentence.
- The facilitator repeats the process for the second sentence.
- The process is repeated for all the remaining sentences.

**ALTERNATIVES**
- For larger groups, have subgroups work on the same task—report results to the full group, then have the scribes draft a statement containing all the words of the several versions.
- Develop a full paragraph before editing.

**TIPS**
- Schedule a couple of hours for this strategy.
- Don’t wordsmith. Request corrections only if the corrections refine the meaning.
- Do not “go along” with something you are uncomfortable with.
- This will go slow at first. About midway through it will pick up speed.

---

**Combine Opposites**  
*Decisions*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Subgroups resolve impasse without audience.

**PROCESS**
- Use when the group is stuck. Ask if two sets of persons with divergent views would be willing to step outside and bring a recommendation back to the group.
- Ask the group if this recommendation is agreeable.
- Determine a time for the subgroup to converse. Their choices are: now, outside the meeting room, or later at a break. The only limitation is that the recommendation must be made today.
- Clarify the subgroup’s decision-making authority with the full group. Determine whether the subgroup will be making a decision by which the group will abide or bring a recommendation for group consideration.

**TIPS**
- Request or suggest that certain members serve on the committee. Asking the most impassioned voice to serve increases the likelihood of group acceptance.
- Set a time limit for the subgroup.

### Eliminate the Negative
*Decisions*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
- Reduce decision complexity

**PROCESS**
- Assuming members have clarified items on a list, ask, “Are there any items you would be okay removing?”
- When a member names an item, ask if anyone objects. If not, remove the item.
- If there is an objection, do not remove the item. No discussion required.
- When this process is complete, move to the next step in the decision-making process.

**TIPS**
- Explain that this process saves the group the time of talking about items in which the group has limited interest.

---

### Existing State-Desired State Map
*Decisions*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
- Focus on outcomes

**PROCESS**
- Display a desired state map, as shown below.
- Explain that defining the desired state establishes a goal and is more important than exploring why the problem exists.
- The group names a desired state in broad terms.
- Next develop a behavioral description. What would one see and hear when the desired state is achieved?
- Next identify the resources needed to achieve the desired state. Consider skills, knowledge, and behavior.
- Select the most catalytic of resources and develop a plan for developing them.

**VARIATIONS**
- Generate a description of the existing state, and then describe the desired state as a direct contrast to existing state elements.

**TIPS**
- The facilitator should preview the stages and sequence of thinking required in this approach.
- When members do not have the same information about an issue, it is useful to describe the existing state from the various perspectives. Otherwise, public display of the existing state is rarely of great value unless using the direct contrast approach described as an alternative.

**Forced Choice Stickers I**
*Decisions*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Provide interactive decision-making protocol

**PROCESS**
- List options on flip chart.
- Distribute an equal amount of stickers to each member.
- Instruct members to spend all their stickers.
- Members place stickers near preferred options.
- The stickers represent a vote and are binding. See variations.

---

**Forced Choice Stickers II**
*Decisions*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Provide advocacy and interactive decision-making protocol

**PROCESS**
- Chart and post various options from which to select.
- Invite members to stand by the chart of their first choice. Ask members to talk about why they value this option. Have each group select a spokesperson.
- Each spokesperson gives a brief advocacy statement.
- Entertain questions of clarification.
- Provide each member with an equal amount of stickers.
- Stickers are spent.

**VARIATIONS**
- The group examines sticker distribution and decides which few options should receive further consideration and conversation.
- Post options on several flip charts. Subgroups stand by options representing their choices and tell group rationale for their choice.
- After advocating and inquiring about members’ choices, fresh stickers are distributed and spent.

---

**Facilitation Strategies and Moves**  
**Appendix A**

---

**TIPS**
- Some members will want to know if they can spend all their stickers on one option. Discourage this.
- It is acceptable to place more than one of one’s stickers on an item.
- Prior dialogue is valuable.

---

**Freeing Stuck Groups**  
*Decisions*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Facilitate decision-making

**PROCESS**
- The facilitator asks, “What’s stopping us from making a decision?” or “Who would be willing to meet with (name) and (name) and develop a proposal for the next meeting?” or “Are you willing to give the subcommittee the authority to make that decision?” or “Would it be agreeable to the group if we asked (name) to bring us more information before we proceed?” or “I think this is a decision for (name). Shall we ask her to make it?”

**VARIATIONS**
- Group members can also pose these questions.
- See “Naïve Questions” in this appendix.
- See “Close the Discussion” options in this appendix.

**TIPS**
- Identify, when possible, the time available in the meeting to reach closure.

---

**Is/Is Not (Doyle and Straus)**  
*Decisions*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Identify most relevant data

**PROCESS**
- In one column write the facts that are known about a problem, where it is, what its effects are, when it occurs, and so on. For example, the boys scored higher than the girls in four of the five test batteries.
- In a second column write facts that are known to not be part of the problem. For example, boys and girls are doing equally well in daily assignments.

**VARIATIONS**
- Small groups generate is and is nots. Report and agree on the most significant examples.
- Follow this with data gathering based on the is/is not analysis.

**TIPS**
- Provide categories for “is”: where, when, to what extent, and with whom does the problem occur?
- Provide categories for “is not”: where, when, to what extent, and with whom does this not occur? Therefore, what might explain the pattern of occurrence and nonoccurrence?

**Section 1:**

**Not A or B, but C**  
*Decisions*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Eliminate decision obstacles

**PROCESS**
- The group is polarized on two options.
- Ask if anyone can suggest a third option (C) that might contain what seems to be attractive about the first two (A and B).

**VARIATIONS**
- List desirable features of A.
- List desirable features of B.
- Have small groups generate options that contain the positive aspects of A and B while minimizing the negative aspects of each.

**TIPS**
- If the group remains stuck, use a criteria matrix shown in the appendix.

---

**Section 2:**

**Paired Weighting**  
*Decisions*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Rank larger groups of items.

**PROCESS**
- Individuals compare each item with every other item according to importance.
- Example: Which is more important, A as compared to B, A as compared to C, A as compared to D, etc. Then B as compared to A, B as compared to C, B as compared to D, etc.
- Participants go through the items, comparing each pair, circling their preferences. They count up all the As, the Bs, the Cs.
- When counting up their responses, participants count across the A line: From then on they count down and then across, starting with B in the top line and then down (counting only the circled letters); then C down and across, then D down and across, etc.

**VARIATIONS**
- You can also compare the items in reference to performance: How are we performing? Which are we performing better? A or B, A or C, A or D, etc. Then B or C, B or D, etc.—You can do either or both processes.
- Numbered cards are thrown on the table and members scramble for their question of choice.
- Add other summary checks for groups larger than four. Some examples might be:
  - Who needs to know what happened in this meeting?
  - By when are the next steps due?
  - What should be highlighted in the minutes of the meeting?

**Rule of One-Third (Doyle and Straus)**
*Identify the Most Important Ideas*

---

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Achieve agreement

---

**PROCESS**
- Bullet point: "Alert the group that after sufficient items have been identified, members will be asked to pick about a third of the items they feel are most important. Explain that this will identify the items most important to the group for further analysis."
- Bullet point: "Use the formula one-third plus one in this way: For a list of twelve items each member would choose five. For a list of twenty items, each member would choose 8."
- Bullet point: "For each item on the list, the facilitator asks for a show of hands and records the number of hands on the chart, circled, in a color not yet used."
- Bullet point: "After counting is completed, ask the group to identify the top few items—mark these in some fashion."
- Bullet point: "When about a third have been identified, or at the point in which a large gap appears between two numbers as in 20, 18, 16, 12, the group will be asked if they want to include the last number (in this example 12)."

---

**NEXT STEPS**
- Bullet point: "Depending on the purpose for identifying high priority items, a number of options exist including: (1) accept all as in a staff development menu, (2) have a subcommittee study and return with recommendations when only one choice is to be made, (3) address the high priority items with other tools of discernment, such as pros and cons or measuring items against a list of criteria."

**Header:**
- The Adaptive School

---

**TIPS**
- Explain that numbers will not make the decisions; group members will be able to advocate for an item not selected and if the group agrees, add it to the list.
- See the video “Focusing Four: A Consensus Seeking Activity for Prioritizing,” Robert Garmston and Michael Dolcemascolo, Denver, Colorado (www.thinkingcollaborative.com, 2009) for a demonstration of the entire process.

---

**Six-Position Straw Poll**  
*Decisions*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Display proposition preferences

**PROCESS**
- Members give poll page to designated person who records the tallies on a wall chart.

**TIPS**
- If you have a lot of 5s and 6s, you should think carefully before implementing it.

---

**Table:**

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| I strongly agree | I agree | I agree with some reservations | I disagree but I’m willing to go with the majority | I disagree but don’t want to stop others | I disagree strongly and will work to block it |
| I really like it | I like it | It’s OK | I don’t think it’s all that great but I’m willing to go along with the majority | I don’t like it, but am willing to go along because I don’t want to stop them | I really don’t like it and will work to change it |
| I’ll advocate for it publicly and privately whether or not it’s adopted | I’ll advocate for it publicly and privately | I’ll support it publicly even with my reservations | I’ll support it publicly and privately when asked | I won’t advocate against it publicly or privately | I’ll actively advocate against it publicly if adopted |
| I’ll actively support its implementation | I’ll support its implementation. | I’ll participate in its implementation | I may be involved in its implementation. I will wait and see | I won’t be involved in implementing, but I won’t sabotage it | If implemented, I will work to change it |

The image is a page from a book or manual titled "Facilitation Strategies and Moves," specifically from "Appendix A." The page number is 269. The content is organized into sections with bullet points and headings, describing different facilitation strategies for group decision-making and idea generation. Here is a detailed description and transcription of the text:

---

**Facilitation Strategies and Moves**  
**APPENDIX A**

---

- State a problem in “how to” language such as “How to increase student attendance,” or “How to support the lower quartile kids in mathematics.”
- Members write only one idea per card.
- Collect and categorize the cards. Discard duplicate, ambiguous, or illegible items.
- Present and study categories and ideas.

**ALTERNATIVES**
- Use slips to prioritize items. On each slip, members record a letter for the item (A, B, C, and so on) and a number representing the priority weight they assign to it. Assuming they have twelve items, 12 would be highest weight, 11 the next highest, and 1 the lowest.
- Slips are turned in and stacked alphabetically. The numbers for each letter are tabulated and presented to the group.

**TIPS**
- Fifteen participants should be able to generate 150 ideas.
- Because it so mechanical and free from influence, this form of prioritizing is useful when there is low trust in the group.

---

**Spend a Buck**  
*Decisions*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Reveal individual or collective choices

**PROCESS**
- Members have one hundred imaginary pennies they can distribute across a few options.
- Explain the options.
- Individuals decide how many pennies they will spend on each option.
- Gather and present the data to the group.

**VARIATIONS**
- Use for individual choices rather than a collective expression of priorities.

**TIPS**
- Provide think time before members assign pennies.

---

**Sufficient Consensus**  
*Decisions*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Achieve agreement

**PROCESS**
- Determine a figure—like 80 percent—that will represent sufficient consensus.
- Keep to one process at a time.
- Members clarify and advocate for items.
- Members may inquire as to the reasoning of another member’s choice.

**Header:**  
THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL

---

- Minority view voices must be encouraged to speak.
- Member views can be paraphrased.
- Call for a show of hands.
- Announce the result.

**VARIATIONS**
- Determine what percentage will qualify as sufficient consensus in general.
- In any meeting, an item can be singled out for even a 100 percent consensus. This should be very rare.

**TIPS**
- No member has the right to block a group.
- Employ a guideline for members not budging from a position. Ask if this is a matter of principle or preference. If a principle, encourage dialogue; if a preference, after others understand the preference, set it aside.

---

**Thumbs-Up**  
*Decisions*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Members and facilitator understand tentative degrees of agreement.

**PROCESS**
- The facilitator or any member can call for a thumbs-up to determine the degree of agreement the group has on an item.
- Thumbs up means yes, thumbs down means no, thumbs held sideways means not sure or it doesn’t matter.
- Call for a show of hands.
- Announce the result.

**VARIATIONS**
- Use as a poll to learn what direction/thinking the group is favoring prior to further conversation.
- Use as a mechanism for sufficient consensus.

**TIPS**
- Ask members with thumbs held sideways to explain their reasoning.
- Ask members with thumbs held down what would need to be modified in the proposal for them give it thumbs up.

- "APPENDIX A" (top right)

---

### PROCESS

- Ask the group to express their response to a statement visually.
- Show five fingers for strongly agree, four for agree, three for neutral, two for disagree, one for strongly disagree.
- Ask each person to respond to this question on a Post-It note: “What would it take to get me reenergized?”
- Phrase the statements as “I’m satisfied with the direction the group is taking,” or “We should move forward on this initiative now.”
- Say the number of fingers you see as you scan the group, as 3, 3, 2, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 3, 2.
- Interpret what you see as, “Seems to be an average of about four,” or “I notice responses on both ends of the scale. Can members voting low share some reasons for their response and members voting high do the same thing?”

---

### VARIATIONS

- Ask members to look around the room and compare what they see with the number of fingers they are displaying.

---

### TIPS

- The benefit of value voting is that the responses are public, giving the group a sense of the whole.
- Use this as a straw poll only, not a final decision—unless you see unanimous display of five fingers.

---

---

**Section Divider Line**

---

**Set and Test Working Agreements**
*Generate and Adhere to Agreements*

---

### PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Members influence group practice.

---

### PROCESS

- A group member says, “I notice that our meetings are not starting on time Could we make an agreement to start on time?” (*Set agreement.*)
- The facilitator leads a conversation in which the group develops an agreement.
- In a later meeting a group member says, “I’d like to talk about the agreement we made to start our meetings on time. I notice we are not doing it. What needs to happen to keep our agreement?” (*Test agreement.*)
- The facilitator leads a conversation in which the group develops an agreement.

---

### VARIATIONS

- A group member requests this topic be placed on the agenda.
- When working agreements have previously been made by the group, either the facilitator or member can call attention to agreement fidelity.

---

### TIPS

- This relates to the group member capability—know when to self-assert and when to integrate.

**Description:**
The image is a page from a book titled "The Adaptive School." The page is focused on the topic of planning, specifically a strategy called "Accordion Planning." The layout includes a table, a section of explanatory text, a small illustration of people in a meeting, and structured sections with headings and bullet points.

---

**Transcription:**

---

**THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL**

| Activate and Engage | Process Text and Information | Generate Ideas | Dialogue | Discuss | Decide | **Plan** | Summarize |

To plan is to envision the steps necessary to reach a goal; who should be involved in what ways, and determining what time frames and materials are necessary. This collection of strategies support groups in understanding the contexts and issues about which they are planning, ways of involving others and ways to assess progress

---

*(There is a small illustration of people sitting around a table with one person standing and presenting at a board.)*

---

**Accordion Planning**  
*Receive Full Group Input in Planning*

**PURPOSES AND INTENTIONS**  
Allow planning teams to work deeply while informing and getting feedback from the larger group at various planning stages.

**PROCESS**
- Planning team adopts a template such as define the problem, analyze causes, identify possible solutions, and implement and test solutions.
- After each stage, planning team members work with others in the organization, informing of the team’s work and seeking reaction and guidance.
- The planning team takes into account responses from the larger group, refines that stage of their work, then repeats the process for the remaining stages up to implementation.

**VARIATIONS**
- Select different planning templates.
- Have each team member report to a group in which they hold membership like a grade level or department.

**TIPS**
- Team members must be clear they are to think for themselves, rather than represent and only speak for the thinking of a group they are a member of.
- Accordion planning takes longer than using a process in which a planning team does the full work, then reports to the larger group. The benefit of this form of planning that makes it worth the extra time is the degree of ownership held by other members of the organization.

The image is a page from a book or manual titled "Facilitation Strategies and Moves" from Appendix A. The page number is 273.

The content is organized into three main facilitation strategies, each with sections for "Purpose and Intentions," "Process," and sometimes "Variations" or "Tips." Here is a detailed transcription:

---

**Denominalize**  
*Render Concepts Amenable to Problem Solving*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Be proactive in response to statements like “We have a problem with communication,” or “There is limited trust in our group.”

**PROCESS**
- Inform a group that when verbs or adjectives have been converted into nouns, they become nominalizations. It is not possible to solve nominalizations, so for planning to start they must be denominalized.
- Invite the group to denominalize by phrasing challenges as “What will we see and hear ourselves doing when we are communicating more effectively? This way of stating the problem reveals the desired state about which a group can plan.

---

**Done—Yet to Do—Questions**  
*Name Action Steps*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Identify and agree on what yet needs to be done.

**PROCESS**
- Regarding a group project, individual members record a list of tasks that are done, tasks that are yet to be done, and questions about getting the work done.
- In table groups, share the information.
- Get agreement on the next most important things to be done.

**VARIATIONS**
- Identify tasks that should be discarded if not done.
- Run the process as a facilitated full-group activity.

**TIPS**
- Members are often so deep in the complexity of work that it is hard to see where they are and generate focus and energy for the next tasks.

---

**Fishbone Diagram**  
*Planning for Technical Change*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Discover cause and effect relationships.

**PROCESS**
- Draw a fishbone diagram on chart paper as shown below.
- Code sections of the chart that may be related to an existing condition of an issue. For tardiness, for example, getting to school, school responses to tardiness, school staff, and home might be listed.
- Brainstorm factors that might be affecting the existing condition and record on the diagram.
- Explore pros and cons of various combinations of solution approaches.

--- Page Break ---

Certainly! Here is a detailed description and transcription of the content in the image:

---

**Header:**
- *THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL* (top left corner)

---

**Section:**
- **ALTERNATIVES**
  - Have subgroups brainstorm each of the categories and record them on a separate chart.
  - Next, report and explore the various charts. Allow additions.

- **TIPS**
  - Protect the group from delving into too much minutia.

---

**Fishbone Diagram**
- There is a labeled diagram titled "Fishbone Diagram" in bold.
- The diagram is a classic fishbone (Ishikawa) diagram with a horizontal line labeled "result:" and several diagonal lines labeled "Cause" branching off, each with smaller branches labeled "Detail."

---

**Force Field Analysis**
- *Technical Change Planning* (italicized)

---

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
- Select opposing forces to weaken and favorable forces to strengthen.

---

**PROCESS**
- Post a T-bar chart with a topic or goal at top. In the left side, write “forces for” and in the right side, write “forces against.”
- Members list forces that fall into either category.
- Members may paraphrase or question for clarity.
- Limit each list to about six items. Once the list is deemed complete, mark the three strongest forces on either side.
- Explore how the forces against might be made weaker and the forces for, strengthened. This phase may take the form of dialogue.
- Rate the forces and how feasible it would be to modify them.
- Select one or more on which to work.

---

**VARIATIONS**
- Assign the first three tasks above to small work groups, then chart and post group results.
- As a full group, entertain questions of clarification.
- Continue with the process as a full group.

---

**TIPS**
- Some forces may legitimately appear on either side of the chart.
- It is usually easier to weaken the forces restraining change than it is to strengthen the helping forces.

### Content Description

#### Text Content

- **Header:**  
  "Facilitation Strategies and Moves" (top left)  
  "APPENDIX A" (top right)

- **Bullet Point:**  
  "Topics such as decreasing dropout rates, increasing attendance, or increasing student motivation to write might prove challenging, as their complexity exceeds this simple analysis."

- **Section Title:**  
  **Futures Wheel**  
  *Identifying Possible Consequences*

- **PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
  Reveal factors to consider in planning.

- **PROCESS**  
  - Display a futures wheel on chart paper.
  - Write the name of the innovation or idea that the group will be working with in the center of the wheel.
  - Work outward from the center to the first layer of circles.
  - Identify two positive consequences and two negative consequences. Have the positive and negative be as different as possible.
  - Continue in this manner to the second layer, then the third, or fourth.
  - Dialogue about the findings. How might this information influence the perceptions and decisions of a planning team?

- **VARIATIONS**  
  - Through this process, a need for more information may surface. Determine what is needed and how to gather it.
  - Two small groups could work on the same decision, then share results to gain greater perspective.

- **TIPS**  
  - These are not predictions. They are possible consequences.
  - An analysis of the data may lead a group to abandon the idea.
  - An analysis of the data may inform a group of ways of implementing the idea that would avoid some negatives.
  - Use the information to learn what needs to be communicated to whom and in what ways.

#### Image Content

- At the bottom of the page, there is a simple diagram labeled "Futures Wheel."  
  - The diagram consists of a central circle labeled "Futures Wheel," with several concentric circles radiating outward.  
  - Lines connect the central circle to the first layer of circles, which are then connected to a second layer, and so on, illustrating the branching out of consequences or ideas.

The image is a page from a book titled "The Adaptive School." The page provides detailed instructions for two group facilitation activities: "Histomap (Suzanne Bailey)" and "Outcome Mapping." Below is a detailed description and accurate transcription of the text:

---

**The Adaptive School**

---

**Histomap (Suzanne Bailey)**
*Learn from Group History*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Release emotional barriers to working toward a desired state.

**PROCESS**
- Hang chart paper on wall like a timeline.
- Mark eras in the group’s history—the year the bond issue passed, the year the new principal arrived, the loss of a federal program, etc.
- Use icons to illustrate the different events that occurred within each of the eras.
- Next, groups of people add words and icons to the timeline and share their memories.

**VARIATIONS**
- Organize groups randomly or as intact working groups.

**TIPS**
- When people hear about the same event from different perspectives, a more complex history is understood.
- What is expressed and understood can be released and need not dominate the working space of the group.

---

**Outcome Mapping**
*Resolve Persistent Performance Problems*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Discover and strengthen internal resources to improve performance.

**PROCESS**
- Reveal purpose and process to group.
- Display six columns with these headings:
  ◦ Presenting problem
  ◦ Tentative outcome
  ◦ Desired behavior of selected others
  ◦ Internal resources required to achieve desired behaviors
  ◦ Change agent strategies to build resources
  ◦ Internal resources required for change agent to perform strategies.
- Elicit responses from group; paraphrase and record responses.
- If there is disagreement regarding what group members say, dialogue may be scheduled for another meeting.

**VARIATIONS**
- Facilitate the use of this map with a change agent desiring change from another group or individual.

**Facilitation Strategies and Moves**  
**APPENDIX A**

- Use as a group facilitation tool.
- Direct the focus to others or to self as a group.
- Use to explore potential strategies to promote growth for an individual.

**TIPS**
- This is task analysis work and must be followed in sequence. Intuitive leaps and leaps to solution should be set aside. We can’t prescribe solutions until the exact behaviors and required resources are known.
- *Presenting problem.* Don’t need specific descriptors. (Ex. Don’t function as a team.)
- *Tentative outcome.* Don’t need specific descriptors. (Ex. Uses team work.)
- *Desired behavior.* State behaviorally: What, by when, how much.
    - Behaviors must be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant to the larger outcome, and tactical. Tactical means the positive byproduct of the existing state can be maintained.
    - Select a few behaviors, most amenable to change in the near future, for the analysis that follows.
- *Internal resources.* Answers the question: “What knowledge, skills, attitudes, or states of mind would be necessary to perform these behaviors?” The assumption is that if they were present, the behaviors would be present.
- *Change agent’s strategies.* Answers the question: “What strategies might the change agent perform in order to have the group access the required resources?”
- *Internal resources for change agent.* Answers the question: “What knowledge, skills, attitudes, or states of mind would the change agent need to have to perform identified strategies?”

---

**Polarity Mapping**  
*Identify and Manage Paradoxes*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Engage members with polarized positions to look beyond one view and forge a workable way to manage the situation.

**PROCESS**
- Identify an ongoing chronic issue.
- Identify a key polarity.
- Agree on value neutral names for each of the poles.
- Draw map below on chart paper.
- Write the pole names on the map.
- Brainstorm content for each quadrant.
- Agree on a name for the highest purpose and deepest fear.
- Facilitate a conversation so members can view and explore the dilemma as a whole and from various perspectives.
- Develop strategies for realizing the upsides of both poles while avoiding the downsides of each pole.

The image is a page from a document titled "Facilitation Strategies and Moves" from "Appendix A." The page number at the bottom right is 279.

The content is divided into two main sections, each describing a facilitation strategy:

---

**Responsibility Charting**  
*Decisions*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Insure follow-up accountability

**PROCESS**
- List all major responsibilities on the left side of a chart. List the names of team members and other persons related to the responsibilities along the top.
- Review all responsibilities and code “R” to mean responsible for the task, “A” to indicate who must authorize decisions, “S” to indicate members providing support and “I” for those who must stay informed.

**VARIATIONS**
- Do this work with a subcommittee to reduce full group meeting time on this task.

**TIPS**
- This can become cumbersome to complete with a full group.

---

**Spot Analysis**  
*Strategic Planning*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Develop a plan.

**PROCESS**
- Hang chart paper on the wall divided into quadrants.
- Label the four sections strengths, problems, opportunities, and threats (SPOT).
- List strengths, then problems.
- Rank the strengths and problems if you have time.
- Brainstorm opportunities. Invite members to see potential opportunities within problems.
- List threats. Explore which ones could invalidate the work of the group.
- Review the chart for insights and action ideas.

**VARIATIONS**
- Next, categorize elements of an issue to be addressed such as curriculum, assessment, and staff development.
- List concerns or goals within each category.
- Identify connections across categories.
- Consider intervening at various starting places.

**TIPS**
- Assign the alternative ideas to a subgroup.

### Structure Conversations About Data
*Data-Driven Planning*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Utilize data to achieve outcomes.

**PROCESS**
- Select type of outcome, demographic, or process data.
- Select most useful organization of data.
- Determine type of analysis.

See chapter 11, Facilitating Data Teams.

---

### Wicked Problems Map
*Preparing Action Plans*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Reveal systems for adaptive planning

**PROCESS**
- Draw a large circle on chart paper and a smaller circle in the center.
- The smaller circle describes the project/initiative the group is working on. It might be implementing rigorous content standards.
- In the outer circle list the systems and practices that would be affected. For implementing standards these might include curriculum alignment, parent expectations, data collection, special education, teacher evaluation, district culture, professional development, reporting practices, and so on.
- Identify complexities and factors that would need to be taken into consideration in developing an action plan.

**VARIATIONS**
- Generate list of affected systems and practices in small group conversations prior to developing the problem map.

**TIPS**
- Apply to “wicked problems” for which no known solution processes are available. Often these require new mental models or are dynamical, producing emergent phenomena within systems and subsystems.

- Activate and Engage
- Process Text and Information
- Generate Ideas
- Dialogue
- Discuss
- Decide
- Plan
- **Summarize** (bolded)

**Text below the table:**
> To summarize is to restate using fewer words, to abstract the essence of information or to make a communication more concise. Groups often use a summarizing strategy to bring closure and understanding to discourse or to concisely evaluate the value or effectiveness of a meeting.

**Illustration:**
- An image of a group of people sitting and facing a person who is presenting at a board.

**Section:**

**7-11 Conversations**
*Organize and Integrate*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Recall, clarify, and correct misunderstandings regarding what happened in a meeting.

**PROCESS**
- Members prepare comments they would make to a friend summarizing this meeting.
- After composing—either mentally or on paper—members mill about the room sharing their comments with others.
- After a few minutes, the facilitator redirects members to report to the full group some of their summaries.
- The facilitator and group edit for consistency and accuracy.

**ALTERNATIVES**
- Summaries can be written and passed around a table for editing.

**TIPS**
- Frame this as a conversation in a convenience store needing to be brief, informal, and without academic language.
- People often report different versions of what happens in meetings. This corrects this tendency.

---

**Section:**
---
**Content Check**
*Summarize*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Clarify the what, why, and how of next steps.

**PROCESS**
- Randomly distribute cards numbered one through four.
- Display a chart with the following ideas:
  1. Walk out knowing what to do.
  2. Why are we doing it?

---

**The Adaptive School**

---

**3. What are we expecting to see?  
4. What are our next steps?**
- The numbers members received determine which meeting summary statement they make.

**VARIATIONS**
- Members draw a playing card.
- Numbered cards are thrown on the table and members scramble for their questions of choice.
- Add other summary checks for groups larger than four. Some examples might be:
  - Who needs to know what happened in this meeting?
  - By when are the next steps due?
  - What should be highlighted in the minutes of the meeting?

**TIPS**
- Make the process routine for greatest results or alternate with “Process Check” in this appendix.

---

**Gots and Wants**  
*Meeting Assessment*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Adjust ways of working with group based on group feedback.

**PROCESS**
- Individuals compose “gots” on sticky notes, one idea per sticky note. A “got” might be an idea received, something learned, or a positive response to working with colleagues.
- Individuals compose “wants” on sticky notes, one idea per sticky note. A “want” might be a comment about process (go faster or slower), a request for information, or a comment about materials.
- As the group adjourns, members place their sticky notes on charts labeled as GOTS or WANTS.

**VARIATIONS**
- See “Plusses and Wishes” in this appendix.

**TIPS**
- After the event, categorize and label the gots and wants. Use this information to adjust your practices at the next session.
- Communicate to the group your response to their needs as you open the next session.

The image is a page from a document titled "Facilitation Strategies and Moves" (Appendix A). The page provides detailed instructions for three facilitation strategies: crafting a "matchbook" definition, identifying the Most Important Point (MIP), and creating a One-Word Summary. Below is a detailed description and transcription of the text:

---

**PROCESS**
- Following the introduction of a topic, groups craft a “matchbook” definition.
- Like a matchbook, very few words can be used (eight to twelve).
- Groups have five minutes to craft and post the definition.

**VARIATIONS**
- Use this strategy to check understandings by summarizing conclusions from a discussion or dialogue.

**TIPS**
- Set wordsmithing aside. Save it for a different task.
- Keep the definitions posted for later reference.
- Use half sheets of chart paper to encourage short definitions.

---

**Most Important Point (MIP)**

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Energize members as they distinguish and report personally relevant information.

**PROCESS**
- Invite the group to reflect on something learned or a conversation held.
- Stand, locate a partner, and share your most important point.

**VARIATIONS**
- Add “Partners Report” to this activity. Members will report to the full assembly the Most Important Point of their partner. The reporting need not be reciprocal and reporting is best done while members are still standing.
- Instead of locating another partner, share MIPs at tables and agree on a table MIP.

**TIPS**
- Learning partners, eye contact partners, or any configuration of partnerships can be used. See “Learning Partner” in this listing of strategies and moves.
- When partners report, because they are reporting their partner’s ideas, they will be briefer.

---

**One-Word Summary**
*Summarize*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Synthesize a conversation or information from a text.

**PROCESS**
- Write one word that summarizes the central idea from this conversation or text.
- Share with a neighbor or table group.

**THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL**

---

**ALTERNATIVES**
- See “Most Important Point,” “Scrambled Sentences,” “Three Balloons,” or “5-3-1” in this appendix.

**TIPS**
- Allow “open text” in which members might review notes or text before arriving at a one-word summary.

---

**Pluses and Wishes**
*Meeting Assessment*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**
Adjust ways of working with group based on group feedback.

**PROCESS**
- Inform the group you will be requesting members to name pluses (things they appreciated or things that supported their learning) and wishes (things they wish the group had done more of, less of, or differently).
- Use two to four flip charts depending on size of group. Each chart is displayed as a T-Bar with pluses at the top left and wishes at the top right.
- Recruit recorders.
- Request pluses first. As each plus is named, paraphrase and direct it to recorders in turn.
- Ask for wishes and repeat the patterns.
- Members orally report pluses—what they valued about content or processes—while a recorder charts the ideas.
- Next, report wishes—what they wish had been done more, less, differently, or wishes for the next session.

**VARIATIONS**
- “Gots and Wants” (elsewhere in this list) is another strategy that serves this purpose.
- With a small group, up to ten or so people, you can serve as both facilitator and recorder.

**ALTERNATIVES**
- Use multiple recorders to speed the charting process.

**TIPS**
- After initial contributions always ask “What else?” rather than “Is there anything else?” to elicit further comments.
- State as “What are some pluses . . .” not “Are there any plusses?”
- After the session, organize each category into sub-topics and report to the group at the next session how their ideas have informed this next session.
- Keep your facial and verbal responses neutral.

The image is a page from a book or manual titled "Facilitation Strategies and Moves," specifically from Appendix A. The page number is 285. The content is organized into three main facilitation strategies, each with sections for purpose, process, variations, and tips. Here is a detailed transcription:

---

**Recipe**  
*Review and Condense*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Engage both sides of brain in review.

**PROCESS**
- Provide format: “Recipe For ________; Name of Dish ____; From the Kitchen of ____; Serves ____; Ingredients ____.”
- Table groups develop and post recipes on chart paper.
- Spokesperson from each table makes a brief presentation to the group.

**VARIATIONS**
- Provide ingredients with which the recipe will be made.
- Use a “Gallery Walk” to share recipes.

**TIPS**
- Give a time estimate, usually about fifteen minutes.

---

**Scrambled Sentences**  
*Review*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Energy and collective review.

**PROCESS**
- Each person writes one word on a card or sticky note illustrative of the individual’s learning.
- The group constructs a sentence using all the words while adding as few words as possible.
- Group spokespersons read the sentences to the full group.

**VARIATIONS**
- Write words for a common experience.
- After creating one sentence, have participants take their word and form another group, creating another sentence.

**TIPS**
- Give a signal for the group work to begin.

---

**Song Writing**  
*Review*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Engage right and left brain in summarizing important points.

---

The page is cleanly formatted with horizontal lines separating each strategy, and each section is clearly labeled.

--- Page Break ---

Certainly! Here is a detailed description and accurate transcription of the text in the image:

---

**The Adaptive School**

---

**PROCESS**
- Have individuals write the name of a song from their childhood on a sticky note.
- Next have them write the name of a song from their high school years.
- Next they write a song they associate with celebrations.
- Using these songs as activators, direct table groups to develop a song that expresses something about the full group in which they are participating, and prepare to perform it.
- Ask which group wants to go first, second, etc. Perform and appreciate.

**VARIATIONS**
- Use this to celebrate accomplishments or transitions in the life of the group.

**TIPS**
- Use this only when table groups have five or more members. This provides enough musical repertoire and style variance for a group to be successful.

---

**Sound and Motion Symphony**  
*Full-bodied Review*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Energy, creativity, and group cohesion.

**PROCESS**
- Table groups select a collective sound and a motion to represent their learning.
- Stand and rehearse.
- When groups are ready to perform, facilitator assumes role of symphony conductor.
- After each section of “instruments” is rehearsed, the facilitator conducts the group bringing different sections in and out as appropriate.

**VARIATIONS**
- The facilitator might stand on a riser or table for greater visibility.

**TIPS**
- Emphasize rationale. Explain that of the many ways humans organize and integrate knowledge, body movements bring a special opportunity for the kinesthetic learner. This activity focuses more on the affective domains of learning than the cognitive.
- Prerequisites for this activity are safe learning environment and trusting relationship with facilitator. Rarely would this occur on the first day of a group’s work.

---

**Three Balloons**  
*Summarize*

**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Quick individual and collective review.

**PROCESS**
- Imagine each member had three balloons on which there was space to write one word or phrase capturing an important idea from today’s work.

--- Page Break ---

The image is a page from a book or manual titled "Facilitation Strategies and Moves" from Appendix A. The page number is 287. The content describes two facilitation strategies: "Tweet" and "Walk About," including their purposes, processes, variations, and tips.

---

**Tweet**  
*Summarize*  
**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Reveal the essence of a topic.

**PROCESS**
- Following the introduction of a topic, groups craft a “tweet.”
- The summary can be no longer than 140 characters.
- Groups have five minutes to craft and post the definition.

---

**Walk About**  
*Review*  
**PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS**  
Reflection on what has been important, personally and as a group.

**PROCESS**
- Establish groups of four to six participants.
- Distribute walk about form. (See below.)
- Members write what they know in left margin (five minutes).
- Demonstrate talking with person from different table. Each provides one idea to the other.
- Each records in one of the cells the idea and the person’s name so others can be referred to that person for more information.
- After ten to twelve minutes, have people seated, sharing the data they gathered.
- Group members analyze data they have collected looking for themes or patterns.

**VARIATIONS**
- Reduce the number of cells to four to save time.
- Select prompts such as recall–insights–applications or know–want to know–think you know.

**TIPS**
- Ensure that people write their original barter material outside instead of inside one of the cells.

---

There is also a section at the top with bullet points and tips related to group reporting:
- Members record their ideas.
- Members report out to the full group.

**VARIATIONS**
- Do not report out.

**TIPS**
- Reporting is useful when the goal is to reinforce certain ideas, stimulate recognition of others, and contribute to a sense of “we” rather than “me.”

The content discusses the complexities faced by teachers in school-based leadership positions, particularly those whose roles involve facilitating school improvement efforts and whose responsibilities are influenced by special funding sources or district policy.

### Detailed Description and Transcription:

#### Main Body Text:
Teachers in school-based leadership positions whose responsibilities include facilitating school improvement efforts, and whose roles have been determined in part by special funding sources or district policy, often face the dilemma of having to sort out their working relationship with the school principal or other administrators to whom they normally report.

This is complex for two reasons. First, any employee–supervisor relationship is governed by multiple factors: district policy, negotiated agreements with employee organizations, the management and leadership style of the principal, the work culture in the school, the style characteristics of the employee, and the interpersonal relationship of the principal and the teacher-leader.

Because informal personalized factors have a greater influence on working procedures than do the hypothetical relationships described in program descriptions, the actual relationship is negotiated between the two people.

However, becoming clear about the working relationship is further complicated, because knowing who is to be served in a support role is complex for even the most practiced consultant or facilitator.

Because one cannot serve two masters, an early task for a consultant or facilitator is to learn who the primary and ultimate clients are. It is these parties whom the resource person is committed to serve. Thus, besides the question of the teacher–principal working relationship, there are several other questions that the teacher-leader and the principal must address:

1. Because of the potential for having role requirements given to the teacher-leader from sources beyond the principal, who exactly is the teacher-leader’s primary and ultimate client, and what are the teacher-leader’s responsibilities to those clients?
2. Under what conditions can the principal be a primary client?
3. Under what conditions can a working committee of the entire faculty be a primary client?
4. What are the core values that will guide this work?
5. Who is the client?

A contact client is a person who makes the initial contact with the teacher-leader. This establishes an expectation for serving a principal or a school according to the goals and descriptions of the funding program. Sometimes the contact comes from the following:

- A personnel office;
- A staff development office;
- An administrator in charge of special programs.

An intermediate client is involved in the early contracting arrangements between the teacher-leader and the school. This person is often responsible for administrating the districtwide program under which each teacher-leader has been assigned. The intermediate client will communicate program goals, procedures to follow, and job descriptions for the teacher-leader. These guidelines set the parameters within which the principal and teacher-leader are to work.

The primary client is the group with which the facilitator will work. Because specific goals and working procedures can be developed only with the primary client, the teacher-leader must be clear about who this is.

**Description:**
The image is a page from a book titled "The Adaptive School." The page number is 298. The content is organized in paragraphs with some bulleted lists. The text discusses the prerequisites for being a successful primary client, the roles of various clients in a school system, and considerations for facilitators working with groups.

**Three prerequisites for being successful as a primary client are as follows:**

- The primary client has made a free and informed choice to ask the facilitator for services.
- The primary client has accepted responsibility for the problem being worked on.
- The primary client has or can access the information necessary to develop solutions.

The ultimate clients are the stakeholders, whose interests should be protected even if they are not in direct contact with the meeting processes. These would include the organization as a whole, students, parents, and community members.

The larger the school system, the greater the chance that communications between the support-role person and the contact, intermediate, and primary clients will be incomplete, contradictory, or confusing. Large school systems, even with the best of intentions, have communication problems. This is a systems problem, not a people problem. The most effective level for aligning incongruent understandings about role and function is with the two people closest to the action, the teacher-leader and the principal. If necessary, the district resource teacher or the administrator who leads the program can help.

In some situations, the primary client might also be the contact and intermediate client. For example, a department chairperson asks you to facilitate a meeting to develop faculty consensus on a set of educational values. The chairperson then works with you to develop agreements on mutual responsibilities as well as the goals and agenda for this meeting. During the meeting that you facilitate, the chairperson is also a member of the group that is receiving your services.

A principal can be the primary client when he or she will receive, or be a member of the group that receives, direct services from the facilitator. The principal will be an effective primary client when he or she has met the three prerequisites listed above for being successful as a primary client.

A working committee of the entire faculty can be the primary client when it represents the full range of opinions of the faculty and when the same three conditions for success as a primary client have been met.

The ideas below are recommended as generic core values to guide all facilitation work.

What are the presenting problem, diagnosis, and plan? Facilitators should not assume that the client has accurately or inaccurately defined and diagnosed the problem. The confident client has already defined the problem, its causes, and a method for solving it, and asks, “Can you help me accomplish this?” The searching client has identified the problem but is not clear about its causes or the methods to solve it, and asks, “How can you help us with this problem?” The puzzled client has not yet identified the problem, and asks, “Can you help us to figure out what is going on and what to do about it?” The reluctant client talks with a facilitator because job expectations require it; this person asks, “What does the project want you to do?”

What are the resources and motivation for change? Two often overlooked resources for change are the group’s strengths and the critical voices of selected group members. Just because a group seeks help does not mean that it is interested in changing its behavior. Groups require resources to change. These include time, information, skills, knowledge, and motivation. Motivation to change can result from the following forms of discomfort:

- An internal dissatisfaction with the status quo;
- Organizational pressure to improve;
- An unachieved vision;
- A drive toward craftsmanship and continual improvement.

What type of facilitation services are being requested? In basic facilitation, the group seeks only to solve a substantive problem. The group engages a facilitator to temporarily

improve its processes in order to work on the problem. When the problem is resolved, the group’s process knowledge and skills are relatively unchanged. The basic facilitator is like a mechanic who fixes the group’s car well enough to get it to a destination. Facilitation and agenda development tend to be done by one or two individuals, and the group expects the facilitator to use whatever processes he or she considers effective.

In developmental facilitation, the group seeks to permanently improve its processes while solving a substantive problem. When the problem is resolved, the group will also be more knowledgeable and skilled at solving future problems. The developmental facilitator is like a staff developer who leads the group in learning how to monitor, repair, and redesign its own car so it can use the vehicle to reach any destination it seeks. Facilitation and agenda development are shared, and the group periodically reflects to learn from its experience.

**Description:**
The image is a page from a book titled "The Adaptive School." The page is formatted in two columns and contains bulleted lists and sections with headers. The content discusses the process of facilitation in a school improvement context, focusing on the relationship between the facilitator and the client (such as a principal or teacher-leader). It outlines steps, questions, and considerations for both ending and conducting facilitation relationships, as well as planning and data collection.

**THE ADAPTIVE SCHOOL**

- How will you know that you are finished?

**Exit and complete the Relationship Goals:**
- A decision to extend the facilitation relationship, recycle with a new problem, or end the relationship.
- Client clarity and commitment to personal next steps.
- Client empowerment to act independently.
- Client feedback to the facilitator on the facilitator’s services.

**Questions:**
- How will we know if the relationship should be extended, recycled, or ended?
- How do I know if the client has the resources to successfully pursue the next steps?
- How can I clarify and transfer my own learning from this relationship?

In the contracting phase, the primary client and the facilitator are jointly responsible for identifying a presenting problem, a way to get started, and mutual responsibilities. There is never a guarantee that consulting or facilitation services will successfully lead to school improvement. However, the odds for success are enhanced when the principal and the teacher-leader form a trusting, candid, and shared-responsibility partnership. In effective projects, the individuals in these two roles develop clarity about the following.

**Relationship:**
- Determine mutual expectations.
- Develop and maintain trust.
- Establish mutual learning goals.
- Identify the primary and ultimate clients.

**Goals:**
- Distinguish the presenting from the underlying problem.
- Determine the desired state.
- Determine specific facilitation goals, plans, working procedures, and assessment designs.
- Incorporate tests for environmental impact.
- Understand the system in which the facilitation is to occur.
- Who will be involved in defining the problem and the desired state?
- How will you know when the project is successful?

**Data:**
- What data is relevant?
- What data gathering and reporting mechanisms will be used?
- What perceptual filters do the stakeholders have?
- What values and principles will guide the decision making?
- What feedback loops will be established?
- Who will take responsibility for specific portions of this endeavor?

**Plan:**
- What projects will have to be set aside to accomplish this?
- Identify interventions.
- Develop a timeline.
- How will you know if revising goals or strategies is called for?
- How will you know if the improvement efforts should be extended, recycled, or ended?
- How will relationships and positive energy be monitored and maintained?
- Who will take responsibility for specific portions of this endeavor?

The client agreed to the arrangements but increasingly felt inadequate control over what was happening. 3. The client talks a more participative game about decision making than he or she is really comfortable with. Ask “Is this project something you really want to see happening? Are you fully satisfied with the way we have set things up? Do you feel you have enough control over how this project is going to proceed?” |
| Provide support. | Make genuine supportive statements about the client’s willingness to proceed. |

**Appendix K**  
**Polarity Management: Using Conflict as a Resource**  
*Carolyn McKanders*

Polarities are chronic, ongoing tensions that are inherent in individual and organizational systems. They are unavoidable and unsolvable, they have two or more right answers that are interdependent, and they must be managed with both-and thinking.

Examples of polarities are the following:
- Individual rubrics and schoolwide rubrics
- Tight and loose structures
- Autonomy and collaboration
- Team and individual
- Home and work

Polarity Management™ is a model that involves a set of principles and tools for dealing with all polarities in life.

Betty Achinstein (2002), writing about conflict among school teachers, notes that collaboration and consensus—critical elements in building community—actually generate conflict. She found that by airing diverse perspectives in a collective setting and encouraging teachers to debate what and how to do schooling, schools generate new conflicts because of their commitment to creating collaborative communities.

In what ways might conflict represent a polarity?
Conflict is a manifestation of interdependence, and tensions between independence and interdependence are ever present. This inherent tension can be a source of productive energy for groups, or it can lead to unproductive interactions and create an energy drain. Groups that use tension productively distinguish between affective and cognitive conflict.

Affective conflict is personalized conflict and is detrimental to group energy and productivity. Cognitive conflict is conflict over ideas and approaches, and it is a hallmark of high-performing groups. Groups that engage in cognitive conflict critically examine ideas to sort out the best practices for student learning. Thus conflict becomes a resource (Amason, Thompson, Hochwarter, & Harrison, 1995).

Achinstein (2002) quotes John Gardner’s explanation of conflict, diversity, and community. Gardner states that diversity is not good simply because it implies breadth of tolerance and sympathy. A community of diverse elements has a greater capacity to adapt and renew itself in a swiftly changing world. To keep a balance between diversity and wholeness, communities must apply structures to reduce polarization, to foster communication among diverse groups, and to create mechanisms for conflict mediation.

Barry Johnson (1996) offers a set of principles, tools, and structures for identifying and utilizing the natural tensions that are created as individuals and organizations attempt to engage in cognitive conflict. These tensions often manifest as polarities: ongoing, chronic issues that are unavoidable and unsolvable. Johnson asserts that when groups can distinguish between a problem to solve and a polarity to manage and can effectively deal with both, they are able to celebrate and capitalize on diversity and convert resistance to change to a resource for sustainable strength and adaptivity.

Leaders, teams, and organizations must ask this fundamental question when they are faced with a challenge: Is this a problem to

solve, or is it an ongoing polarity that we must manage well? Problems to solve are those that have one right answer or two or more right answers that are independent. For example: “How do you spell?” or “What should we include in our parent survey?”

In contrast, polarities to be managed are sets of opposites that can’t function well independently; they require both-and thinking. Because the two sides of a polarity are interdependent, you cannot choose one as a solution and neglect the other. The objective of managing polarities is to get the best of both opposites while avoiding the limits or downside of each. Johnson (1996) uses breathing as a metaphor for all polarities. You cannot solve the inhale-exhale polarity by choosing to either inhale or exhale. You manage it by getting the benefits of each while appreciating the limits of each. It’s not a static situation. It’s a process, an ongoing flow of shifting emphasis from one to the other and back again. Managing this polarity requires choosing both inhaling and exhaling.

Some examples of polarities to manage are work and home, individual and team, stability and change, independence and interdependence, and planning and action.

A central premise of the adaptive school work is that leaders must recognize that schools are living paradoxes (i.e., polarities), operating simultaneously as “thing” and “energy” models—dynamic systems of energy and information.

The principles and tools of Polarity Management TM support collaborative communities in accessing the richness of capitalizing on diversity and engaging cognitive conflict to liberate group energy and productivity.

**The Polarity Map**

The polarity map is a tool for mapping paradoxes or dilemmas, which we refer to as polarities. The map provides a structure for making invisible tensions visible and for addressing the whole polarity picture. Once the map is completed through collaborative conversation, it provides a focus for dialogue from diverse perspectives.

The polarity map is a square divided into four quadrants. The right and left halves are called poles. The upper part of each pole contains the positive results of focusing on that pole, referred to as its upside. The lower part of each pole contains the negative results of focusing on that pole to the neglect of the other pole and is called the downside. Creating and discovering the content of all four quadrants is essential for maximum effectiveness in managing a polarity.

**Guidelines for Creating a Polarity Map**

Define the challenge. Identify an ongoing, chronic issue (a) within your sphere of influence (b) that has eluded problem-solving and (c) that has to be addressed in the next 2 months.

Identify a key polarity. A polarity differs from a problem in the following ways: (a) The issue continues over time, (b) there are two interdependent alternatives, (c) you need to have the positive aspects of each of the alternatives, and (d) developing one alternative to the neglect of the other will eventually undermine your productivity. Ask the following probing questions:

1. In what ways do you continue to experience this issue over time?
2. In what ways are there two alternatives that are interdependent? This means that you can focus on only one pole for so long before you are required to focus on the other pole.
3. What is the necessity of having the upsides of both poles over time?
4. To what extent will focusing on one upside to the neglect of the other eventually undermine your productivity?

Explore the issues, opportunities, and polarities. Facilitate a conversation that is designed to create an objective description of the issues,

opportunities, and polarities that are present. The skills of dialogue (chapter 5) and the norms of collaboration (chapter 4) are essential to this goal. Presume that all ideas are respected and important. Paraphrasing (chapter 4) is a primary tool in these conversations.

Well-crafted paraphrases communicate I am trying to understand you, and therefore I value what you have to say” and establish a relation- ship between people and ideas.

Here is an example. A high school leadership team that was conversing about staff resistance to interdepartmental collaboration concluded that there were merits to some staff members’ advocacy of autonomy. During this conversation the facilitator offered the following paraphrases:

- “Sam, you believe the complaints we’re getting are data worth examining.”
- “A value that we all hold is that all departments working together will produce better results for all students.”
- “On the one hand, we want teaming, and on the other hand, we see the necessity for individual action.”
- “It sounds as if we want to honor autonomy in two ways, individuals and departments.”

The facilitator provided a “abstracting paraphrase” (chapter 4) to paraphrase the polarity: “Let me see if I can sum this up. We’re wondering how we might collaborate while also honoring individual autonomy.”

In this example the high school leadership team decided to create a collaboration-autonomy polarity map. Later they repeated this mapping process with the staff.

Agree on names for the poles. The names should be value-neutral and be agreed on by the group.

Write the pole names on the map. The polarity map is created on chart paper so that group members can see the map as it unfolds.

Brainstorm the content for each quadrant. Aim to write four to eight entries in each quad-

rant. Collect all ideas from the participants without judgment, criticism, or questions. Identify both upsides, asking, “What are some positives results or upsides of focusing on?” Then identify both downsides, asking, “What are the negatives of focusing on to the neglect of the other pole?” This order can be modified to meet individual and group needs. For example, a group that values stability over change might need to brainstorm the upside of stability and the downside of change before being ready to move to mapping the upside of change. Oppositional values and fears should be identified and respected as important.

Agree on a higher purpose and a deeper fear. Agreeing on a higher purpose and a deeper fear integrates oppositional views and provides a reason to manage the tension between them. The higher purpose is the major benefit of managing the polarity well, and the deeper fear is the major negative result of not managing the polarity well. Again, use dialogue and the norms of collaboration.

The “abstracting paraphrase” is invaluable for integrating seemingly competing values and views, elevating conversations to a common higher purpose. For example, a middle school staff dialogue about student discipline became quite emotional, with members giving example after example of student misbehavior. Some staff members insisted that more suspensions and rules were necessary; others challenged this idea, stating that the students would just become resentful, passive-aggressive, and less willing to behave. They argued that their role was to support students in learning life skills for controlling themselves.

The chairman of the committee, who was acting as the facilitator, offered a “abstracting paraphrase”: “Some of us feel strongly about tightening the rules to get order, whereas some believe that students might need to be taught how to use their freedom to self-regulate. It is apparent that a goal we all hold is how to support the students in exhibiting more productive behavior.”

After additional conversation, the group agreed to map the structure-freedom polarity, coming to the conclusion that both were necessary to encourage students’ productive behavior.

Dialogue about the completed polarity map and explore ways to maximize the upside of each pole and minimize the downside of each pole.

**Understanding How Polarities Work**

A polarity map appears as a static set of ideas in four labeled quadrants: positives and values in the upside of each pole, and negatives and concerns in the downside of each pole. In fact, there is a predictable movement through a polarity situation, and we can envision it with the polarity map. As polarities work, we can predict people’s movement from one pole to the other as they (a) anticipate or experience the downside of one pole, from which they want to move away, and (b) are attracted to the upsides of the opposite pole, which they want to move toward. The downside of the pole they want to leave often becomes identified as the problem.

The upside of the opposite pole becomes identified as the solution. However, for a polarity to be well managed, one must remain in the upside of both poles while avoiding the limitations of the downsides of both poles. The natural energy flow of a well-managed polarity is an infinity loop, with only a slight dip into the lower quadrants.

**Facilitating Polarity Mapping**

Facilitation provides the focusing, directing, and organizing features that are necessary for adult conversations to produce results for students. Facilitators manage group energy through attention to three areas: (a) helping members in active participation, and (c) focusing group attention.

### Content Description

The page discusses strategies for facilitating conversations around polarities and diverse viewpoints, emphasizing the importance of cognitive conflict and psychological safety for productive dialogue. It provides principles and strategies for facilitators, including:

#### Principles and Strategies:
- **Grounding:** An inclusion activity for respectful listening and bringing everyone’s voice to the room. It encourages connection, expression of hopes and apprehensions, thinking and feeling, and surfacing hidden agendas.
- **Greeting Circle:** A grounding activity where each person greets and is greeted by another, releasing productive energy by confronting the natural tension of greeting others.
- **Address One Topic at a Time:** Emphasizes the importance of focusing on one topic or polarity at a time to avoid confusion and honor both ideas and contributors.

It also mentions that group processes are essential for collective thinking, brainstorming, clarifying, analyzing, and evaluating, and that facilitators should ensure all group members understand the process.

### Section: Facilitating Conversation About a Completed Polarity Map

This section explains that after mapping a polarity, a facilitated conversation helps group members explore the dilemma from multiple perspectives and generate strategies for staying in the upsides of both poles while avoiding downsides. Inquiry is encouraged to support resourcefulness and success.

#### Sample Questions Provided:
- As you reflect on our collective wisdom, what new learning and insights are emerging for you?
- Given our expanded perspective, what might be some benefits for managing this polarity well?
- What might be some higher purposes that will benefit all of our students?
- What might be some of our deepest fears if we fail to manage this polarity well?
- As we reflect on phrases in each quadrant, what might be some assumptions, values, or beliefs that are present?
- Given our desire to stay in the upsides of both poles, what are some strategies?
- What are some indicators that will tell us we are moving to the downside of a pole? Who will remind us, and how?
- What seems most important to all of us here?
- What might be some impacts of collaboratively mapping a polarity?
- What are your hunches about other polarities that might exist in this situation?
- How might we apply this to other areas of our work?

---

**Tips for Using Polarity Maps**
- Remember that to pursue the benefits of one pole, you must also pursue the benefits of the other pole. The solution is not static.
- One possibility is to identify the indicators for each pole, which will let you know when you are experiencing its downside.

Putting feedback mechanisms in place aids in managing the polarity. (Example: Using conversation maps and tools)
- Listen deeply and facilitate dialogue, especially with naysayers.
- Brainstorm strategies for staying in the upsides of both poles.
