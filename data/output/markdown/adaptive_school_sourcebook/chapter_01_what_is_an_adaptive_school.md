## Chapter 1 What is an Adaptive School?

A n adaptive school is neither a place, nor a program, neither a leader nor a structure. Rather, it is the application of two lenses, one for 'things' and one for 'energy' to examine learning and the organic systems in which it thrives. Central to these lenses is a dual focus held by leaders-leaders not just in the traditional sense of assigned authority, but including those passionate enough to step forward and lead from any role when conditions favor such emergence. These dual  perspectives  might  be  found  in  a  grade-level  group,  a  department,  a  cross disciplinary team, a school, or an entire district. The lens for 'thing' focuses on the basic stuff of good management. 'Thing' ways of seeing and working get the details handled, the bills paid, and the buses running on time and making the right stops in the right neighborhoods. 'Thing' thinking is the historical foundation of management systems in modern organizations.

The second leadership perspective focuses on energy. Margaret Wheatley (1992) observed that the quality of human relationships creates the  energy  that  produces  work.  This  interdependence,  noted  by  Wheatley,  studied  by Louis, Marks, and S. Kruse (1996) and examined  in  high  performing  groups  by  Woolley and  colleagues  (2010)  is  an  essential  energy for  school  success.  Other  important  energies are the energies of commitment, will, efficacy, craftsmanship, consciousness, and others. With the  additional  lenses  explored  in  this  book, leaders  in  all  roles  can  identify,  enhance,  and concentrate  these  energies  on  the  moral  mission of schools.

The  revolution  in  physics  called  quantum mechanics clarifies the essential distinctions  between  matter  and  energy  and  simultaneously  blurs  the  line  between  them.  The very term quantum mechanics means bundles of  energy  (quantum)  in  motion  (mechanics) (Capra,  1991).  This  book  describes  ways  to shape this energy through the liberating structures  of  collaborative  norms,  well-organized meetings, new frames for conflict, and communication  practices  that  make  a  difference for student learning.

As  Richard  Elmore  (1995)  reminds  us, the  real  work  of  changing  schools  lies  not in  changing  things,  but  in  changing  norms, knowledge, and skills (energy) at the individual  and  organizational  levels.  In  fact,  without new  norms,  knowledge,  and  skills,  structural changes  such  as  block  scheduling,  site-based decision-making, multiage classrooms, and inclusive classrooms will have little or no effect on student learning.

In  adaptive  organizations,  leaders  pay  attention  to  both  things  and  energy  and  to  the flow  and  interchange  of  energy  and  information. Energy becomes an avenue to attainment. We will expand on this idea in chapter 3 with descriptions of four leadership roles, in chapter 8 with an elaboration on the role of facilitator,

and  in  chapter  10,  in  which  we  will  describe five invisible sources of high performance.

## Adaptive, Not Adapted

Evolutionary  biology  is  the  source  for  a central  notion  in  our  work:  adaptivity.  To  be adaptive means to change form in concert with clarifying identity. This is quite different from being adapted ,  which  means  to  have  evolved through specialization to fit specific conditions within tightly defined boundaries.

Monarch butterflies are a good example of an adapted species. As we write this, the monarch has been added to the endangered species list. Across North America, the summer fields sparkle  with  their  flight.  Monarchs,  as  most schoolchildren  learn,  lay  their  eggs  only  on milkweed plants. When the larvae hatch, they feed on the milkweed leaves, growing and developing until it is time to spin a chrysalis that is attached to the milkweed plant. The larvae metamorphose  into  adult  butterflies,  and  the cycle repeats. Without milkweed there would be  no  monarchs.  The  monarch's  nutritional and  habitat  needs  are  firmly  adapted  to  this one type of plant.

An example of adaptivity within a species can  be  found  on  another  continent. As  primatologists  study  the  social  lives  of  chimpanzee groups,  they  discover  a  remarkable  range  of behaviors within individuals and within populations that are isolated from one another. They are now using the term culture to describe variations in food-gathering techniques that include prepositioning hammer stones for cracking nuts in anticipation of ripening, using grass stalks as tools to fish termites from holes, and sharpening sticks  to  use  as  thrusting  spears  when  hunting small monkeys. These cultural variations spread through local populations and to the next generation but remain unique to a given region.

Organizations,  like  species,  also  need  to contend  with  adapting  to  changing  environments. This usually means letting go of existing forms and continually clarifying the core iden- tity of the enterprise. As we write this volume, the United States Post Office is struggling for relevancy. Years of deficit budgets have coincided  with  changes  in  the  ways  people  communicate. E-mails, texts, Twitter, Skype calls, and  other  digital  innovations  have  eroded  the Post Office's dominance in the communication field.  Today,  they  are  reasserting  their  place in the economy with a change in form, and in identity. 'Our former identity,' an official told us,  'was connecting  people .  You  write  your grandmother a letter.  In  a  couple  of  days  she gets it. Today people have all these other ways of connecting. So our emerging identity is connecting goods .  We are cheaper than FedEx or UPS and are the delivery service for Amazon.' The Post Office is changing its form, eliminating a fleet of planes, handling more packages than letters,  with  big-brother  data  everywhere clocking the time people spend in line, and how long it takes a driver to get out of the truck at a stop. 'FedEx drivers,' he told us, 'are disciplined if they spend too much time backing up' because studies show backing is less efficient than moving forward.

One  of  the  most  significant  changes  in form and identity in schools has been the relatively recent transformation of the role of the school librarian. This was first brought to our attention  several  years  ago  at  a  seminar  we were  conducting,  when  a  participant  stopped by  at  a  break  to  share  her  struggles  with  this issue. As the head librarian for a medium-sized school district, she described all of the professional changes she had experienced since completing her master's degree in library science in the early 1970s. As a supervisor, she supported several  librarians  who  were  also  struggling with similar changes. She noted that as librarians they were taught to be quality filters and to stock the shelves with reliable and authoritative reference materials. When students and teachers asked for resources, the librarians were able to  supply  the  best  sources  available  and  took professional pride in knowing and having these materials on hand.

As students and teachers became increasingly  computer  savvy,  the  librarians  began feeling  devalued.  The  budget  for  reference materials  switched  to  online  resources,  and the  librarians  became  concerned  about  the quality  of  the  information  that  students  and teachers  access  through  Google  and  Wikipedia, and  other  searchable  sources.  Being  a quality filter was a role that gave the librarians pride in their work. They have found that they now have to be teachers of  quality  filtering. The deep transition is therefore not a change in the knowledge base of librarians, but in the ways that they apply their knowledge within their new identities.

All around us we see examples like this. As Internet-based courses for students become common, what it means to be a teacher and to have  a  class  will  dramatically  shift.  What  it means to be a student is changing. The very concept of the schoolhouse may increasingly be  seen  as  a  historical  artifact  rather  than  a current reality.

Voice-recognition software, coupled with high  bandwidth,  cheap  digital  storage,  and artificial  intelligence,  will  most  likely  dramatically change the teaching of foreign languages. It is not hard to imagine digital environments  in  which  students  or  their  avatars interact with native speakers of the language they are learning. The scenes will come com- plete  with  full  cultural  settings,  appropriate body language and nonverbal messages, and an  oscilloscope-like  readout  displaying  the voice  inflections  of  the  native  speaker  compared  to  the  voice  inflections  of  the  novice learner.  Conversations  can  be  repeated  with this  patient  tutor  until  they  are  fully  mastered.  In  such  an  environment  the  form  of specialty teacher of one language is replaced by the identity of master of second-language learning. This identity is accompanied by the elements  of  designer,  motivator,  manager, and clinician. The number of languages to be taught is limited not by personnel, but by the availability of software and hardware.

Table 1.1 sums up the relationship between form and identity in several examples.

The great challenge for schools is to let go of the comforts and routines of adapted behaviors  and  to  develop  the  patterns  and  practices of adaptivity. The demographic, technological, economic, environmental, social, and political pressures  driving  our  rapidly  changing  world make this necessary. This is especially true in climates  in  which  the  metaphorical  milkweed might  not  live  forever. Adaptivity  consists  of informed inquiry leading to flexible responses interacting with changing environmental conditions. This is true for individuals, species, and organizations. It requires a clear identity and a lack of attachment to form.

## Why Adaptivity Matters to Schools

To address this question we must first address the differences between technical change (fixing  an  ordinary  problem  without  altering the system)  and  adaptive  change  (fixing  a problem by disrupting the system), for in truth, adaptivity matters when one's goal is sustainable  change.  Educational  literature  is  replete with dramatic stories of change; a heroic principal turns around an underperforming school, a  superintendent  promotes  reforms  that  raise the test scores in a middle-class district, a special  ed  director  causes  improvements  in  math scores for students whose teachers she directs. Inevitably, these dramatic accounts of progress realized  by  treating  adaptive  challenges  as technical ones reverse course, and gains made during  a  brief  period  of  charismatic  attention return to a status quo.

Sustainable change is, of course, an oxymoron  unless  it  is  understood  that  healthy change  efforts  include  a  period  of  refinement and  revision  as  educators  seek  to  bring  the changes  into  alignment  with  best  possible benefits  for  students.  Mutation  monitoring  is a process in which leaders monitor application practices  that  differ  from  the  adopted  innovation,  eliminate  those  that  interfere  with  program fidelity, and expand on those that provide better mechanisms to achieve program goals.

Sustainable  change  is  driven  by  moral clarity, only possible with adaptive approaches, and only realized when identity is clear. CVS Pharmacy is changing its name to CVS Health as  it  shifts  its  emphasis  to  promote  health  in line  with  its  emerging  identity.  It  is  banning cigarette sales from its stores and, as reported by  Hakim  at  the New York  Times (2015),  recently  resigning  from  the  U.S.  Chamber  of Commerce because of that institution's position against antismoking laws.

## Using Fresh Lenses and New Skills

Technical  challenges,  differ  from  adaptive ones  in  that  the  problems  are  easy  to  identify, may lead to quick and easy solutions, can sometimes be solved by edict, and rarely address the root causes of problems. Adaptive change, however, requires a systems view, asks for changes in  values,  is  difficult  to  identify,  easy  to  deny, requires  altering  numerous  arenas  within  the organization, needs people with the problem to resolve  it,  and  requires  experimental  thinking. In the medical field, if high blood pressure is the problem,  taking  blood  pressure  medicine  is  an example of technical change while moving to a healthier lifestyle would be a more adaptive approach. Managing schools calls for both kinds of change.  Examples  of  problems  requiring  technical change are altering bus routings to reduce time students are  in  transit,  improving  the  win record of a high school sports team, or changing the start times of school even with the resulting challenges  this  brings  to  other  aspects  of  the program such as student schedules, after-school work opportunities, and athletic practices. Sending a person to the moon and performing openheart  surgery  are  often  offered  as  examples  of complicated problems needing technical change and linear reasoning.

In contrast adaptive changes require nonlinear  thought,  attention  to  an  ever-changing environment,  ownership  of  the  problem  by the  people  closest  to  it,  fearless  inquiry,  and addressing  values  conflicts.  In  schools,  improving  the  reading  performance  of  primary students, achieving a student body committed to  inquiry,  or  eliminating  bullying  requires adaptive change.

The same problem can be viewed from either lens. One school confronting the challenge of  receiving  a  passing  mark  on  a  tenth-grade state  literacy  test  focused  its  remedial  efforts

## The Peripatetic Pivot Point

Successful  sea  captains  must  apply  adaptive  competence,  explains  P.  F.  Willteron  in Basic Ship Handling for Master, Mates and Pilots (1980). There is no formula for ship handling, but an array of forces that must be monitored lest the captain be caught off guard. Tide, displacement, wind, and current can all cause a ship to pivot, and the captain must be able to anticipate these forces and tap into learning from past experience in order to skillfully move the vessel forward.

The tricky thing about the pivot point is that the location of the pivot point changes from moment to moment because the location of the pivot point of a boat that is underway depends on how or even whether the boat is already moving relative to the water that it is in contact with at that moment .

Added to the complexity of ship handling is the reality that ships do not have brakes. An anchor helps when a ship is moving slowly, but a ship can still move forward even with its anchor dropped. This increases the importance of monitoring forces, as well as how forces interact with one another. For example, given that part of the vessel is underwater, if the current is moving faster than the wind, the water will exert more force than the air. This knowledge of which forces are exerting the most impact informs the captain's decision-making regarding steering and adjustments.

Schools are much like ships, requiring monitoring forces rather than following a formula. Anchorage District principal Deanna Beck (Lt. Commander, U.S. Coast Guard Reserve) told us how she prioritizes forces as a leader. 'It depends on your speed,' she replied. If you're going fast you'll have to pay attention to what will have the biggest impact on your vessel and what else is going on in the environment. When coming into San Francisco Bay, for example, she first makes note of anything nearby such as trees or buildings, then figures out how fast she's going. With that collective information she can determine whether the wind or water is having more force, and how to adapt accordingly (Beck, 2015; Whiteley, 2015).

on  boosting  the  achievement  of  students  who were falling just below a failing grade. Another school  facing  the  same  situation  concentrated its efforts on improving literacy for all students for  the  long  run. Teachers worked together to improve their practices and engaged the community with a full month emphasis on literacy skills. In the second school, results for the first year were not dramatic, but by the third year the school had become the district's second-highest scoring school (Hargreaves and Fink, 2004). In the first example, the school treated an adaptive challenge as a technical one and got quick but nonsustainable change.

One  emerging,  messy  issue  for  schools that  requires  adaptive  change  is  that  a  sustained emphasis on information and communication  technologies  has  significantly  influenced  students  and  their  school  experience. At a restaurant the other night we watched a three-year-old  competently  manage  an  iPod. Ian  Jukes  (2006)  notes  that  kids'  brains  are being  changed  because  of  intense  sustained experience (seven days a week, several hours a  day)  with  the  digital  world.  Some  observe that the average working memory space might be  less  today  than  when  we  were  students. How many phone numbers do you know other

## Schools Are Complex Systems

Table 1.3. Schools Are Complex Systems.

## From Different Disciplines Come These Synonyms

Nonlinear

Complex

Dynamical

Beyond the issues of sustainability, and a rapidly changing environment, another reason adaptivity is important is that schools are complex  systems,  and,  while  it  is  not  possible  to change such systems,  it  is  possible  to  disturb them. A complex system is one in which tiny events cause major disturbances (the butterfly effect  in meteorology  or  the  paraphrase  in social  systems);  everything  affects  everything else (on days when David is absent, everything goes better in class); you don't have to touch everyone  to  make  a  difference  (six  teachers changed the work culture of an entire school by being publicly polite in public places); and both things and energy matter (while things like new books are important, more important are effort, caring, and commitment).

Complicated  systems,  on  the  other  hand, lack the interactive characteristics of complex ones  and  can  be  changed  through  edict  and linear  logic.  Performing  brain  surgery  is  an example of working in a complicated system.

Managing  a  marriage  represents  a  complex system challenge (Cuban, 2010; Garmston and Wellman, 2013).

Schools  are  nonlinear  systems  in  which cause and effect are not tightly linked. In nonlinear systems, the parts do not add up to the same sum each time they are combined. Fresh combinations result in different outcomes. For teachers,  the  curriculum  combines  with  instructional and assessment practices to support student  learning.  Yet  every  school  year  turns out  differently  as  the  pedagogical  mix  blends with a new crop of students.

A  blend  of  regularity  and  irregularity shapes nonlinear systems, producing patterns of stability and  instability. Critical choice points present new  possibilities and  new forms  of  order.  Instability  permits  creative life  in  school  systems.  The  self-organizing interactions between people develop feedback loops that recur and amplify across the scale of the organization. Changes in such systems may be unexpected.

Self-organization develops through meaningful  adult  interactions  about  students,  student work, and the purposes and processes of schooling. To be productive, such interactions must  be  infused  with  and  guided  by  shared values  and  norms  of  collaboration.  The  environment  must  encourage  reflection,  inquiry, challenge,  and  deprivatization  of  practice  for both teachers and administrators. This in turn requires  skills  in  dialogue,  discussion,  planning, and problem solving. At times the work

is messy and nonrational. Habitual, linear ways of thinking will work for some issues but not for the increasingly complex and ill-structured problems that beset many schools today.

## Principles of Complex or Dynamical System Change

In  the  early  1950s  a  trucking  magnate named  Malcolm  McLean  and  his  colleagues began  the  process  that  produced  the  shipping-container  industry  that  we  know  today, revolutionizing  costs  as  cargo  handling  at  either  end  of  the  voyage  produced  as  much as  50  percent  of  the  costs  of  moving  goods (Levinson, 2006). McLean was not limited by the identity of being a trucker. He realized that he was in the moving goods business and that trucks, trains, and ships could work in harmony to  move  material  if  that  material  was  placed in  uniform-sized  containers  and  a  supporting infrastructure  facilitated  the  rapid  deployment of these containers across the globe.

His  innovations  rapidly  reduced  the  costs of moving goods and negated the need to have sources of production and storage close to ports. The waterfronts of the world swiftly shed manufacturing industries, and warehouses were transformed into high-status housing and recreation areas in many locales. In 1964 the five boroughs of New York City were home to manufacturing concerns that employed nearly 900,000 workers. By the mid-1970s more than one-third of those jobs were gone. Cheap transportation motivated the search for cheaper labor and lower manufacturing costs. Distance was no longer an obstacle to commerce. This example illuminates five underlying principles, described below, that guide adaptive systems such as the shipping industry, weather systems, and schools.

- 1. More  data  do  not  lead  to  better  predictions . Malcom  McLean  did  not  need  to know all  the  economic  data  points  about the industries that were his customers. He merely  needed  sufficient  data  about  his own business and the appropriate metrics
- to guide his business plans. Meteorologists have  more  data  than  at  any  time  in  history, yet their radars and computer models lose meaning beyond a four-day window. Many schools we work with are data-rich and  meaning-poor.  They  collect  endless surveys  and  pore  over  spreadsheets  but don't take the time to dialogue and make meaning  from  their  experiences  and  the knowledge they have within them.
- 2. Everything influences everything else . The rise  of  the  shipping  container  made  the economic boom possible both in Asia and for  Wal-Mart  and  other  big-box  discount stores.  These  forces  have  fueled  growing prosperity as well as environmental damage across the globe. In weather systems, temperature changes affect wind patterns, which affect precipitation patterns, which in turn influence climate changes, including  droughts  and  floods.  In  schools,  the affective climate of the building and classrooms  influence  how  adults  feel  about their work, the energy they invest, and the academic results for students.
- 3. Tiny  events  create  major  disturbances. Putting  a  stack  of  boxes  in  and  on  ships is  in  many  ways  a  tiny  event.  Yet  this simple revolution has changed economies throughout the world, changed labor relations by making loading ships highly technical  skilled  work,  and  changed  the  balance of power as emerging countries flex their  new  financial  and  political  muscles. As tropical storms develop off the coast of the African continent and swing across the Atlantic Ocean and into the Caribbean Sea, encountering water that is as little as onefourth degree warmer tips the storm into a raging hurricane. In collaborative groups, a  participant  who  is  skilled  in  paraphrasing  and  inquiry  opens  up  the  thinking  of others and deepens the meaning that these conversations produce.
- 4. You don't have to touch everyone in the system to make a difference . Malcom Mclean

didn't have to run around the globe and get all  the  policymakers and decision makers in  place  and  on  board  before  starting  his venture.  He  designed  some  sturdy  boxes, converted some old tanker ships, and built some  special  cranes  at  the  sending  and receiving  ports.  The  rest  of  the  system responded over time to these innovations. Weather systems affect behaviors by their mere  presence.  Whether  these  systems are hot or cold, wet or dry, environments and organisms respond to these influences without the right to vote. In the same way, a  school  culture  shapes  the  behavior  of its  members. That is why school cultures are  so  tenacious  in  the  face  of  personnel changes. The real work of school improvement, then, is the work of 'reculturing' by shaping the norms, beliefs, and values of those cultures. We've consulted with several international schools on this for whom this is a special challenge.

- 5. Both  things  and  energy  matter . Ships, boxes,  cranes,  trucks,  and  trains  are  all things.  They  have  to  work  together  in  a timely  fashion  to  move  the  goods  that move  the  economy.  They  also  represent the energy of commerce-the innovating, buying, selling, and improving of products that  engage  human  minds  and  imaginations. Wind, sun, and rain are all tangible phenomena, but it is the energy they contain  and  transmit  that  moves  windmills, sprouts  plants,  and  produces  waterfalls. Schools require books and bells, halls and balls,  but  again  it  is  the  energy  of  caring and  commitment  that  moves  minds  and produces learning.

## How Schools Become Adaptive

So far we have discussed the importance of adaptivity and the need to clarify identity, both as  individuals  and  as  organizations,  without clinging to outmoded forms. We've suggested a rationale for why this is important by framing schools as nonlinear, complex, dynamical systems in which cause-and-effect linkages are not so easily drawn. We will now briefly describe how schools can achieve this. The chapters that follow  will  expand,  elaborate  on,  and  share many of the concrete tools we have learned to use from our work with successful schools.

For readers that prefer to see the big picture, figure 1.1 gives an overview of concepts that follow in this book.

## A Short Course in Adaptivity: Focusing Questions

We  encourage  departments,  committees, councils, and faculties to reflect frequently on three focusing questions: (a) Who are we? (b) Why are we doing this? and (c) Why are we doing this this way? The byproduct of this reflection is action for improving student learning.

## Who Are We?

Principal Kathy Dunton of Vine Hills Elementary School in California told us that these three  questions  transformed  her  school.  She encourages  teachers  and  parents  to  ask  them frequently  and  to  explore  them  in  depth.  The question  'Who  are  we?'  leads  directly  to  the issue  of  identity.  This  issue  forces  the  related questions  of  'About  what  do  we  care?'  and 'How much do we dare?' The form taken by a school, team, department, or teacher's assignment  is  less  important  than  identity.  Identity represents  the  story  that  a  group  tells  itself to  organize  its  values  and  beliefs.  A  group's beliefs determine its behavior. Collectively, its behavior affects student learning (Dilts, 1994). (See chapter 10.)

Identity  cannot  be  found  in  a  mission statement. It displays itself in hallways, faculty lounges,  meeting  minutes,  and  student  academic results. Identity reveals itself in periods of  stress:  What  a  group  strives  to  preserve  or fights to protect describes its identity. The very definitions of success, the awards and rewards

for both students and staff members, symbolize driving values and beliefs.

## Why Are We Doing This?

Folk  wisdom,  tradition,  and  unexamined habit  rule much  of  what  schools  do.  The agricultural  calendar,  factory  schedules,  and athletic practices  continue  to  frame  yearly and daily time use. Bus schedules and teacher contracts exert powerful and often unexamined influences  on  student  learning.  Yet  these  and other  features  of  school  life  go  unquestioned. 'It's  just  the  way  we  do  things  around  here,' one is told when bold enough to inquire.

A classic story captures the essence of this issue. A little girl, watching her mother prepare a ham for the oven, wanted to know why her mommy was cutting the end off before placing it in the roasting pan. 'I don't really know,' her mother  replied,  'That's  the  way  my  mommy did it.'

So  the  little  girl  went  to  see  her  grandmother and asked her why she cut the end of the ham off before putting it in the roasting pan. 'I don't really know,' her grandmother replied, 'That's the way my mommy did it.'

So the little girl went to see her great-grandmother and asked her why she cut the end of the ham off before putting it in the roasting pan. 'Well,'  the  old  woman  explained,  stretching her arms wide, 'I grew up on the prairie in a little  sod  house, and our hams were this big.' Bringing  her  hands  closer  together,  she  concluded,  'And  our  oven  was  this  big.  We  had to cut the end off the ham to fit it in the oven.'

In  many  settings,  educators  continue  to 'cut the end off the ham' long after the original rationale has passed. The deep structure of schooling is  set  on  foundations  of  'hams  and end  scraps'  from  earlier  eras.  Unquestioned assumptions  form  the  'ovens'  in  which  they 'cook.'  Many  current  practices  are  rooted  in beliefs  about  the  need  for  power  and  control over others and over resources (Sarason, 1990). Such beliefs were at the heart of the management  literature  during  most  of  the  1800s  and

1900s.  They  are  the  source  of  conflicts  over curriculum and at the center of most tensions around  any  form  of  shared  decision  making. The question 'Why are we doing this?' brings attention and choice to practices that have become unquestioned habits.

## Why Are We Doing This This Way?

The  'this'  that  we  are  doing  could  be grouping  students  for  instruction,  developing learning  experiences,  or  deciding  time  allotments for activities. This last question, valued so  highly  by  California  principal  Kathy  Dunton,  brings  focus  not  to  the what and why of the activity but to the how .  Walk through any school  with  a  notebook  in  hand,  because  this question will have you scribbling rapidly.

The  daily  schedule  is  a  good  starting point. Anyone who has observed the sleeping and  waking  patterns  of  adolescents  knows that  8:00  a.m.  is  not  peak  time  for  anything not conducted in a prone position, yet district schedules organized by transportation patterns typically have high schools starting around that hour.  On  the  other  hand,  many  five-  and  sixyear-olds are up and bustling, ready to get on with the new day. Schools might, in fact, have the daily time schedule for the various levels of schooling in reverse order from what would be a better fit with physical development patterns.

The question 'Why are we doing this this way?' could be restated, as 'Who benefits from the current system?' Exploring this form of the question  provides  insight  into  the  forces  that keep current practices in place. As Kathy Dunton found, these three focusing questions open up new ways of seeing school practices. Once revealed,  they  can  be  acted  on  and  modified. Left  unexamined,  they  keep  the  institutional drivers  on  autopilot  and  the  'map'  stuffed  in the 'glove compartment.'

## This Book Teaches New Songs

All  cultures  have  creation  stories  to  explain  the  coming  of  the  world  and  their  own

place in it. The Aboriginal people of Australia believe that their land is covered with a web of invisible pathways. These 'dreaming-tracks' or 'songlines' first appeared during the Tjukurpa (djook-oor-pah)  or  'Dreamtime,'  when  ancestral  beings  wandered  over  the  featureless landscape,  singing  the  world  into  existence. These totemic ancestors sang out the name of everything  that  crossed  their  path.  They  sang out the names of plants, animals, rocks, rivers, salt pans, and waterholes, coding and wrapping the world in a web of song (Chatwin, 1987).

When  an  Aboriginal  mother  is  pregnant and feels the baby kick for the first time, she calls the shaman to identify that child's totemic spirit  guide.  Physical  features  at  the  site  of the kick are then interpreted, and the spirit of the child-the  child's  'dreaming'-is  thus identified.  This  dreaming  can  be  one  of  any number of mammals, insects, birds, or reptiles. As the child grows, he or she learns the song of  this  spirit  guide.  Coded  into  the  song  are the  features  of  the  local  landscape-where  to find food, water, shelter, and safe travel routes. Song is the oldest mnemonic device, far easier for a nomad to carry than any road atlas.

An Aborigine  who  goes  'walkabout'  on a  journey  of  discovery  or  on  a  hunting  foray calls  on  this  song  to  guide  him  or  her. Along one's 'songline,' one has safe passage, meeting others who share the dreaming along the way. Memory carries the traveler to the limits of the song. At the boundaries Aborigines meet and, through ritual,  swap  songs. This  sharing  relationship extends the territory of each and binds one to another through song.

To find new territory and new routes, we all need to learn new songs. This earth and its workings are not as we were once taught. At the limits of our songs, we need one another so that we can be adaptive in a world made of bundles of energy in motion.
