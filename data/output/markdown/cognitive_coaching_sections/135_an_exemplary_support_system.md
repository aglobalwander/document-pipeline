## AN EXEMPLARY SUPPORT SYSTEM

Sometimes we are asked, 'When coaching, is it all right to give a suggestion? What if you sense the teacher's plan will not work? Should you tell him?'

Coaching, collaborating, and consulting each serves a valued purpose to the teacher, the institution, or both. Ideally, each takes place in transactions devoted to only one of these functions at a time. There are situations, however, that call for an occasional , skillful transition to another function. There are no simple rules to guide the coach, but there are some prerequisite conditions.

Of paramount importance is interpersonal trust and trust in the process. Next is a collegial relationship between the coach and the person being coached. Finally, the coach needs exquisite coaching skills; to consult, he/she also needs a rich knowledge base of the topics under consideration.

For one to successfully support teachers across each of these support functions, skill in conducting classroom observations is a necessary component. Being able to recognize, along a developmental continuum, classroom manifestations of whatever set of teaching standards the district has developed is essential. Also needed are skills at using a variety of datagathering instruments. Because an important goal in working, especially with new teachers, is to develop independence, not dependence, collaboration is used as a vehicle for developing the beginning teacher's professional independence as well as signaling working together as a value in successful schools.

For beginning teachers, teacher coaches are lifelines to survival.

Coaches communicate a reaffirming certainty that each beginning teacher is okay, has the capacity to survive and learn, and contributes value to students' education. Such consistently positive presuppositions are especially important during the early months, when beginning teachers encounter feelings of overwhelming self-doubt and inadequacy (Moir, Barron, and Stobbe 2001).

Seamlessness is achieved when many coaching practices are applied in either consulting or collaborating. For example, trust and rapport are fundamental to any helping relationship. Paraphrasing, with its profound influences on the chemistry of resourcefulness, is prominent in each of the support functions of collaborating, consulting, and coaching. In consulting, as in coaching, there is a need for data. Good practices in either function require clarity about what data to gather, how to collect it, and how it will be useful. Data may sometimes be reported within the consulting role without interpretation from the consultant, as is true in coaching (see chapter 3). During consulting, clarity is needed about the teacher's goals. A consultant, like a coach, will use open-ended questions and pause, paraphrase, and pose to elicit thinking. Given these common features, the question 'How do you know when to segue from coaching to consulting, and how do you do it?' is sometimes met with puzzlement.
