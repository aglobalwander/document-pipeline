## Chapter 7

## Time-Efficient Meetings

M eetings that are well-planned and executed-and the planning is prerequisite to the execution-promote one of the most valuable energy sources  for  groups,  and  the  one  most  consistently  related  to  school success: efficacy.

Agenda construction is, first of all, a way of  thinking.  There  is  simply  no  other  activity that can economize time and maximize success and  satisfaction  as  much  as  a  well-formed agenda. The  problem,  of  course,  is  that  it  requires time to develop one.

'Prepare  more  and  meet  less'  is  a  motto for  successful  groups  and  effective  leaders. By  making  a  personal  investment  in  agenda design, leaders reduce wasted time by tenfold and overall meeting time by as much as 30 percent. This in turn produces dramatic increases in productivity and group-member satisfaction.

When  leaders  value  agenda  design,  department  meetings  become  better  run,  ad  hoc committees function more smoothly, and task forces  and  advisory  groups  feel  better  about their  work  and  get  more  done.  Being  smart and  proactive  about  meeting  design  pays  off throughout the school and the district.

Smart leaders and facilitators value meeting  planning  in  the  same  way  that  high-performing  teachers  value  planning  for  instruction, because it influences the success of what follows.

Groups meet for many reasons in schools. Each  meeting  provides  opportunities  to  both manage the work of the group and the school and to increase the group's capacity to do richer and deeper work. Once again, both things and energy matter. Smart agendas help groups that meet  for  planning  and  problem  solving  get better  at  planning  and  problem  solving.  This happens  when  the  meeting  design  provides both task focus and opportunities to reflect on the process and personal and collective learning in these arenas. Smart agendas help groups that meet to explore and refine teaching strategies also learn how to learn as colleagues and professionals. Smart agendas help groups that meet to support the learning needs of individual students also learn ways to collaboratively learn  from  and  with  data  and  from  and  with one another.

## How to Use This Chapter

We will  describe  the  remarkable  benefits of  meeting  design  in  complex  nonlinear  systems, such as schools. Although protecting time to  design  meetings  produces  some  tensions, and  time-pressed  leaders  occasionally  have to work  extemporaneously,  the  majority  of meetings,  planned  well,  will  produce  benefits by the hundredfold. This chapter elaborates on ways  to  achieve  these  benefits.  You  will  find principles  of  agenda  construction,  samples  of agendas, and a template for delegating tasks to groups. Finally, we offer some general design and planning tips.

The sequence in which you will want this information depends on your prior information, personal  history,  present  needs,  and  urgency. If  you  have  an  immediate  need  for  agenda samples,  move  ahead  to  the  section  'Agenda Templates' or to the list of tips within it. If you want  a  rationale  with  which  to  persuade  others to invest in design work, go to the section

'Design Matters.' If you are interested in design principles that capacitate you to teach others and to develop effective agendas in any setting,  read 'The Principles of Design.' Should you want to delegate a problem to a group for its recommendations, go to the section 'Posing Problems for Groups to Work On.'

## Design Matters

Consider the time you spend in meetings. At  a  modest  two  hours  per  week,  you  are spending  more  than  three  thousand  hours  in meetings  throughout  the  life  of  your  career. If  you translate that to a team of twelve, then 4,500 eight-hour days are being spent in meetings. That's more than twelve years! All professions and industries tend to malign meetings as time wasters. This doesn't have to be so.

Poorly  organized  meetings  incur  abysmal costs.  Morale  suffers,  venting  and  other  counterproductive exchanges move to the building's parking  lot,  and  members  grow  less  and  less willing to invest their time in projects, committees, and teams. Frustration reigns in department meetings and ad hoc groups and insinuates its presence into school activities, including teaching.  Many of us have experienced this and yet know  that  it  does  not  have  to  be  so.  In  many settings, meetings  are  well-organized;  what emerges there are well-run meetings, optimisim, efficacy,  successful  results,  and  an  increasing willingness to particpate in collaborative work.

What's talked  about  matters.  One  district collected  and  analyzed  agendas  from  faculty meetings, school leadership teams, department meetings,  and  grade-level  groups.  From  60 percent  to  80  percent  of  the  meetings  were devoted  to  'administrivia'-scheduling,  announcements,  event  organization,  discipline, compliance  issues,  or  disputes-leaving  only a  small  percentage  of  time  for  the  discussion of  teaching  and  learning.  In  other  districts announcements  and  other  'administrivia'  are handled  through  other  forms  of  communication. The only reason an announcment or event details should appear on an agenda is if mem- bers need conversation in order to understand and uniformly apply it.

Agendas, too reveal the dynamical systems principle  that  both  things  and  energy  matter. When meeting topics are matters of substance and  the  conversations  are  well-organized,  the intangible  products  of  meetings  translate  to mindsets  and  behaviors.  These  must  not  be underestimated,  for  when  the  intangibles  are positive, they provide the energy for productive work.  Well-planned  and  executed  meetings promote collective efficacy, found to be a foundation for success even in low socioeconomic schools (Hoy et al., 2006).

## Principles of Design

Because principles are generalizations, not rules, they offer elasticity, which rules do not. We will explore five agenda-design principles: (a)  allocentrism,  planning  with  the  group  in mind;  (b)  relevance,  connecting  to  the  members  and  unit  goals;  (c)  information,  ensuring that groups have the information they need to do  their  task;  (d)  interaction,  keeping  minds and  voices  active;  and  (e)  congruence  with organizational values and beliefs.

## Allocentrism

Design with the users in mind. Put yourself  in  their  place.  Imagine  how you will feel entering  the  meeting. Are  there  special  needs that  require  attention? Will the group be tired or  distracted?  Are  the  participants  informed about the purpose of the session? What knowledge  do  they  bring  to  the  table  that  does  not have to be repeated? What would they need to know to  encourage  participation?  What  skills might have to be introduced or reinforced for them to do good work on the issues that will be  addressed?  Are  there  issues  of  mood  that might run counter to receptivity? What seating is going  to  be  comfortable,  psychologically and  physically?  When  attitude  or  low  energy is  an  issue,  design  an  opening that alters this. Consider using banned words, acknowledge re-

sistance or check-in or other inclusion activities found in appendix A to shift mood.

We once conducted a meeting in a kindergarten  room  that  was  not  going  well.  Finally, we  realized  the  discomfort  that  people  were feeling sitting in those itty-bitty chairs, so we corrected  the  seating  and  the  quality  of  the meeting improved. A simple matter of furniture placement can make an enormous difference in meeting success. We described practical models for room design and materials in chapter 6.

## Relevance

The principle of relevance concerns membership,  the  internal  fit  of  the  agenda  items, and the degree to which the agenda has some bearing on the larger contexts and goals within which the group works.

When an item is relevant to only part of the group, schedule it last and dismiss those who are  not  involved.  Nothing  is  more  frustrating and disrespectful of time than to make someone sit through agenda items that are irrelevant to  them. Selective dismissals honor the group members and become part of a norm of appreciating their energies and time.

To what degree do the agenda items relate to one another? Cluster those that relate. Organize others using transitions activities that are described  in  chapter  8.  Finally,  and  perhaps most important, what bearing does this meeting have on the larger contexts of the group's existence and work? Cognizance of this allows an opening  in  which  the  meeting  is  perceptually framed to help the participants make sense of the  work.  Groups  often  need  a  sense  of  their history to understand and embrace the work of a particular meeting.

## Information

Three questions guide agenda construction related to information. The first of these is deciding what information is needed for the group to do its work. As mentioned above, sometimes this information is history and context so that the  group  members  can  start  from  the  same place together. Groups might occasionally need policy information or research summaries on a topic in order to do informed work; the agenda planner can then provide for a paired reading activity  from  an  appropriate  journal.  Second, it  is  often  important  to  know  which  players outside the group, or which other groups, have say on the topic so that consciousness can be brought to the question of defining the 'sandbox,' one of the four structures for successful meetings described in chapter 6.

Third,  and  most  important,  groups  need to  know who they are in the decision-making process.  Are  they  to  inform,  recommend,  or decide? Third, if they are to inform or recommend, to whom are they relaying information and  what  are  the  next  steps  in  the  process? Display this information directly on the agenda next to the items.

## Interaction

Assuming  that  the  purpose  of  a  meeting is  for  members  to  think,  deliberate,  or  take action, interaction is essential. Any group that spends  the  majority  of  its  time  in  full-group mode is  keeping  its  brain  activity  surpressed, encouraging  lethargy,  and  reducing  meeting achievement  and  the  value  for  participants. Two essential questions must be addressed to plan  for  the  degrees  and  types  of  interaction. What tasks will be asked of the group: comprehending, exploring, informing, recommending, or deciding? What cognitive actitvities will be required:  generating,  categorizing,  analyzing, synthesizing, or extrapolating?

The thoughtful use of 'conversation containers' fosters success. These essentially provide  scaffolds  for  the  talk.  Skillful  designers consider  ways  to  start,  structure,  and  sustain thinking in their meetings.

Just  because  people  are  sitting  together does not mean that they are a group capable of working together. Recognize that groups do not arrive primed for work; they need to transition physically,  socially,  cognitively,  and  emotion-

ally  into  the  work  space  and  topic.  Wellman and Lipton (2004) refer to strategies that perfom this function as conversation starters .

Well-chosen activators are psychologically safe  conversation  starters  that  are  pertinent to  the  task.  Safety  is  important;  it  allows  the risk  of  stating  ideas  when  you  are  not  sure, disclosing  that  you  do  not  know,  disagreeing, or being able to talk and not be overridden by highly  verbal  participants.  Overcoming  this risk is at the heart of effective meeting participation. What happens early in a meeting sets the  tone  for  the  session.  By  encouraging  full participation  at  the  outset,  participants  then expect  to  contribute  throughout  the  session. When  group  leaders  talk  at  the  group  in  the opening minutes, participants become passive consumers of information with varying degrees of engagement. See inclusion activities in appendix A for ideas.

Protocols (both starters and structures) can be  designed  to  minimize  risk  and  maximize critical  thinking.  Avoid,  at  all  costs,  opening with  'feel  good'  activities  in  which  participants see no connection to their work.

Although  safety  is  necessary  to  access the neocortex and the members' best thinking, comfort  is  not  a  requirement  in  meetings.  In fact,  if  a  group  is  always  comfortable,  it  is probably talking about the wrong things.

## Structures

Structures  are  strategies,  or  protocols,  that shape and organize conversations, again providing  psychological  safety  and  maximizing  time efficiency. Almost any strategy can be designed as a protocol that sets rules or instructions for a conversation.  Many  are  listed  in  chapter  8,  related to facilitator tasks during different meeting stages; others can be found in appendix A.

We are using the terms strategy and protocol somewhat interchangeably. In diplomacy a  protocol  governs  who  greets  whom  first;  in technology it governs the rules for two pieces of  equipment to talk together. A meeting protocol provides a 'container' for conversations that defines what is to happen and how it will occur. In meetings, protocols have the following three functions:

- 1. Establish topics, time for the activity, who speaks, and the sequence of the speakers, if any.
- 2. Provide challenge and limit discomfort.
- 3. Designate the thinking skills to be used.

Without  a  structure,  conversations  can meander,  go  off  course,  and  take  valuable time  away  from  the  meeting  objectives.  The thoughtful  selection  of  strategies  supports  the efficient use  of  time  by  defining  the  total amount of time for a conversation and the time for each component. Protocols can also determine the type of thinking that is required, such as  separating  data  from  inference,  analyzing, evaluating, or developing theories.

Some  examples  of  structures are the paired-reading  activities  of  'Say  Something,' or  the  strategies  'Key  Concepts/Key  Ideas,' 'Assumptions  Wall,'  and  'Card  Stack  and Shuffle'  (appendix  A).  Brainstorming  is  a structure  because  it  specifies  the  thought  processes  to  use  and  the  order  in  which  to  use them, and because the facilitator is calling on people,  determining  who  speaks  when.  It  is our  view  that  the  steps  in  the  brainstorming protocols always have to be reviewed and that facilitators should intervene immediately when violations or mutations occur.

## Sustainers

Sustainers are strategies and tools that are used to maintain longer, focused conversations. How  people  talk  to  one  another  will  either sustain  or  dampen  communication. Sustainers are  verbal  and  nonverbal  tools  used  by  group members  to  enhance  their  ability  to  deliver psychologically  safe  thoughts  to  one  another even when they disagree. The seven norms of collaboration  described  in  chapter  4  serve  as the  starting  point  for  this  set  of  skills.  Learning  the  tools  for  inquiry  described  in  chapter 4  represents  an  ongoing  curriculum  for  many groups.  Group  size  is  an  important  sustainer.

Paired  activities  require  the  least  amount  of time,  compared  to  trios,  quartets,  or  sextets. Pairs are psychologically safer units than larger groups  are.  Trios  bring  the  valuable  tension of  three  sets  of  experiences.  It  is  also  harder in  a  trio  than  in  a  pair  to  leave  the  task  and enter social talk. Quartets are diverse yet small enough to be in the early stages of learning as they apply new communication skills. Quartets are an ideal size to dialogue about data posted before  them  on  the  wall.  Groups  of  six  are  a good  size  for  protocols  like  'First  Turn/Last Turn' or 'Grounding' (see appendix A) and for activities that synthesize findings.

Individual reflection is the safest size unit of  all.  Many  strategies  begin  with  private  reflection,  either  mentally  or  in  writing,  giving members  a  chance  to  gather  their  thoughts before participating in a group.

## Offer the What, Why, and How of Strategies and Structures

A  wise  facilitation  practice  is to offer the  what,  why,  and  how  of  any  strategy  and structure  you  are  about  to  use  with  a  group. Offering  the  'Why'  is  especially  important when  applying  new  meeting  tools  that  break pattern for the group. For example, using pairs and trios instead of operating as a committee of the whole may be disconcerting for some group members. In this case the facilitator might say: 'We're going to use a paired reading strategy so that you can engage with the text and with a partner to clarify your understanding and gain the  perspective  of  another  set  of  eyes.'  The 'Why' is a statement of purpose and intention. The why speaks to both the intention of a particular  strategy  or  structure  and  to  the  deeper group development outcomes for that group.

Keep in mind that these are principles, not rules,  and  that  the  strategies  named  here  are not  limited  to  the  group  size  suggested.  Sue Presler, a colleague and friend, while working with a full faculty in Hawaii, once took a step from  the  'Focusing  Four'  (see  appendix  A) and  used  it  with  the  full  group  to  have  them advocate  lunchroom  solutions  that  had  been generated  the  week  before.  We  never  would have considered doing that, yet after just a few people  talked,  it  became  clear  to  the  group which solution would serve best.

Degree  of  structure  is  another  sustainer. The planners decide when to select a tight or a loose protocol as a matter of scaffolding for success. A tight protocol is one in which members  have  little  choice  about  when  and  how to  participate  and  have  maximum  scaffolding for success.  Examples  are  'First  Turn/Last Turn,' 'In and Out of the Frame,' and 'Futures Wheel.' Designers will plan for tight protocols when  the  topic  is  complex  or  emotionally loaded or when the group does not have much experience working together effectively.

Loose  protocols  provide  less  scaffolding and leave more decisions in the hands of members.  Examples  are  'Paired  Verbal  Fluency,' 'Around  the  Room  and  Back  Again,'  and 'Most Important Point.'

Group  maturity,  another  sustainer,  refers to  the  collective  effectiveness  of  a  group  as it  works  together.  A  long-standing  group  can be  immature;  a  recently  formed  group  might be mature. The more immature a group is, the more need there is for tight structures and for carefully  describing  the  reasons  for  and  the structures of the strategies. Mature groups can work with either tight or loose protocols and, in fact, will sometimes ask for a tight protocol because they recognize that the topic is hard to talk about.

## Congruence

Congruence  with  organizational  values and  beliefs  is  the  fifth  principle  of  agenda design.  What  happens  in  meetings  is  a  manifestation of the degree to which the group is a learning community and will be a force for or a  force  against  developing  collective  efficacy. Thoughtful design can help unify faculty perspectives and experience. Many schools experience too much fragmentation. Good meeting design can express and reinforce deeper organizational values and beliefs about learning and

are  opportunities  to  model  effective  learning designs. Well-planned meetings link the project to the initiative, the immediate to the important, the short range to the long, and the greater community to its subsets.

<!-- image -->

We now move from design principles to the hands-on  activities  of  drafting  an  agenda  you will use. We will explore whether a meeting is even necessary. If the answer is yes, what type of meeting will it be? To help answer this question, we present a planning template and samples of agendas that serve different purposes.

## Is a Meeting Necessary?

Your first consideration is whether a meeting  is  even  necessary. Ask  yourself  what  you want  to  accomplish  and  if  meeting  together is  the  best  possible  use  of  your  group's  time on  this  topic.  Are  there  alternatives,  such  as surveys,  memos,  focus-group  interviews,  or phone or video conferencing that might serve just as well?

If  you  decide  that  a  meeting  is  appropriate, examine the potential agenda topics. Does each item on the agenda concern at least three members of the group? If not, deal with it oneto-one. Is it clear what type of action the group is to take on the item? If not, clarify it. Can it be dealt with either initially or fully at a lower level? If so, reroute it to the appropriate group or  subcommittee.  Has  the  item  for  discussion been  thoroughly  prepared-researched,  documented, and defined? If not, hold it over until the preparation is complete.

Once you've decided that a meeting is the best alternative and have screened the agenda items  to  determine  which  ones  must  be  addressed, consider who should be there. Do the agenda items pertain to the entire staff or just some of them? As mentioned earlier, if  some are for all but others pertain to just a couple of departments, schedule two adjournment times, releasing  those  who  are  not  involved  before starting on the final items. Are the items under consideration important or urgent enough to be on the next agenda? If not, reschedule them for a later meeting.

Always reserve the last five to ten minutes of  discussion  or  dialogue  meetings  for  the members to reflect on the meeting process. Developing other processes is one of the highest callings of leadership. Using a meeting assessment  inventory  reinforces  paying  attention  to the  success  structures  and  meeting  standards described in chapter 6 and helps groups to grow more skillful with each meeting.

Use the rule of one half: List the agenda topics,  then  cut  the  list  by  half.  One  reason meetings  can  be  a  source  of  dissatisfaction is  that  they  attempt  to  cover  too  much.  Slow down. Allow the  time  that  the  topics  and  the members deserve.

## What Type of Meeting Will It Be?

The type of meeting will influence the type of outcomes that can be reached. Four meeting types common to working groups are musters, assemblies,  discussions,  and  dialogues.  Chapter  5  presented  the  purposes  of  dialogue  (to understand) and discussion (to decide) as well as  the  structures  for  these  meeting  functions. Grade-level  teams,  department  meetings,  curriculum-council  leadership  groups,  and  full-

facility  meetings  carry  most  of  the  important conversations  about  teaching  and  learning  in dialogue or discussion formats.

Assemblies  are  routine  meetings  of  very large groups  like  high  school  faculties,  in which the large number of members limits the outcomes  to  receiving  and  clarifying  'pass down' information and sanctioning or rejecting proposals presented by a leader or a subgroup. Another example of an assembly is union rallies, in which the purpose is to give information and  get  people  excited.  One  exception  to  the limitation  of  assemblies  is  the  1-2-6  strategy (appendix A), in which even a group as large as two hundred can generate, clarify, advocate, and  select  a  few  items  as  most  important  to pursue. It should take no longer than an hour to accomplish this.

Musters are the regularly scheduled meetings of a department, an elementary faculty, or a special unit of workers such as bus drivers or  principals.  The  function  of  musters  is  to communicate up, down, and sideways and to feel  positive  about  the  experience.  They  are a  time  for  making  announcements,  coordinating calendars, and clarifying 'pass down' information. Never use a muster meeting for 'pass  down'  information  in  a  group  when a  memo  would  do,  unless  members  need  to ask  questions,  raise  issues,  or  agree  to  common  approaches  for  effective  implementation. Musters, like regularly scheduled faculty meetings,  often  reserve  time  for  discussion or  dialogue. We've  occasionally  held  muster meetings with chairs removed, to have standup meetings signaling this is brief, to the point with a quick dismissal.

## Clear Outcomes

We  like  to  say  that  the  three  most  important  considerations  in  drafting  an  agenda are  clear  outcomes, clear outcomes, and clear outcomes.  Creating  clear  outcomes  is  simple but  not  easy.  Like  a  finely  crafted  lesson,  a successful meeting will have outcomes that are behaviorally observable for each agenda item.

Well-formed outcomes describe a product, not a process; a destination, not a journey.

## Agenda Templates

We've had much success in designing meeting  agendas  within  our  own  organizations  and for  groups  with  whom  we  consult  by  asking ourselves, or the group, the following questions:

## A Pocket Guide to Agenda Design

- · What must happen at the opening of the meeting to provide an inclusion experience,  define  goals  and  roles, and adopt an agenda?
- · What terms should be defined?
- · What  questions must the group address,  and  in  what  sequence,  to achieve its desired outcome?
- · How much time will be assigned to meeting topics?
- · What processes and language will be used to maintain group-member efficacy, flexibility, craftsmanship, consciousness, and interdependence?
- · What  closing  activities  will  ensure clarity on group decisions, and who is to do what by when as the next steps?
- · What follow-up will be required?
- · What will be communicated to others about this meeting, and how will it be communicated?

To further complicate the issue of having clear  outcomes,  we  offer  two  final  considerations. One  is  that  high-functioning,  intact groups  should  pay  attention  to  their  development as  a  group. Therefore,  outcomes  should be thought about not only in terms of cognitive, affective,  and  product  goals  for  the  meeting, but  also  in  terms  of  how  the  meeting  can  be

conducted  in  such  a  way  that  the  group  gets better at being a group.

Finally,  regardless  of  your  role  within  a meeting,  or  even  the  nature  of  the  meeting, what,  specifically,  are  your  desired  outcomes? As a group member, do you desire greater clarity about an issue, or is it your intent to influence the  group  on  an  item?  If  the  latter,  how  will you  know  you've  succeeded,  and  what  might some strategies be? Mentor teachers often report to  us  with  surprise  that  being  clear  about  their outcomes has transformed one-to-one meetings with the teachers they are supporting.

In  our  own  practice  we  often  begin  a consultation  conversation  with  the  following questions:  'What  do  you  want  as  a  result  of this  meeting? How will you know if we have achieved that? What topics should be discussed for  that  goal?  How  much  time  should  we  allot,  and  in  what  sequence  should  we  discuss them?'  Helping  the  other  party  to  think  in outcome terms, whether the meeting is a parent conference or the start of a thirty-minute session with two other colleagues helps to focus time and strategies to get results.

The more one practices, the easier agenda construction  becomes.  Here  are  some  final planning tips:

- · Engage  design  help.  In  fact,  part  of  developing  your  group  is  to  increase  group consciousness and skill in this area.
- · Post outcomes in the meeting rooms. This forces you to construct clear language and observable goals and aids all members in knowing  the  reason  for  this  meeting  and how to best focus their energy. In addition, should  group  members  get  off  topic,  it allows the facilitator to gesture toward the posted outcomes and ask, 'Please help us to  understand  how  your  comments  relate to this outcome.' Sometimes they will tell us; sometimes they will monitor their own contribution, saying, 'I'll save it for later.'
- · Determine  how  much  content  and  how much process will be required to achieve
- outcomes  related  to  the  agenda  items. How much discussion, exploration, or dialogue  might  be  necessary?  How  much information  will  be  required?  Remember that when goals are related to attitude and behavior change, more process time is required, not less.
- · Estimate  the  time  that  each  agenda  item will take. Remember that if processes are involved, it takes time to explain them and to check for understanding.
- · Place  divisive  items  early  on  an  agenda to  minimize  the  possibility  of  members leaving at the end of the meeting in a funk.
- · If the  meeting  purpose  is  singular  and brief,  remove  the  furniture.  This  signals a  stand-up  meeting-quick,  focused,  and everyone out in fifteen minutes.
- · When you are a meeting leader, keep the first  hour  after  the  meeting  to  write  minutes and memos and do the necessary follow-up. Sending out a written follow-up to a meeting within twenty-four or forty-eight hours signals that you value people's time.
- · Consider what commitment will be made in the meeting  to  group  development. What time, processes, and areas of group development will be addressed? At times, one  of  the  seven  norms  of  collaboration (see  chapter  4)  will  emerge  as  important to  strengthen; at other times, raising consciousness  on  the  five  standards  for  successful meetings (see chapter 6 will be useful.  This  attention  to  group  development, often  overlooked,  is  the  secret  to  getting better and is the focus of the next chapter.

## Agenda Formats

Figures  7.2  through  7.5  are  sample  formats for meetings of various lengths. They are offered as idea stimulators for your situations. Obviously, these are not the only formats possible; you might have one that is working well for you.

This format was developed by the International School Bangkok after one of the authors worked with them developing collaborative tools for instructional leaders. Members of these classes included the Superintendent , Associate Superintendent for Curriculum, all Principals, some department heads and teachers in informal leadership roles The learning and the modeling by the Superintendent was instrumental in spreading sound practices throughout the school. The cabinet also held its meetings in the round so anyone could come and observe them at work, practicing meeting standards and employing norms of collaboration (Garmston and Welsh, 2007)

## Posing Problems for Groups to Work On

Much time can be saved when councils or other groups delegate tasks to subcommittees. Our experience is that three hours spent carefully  posing  the  problem  has  saved  literally hundreds  of  hours  of  committee  work,  eliminated  false  starts,  and  helped  to  keep  morale and communications at healthy levels.

To delegate without clear directions, constraints,  and  other  details  often  produces  unsatisfactory results. Both parties feel bad, and sometimes  the  committee  that  developed  the report is directed to repeat the work. It is in this type of work that clarity about decision authority needs to be at its most precise.

Decide which ones are most appropriate for  a  problem  you  are  posing  for  a  group  to work on.

Well-constructed agendas are an essential part of successful meetings. An excellent facilitator,  informed  and  capable  group  members, and  sufficient  time  and  space  alone  are  not enough to create meetings that get a lot of quality work done in a short amount of time with a great deal of member satisfaction.

## Step 1. Leaders define the problem:

- (a) What is the problem or challenge?
- (b) Who is affected directly?
- (c) Who and what are affected indirectly?
- (d) What feelings may exist about the problem?
- (e) What time, personnel, and fiscal limitations apply to resolutions or resolving processes

## Step 2. Leaders develop resolution criteria:

- (a)   What is the desired outcome?
- (b)   What criteria must the outcome meet in order to reach a satisfactory resolution?
- (c)   In what ways will the resolution contribute to organizational values or goals?

## For example:

- · The management team achieving and maintaining a common focus · Employees knowing that they are cared about and can contribute to the organization's directions
- · Development of five energy sources (efficacy, flexibility, craftsmanship, consciousness, and interdependence)
- (d)     In what ways will the resolution procedures and processes contribute to the organization's reflection, continued learning, and systematically managed change?

Step 3. Leaders phrase the assignment for the task force or ad hoc group:

- (a)   Determine the level(s) of decision-making authority the group will have
- (b)     Decide if the group is to present one resolution or three, with advantages and disadvantages for each.
- (c)     Phrase the task with language such as 'What might we do in order that. . .' or 'In what ways might we provide the widest latitude to the task force and maximize potential for creativity?'
- (d)     List the resolution criteria with language such as 'In ways that increase group efficacy, sharpen the management team's focus, and do so within existing budget guidelines.' This informs the group of organizational values and/or resolution restraints.

Step 4. Leaders present the assignment to the group and initiate processes for clarification and understanding of the task:

Example: This committee's task is to present to the superintendent of schools, by March 1, a recommendation regarding the issue stated below. The superintendent will take under advisement the committee's recommendation and will draft and recommend policy to the board of trustees. The board, after holding public hearings, will make a final decision at their June 8 meeting. Issue: In what ways might we develop teachers' capacity to teach for culturally proficient standards and authentically interact with families of minority cultures.

The committee's recommendations must do this in ways that will:

- (a)   Bring us into full compliance with the law
- (b)   Maximize individual choice
- (c)   Work within the allocated budgets for professional and organizational development
- (d)   Contribute to collective efficacy
