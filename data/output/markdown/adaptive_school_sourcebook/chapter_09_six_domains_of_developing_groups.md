## Chapter 9

## Six Domains of Developing Groups

D eveloping groups is one of three jobs assumed by leaders and professional developers. The other two are the task of getting work done and developing  process  skills.  This  chapter  describes  principles  of  group development and provides a way for groups to diagnose themselves on six fundamental aspects of group maturity. Chapter 10 provides a systems view of changing groups and reveals ways of working for long-range, sustainable change by assessing and intervening at the level of energy sources driving group performance.

in which you don't have to touch everyone to make a difference. Adaptive leaders of groups and within groups-no matter what their titlerealize that developing a group is an ongoing, third  agenda  in  their  work;  the  first  is  getting work  done,  and  the  second  is  improving  the processes of accomplishing work.

All groups work at less than full potential. The best groups regard this not as a deficiency but as a healthy dissatisfaction with their current  performance.  They  consistently  commit their  resources  to  working  together  more  effectively. This is the way that research teams become better at researching, that  basketball teams win more games, and that theater casts improve  from  performance  to  performance. All groups become better at their tasks when they reflect on their work, acquire new knowledge and skills, and practice the fundamentals of their craft. As stated previously, any group that  is  too  busy  to  reflect  on  its  work  is  too busy to improve.

All groups are unique. All groups are complex systems in which everything affects everything else, tiny events make major disturbances

## The Premises of Group Development

## Each Group Is Unique

History,  cognitive  styles,  setting,  mental models, and tasks all contribute to developing a  group  personality.  Each  group  is  not  only unlike other groups, it is also different from the sum  of  its  individuals.  For  example,  a  group might be composed of efficacious individuals who nevertheless believe that collectively they have little chance of making a difference.

## Some Groups Mature

Some groups will mature along a continuum from novice  to  expert  performance.  Not all  groups  make  this  journey,  just  as  not  all teachers  achieve  a  state  of  expertise.  David

Berliner  (cited  in  Calderhead,  1996)  speculated that the novice stage in teaching usually lasts  for  the  first  year  and  that  most  teachers reach the third stage (competence) within three or  four  years.  Only  a  modest  percentage  of teachers  moves  to  the  next  stage  of  proficiency,  and  an  even  smaller  percentage,  says Berliner, achieves the expert stage. Contemporary teacher education programs are placing a greater emphasis on metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive regulation. This monitoring of  one's  own  progress  in  achieving  learning goals  may  abbreviate  the  novice  to  expertise journey.  This  is  especially  important  as  programs aim to develop 'adaptive expertise' the ability to engage in lifelong learning, especially from others (Darling-Hammond and Bransford, 2005; National Research Council, 2000).

We believe that much the same is true for group  development  and  that  groups  with  collaborative cultures, groups in which members practice  group  member  metacognitive  skills will  advance  faster  than  groups  with  cultures of individualization. Expert groups can do increasingly more in less time. They differ from novices in these ways:

- · Have  more  practical  knowledge  of  the social,  political,  and  systems  context  in which their work occurs.
- · Plan, monitor, and revise their approach to problems more effectively.
- · Spend  more  time  trying  to  understand  a problem  before  generating  solutions  and are  more  likely  to  monitor  their  solution attempts.
- · Are more likely to be reflective and continuously learn through experience.
- · Do  better  at  distinguishing  relevant  data from nonrelevant data in problem solving.

## Attrition Does Not Have to Block Development

With intention and attention it is possible to  minimize and overcome the disruptive ef- fects  of  attrition  on  group  dynamics. Groups that emphasize developing group-member capabilities  and  norms  of  collaboration  informally provide induction experiences for new members (see chapter 4). We work with many international  schools.  In  these  settings  staff turnover  is  high  and  frequent.  Yet,  in  teams that  regularly  apply  collaborative  norms  and meeting standards as a matter of course, new members quickly adopt the behaviors of their new school.

## Variables Affect Performance and Performance Capacity

'Soft'  variables,  such  as  morale,  work culture, and trust not only influence the performance of a group but also influence the group's ability to learn from its experience (Hennessy, 1998).  As  we  shall  see  in  the  next  chapter also,  the  collective  energies  of  efficacy,  interdependence,  consciousness,  craftsmanship, and  flexibility  affect  a  group's  performance. In  data-driven  climates,  it  may  appear  that only student-related metrics such as test scores and  graduation  rates  have  value  in  guiding important  efforts.  Not  so,  say  a  number  of organizational  developers  in  the  private  sector,  sociology,  and  education  (Harner,  2015). Variables like trust are being measured (exemplified in the Chicago school research, such as Bryk and Schneider, 2002), work climate, and teacher  efficacy  contribute  to  understanding and improvement.

## Learning Organizes Itself in Unique Domains

Learning  occurs  through  different  processes, some centering in the neocortex, others at  the  limbic  system,  some  a  combination  of both. Depending on the model one adopts (all models are incomplete) you would say that it is nested in hierarchical levels of environment, behaviors,  capabilities,  beliefs,  identity,  and mission.  For  two  decades  we  have  applied concepts  from  this  model  with  success.  A

newer model (Garmston in Costa et al., 2015), described  in  the  next  chapter,  regards  these domains  as  interactive  within  a  complex  system, in which, as we have explored, everything affects  everything  else  and  tiny  events  cause major disturbanances. The greatest benefits of group development efforts come from strategically intervening in the different domains.

## Metacognition and Style Diversity Accelerate Learning

Groups that reflect about their experiences develop the executive consiousness necessary to  self-organize  and  manage  the  processes used  to  do  their  work.  In  other  words  they take time to learn about themselves and how they do their work. When diversity in cognitive  style  exists  in  groups,  such  learning  is accelerated. Teams that manage the style tensions between experiencing, reflecting, thinking,  and  acting  achieve  the  greatest  growth and greatest accomplishments. Knowledge of the six domains of group develoment, below, is  particularly  useful  for  such  groups  (Kolb and Kolb, 2009).

## Maturity Manifests in Six Domains of Group Development

Group maturity manifests in the ways that a group manages its day-to-day work in order to  deal  with  its  external  environment.  How well  it  performs  in  six  interacting  domains determines the group's achievement. Each field is informed by the application of domain-specific  knowledge,  skills,  and  structures  as  well as  unique  combinations  of  efficacy,  flexibilty, craftsmanship, consciousness, and interdependence.  Each  of  the  chapters  in  this  book highlights  the  resources  for  developing  these domains. Readers may wish to turn to the end of  the  chapter  now  for  a  description  of  each field and a diagnostic instrument.

## The Six Fields of Group Development

The  six  domains  of  group  development are (1) getting work done; (2) doing the right work; (3) working collaboratively; (4) managing systems; (5) developing the group; and (6) adapting to change.

All groups struggle to achieve a successful balance  between  managing  and  adapting  to external  relationships  and  maintaining  harmonious  and  effective  internal  relationships (Schein,  2004).  In  each  dimension,  the  issues of task accomplishment and process skills development compete for attention. Although it is useful for groups to realize this macroview of their work, it is difficult to assess and intervene with group development at this level. To effectively build strong groups capable of maintaining their own identity and adapting to external environments, groups must be able to function skillfully within each of the six fields. Knowing the knowledge bases, skills, and structures of each is an essential first step. Knowing the assumptions  held  by  the  group  about  each  of these  theaters  of  operation  reveals  the  mental models and drivers of group choices.

Before reading this section, think about a group with which you work, and ask yourself the following:

- 1. What are our strengths as a group?
- 2. What difficulties do we encounter as we work?
- 3. How ready are we to take on increasingly complex or emotionally charged tasks?
- 4. What are some potential growth areas for us as a group?

## Getting Work Done

Leaders  and  groups  understand  the  dynamic  relationship  between  task  accomplishment  and  process  skills  development.  The

prevailing mental model in this domain is that the group assumes that its work is manageable. Essential  knowledge  includes  mastering  dialogue  and  discussion  (chapter  5),  conducting successful meetings (chapter 6), designing efficient and effective meetings (chapter 7), using facilitation  skills  (chapter  8),  and  facilitating data teams (chapter 11).

## Doing the Right Work

Leaders  and  groups  plan  work  to  realize their vision, values, and emerging goals (chapter 2). The organizing presupposition of this domain in  that  vision,  values,  and  goal  clarity  focus group energy as well as when and how to talk about  each  (chapter  5).  The  necessary  knowledge includes understanding adaptivity (chapter 2), facilitating data teams (chapter 11), living effectively with conflict (chapter 12), developing the capacities for change and adaptivity (chapter 13), and creating community (chapter 14).

## Working Collaboratively

Leaders  and  groups  work  to  create  and maintain  an  effective  environment  for  collaboration  and  interdependence.  The  dominant presupposition in this domain is that diversity is  a  necessary  resource  and  that  subcultures must connect with and value one another. The knowledge that is necessary to effectively work collaboratively  and  interdependently  includes focusing  on  both  things  and  energy  (chapter 2), the four group-member capabilities and the seven  norms  of  collaboration  (see  chapter  4), the mastery of dialogue and discussion (chapter 5),  successful  meeting  management  (chapter 6), time efficient meeting (chapter 7), facilitation  skills  (chapter  9),  facilitating  data  teams (chapter 11), and the ability to work effectively with conflict (chapter 12).

## Managing Systems

Groups develop new ways of looking at the world. An organizing presupposition here is that as systems become more complex, the ability to think systematically and know when to set aside linear logic is important. Critical knowledge includes understanding dynamical systems (chapter 2), working effectively with conflict  (see  chapter  12),  developing  the  capacities for change and adaptivity (see chapters  1,  2,  and  10),  and  creating  community (see chapter 14).

## Developing the Group

Whatever the degree of accomplishment, groups can become better at their work. Individuals and groups need to develop resources for  generating  ideas  and  adapting  to  change. An  important  presupposition  in  this  domain is that both individual and group orientations are necessary to produce innovations and implement  them.  The  necessary  knowledge  includes information about two ways of talking (chapter 6), norms of collaoration (chapter 5), about group development (as described in this chapter),  the  ability  to  work  effectively  with conflict  (see  chapter  12),  the  importance  of professional  community  (see  chapter  4),  and the principles of creating that community (see chapter 14).

## Adapting to Change

An  effective  group  relates  to  multiple communities  that  are  external  to  the  group. The  agendas  and  resulting  demands  of  these communities are often in flux and inconsistent with  one  another.  The  prevailing  presupposition  within  this  domain  is  that  for  groups  to function effectively, they must constantly adapt to  external  environments.  The  more  turbulent the environment, the more the energy must be focused outward. Critical knowledge includes recognizing schools as complex systems (chapter 2), asking three focusing questions (chapter 2), working  with  conflict  (see  chapter  12), developing the capacities for change and adaptivity (see chapter 10), and creating community (see chapter 14).

## Assessing the Six Fields

The  six  domains  are  inextricably  intertwined; woven together, they make a whole. The knowledge for one domain is also necessary in another. As in all dynamic systems, what affects one variable affects the others. Because of this interactive nature, an assessment instrument that seeks  detail  about  either  the  'things'  or  'the energy'  in  each  domain  would  contain  redundancies. Mastery of discussion and dialogue, for example, are requirements in the first and third domains. To be effective at dialogue, individuals must internalize the group-member capabilities and the norms of collaboration; these elements are also a prerequisite for managing conflict in the fourth, fifth, and sixth domains. To maximize discussion  effectiveness, successful  meeting skills are required, which is a focus in the first and third domains.

In  contrast  to  the  energies  involved  in assessing  'hard  data,'  the  energies  in  system dynamics  have  traditionally  been  harder  to measure, more prone to measurement error, and therefore less relied upon as a data source for group development. Nevertheless, 'the importance  of  measurement  error  diminishes  when the investigative focus shifts from concern over the system's current state to understanding the system's  behavior  over  time,  which  is  often the  purpose  of  a  systems  dynamics  model' (Hennessy, 1998, pp. 6-7). Measurement-error importance  also  declines  when  data  are  used to  promote  conversations  about  how  a  group might strengthen itself  rather  than  being  used for external evaluation.

We have found that a simple rating scale such  as  the  following  is  useful  for  group self-assessment:  1  =  Beginning;  2  =  Emerg-

ing; 3 = Developing; 4 = Integrating; and 5 = Innovating.

Organize  a  faculty  group  into  subgroups of three or four members each. Have them discuss each domain using the descriptions above. Have them rate their group by loose consensus on each domain, using this scale. Suggest that a  way  of  calibrating  their  place  on  the  scale might be to locate, in general, where the group functions along a continuum of unconscious incompetence (they don't know they don't know) to  unconscious  competence  (performing  with effortlessness). Rate the major knowledge areas in each domain as follows:

| Beginning   | Unconscious incompetence: We don't know what we don't know.                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Emerging    | Unconscious incompetence to conscious competence: We are discovering areas in which we want to learn.                                                                                                     |
| Developing  | Conscious competence: We are applying skills but with much effort, requiring more attention to how we are using a skill than to the results we are getting and possible needs for modifying our approach. |
| Integrating | Conscious competence to unconscious competence: We are beginning to be able to focus on results and the skill we are employing.                                                                           |
| Innovating  | Unconscious competence: Our skills are so internalized we can put our full attention on the realtionship and the results we are getting, allowing us to effortlessly modify our approach if necessary.    |
| Adapting    | Reflective competence: Having gained unconsious competence, we routinely reflect, learn from, and modify future interactions.                                                                             |

Now have  the  subgroups  report  their  assessments to the entire group. Search for agreement  among  subgroups  and  set  those  aside. Locate areas of disagreement and seek to un- derstand the differences in perception. Come to an accommodation in ratings. From this analysis, have the group select a domain for further study and development (figure 9.2).

Figure 9.1 . Assessing Six Domains of Group Development

## A Systems Approach for Developing Groups

Like birds lifting off from far reaches in a meadow and flocking together in flight, ideas emerge from a variety  of  sources  in  a  group, suggestive of a systems approach to developing groups. Within the literature on organizational development and school change, it is now taken for  granted  that  teacher  work  and  learning  is largely influenced by socialization and that the culture of the workplace is significant in determining how teachers think, what they do, and how they express themselves (Hargreaves and Fullan,  2012;  Newmann  and  Wehlage,  1995; Rosenholtz, 1991). From anthropology, cybernetics, psychology, and organizational science (Dilts, 1996) come conceptions of nested levels  of  learning  in  which  learning  at  one  level influences learning at another. In this model, a sense  of  identity  organizes  and  informs  other levels  of  learning.  In  another  model,  learning domains are parts of complex systems (Costa and  Garmston,  2016).  In  this  model,  too,  the sense of identity is dominant.

In  the  following  chapter,  group  identity is  identified  as  a  catalytic  entity,  changeable through  circumstances  and  time,  that  when selected as a focus of intervention, can dramatically affect group performance. Like individual identity, organizational  identity  is  also  fluid. This instability is regarded as an asset to adaptivite change (Gioia, Schulz, Corley, 2000). Organizational idenity can be clarified in patterns of self-reflection. Four essential questions promote this  line  of  inquiry: Who  are  we? What do we take  to  be  central  to  our  work?  What  do  we believe makes our group distinct from the perceptions of other groups? What is perceived by us to be an enduring quality of our organization? Additionally,  five  collective  energy  sourcesefficacy,  flexibiity,  craftsmanship,  consiousness and interdependence are described as potential places of intervention to support stuck groups in moving toward their potential.

The  newer  sciences-quantum  physics, cognitive anthropology, complexity theory, and the study of fractals-portray a view of life organizing itself. Margaret Wheatley and Myron Kellner-Rogers (1996), articulate translators of the new sciences for leadership agendas, write the following:

Identity,  then,  is  another  essential  condition for  organization.  It  is  the  self  of  the  system that compels  it  toward  particular  actions and behaviors. . . . Organizational structures emerge  in  response  to  these  imperatives  of identity. Identity is at the core of every organization, fueling its creation. (pp. 85-86)
