# Documentation Improvement Plan

This document outlines the plan to clean up and update the existing documentation and create a new simplified overview document for the document processing pipeline.

## 1. Update Existing Documentation:

*   **README.md:**
    *   Enhance the "Features" section to explicitly mention audio and video processing capabilities.
    *   Correct the statement about the LICENSE file, noting that it is already included.
    *   Verify and update the "Requirements" and "Installation" sections for accuracy.
    *   Refine the "Usage" section to clearly direct users to `USER_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions on using the `run_pipeline.py` script.
    *   Incorporate any relevant updates from `pipeline_progress_summary.md` that are not yet reflected in the README.

*   **USER_GUIDE.md:**
    *   Add comprehensive instructions and practical examples for processing audio and video files using the `run_pipeline.py` script, including relevant options (e.g., for transcription).
    *   Provide clearer explanations and examples for PDF processing, detailing the different `--ocr_mode` options (`hybrid`, `docling`, `gpt`) and how to specify the `--llm_provider`.
    *   Ensure the section on Weaviate ingestion is clear, explaining how to use the `weaviate` pipeline type and linking to `docs/weaviate_layer.md` for in-depth details on Weaviate configuration and management.
    *   Review all existing examples to ensure they are accurate and cover the full range of supported functionalities.

*   **docs/weaviate_layer.md:**
    *   Review the technical details, especially regarding schema definitions and collection management, to ensure they align with the current codebase and the recent bug fixes.
    *   Add a section or update the existing schema section to list and briefly describe the purpose of each defined collection schema (KnowledgeItem, KnowledgeMain, AudioItem, AudioChunk, ImageItem, VideoItem, VideoChunk).
    *   If there have been updates to the planned testing or CI setup, reflect those in the document.

*   **pipeline_progress_summary.md:**
    *   Add a summary of the recent bug fixes related to the Weaviate schema configuration and the successful resolution of the integration test failures.
    *   Include any other notable progress or changes made to the pipeline since the last update date in the document title.

## 2. Create Simplified Overview Document (`OVERVIEW.md`):

*   Create a new markdown file named `OVERVIEW.md` in the root directory of the project.
*   Draft content that explains the document processing pipeline in simple, non-technical terms.
*   Clearly articulate what the pipeline does, the types of files it can process (e.g., "documents like PDFs and Word files, audio recordings, and images"), and the different outputs it can generate (e.g., "plain text summaries, formatted reports in Markdown, structured data in JSON, or organized information in a searchable database").
*   Use analogies or simple examples to explain complex concepts if necessary.
*   Include a basic visual representation of the pipeline flow:

    ```mermaid
    graph TD
        A[Your Files (PDFs, Audio, Images, etc.)] --> B(The Pipeline Processes Them)
        B --> C[Useful Outputs (Text, Reports, Data, Searchable Database)]
    ```
*   Clearly state that this document is a high-level overview and direct readers to `README.md` and `USER_GUIDE.md` for detailed technical information and usage instructions.

## 3. Review and Refine:

*   Once the updates and the new document are drafted, I will review them for clarity, accuracy, and consistency across all files.
*   I will then share the updated documentation and the new overview document with you for your review and feedback before finalizing.
