## MEDIATING RESOURCES FOR HOLONOMY

We either make ourselves miserable, or we make ourselves strong. The amount of work is the same.

-Carlos Castaneda

Holonomy describes a characteristic of dynamic or nonlinear systems in which everything influences everything else. Tiny events can cause major disturbances in the system, and you do not need to touch everyone to make a difference. Each autonomous unit in a holonomous system influences the system in addition to being influenced by it (Garmston and Wellman 2013).

Of course, the goals of holonomy are never fully achieved. In addition, there is no such thing as perfect attainment of the states of efficacy, flexibility, craftsmanship, consciousness, and interdependence. These are utopian energies toward which we constantly aspire. The journey toward holonomy and the five states of mind is the destination.

Performing intelligently in holonomous systems means living in tensions: whole and part, event and context, individual and group. It is a life work, described by Jung as individuation-an integrated development of the physical, emotional, spiritual, intellectual, and social being. It is a human journey everywhere, across all continents, ages, and cultures. It is most complex in the 21st century in postindustrial societies such as ours, in which Robert Kegan (1994) estimates that perhaps as much as 50 percent of Americans have not achieved the cognitive complexity needed to cope with daily life. Our dream is that all educators will one day possess the complexity to provide the very best instruction for students. As described earlier, our mission is to foster autonomous, self-directed learners, capable of intelligent, values-based living within holonomous systems. Although there are many important aspects related to mediation, the most critical is to remember one's intention in a mediational transaction.

There is no doubt that school staffs that exercise intelligent membership in holonomous systems also work collaboratively and produce better results with students than do faculties whose members work in isolation from one another. Such workplaces are characterized by clear values and norms, reflective dialogue, deprivatized teaching, and an atmosphere in which the primary focus of energy, attention, and conversation is on student learning. Richard Elmore and Elizabeth City (2007, 3) note that

'The discipline of school improvement lies in developing strong internal processes for self-monitoring and reflection.' This requires selfdirectedness-an enduring goal in the work of Cognitive Coaching.

Mediating holonomy pursues three outcomes: developing capacity among the parts, strengthening the whole, and creating the consciousness and skills with which part and whole inform and support the continuing development of each another. To achieve the first outcome is to support people in becoming autonomous and self-actualizing. Efficacy and craftsmanship especially contribute to this; so do supporting teachers in a continual inquiry into the knowledge base about teaching and developing commitment to setting and working toward high standards.

The second outcome calls for members of the school community to function interdependently, recognizing their capacity to both self-regulate and be regulated by the norms, values, and goals of the larger system. Consciousness, craftsmanship, and interdependence are primary energy sources. To attain this requires clear standards for collaborative work and for teaching, if necessary, the structural, communication, and metacognitive skills required for productive collaboration.

The third outcome is achieved by developing each part and whole to value the other component. This outcome also is achieved by devising and using strategies that draw on the advantages of each while avoiding the shortcomings. The entire set of states of mind contributes to each of these outcomes and, perhaps more than anywhere else, is true for this third outcome.
