The IB Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous, academically challenging and balanced
programme of education designed to prepare students aged 16 to 19 for success at
university and life beyond. The DP aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable,
inquiring, caring and compassionate, and to develop intercultural understanding,
open-mindedness and the attitudes necessary to respect and evaluate a range of viewpoints.
To ensure both breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding, students must
choose at least one subject from five groups: 1) their best language, 2) additional
language(s), 3) social sciences, 4) experimental sciences, and 5) mathematics. Students
may choose either an arts subject from group 6, or a second subject from groups
1 to 5. At least three and not more than four subjects are taken at higher level (240
recommended teaching hours), while the remaining are taken at standard level (150
recommended teaching hours). In addition, three core elements—the extended essay,
theory of knowledge and creativity, action, service—are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.
These IB DP subject briefs illustrate four key course components.

I. Course description and aims
The IB DP Computer science SL course requires an understanding of the
fundamental concepts of computational thinking as well as knowledge
of how computers and other digital devices operate. The course, under pinned by conceptual thinking, draws on a wide spectrum of knowledge,
and enables and empowers innovation, exploration and the acquisition
of further knowledge.  Students study how computer science interacts
with and influences cultures, society and how individuals and societies
behave, and the ethical issues involved. During the course the student
will develop computational solutions. This will involve the ability to:
• identify a problem or unanswered question • design, prototype and test a proposed solution
• liaise with clients to evaluate the success of the proposed solution and make recommendations for future developments.
The aims of the computer science standard level courses are to:
• provide opportunities for study and creativity within a global con text that will stimulate and challenge students developing the
skills necessary for independent and lifelong learning
• provide a body of knowledge, methods and techniques that char acterize computer science
• enable students to apply and use a body of knowledge, methods and techniques that characterize computer science
• demonstrate initiative in applying thinking skills critically to identi fy and resolve complex problems
• engender an awareness of the need for, and the value of, effective
collaboration and communication in resolving complex problems
• develop logical and critical thinking as well as experimental, inves tigative and problem-solving skills
• develop and apply the students’ information and communication
technology skills in the study of computer science to communi cate information confidently and effectively
• raise awareness of the moral, ethical, social, economic and environ mental implications of using science and technology
• develop an appreciation of the possibilities and limitations asso ciated with continued developments in IT systems and computer science
• encourage an understanding of the relationships between scientif ic disciplines and the overarching nature of the scientific method.

IV. Sample questions
• The colour of a pixel can be stored as a 16-bit integer.
(a) State how many different colours can be represented in a 16-bit integerfield.

(b) State whether this storage system for colour values is digital or analog.
(c) Outline one advantage and one disadvantage of using 32-bits
per-pixel to store colours instead of 16-bits per-pixel.
• State the output of the following code fragment:
double n= 1234.5678;
double p = math.floor((n*100)/100); output (p);
Recall that math.floor(3.7) produces the integer result 3.
