## Intervening for Self-Managing

When a colleague is planning an event-such as teaching a lesson, conducting a professional development meeting, anticipating a parentteacher conference, or envisioning a school board meeting-the mediator, understanding the role of language as a meditational tool, carefully selects and composes questions intended to engage the mental processes of selfmanagement. Those questions are invitational, open ended, and cognitively complex. Some examples are shown in table 4.1.
