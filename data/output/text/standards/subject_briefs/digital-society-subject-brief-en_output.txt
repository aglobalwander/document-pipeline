The Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the
16 to 19 age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be
knowledgeable and inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis
on encouraging students to develop intercultural understanding, open‑mindedness, and
the attitudes necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core. Students
study two modern languages (or a modern language and a classical language),
a ­humanities or social science subject, an experimental science, mathematics
and one of the creative arts. Instead of an arts subject, students can choose two
subjects from another area. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes
the Diploma Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare
students effectively for university entrance. In each of the academic areas students
have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can choose subjects
that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.
Normally, three subjects (and not more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and
the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends 240 teaching hours for HL
subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than
at SL. In addition, three core elements—the extended essay, theory of knowledge and creativity,
activity, service—are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.

I. Course description and aims
Digital society is an interdisciplinary course within the individuals and societies subject group. The
course is designed for young people interested in exploring the impact and importance of digital systems
and technologies in the contemporary world. Digital society is intended to appeal to a broad range of
teachers in the social studies, media, humanities, IT and related subject areas.
The course integrates concepts, content and contexts through inquiry.
•	 Concepts such as expression, space and identity highlight powerful, pervasive and debatable perspectives that provide insight for inquiry.
•	 Content informs inquiry with details about digital systems including areas related to data, algorithms, media, AI, robotics and more.
•	 Contexts situate inquiry into areas significant to life in digital society including social, cultural and environmental contexts.
In addition, HL students consider important contemporary challenges and digital interventions.
The course aims support standard level (SL) and higher level (HL) students on their inquiry journey as they:
•	 Focus inquiry using course concepts, content and contexts as well as real-world examples
•	 Explore diverse sources relevant to digital society
•	 Investigate impacts and implications of digital systems for people and communities
•	 Reflect on emerging trends, future developments and further insights
•	 Share discoveries about digital society with others
