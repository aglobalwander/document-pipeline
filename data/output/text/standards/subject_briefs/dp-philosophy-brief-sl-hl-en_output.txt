The Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the
16 to 19 age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be
knowledgeable and inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis
on encouraging students to develop intercultural understanding, open‑mindedness, and
the attitudes necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core. Students
study two modern languages (or a modern language and a classical language),
a ­humanities or social science subject, an experimental science, mathematics
and one of the creative arts. Instead of an arts subject, students can choose two
subjects from another area. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes
the Diploma Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare
students effectively for university entrance. In each of the academic areas students
have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can choose subjects
that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.
Normally, three subjects (and not more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and
the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends 240 teaching hours for HL
subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than
at SL. In addition, three core elements—the extended essay, theory of knowledge and creativity,
activity, service—are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.

I. Course description and aims
The DP philosophy course provides students with an opportunity to undertake systematic critical
inquiry into profound and challenging questions, such as: What does it mean to be human? What is the
relationship between justice, freedom and equality? What do we mean when we say something is right
or wrong? These abstract questions arise out of our everyday experiences, and the practice of philosophy
deepens and clarifies our understanding of these questions, as well as possible responses.
The aim of the philosophy course is to engage students in philosophical activity, enabling them to:
•
develop an inquiring and intellectually curious way of thinking •
appreciate the diversity of perspectives, traditions and approaches within philosophical thinking •
critically examine their own experiences and perspectives • learn from the thinking of others • articulate their own views, ideas and arguments •
apply their philosophical knowledge and skills to the world around them.
II. Curriculum model overview
The DP philosophy course comprises a shared core syllabus for all SL and HL students, consisting of the
study of the core theme “Being human”, one optional theme and one prescribed text, as well as the
completion of the internal assessment exercise. In addition, students at HL must study one further optional
theme as well as the HL extension topic “Philosophy and contemporary issues”. The recommended
teaching hours for each element of the course are summarised below.
