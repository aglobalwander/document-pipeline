The IB Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous, academically challenging and
balanced programme of education designed to prepare students aged 16 to 19
for success at university and life beyond. The DP aims to encourage students to be
knowledgeable, inquiring, caring and compassionate, and to develop intercultural
understanding, open-mindedness and the attitudes necessary to respect and evalu ate a range of viewpoints. Approaches to teaching and learning (ATL) within the DP
are deliberate strategies, skills and attitudes that permeate the teaching and learning
environment. In the DP students develop skills from five ATL categories: thinking,
research, social, self-management and communication.
To ensure both breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding, students must
choose at least one subject from five groups: 1) their best language, 2) additional lan guage(s), 3) social sciences, 4) experimental sciences, and 5) mathematics. Students
may choose either an arts subject from group 6, or a second subject from groups
1 to 5. At least three and not more than four subjects are taken at higher level (240
recommended teaching hours), while the remaining are taken at standard level (150
recommended teaching hours). In addition, three core elements—the extended
essay, theory of knowledge and creativity, action, service—
are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.
These IB DP subject briefs illustrate four key course components.

I. Course description and aims
Physics is the most fundamental of the experimental sciences as it
seeks to explain the universe itself, from the very smallest particles to
the vast distances between galaxies. Despite the exciting and ex traordinary development of ideas throughout the history of physics,
observations remain essential to the very core of the subject. Models
are developed to try to understand observations, and these themselves
can become theories that attempt to explain the observations.
Besides helping us better understand the natural world, physics gives us
the ability to alter our environments.  This raises the issue of the impact
of physics on society, the moral and ethical dilemmas, and the social,
economic and environmental implications of the work of physicists.
By studying physics students should become aware of how scientists
work and communicate with each other. While the scientific method
may take on a wide variety of forms, it is the emphasis on a practical
approach through experimental work that characterizes the subject.
Teachers provide students with opportunities to develop manipulative
skills, design investigations, collect data, analyse results and evaluate and communicate their findings.
Through the overarching theme of the nature of science, the aims of the DP physics course are to enable students to:
1.	 appreciate scientific study and creativity within a global context through stimulating and challenging opportunities
2.	 acquire a body of knowledge, methods and techniques that characterize science and technology
3.	 apply and use a body of knowledge, methods and techniques that characterize science and technology
4.	 develop an ability to analyse, evaluate and synthesize scientific information
5.	 develop a critical awareness of the need for, and the value of, effec tive collaboration and communication during scientific activities
6.	 develop experimental and investigative scientific skills including the use of current technologies
7.	 develop and apply 21st century communication skills in the study of science
8.	 become critically aware, as global citizens, of the ethical implica tions of using science and technology
9.	 develop an appreciation of the possibilities and limitations of science and technology
10.	develop an understanding of the relationships between scientific
disciplines and their influence on other areas of knowledge.

The group 4 project
The group 4 project is a collaborative activity where students from dif ferent group 4 subjects, within or between schools, work together. It al lows for concepts and perceptions from across disciplines to be shared
while appreciating the environmental, social and ethical implications
of science and technology. It can be practically or theoretically based
and aims to develop an understanding of the relationships between
scientific disciplines and their influence on other areas of knowledge.
The emphasis is on interdisciplinary cooperation and the scientific processes.
III. Assessment model
It is the intention of this course that students are able to fulfill the following assessment objectives:
1.	 Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of:
• facts, concepts, and terminology • methodologies and techniques • communicating scientific information.
2.	 Apply:
• facts, concepts, and terminology • methodologies and techniques
• methods of communicating scientific information.
3.	 Formulate, analyse and evaluate:
• hypotheses, research questions and predictions • methodologies and techniques • primary and secondary data • scientific explanations.
4.	 Demonstrate the appropriate research, experimental, and person al skills necessary to carry out insightful and ethical investigations.

IV. Sample questions
• An object falls freely from rest through a vertical distance of 44.0m
in a time of 3.0s. What value should be quoted for the acceleration of free-fall? (Paper 1)
A.	 9.778ms-2
B.	 9.780ms-2
C.	 9.78ms-2
D.	 9.8ms-2
• There is a suggestion that the temperature of the Earth may
increase if the use of fossil fuels is not reduced over the coming
years. Explain, with reference to the enhanced greenhouse effect,
why this temperature increase may occur. (Paper 2)
•  In an experiment to measure the specific heat capacity of a
metal, a piece of metal is placed inside a container of boiling
water at 100°C.  The metal is then transferred into a calorimeter
containing water at a temperature of 10°C.  The final equilibrium
temperature of the water was measured.  One source of error
in this experiment is that the small mass of boiling water will be
transferred to the calorimeter along with the metal.
(a)	Suggest the effect of the error on the measured value of the specific heat capacity of the metal
(b)	State one other source of error for this experiment (Paper 3)
