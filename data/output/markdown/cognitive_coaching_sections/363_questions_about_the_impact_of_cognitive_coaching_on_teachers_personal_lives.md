Researchers could also conduct studies on the impact of Cognitive Coaching on teachers' personal lives. How might relationships with spouses, partners, or significant others change?

How might Cognitive Coaching impact teacher curiosity and creativity? What might be some changes in teacher self-concept? What changes could occur in teacher identity and how teachers see themselves?
