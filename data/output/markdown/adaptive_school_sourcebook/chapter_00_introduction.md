## Preface

I n the blink of a cosmic eye the technological developments from the atom bomb, cell phone, Internet, and ingestible cameras for medical research have brought profound changes. The individual and cumulative effects of these revolutionary developments liberate, endanger, connect, and separate us. Mass media,  telecommunications,  information  technology,  and  artificial  intelligence are  changing  our  world  and  our  very  selves,  as  they  bring  us  to  new  starting points for human and social development. This is a world in which serious conversations among researchers in the field of artificial intelligence urgently ask the questions: What is intelligence? What is the mind? Will machines wrest control from their human masters?

How do we cope with such an increasingly unpredictable world? To move with the flow of change we need to be able to let go of past assumptions and learn to think afresh. As change pushes  us  to  make  more  decisions  faster  and faster,  it  becomes  increasingly  important  not to  fall  into  the  trap  of  rushing  our  judgments or  being  seduced  by  the  comfort  of  action. Complex  problems  always  have  simple  solutions-that  are  usually  wrong.  Quality  decisions require that we slow down and create the opportunity for insights and feelings to emerge in our awareness. Slowing to think, to inquire, to  collaborate,  to  talk  together  about  student learning is what biologists call an adaptive trait.

Adaptive  traits  have  a  current  functional role  in  the  life  of  an  organism.  In  organizations, these traits maintain, sustain, and evolve by  becoming  normative  forces  that  shape  the behavior  of  managers  and  employees. This  is not a simple matter, as this new normal requires support,  monitoring,  and  indelible  connection with values. The organization must remain viable at all stages of its development and within all phases of environmental change.

On a recent break from working with international educators in Mumbai, India, while wandering  the  alleyways  and  passageways of  Dharavi, the locale for the movie Slumdog Millionaire ,  we wondered what adaptive traits might be keeping this multireligious, multiethnic,  diverse  settlement  alive.  With  nearly  one million people sardined into five hundred acres, these human beings are amazingly resourceful. Adaptivity is their essential human quality, enabled by self-conscious intelligence modifying either the conditions or themselves to such an extent that they can live at the extremes. People adapt and use their ingenuity and inventiveness to  survive,  but  also  to  find  meaning  and  purpose,  and  whatever  degree  of  pleasure,  even happiness, that humans may know.

We also wondered anew about the adaptive traits necessary for twenty-first-century schools to crest the waves of unrelenting change. From the first edition of this book in 1999 until now, the essential adaptive traits we have witnessed in  many  settings  are  the  dispositions  to  inquire, to collaborate, and to talk about student learning and teachers' roles in student enlight-

enment. These traits, and the instruments that serve  them,  have  been  sustainable  and  embraced internationally now for seventeen years. Teaching  is  a  people  business,  and  effective schools are settings in which people meet in the center of their practice. They meet as humans and with the practical and productive tools described in this book.

Regarding this third edition we especially appreciate  the  keen  editing  eyes  of  Jane  Ellison, Carolee Hayes, Carolyn McKanders, and Wendy Ferguson and the invaluable assistance provided by Michael Dolcemascolo in refining this  new  organization  and  material  on  facilitator moves and strategies. And above all, we want  to  express  gratitude  to  Sue  Canavan, acquisitions editor and friend, who has guided this work  through  three  editions  now,  and whose indefatigable spirit, encouragement, and problem-solving abilities have been indispensable in making this work available to readers.

We  are  eternally  grateful  to  the  many voices  that  have  contributed  to  our  learning, from  schools  around  the  world,  from  colleagues  at  Thinking  Collaborative,  and  from the  emerging  research  and  knowledge  in  our profession. We remain committed to the notion that adaptation is a process requiring relatively small  changes  over  time  and  those  changes begin with us.

## Introduction

T school systems and groups in the past twenty years as we have worked his edition of The Adaptive School represents much of our learning about with  educators  in  settings  that  span  the  globe. Although  each  school  is unique, there are social patterns that are easily recognizable when people gather in groups to work together. Drawing on these experiences and looking at group work through the  theoretical  filters  of  biology,  ecology,  quantum  physics,  complexity science, systems thinking, and cognitive and social psychology, we offer a practical set of principles and tools for developing and facilitating collaborative groups.

The  Adaptive  School is about  developing  strong  groups  and  schools  in  which  collaborative  faculties  are capable  of  meeting the  uncertain  challenges  of  tomorrow.  Some schools  are  flourishing.  Others  are  making remarkable gains in improving student achievement,  increasing  attendance,  attaining  higher post-school  accomplishments,  and  developing satisfying relationships with their communities. Some schools produce only fair results; others languish. We believe that all can be better.

it  is  difficult  to  maintain  a  collaborative  core. Regardless of the nature of the issues, it is our premise that the means for improvement exist within  the  school  community.  The  practical ideas in this book show how to activate these resources if they are dormant and focus them if they are scattered.

As  realists, we  recognize  that  difficult and  different  challenges  beset  schools  and communities  in  their  quest  to  serve  students. Issues differ from school to school. Urbanism and ruralism bring their own special problems. Defeatism, extremism, apathy, or politics infect some  schools.  Schools  can  become  obsessed with  ensuring  predictable  results  or  they  can struggle  to  overcome  the  effects  of  extreme poverty, neglected children, or the burdens of ponderous  bureaucracy.  Money  can  bring  its own  problems.  Some  affluent  communities lobby  for  traditional  definitions  of  success  at the  expense  of  other  needs.  In  some  districts, the teachers and students struggle daily with inadequate and outdated materials and facilities. In some settings, faculty turnover is so frequent

We  believe  that  leadership  is  important, and that the most effective leadership is widely distributed,  informed,  and  deeply  developed. To be adaptive and meet the demands of omnipresent  change  requires  more  than  linear thought,  old  problem-solving  formulas,  and recycled strategic plans. In the work of school improvement, human energy matters as much as  the  elements  of  good  management  domaybe more.

This  book  is  informed  by  the  central  notion  of  adaptivity,  five  principles  of  complex systems,  and  focusing  questions  that  bring attention to the fundamental issues of capacity building in schools. (See sidebar.) These ideas are initially introduced in part I and elaborated in the remaining chapters. They form the conceptual backbone of the chapters and provide a

rationale for the tools and approaches that we present.

The book is designed as a sourcebook to support you in developing and facilitating collaborative groups to improve student learning. You can use it  as  a  basic  text  for  yourself  or with a study group and as a reference book for diagnosis and problem solving. We encourage you  to  choose  the  approaches  that  best  serve your interests and needs.

Read from the beginning to the end. The chapter  content  is  designed  sequentially,  with each chapter building on the preceding ones.

Check the table of contents for an issue of specific  interest  and  read  that  chapter.  It  will provide references to other chapters.

Read the  introduction  to  each  of  the  five parts to overview main ideas in those chapters.

Refer  to  the  problem-based  user's  guide (table  I.1)  to  search  the  text  for  information about specific problems.

A  major  section  of  this  book  is  the  toolkit  of  facilitator  moves  and  strategies,  which makes  up  appendix  A.  Appendix  I  offers  a self-assessment device from which every meeting can be improved.

Adaptive: Change form, clarify identity Schools are complex systems

## Complex systems principles:

More data do not lead to better predictions

Everything influences everything else

Tiny events produce major disturbances

You  don't  have  to  touch  everyone  to make a difference

Both things and energy matter

## Focusing questions:

Who are we?

Why are we doing this?

Why are we doing this this way?

## PART I

## ADAPTIVITY

In all the chaos there is a cosmos, in all disorder, a secret order.

-Carl Jung, 1955

School reform has been a topic of study for much of the history of formal schooling. These generations  of  inquiry  continue  to  influence present practices in both productive and, in many cases,  nonproductive  ways.  Traditional  views and linear designs for organizing learning limit our ability to see schools as complex systems of interacting parts, each influencing the others.

Here we provide a brief history of school improvement efforts. Our thinking is informed by  constructivist  psychology,  quantum  mechanics,  complexity  theory,  fractal  geometry, evolutionary  biology,  and  systems  thinking as  new  ways  of  looking  at  schools.  Here  we address  several  issues:  Why  adaptivity  is  important  to  schools,  what  adaptive  leaders  do to  support  sustainable  change,  and  what  both formal and informal leaders can do to support adaptivity in their schools.

This  opening  section  of  the  book  reveals a  glimpse  of  the  patterns  and  emerging  evolution of thinking related to significant human achievements, including the education of children and youth. We make the case that clockwork thinking  has  driven  most  organizational innovation,  especially  in  the  ways  reformers think  about  school  change.  These  habits  of technical thought guided the exploration of the ancient  world  and  even  now  the  exploration of  space. We propose that newer sciences are revealing a fresh way of thinking about complex organizations, including schools, and offer promise  for  working  with  the  perennial  challenges in schooling. Here we offer a definition of adaptivity, explore its importance to education, and present a short version of how groups operate with it as a driving principle.

We  also  explore  the  limits  of  traditional leadership  and  comment  on  emerging  understandings of the role of the adaptive leader.
