I. Course description and aims
At the core of the DP psychology course is an introduction to three
different approaches to understanding behaviour: the biological,
cognitive and sociocultural approaches. Students study and critically
evaluate the knowledge, concepts, theories and research that have developed the understanding in these fields.
The interaction of these approaches to studying psychology forms the
basis of a holistic and integrated approach to understanding mental
processes and behaviour as a complex, dynamic phenomenon, allowing
students to appreciate the diversity as well as the ­commonality between their own behaviour and that of others.
The contribution and the interaction of the three approaches is
­understood through the four options in the course, focusing on areas of
applied psychology: abnormal psychology, developmental psychology,
health psychology, and the psychology of relationships. The options
provide an opportunity to take what is learned from the study of the
approaches to psychology and apply it to specific lines of inquiry.
Psychologists employ a range of research methods, both qualitative and
quantitative, to test their observations and hypotheses. DP psychology
promotes an understanding of the various approaches to research and
how they are used to critically reflect on the evidence as well as assist
in the design, implementation, analysis and evaluation of the students’
own investigations. Surrounding the approaches and the options are the
overarching themes of research and ethics. A consideration of both is paramount to the nature of the subject.
The aims of the psychology course at SL and at HL are to:
z
z develop an understanding of the biological, cognitive and socio­
cultural factors affecting mental processes and behaviour z
z apply an understanding of the biological, cognitive and ­sociocultural
factors affecting mental processes and behaviour to at least one applied area of study z z understand diverse methods of inquiry z
z understand the importance of ethical practice in psychological
research in general and observe ethical practice in their own inquiries z
z ensure that ethical practices are upheld in all psychological inquiry and discussion z
z develop an awareness of how psychological research can be applied
to address real-world problems and promote positive change z
z provide students with a basis for further study, work and leisure through the use of an additional language z
z foster curiosity, creativity and a lifelong enjoyment of language learning.

The Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19
age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and
inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students
to develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them
to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core. Students study
two modern languages (or a modern language and a classical language), a humanities
or social science subject, an experimental science, mathematics and one of the creative
arts. Instead of an arts subject, students can choose two subjects from another area.
It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma Programme a
demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university
entrance. In each of the academic areas students have flexibility in making their
choices, which means they can choose subjects that particularly interest them and
that they may wish to study further at university.
Normally, three subjects (and not more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and
the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends 240 teaching hours for
HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than at SL.
In addition, three core elements—the extended essay, theory of knowledge and creativity, activity,
service—are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.
This IB DP subject brief has four key components:
