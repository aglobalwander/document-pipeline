## Silence

Some coaches may wait only one or two seconds after having asked a question before they ask another question or give an answer to the question themselves. It is easy to feel that unless someone is talking, no one is learning. In actuality, however, silence is an indicator of a productive conversation. After the coach asks a question or after the partner gives an answer, the ensuing silence (1) communicates respect for the other's reflection and processing time, and (2) results in a positive effect on higher-level cognitive processing.

If the coach waits only a short time-one or two seconds-then a brief, one-word type of response will typically result. On the other hand, if the coach waits for a longer period, teachers tend to respond in whole sentences and complete thoughts. There is a perceptible increase in the creativity of the response as shown by greater use of descriptive and modifying words and an increase in speculative thinking (Rowe 1996). There is also an increased feeling of being valued and respected by the coach.

Coaches can communicate expectation through the use of silence.

When the coach asks a question and then waits for an answer, it

demonstrates that the coach not only expects an answer but also has faith in the other person's ability to perform the complex cognitive task, given enough time. If the coach asks a question, waits only a short time, and then gives the answer or gives hints, it subconsciously communicates that the colleague is inadequate and can't really reason through to an appropriate answer (Good and Brophy 1973).

When the coach pauses after the other person gives an answer, it causes the continuation of thinking about the task or question. Furthermore, when a coach waits after the partner asks a question or gives an answer, it models the same thoughtfulness, reflectiveness, and restraint of impulsivity that are desirable behaviors for others to use (Rowe 1986).

To view an example of wait time, please go to www.thinkingcollaborative.com/supportingaudio-videos 3-2/. The coach, Carolee, uses wait time after having asked Kris a question (Wait time 1). Chris processes internally for over seven seconds before responding the first time. In response to a second question, Chris reflects nearly as long before responding. These responses are consistent with Rowe's research showing that wait time of three to five seconds elicits deeper thinking.
