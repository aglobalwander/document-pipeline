The IB Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous, academically challenging and
balanced programme of education designed to prepare students aged 16 to 19
for success at university and life beyond. The DP aims to encourage students to be
knowledgeable, inquiring, caring and compassionate, and to develop intercultural
understanding, open-mindedness and the attitudes necessary to respect and evalu ate a range of viewpoints. Approaches to teaching and learning (ATL) within the DP
are deliberate strategies, skills and attitudes that permeate the teaching and learning
environment. In the DP students develop skills from five ATL categories: thinking,
research, social, self-management and communication.
To ensure both breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding, students must
choose at least one subject from five groups: 1) their best language, 2) additional lan guage(s), 3) social sciences, 4) experimental sciences, and 5) mathematics. Students
may choose either an arts subject from group 6, or a second subject from groups
1 to 5. At least three and not more than four subjects are taken at higher level (240
recommended teaching hours), while the remaining are taken at standard level (150
recommended teaching hours). In addition, three core elements—the extended
essay, theory of knowledge and creativity, action, service—
are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.

I. Course description and aims
The IB Diploma Programme visual arts course encourages students to
challenge their own creative and cultural expectations and boundaries.
It is a thought-provoking course in which students develop analytical
skills in problem-solving and divergent thinking, while working towards
technical proficiency and confidence as art-makers. In addition to
exploring and comparing visual arts from different perspectives and in
different contexts, students are expected to engage in, experiment with
and critically reflect upon a wide range of contemporary practices and
media. The course is designed for students who want to go on to study
visual arts in higher education as well as for those who are seeking lifelong enrichment through visual arts.
The role of visual arts teachers should be to actively and carefully
organize learning experiences for the students, directing their study
to enable them to reach their potential and satisfy the demands of
the course. Students should be empowered to become autonomous, informed and skilled visual artists.
The aims of the arts subjects are to enable students to:
1.	 enjoy lifelong engagement with the arts
2.	 become informed, reflective and critical practitioners in the arts
3.	 understand the dynamic and changing nature of the arts
4.	 explore and value the diversity of the arts across time, place and cultures
5.	 express ideas with confidence and competence
6.	 develop perceptual and analytical skills.
In addition, the aims of the visual arts course at SL and HL are to enable
students to:
7.	 make artwork that is influenced by personal and cultural contexts
8.	 become informed and critical observers and makers of visual culture and media
9.	 develop skills, techniques and processes in order to communicate concepts and ideas.

Visual arts methods • Look at different techniques for making art.
• Investigate and compare how and why different techniques have evolved and the processes involved.
• Experiment with diverse media and explore techniques for making art.
• Develop concepts through processes informed by skills, techniques and media.
• Evaluate how their ongoing work communicates meaning and purpose.
• Consider the nature of “exhibition” and think about the process of selection and the potential impact of their work on different audiences.
50
Communicating visual arts • Explore ways of communicating through visual and written means.
• Make artistic choices about how to most effectively communicate knowledge and understanding.
• Produce a body of artwork through a process of reflection and evaluation, showing a synthesis of skill, media and concept.
• Select and present resolved works for exhibition.
• Explain the ways in which the works are connected.
• Discuss how artistic judgments impact the overall presentation.
50
Throughout the course students are required to maintain a visual arts
journal. Although sections of the journal will be selected, adapted and
presented for assessment, the journal itself is not directly assessed or
moderated. It is, however, regarded as a fundamental activity of the course.
III. Assessment model
Having followed the visual arts course, students are expected to:

2.	 Demonstrate application and analysis of knowledge and under standing
• Express concepts, ideas and meaning through visual communication
• Analyse artworks from a variety of different contexts
• Apply knowledge and understanding of skills, techniques,  media, forms and processes related to art-making
3.	 Demonstrate synthesis and evaluation
• Critically analyse and discuss artworks created by themselves and
others and articulate an informed personal response
• Formulate personal intentions for the planning, development and
making of artworks that consider how meaning can be conveyed to an audience
• Demonstrate the use of critical reflection to highlight success and failure in order to progress work
• Evaluate how and why art-making evolves and justify the choices made in their own visual practice
4.	 Select, use and apply a variety of appropriate skills and techniques
