Introduction
Toward greater focus and coherence
Mathematics experiences in early childhood settings should concentrate on
(1) number (which includes whole number, operations, and relations) and (2)
geometry, spatial relations, and measurement, with more mathematics learning
time devoted to number than to other topics. Mathematical process goals should be integrated in these content areas.
­— Mathematics Learning in Early Childhood, National Research Council, 2009
The composite standards [of Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore] have a number
of features that can inform an international benchmarking process for the
development of K–6 mathematics standards in the U.S. First, the composite
standards concentrate the early learning of mathematics on the number,
measurement, and geometry strands with less emphasis on data analysis and
little exposure to algebra. The Hong Kong standards for grades 1–3 devote
approximately half the targeted time to numbers and almost all the time remaining to geometry and measurement.
— Ginsburg, Leinwand and Decker, 2009
Because the mathematics concepts in [U.S.] textbooks are often weak, the
presentation becomes more mechanical than is ideal. We looked at both
traditional and non-traditional textbooks used in the US and found this conceptual weakness in both.
— Ginsburg et al., 2005
There are many ways to organize curricula. The challenge, now rarely met, is to
avoid those that distort mathematics and turn off students.
— Steen, 2007
For over a decade, research studies of mathematics education in high-performing
countries have pointed to the conclusion that the mathematics curriculum in the
United States must become substantially more focused and coherent in order to
improve mathematics achievement in this country. To deliver on the promise of
common standards, the standards must address the problem of a curriculum that
is “a mile wide and an inch deep.” These Standards are a substantial answer to that challenge.
It is important to recognize that “fewer standards” are no substitute for focused
standards. Achieving “fewer standards” would be easy to do by resorting to broad,
general statements. Instead, these Standards aim for clarity and specificity.
Assessing the coherence of a set of standards is more difficult than assessing
their focus. William Schmidt and Richard Houang (2002) have said that content standards and curricula are coherent if they are:
articulated over time as a sequence of topics and performances that are
logical and reflect, where appropriate, the sequential or hierarchical nature
of the disciplinary content from which the subject matter derives. That is,
what and how students are taught should reflect not only the topics that fall
within a certain academic discipline, but also the key ideas that determine
how knowledge is organized and generated within that discipline. This implies

=== Page 4 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS
INTRODUCTION   |   4
that to be coherent, a set of content standards must evolve from particulars
(e.g., the meaning and operations of whole numbers, including simple math
facts and routine computational procedures associated with whole numbers
and fractions) to deeper structures inherent in the discipline. These deeper
structures then serve as a means for connecting the particulars (such as an
understanding of the rational number system and its properties). (emphasis added)
These Standards endeavor to follow such a design, not only by stressing conceptual
understanding of key ideas, but also by continually returning to organizing
principles such as place value or the properties of operations to structure those ideas.
In addition, the “sequence of topics and performances” that is outlined in a body of
mathematics standards must also respect what is known about how students learn.
As Confrey (2007) points out, developing “sequenced obstacles and challenges
for students…absent the insights about meaning that derive from careful study of
learning, would be unfortunate and unwise.” In recognition of this, the development
of these Standards began with research-based learning progressions detailing
what is known today about how students’ mathematical knowledge, skill, and understanding develop over time.
Understanding mathematics
These Standards define what students should understand and be able to do in
their study of mathematics. Asking a student to understand something means
asking a teacher to assess whether the student has understood it. But what does
mathematical understanding look like? One hallmark of mathematical understanding
is the ability to justify, in a way appropriate to the student’s mathematical maturity,
why a particular mathematical statement is true or where a mathematical rule
comes from. There is a world of difference between a student who can summon a
mnemonic device to expand a product such as (a + b)(x + y) and a student who
can explain where the mnemonic comes from. The student who can explain the rule
understands the mathematics, and may have a better chance to succeed at a less
familiar task such as expanding (a + b + c)(x + y). Mathematical understanding and
procedural skill are equally important, and both are assessable using mathematical tasks of sufficient richness.
The Standards set grade-specific standards but do not define the intervention
methods or materials necessary to support students who are well below or well
above grade-level expectations. It is also beyond the scope of the Standards to
define the full range of supports appropriate for English language learners and
for students with special needs. At the same time, all students must have the
opportunity to learn and meet the same high standards if they are to access the
knowledge and skills necessary in their post-school lives. The Standards should
be read as allowing for the widest possible range of students to participate fully
from the outset, along with appropriate accommodations to ensure maximum
participaton of students with special education needs. For example, for students
with disabilities reading should allow for use of Braille, screen reader technology, or
other assistive devices, while writing should include the use of a scribe, computer,
or speech-to-text technology. In a similar vein, speaking and listening should be
interpreted broadly to include sign language. No set of grade-specific standards
can fully reflect the great variety in abilities, needs, learning rates, and achievement
levels of students in any given classroom. However, the Standards do provide clear
signposts along the way to the goal of college and career readiness for all students.
The Standards begin on page 6 with eight Standards for Mathematical Practice.

How to read the grade level standards
Standards define what students should understand and be able to do.
Clusters are groups of related standards. Note that standards from different clusters
may sometimes be closely related, because mathematics is a connected subject.
Domains are larger groups of related standards. Standards from different domains may sometimes be closely related.
Number and Operations in Base Ten
3.NBT
Use place value understanding and properties of operations to perform multi-digit arithmetic.
1.
Use place value understanding to round whole numbers to the nearest 10 or 100.
2. Fluently add and subtract within 1000 using strategies and algorithms
based on place value, properties of operations, and/or the relationship between addition and subtraction.
3. Multiply one-digit whole numbers by multiples of 10 in the range
10-90 (e.g., 9 × 80, 5 × 60) using strategies based on place value and properties of operations.
These Standards do not dictate curriculum or teaching methods. For example, just
because topic A appears before topic B in the standards for a given grade, it does
not necessarily mean that topic A must be taught before topic B. A teacher might
prefer to teach topic B before topic A, or might choose to highlight connections by
teaching topic A and topic B at the same time. Or, a teacher might prefer to teach a
topic of his or her own choosing that leads, as a byproduct, to students reaching the standards for topics A and B.
What students can learn at any particular grade level depends upon what they
have learned before. Ideally then, each standard in this document might have been
phrased in the form, “Students who already know ... should next come to learn ....”
But at present this approach is unrealistic—not least because existing education
research cannot specify all such learning pathways.  Of necessity therefore,
grade placements for specific topics have been made on the basis of state and
international comparisons and the collective experience and collective professional
judgment of educators, researchers and mathematicians. One promise of common
state standards is that over time they will allow research on learning progressions
to inform and improve the design of standards to a much greater extent than is
possible today. Learning opportunities will continue to vary across schools and
school systems, and educators should make every effort to meet the needs of
individual students based on their current understanding.
These Standards are not intended to be new names for old ways of doing business.
They are a call to take the next step. It is time for states to work together to build
on lessons learned from two decades of standards based reforms. It is time to
recognize that standards are not just promises to our children, but promises we intend to keep.

Mathematics | Standards for Mathematical Practice
The Standards for Mathematical Practice describe varieties of expertise that
mathematics educators at all levels should seek to develop in their students.
These practices rest on important “processes and proficiencies” with longstanding
importance in mathematics education. The first of these are the NCTM process
standards of problem solving, reasoning and proof, communication, representation,
and connections. The second are the strands of mathematical proficiency specified
in the National Research Council’s report Adding It Up: adaptive reasoning, strategic
competence, conceptual understanding (comprehension of mathematical concepts,
operations and relations), procedural fluency (skill in carrying out procedures
flexibly, accurately, efficiently and appropriately), and productive disposition
(habitual inclination to see mathematics as sensible, useful, and worthwhile, coupled
with a belief in diligence and one’s own efficacy).
1   Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
Mathematically proficient students start by explaining to themselves the meaning
of a problem and looking for entry points to its solution. They analyze givens,
constraints, relationships, and goals. They make conjectures about the form and
meaning of the solution and plan a solution pathway rather than simply jumping into
a solution attempt. They consider analogous problems, and try special cases and
simpler forms of the original problem in order to gain insight into its solution. They
monitor and evaluate their progress and change course if necessary. Older students
might, depending on the context of the problem, transform algebraic expressions or
change the viewing window on their graphing calculator to get the information they
need. Mathematically proficient students can explain correspondences between
equations, verbal descriptions, tables, and graphs or draw diagrams of important
features and relationships, graph data, and search for regularity or trends. Younger
students might rely on using concrete objects or pictures to help conceptualize
and solve a problem. Mathematically proficient students check their answers to
problems using a different method, and they continually ask themselves, “Does this
make sense?” They can understand the approaches of others to solving complex
problems and identify correspondences between different approaches.
2   Reason abstractly and quantitatively.
Mathematically proficient students make sense of quantities and their relationships
in problem situations. They bring two complementary abilities to bear on problems
involving quantitative relationships: the ability to decontextualize—to abstract
a given situation and represent it symbolically and manipulate the representing
symbols as if they have a life of their own, without necessarily attending to
their referents—and the ability to contextualize, to pause as needed during the
manipulation process in order to probe into the referents for the symbols involved.
Quantitative reasoning entails habits of creating a coherent representation of
the problem at hand; considering the units involved; attending to the meaning of
quantities, not just how to compute them; and knowing and flexibly using different properties of operations and objects.
3   Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.
Mathematically proficient students understand and use stated assumptions,
definitions, and previously established results in constructing arguments. They
make conjectures and build a logical progression of statements to explore the
truth of their conjectures. They are able to analyze situations by breaking them into
cases, and can recognize and use counterexamples. They justify their conclusions,

=== Page 7 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS standards for mathematical practice   |   7
communicate them to others, and respond to the arguments of others. They reason
inductively about data, making plausible arguments that take into account the
context from which the data arose. Mathematically proficient students are also able
to compare the effectiveness of two plausible arguments, distinguish correct logic or
reasoning from that which is flawed, and—if there is a flaw in an argument—explain
what it is. Elementary students can construct arguments using concrete referents
such as objects, drawings, diagrams, and actions. Such arguments can make sense
and be correct, even though they are not generalized or made formal until later
grades. Later, students learn to determine domains to which an argument applies.
Students at all grades can listen or read the arguments of others, decide whether
they make sense, and ask useful questions to clarify or improve the arguments.
4   Model with mathematics.
Mathematically proficient students can apply the mathematics they know to solve
problems arising in everyday life, society, and the workplace. In early grades, this might
be as simple as writing an addition equation to describe a situation. In middle grades,
a student might apply proportional reasoning to plan a school event or analyze a
problem in the community. By high school, a student might use geometry to solve a
design problem or use a function to describe how one quantity of interest depends
on another. Mathematically proficient students who can apply what they know are
comfortable making assumptions and approximations to simplify a complicated
situation, realizing that these may need revision later. They are able to identify
important quantities in a practical situation and map their relationships using such
tools as diagrams, two-way tables, graphs, flowcharts and formulas. They can analyze
those relationships mathematically to draw conclusions. They routinely interpret their
mathematical results in the context of the situation and reflect on whether the results
make sense, possibly improving the model if it has not served its purpose.
5   Use appropriate tools strategically.
Mathematically proficient students consider the available tools when solving a
mathematical problem. These tools might include pencil and paper, concrete
models, a ruler, a protractor, a calculator, a spreadsheet, a computer algebra system,
a statistical package, or dynamic geometry software. Proficient students are
sufficiently familiar with tools appropriate for their grade or course to make sound
decisions about when each of these tools might be helpful, recognizing both the
insight to be gained and their limitations. For example, mathematically proficient
high school students analyze graphs of functions and solutions generated using a
graphing calculator. They detect possible errors by strategically using estimation
and other mathematical knowledge. When making mathematical models, they know
that technology can enable them to visualize the results of varying assumptions,
explore consequences, and compare predictions with data. Mathematically
proficient students at various grade levels are able to identify relevant external
mathematical resources, such as digital content located on a website, and use them
to pose or solve problems. They are able to use technological tools to explore and deepen their understanding of concepts.
6   Attend to precision.
Mathematically proficient students try to communicate precisely to others. They
try to use clear definitions in discussion with others and in their own reasoning.
They state the meaning of the symbols they choose, including using the equal sign
consistently and appropriately. They are careful about specifying units of measure,
and labeling axes to clarify the correspondence with quantities in a problem. They
calculate accurately and efficiently, express numerical answers with a degree of
precision appropriate for the problem context. In the elementary grades, students
give carefully formulated explanations to each other. By the time they reach high
school they have learned to examine claims and make explicit use of definitions.

=== Page 8 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS standards for mathematical practice   |   8 7   Look for and make use of structure.
Mathematically proficient students look closely to discern a pattern or structure.
Young students, for example, might notice that three and seven more is the same
amount as seven and three more, or they may sort a collection of shapes according
to how many sides the shapes have. Later, students will see 7 × 8 equals the
well remembered 7 × 5 + 7 × 3, in preparation for learning about the distributive
property. In the expression x2 + 9x + 14, older students can see the 14 as 2 × 7 and
the 9 as 2 + 7. They recognize the significance of an existing line in a geometric
figure and can use the strategy of drawing an auxiliary line for solving problems.
They also can step back for an overview and shift perspective. They can see
complicated things, such as some algebraic expressions, as single objects or as
being composed of several objects. For example, they can see 5 – 3(x – y)2 as 5
minus a positive number times a square and use that to realize that its value cannot be more than 5 for any real numbers x and y.
8   Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.
Mathematically proficient students notice if calculations are repeated, and look
both for general methods and for shortcuts. Upper elementary students might
notice when dividing 25 by 11 that they are repeating the same calculations over
and over again, and conclude they have a repeating decimal. By paying attention
to the calculation of slope as they repeatedly check whether points are on the line
through (1, 2) with slope 3, middle school students might abstract the equation
(y – 2)/(x – 1) = 3. Noticing the regularity in the way terms cancel when expanding
(x – 1)(x + 1), (x – 1)(x2 + x + 1), and (x – 1)(x3 + x2 + x + 1) might lead them to the
general formula for the sum of a geometric series. As they work to solve a problem,
mathematically proficient students maintain oversight of the process, while
attending to the details. They continually evaluate the reasonableness of their intermediate results.
Connecting the Standards for Mathematical Practice to the Standards for Mathematical Content
The Standards for Mathematical Practice describe ways in which developing student
practitioners of the discipline of mathematics increasingly ought to engage with
the subject matter as they grow in mathematical maturity and expertise throughout
the elementary, middle and high school years. Designers of curricula, assessments,
and professional development should all attend to the need to connect the
mathematical practices to mathematical content in mathematics instruction.
The Standards for Mathematical Content are a balanced combination of procedure
and understanding. Expectations that begin with the word “understand” are often
especially good opportunities to connect the practices to the content. Students
who lack understanding of a topic may rely on procedures too heavily. Without
a flexible base from which to work, they may be less likely to consider analogous
problems, represent problems coherently, justify conclusions, apply the mathematics
to practical situations, use technology mindfully to work with the mathematics,
explain the mathematics accurately to other students, step back for an overview, or
deviate from a known procedure to find a shortcut. In short, a lack of understanding
effectively prevents a student from engaging in the mathematical practices.
In this respect, those content standards which set an expectation of understanding
are potential “points of intersection” between the Standards for Mathematical
Content and the Standards for Mathematical Practice. These points of intersection
are intended to be weighted toward central and generative concepts in the
school mathematics curriculum that most merit the time, resources, innovative
energies, and focus necessary to qualitatively improve the curriculum, instruction,
assessment, professional development, and student achievement in mathematics.

KINDERGARTEN   |   9
Mathematics | Kindergarten
In Kindergarten, instructional time should focus on two critical areas: (1)
representing, relating, and operating on whole numbers, initially with
sets of objects; (2) describing shapes and space. More learning time in
Kindergarten should be devoted to number than to other topics.
(1) Students use numbers, including written numerals, to represent
quantities and to solve quantitative problems, such as counting objects in
a set; counting out a given number of objects; comparing sets or numerals;
and modeling simple joining and separating situations with sets of objects,
or eventually with equations such as 5 + 2 = 7 and 7 – 2 = 5. (Kindergarten
students should see addition and subtraction equations, and student
writing of equations in kindergarten is encouraged, but it is not required.)
Students choose, combine, and apply effective strategies for answering
quantitative questions, including quickly recognizing the cardinalities of
small sets of objects, counting and producing sets of given sizes, counting
the number of objects in combined sets, or counting the number of objects that remain in a set after some are taken away.
(2) Students describe their physical world using geometric ideas (e.g.,
shape, orientation, spatial relations) and vocabulary. They identify, name,
and describe basic two-dimensional shapes, such as squares, triangles,
circles, rectangles, and hexagons, presented in a variety of ways (e.g., with
different sizes and orientations), as well as three-dimensional shapes such
as cubes, cones, cylinders, and spheres. They use basic shapes and spatial
reasoning to model objects in their environment and to construct more complex shapes.

2. Correctly name shapes regardless of their orientations or overall size.
3. Identify shapes as two-dimensional (lying in a plane, “flat”) or three dimensional (“solid”).
Analyze, compare, create, and compose shapes.
4. Analyze and compare two- and three-dimensional shapes, in
different sizes and orientations, using informal language to describe

=== Page 13 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS grade 1   |   13
Mathematics | Grade 1
In Grade 1, instructional time should focus on four critical areas: (1)
developing understanding of addition, subtraction, and strategies for
addition and subtraction within 20; (2) developing understanding of whole
number relationships and place value, including grouping in tens and
ones; (3) developing understanding of linear measurement and measuring
lengths as iterating length units; and (4) reasoning about attributes of, and composing and decomposing geometric shapes.
(1) Students develop strategies for adding and subtracting whole numbers
based on their prior work with small numbers. They use a variety of models,
including discrete objects and length-based models (e.g., cubes connected
to form lengths), to model add-to, take-from, put-together, take-apart, and
compare situations to develop meaning for the operations of addition and
subtraction, and to develop strategies to solve arithmetic problems with
these operations. Students understand connections between counting
and addition and subtraction (e.g., adding two is the same as counting on
two). They use properties of addition to add whole numbers and to create
and use increasingly sophisticated strategies based on these properties
(e.g., “making tens”) to solve addition and subtraction problems within
20. By comparing a variety of solution strategies, children build their
understanding of the relationship between addition and subtraction.
(2) Students develop, discuss, and use efficient, accurate, and generalizable
methods to add within 100 and subtract multiples of 10. They compare
whole numbers (at least to 100) to develop understanding of and solve
problems involving their relative sizes. They think of whole numbers
between 10 and 100 in terms of tens and ones (especially recognizing the
numbers 11 to 19 as composed of a ten and some ones). Through activities
that build number sense, they understand the order of the counting numbers and their relative magnitudes.
(3) Students develop an understanding of the meaning and processes of
measurement, including underlying concepts such as iterating (the mental
activity of building up the length of an object with equal-sized units) and
the transitivity principle for indirect measurement.1
(4) Students compose and decompose plane or solid figures (e.g., put
two triangles together to make a quadrilateral) and build understanding
of part-whole relationships as well as the properties of the original and
composite shapes. As they combine shapes, they recognize them from
different perspectives and orientations, describe their geometric attributes,
and determine how they are alike and different, to develop the background
for measurement and for initial understandings of properties such as congruence and symmetry.
1Students should apply the principle of transitivity of measurement to make indirect
comparisons, but they need not use this technical term.

Operations and Algebraic Thinking
1.OA
Represent and solve problems involving addition and subtraction.
1.
Use addition and subtraction within 20 to solve word problems involving
situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart,
and comparing, with unknowns in all positions, e.g., by using objects,
drawings, and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.2
2. Solve word problems that call for addition of three whole numbers
whose sum is less than or equal to 20, e.g., by using objects, drawings,
and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.
Understand and apply properties of operations and the relationship between addition and subtraction.
3. Apply properties of operations as strategies to add and subtract.3 Examples:
If 8 + 3 = 11 is known, then 3 + 8 = 11 is also known. (Commutative property of
addition.)  To add 2 + 6 + 4, the second two numbers can be added to make
a ten, so 2 + 6 + 4 = 2 + 10 = 12. (Associative property of addition.)
4. Understand subtraction as an unknown-addend problem. For example,
subtract 10 – 8 by finding the number that makes 10 when added to 8.
Add and subtract within 20.
5. Relate counting to addition and subtraction (e.g., by counting on 2 to add 2).
6. Add and subtract within 20, demonstrating fluency for addition and
subtraction within 10. Use strategies such as counting on; making ten
(e.g., 8 + 6 = 8 + 2 + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14); decomposing a number leading to
a ten (e.g., 13 – 4 = 13 – 3 – 1 = 10 – 1 = 9); using the relationship between
addition and subtraction (e.g., knowing that 8 + 4 = 12, one knows 12 – 8
= 4); and creating equivalent but easier or known sums (e.g., adding 6 +
7 by creating the known equivalent 6 + 6 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13).
Work with addition and subtraction equations.
7. Understand the meaning of the equal sign, and determine if equations
involving addition and subtraction are true or false. For example, which
of the following equations are true and which are false? 6 = 6, 7 = 8 – 1, 5 + 2 = 2 + 5, 4 + 1 = 5 + 2.
8. Determine the unknown whole number in an addition or subtraction
equation relating three whole numbers. For example, determine the

1.
Order three objects by length; compare the lengths of two objects indirectly by using a third object.
2. Express the length of an object as a whole number of length units, by
laying multiple copies of a shorter object (the length unit) end to end;

the shares using the words halves, fourths, and quarters, and use the
phrases half of, fourth of, and quarter of. Describe the whole as two of,

Mathematics | Grade 2
In Grade 2, instructional time should focus on four critical areas: (1)
extending understanding of base-ten notation; (2) building fluency with
addition and subtraction; (3) using standard units of measure; and (4) describing and analyzing shapes.
(1) Students extend their understanding of the base-ten system. This
includes ideas of counting in fives, tens, and multiples of hundreds, tens,
and ones, as well as number relationships involving these units, including
comparing. Students understand multi-digit numbers (up to 1000) written
in base-ten notation, recognizing that the digits in each place represent
amounts of thousands, hundreds, tens, or ones (e.g., 853 is 8 hundreds + 5 tens + 3 ones).
(2) Students use their understanding of addition to develop fluency with
addition and subtraction within 100. They solve problems within 1000
by applying their understanding of models for addition and subtraction,
and they develop, discuss, and use efficient, accurate, and generalizable
methods to compute sums and differences of whole numbers in base-ten
notation, using their understanding of place value and the properties of
operations. They select and accurately apply methods that are appropriate
for the context and the numbers involved to mentally calculate sums and
differences for numbers with only tens or only hundreds.
(3) Students recognize the need for standard units of measure (centimeter
and inch) and they use rulers and other measurement tools with the
understanding that linear measure involves an iteration of units. They
recognize that the smaller the unit, the more iterations they need to cover a given length.
(4) Students describe and analyze shapes by examining their sides and
angles. Students investigate, describe, and reason about decomposing
and combining shapes to make other shapes. Through building, drawing,
and analyzing two- and three-dimensional shapes, students develop a
foundation for understanding area, volume, congruence, similarity, and symmetry in later grades.

Mathematics | Grade 3
In Grade 3, instructional time should focus on four critical areas:  (1)
developing understanding of multiplication and division and strategies
for multiplication and division within 100; (2) developing understanding
of fractions, especially unit fractions (fractions with numerator 1); (3)
developing understanding of the structure of rectangular arrays and of
area; and (4) describing and analyzing two-dimensional shapes.
(1) Students develop an understanding of the meanings of multiplication
and division of whole numbers through activities and problems involving
equal-sized groups, arrays, and area models; multiplication is finding
an unknown product, and division is finding an unknown factor in these
situations. For equal-sized group situations, division can require finding
the unknown number of groups or the unknown group size. Students use
properties of operations to calculate products of whole numbers, using
increasingly sophisticated strategies based on these properties to solve
multiplication and division problems involving single-digit factors. By
comparing a variety of solution strategies, students learn the relationship between multiplication and division.
(2) Students develop an understanding of fractions, beginning with
unit fractions. Students view fractions in general as being built out of
unit fractions, and they use fractions along with visual fraction models
to represent parts of a whole. Students understand that the size of a
fractional part is relative to the size of the whole. For example, 1/2 of the
paint in a small bucket could be less paint than 1/3 of the paint in a larger
bucket, but 1/3 of a ribbon is longer than 1/5 of the same ribbon because
when the ribbon is divided into 3 equal parts, the parts are longer than
when the ribbon is divided into 5 equal parts. Students are able to use
fractions to represent numbers equal to, less than, and greater than one.
They solve problems that involve comparing fractions by using visual
fraction models and strategies based on noticing equal numerators or denominators.
(3) Students recognize area as an attribute of two-dimensional regions.
They measure the area of a shape by finding the total number of same size units of area required to cover the shape without gaps or overlaps,
a square with sides of unit length being the standard unit for measuring
area. Students understand that rectangular arrays can be decomposed into
identical rows or into identical columns. By decomposing rectangles into
rectangular arrays of squares, students connect area to multiplication, and
justify using multiplication to determine the area of a rectangle.
(4) Students describe, analyze, and compare properties of two dimensional shapes. They compare and classify shapes by their sides and
angles, and connect these with definitions of shapes. Students also relate
their fraction work to geometry by expressing the area of part of a shape as a unit fraction of the whole.

3.OA
Represent and solve problems involving multiplication and division.
1.

number of objects in 5 groups of 7 objects each. For example, describe
a context in which a total number of objects can be expressed as 5 × 7.
2. Interpret whole-number quotients of whole numbers, e.g., interpret
56 ÷ 8 as the number of objects in each share when 56 objects are
partitioned equally into 8 shares, or as a number of shares when
56 objects are partitioned into equal shares of 8 objects each. For
example, describe a context in which a number of shares or a number of groups can be expressed as 56 ÷ 8.
3. Use multiplication and division within 100 to solve word problems in
situations involving equal groups, arrays, and measurement quantities,
e.g., by using drawings and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.1

× ? = 48, 5 = Í ÷ 3, 6 × 6 = ?.
Understand properties of multiplication and the relationship between multiplication and division.
5. Apply properties of operations as strategies to multiply and
divide.2 Examples: If 6 × 4 = 24 is known, then 4 × 6 = 24 is also known.
(Commutative property of multiplication.) 3 × 5 × 2 can be found by 3
× 5 = 15, then 15 × 2 = 30, or by 5 × 2 = 10, then 3 × 10 = 30. (Associative
property of multiplication.) Knowing that 8 × 5 = 40 and 8 × 2 = 16, one
can find 8 × 7 as 8 × (5 + 2) = (8 × 5) + (8 × 2) = 40 + 16 = 56. (Distributive property.)
6. Understand division as an unknown-factor problem. For example, find
32 ÷ 8 by finding the number that makes 32 when multiplied by 8.
Multiply and divide within 100.
7. Fluently multiply and divide within 100, using strategies such as the
relationship between multiplication and division (e.g., knowing that 8 ×
5 = 40, one knows 40 ÷ 5 = 8) or properties of operations. By the end
of Grade 3, know from memory all products of two one-digit numbers.
Solve problems involving the four operations, and identify and explain patterns in arithmetic.
8. Solve two-step word problems using the four operations. Represent
these problems using equations with a letter standing for the
unknown quantity. Assess the reasonableness of answers using mental
computation and estimation strategies including rounding.3
9. Identify arithmetic patterns (including patterns in the addition table or
multiplication table), and explain them using properties of operations.
For example, observe that 4 times a number is always even, and explain
why 4 times a number can be decomposed into two equal addends.
1See Glossary, Table 2.
2Students need not use formal terms for these properties.
3This standard is limited to problems posed with whole numbers and having whole number answers; students should know how to perform operations in the conven tional order when there are no parentheses to specify a particular order (Order of Operations).

whole is partitioned into b equal parts; understand a fraction a/b as the quantity formed by a parts of size 1/b.
2. Understand a fraction as a number on the number line; represent fractions on a number line diagram.
a.	 Represent a fraction 1/b on a number line diagram by defining the
interval from 0 to 1 as the whole and partitioning it into b equal
parts. Recognize that each part has size 1/b and that the endpoint
of the part based at 0 locates the number 1/b on the number line.
b.	 Represent a fraction a/b on a number line diagram by marking off
a lengths 1/b from 0. Recognize that the resulting interval has size
a/b and that its endpoint locates the number a/b on the number line.
3. Explain equivalence of fractions in special cases, and compare fractions by reasoning about their size.
a.	 Understand two fractions as equivalent (equal) if they are the same size, or the same point on a number line.
b.	 Recognize and generate simple equivalent fractions, e.g., 1/2 =
2/4, 4/6 = 2/3. Explain why the fractions are equivalent, e.g., by using a visual fraction model.
c.	 Express whole numbers as fractions, and recognize fractions that
are equivalent to whole numbers. Examples: Express 3 in the form
3 = 3/1; recognize that 6/1 = 6; locate 4/4 and 1 at the same point of a number line diagram.
d.	 Compare two fractions with the same numerator or the same
denominator by reasoning about their size. Recognize that
comparisons are valid only when the two fractions refer to the

Represent and interpret data.
3. Draw a scaled picture graph and a scaled bar graph to represent a

5. Recognize area as an attribute of plane figures and understand concepts of area measurement.
a. A square with side length 1 unit, called “a unit square,” is said to

b. A plane figure which can be covered without gaps or overlaps by
n unit squares is said to have an area of n square units.
6. Measure areas by counting unit squares (square cm, square m, square in, square ft, and improvised units).
7. Relate area to the operations of multiplication and addition.
a. Find the area of a rectangle with whole-number side lengths by
tiling it, and show that the area is the same as would be found by multiplying the side lengths.
b. Multiply side lengths to find areas of rectangles with whole number side lengths in the context of solving real world and

Reason with shapes and their attributes.
1.
Understand that shapes in different categories (e.g., rhombuses,
rectangles, and others) may share attributes (e.g., having four sides),
and that the shared attributes can define a larger category (e.g.,
quadrilaterals). Recognize rhombuses, rectangles, and squares as
examples of quadrilaterals, and draw examples of quadrilaterals that do not belong to any of these subcategories.
2. Partition shapes into parts with equal areas. Express the area of each
part as a unit fraction of the whole. For example, partition a shape into 4
parts with equal area, and describe the area of each part as 1/4 of the area of the shape.

Mathematics | Grade 4
In Grade 4, instructional time should focus on three critical areas: (1)
developing understanding and fluency with multi-digit multiplication,
and developing understanding of dividing to find quotients involving
multi-digit dividends; (2) developing an understanding of fraction
equivalence, addition and subtraction of fractions with like denominators,
and multiplication of fractions by whole numbers; (3) understanding
that geometric figures can be analyzed and classified based on their
properties, such as having parallel sides, perpendicular sides, particular angle measures, and symmetry.
(1) Students generalize their understanding of place value to 1,000,000,
understanding the relative sizes of numbers in each place. They apply their
understanding of models for multiplication (equal-sized groups, arrays,
area models), place value, and properties of operations, in particular the
distributive property, as they develop, discuss, and use efficient, accurate,
and generalizable methods to compute products of multi-digit whole
numbers. Depending on the numbers and the context, they select and
accurately apply appropriate methods to estimate or mentally calculate
products. They develop fluency with efficient procedures for multiplying
whole numbers; understand and explain why the procedures work based on
place value and properties of operations; and use them to solve problems.
Students apply their understanding of models for division, place value,
properties of operations, and the relationship of division to multiplication
as they develop, discuss, and use efficient, accurate, and generalizable
procedures to find quotients involving multi-digit dividends. They select
and accurately apply appropriate methods to estimate and mentally
calculate quotients, and interpret remainders based upon the context.
(2) Students develop understanding of fraction equivalence and
operations with fractions. They recognize that two different fractions can
be equal (e.g., 15/9 = 5/3), and they develop methods for generating and
recognizing equivalent fractions. Students extend previous understandings
about how fractions are built from unit fractions, composing fractions
from unit fractions, decomposing fractions into unit fractions, and using
the meaning of fractions and the meaning of multiplication to multiply a fraction by a whole number.
(3) Students describe, analyze, compare, and classify two-dimensional
shapes. Through building, drawing, and analyzing two-dimensional shapes,
students deepen their understanding of properties of two-dimensional

Operations and Algebraic Thinking
4.OA
Use the four operations with whole numbers to solve problems.
1.
Interpret a multiplication equation as a comparison, e.g., interpret 35
= 5 × 7 as a statement that 35 is 5 times as many as 7 and 7 times as
many as 5. Represent verbal statements of multiplicative comparisons as multiplication equations.
2. Multiply or divide to solve word problems involving multiplicative
comparison, e.g., by using drawings and equations with a symbol
for the unknown number to represent the problem, distinguishing
multiplicative comparison from additive comparison.1
3. Solve multistep word problems posed with whole numbers and having
whole-number answers using the four operations, including problems
in which remainders must be interpreted. Represent these problems
using equations with a letter standing for the unknown quantity.
Assess the reasonableness of answers using mental computation and estimation strategies including rounding.
Gain familiarity with factors and multiples.
4. Find all factor pairs for a whole number in the range 1–100. Recognize
that a whole number is a multiple of each of its factors. Determine
whether a given whole number in the range 1–100 is a multiple of a
given one-digit number. Determine whether a given whole number in the range 1–100 is prime or composite.
Generate and analyze patterns.
5. Generate a number or shape pattern that follows a given rule. Identify
apparent features of the pattern that were not explicit in the rule itself.
For example, given the rule “Add 3” and the starting number 1, generate
terms in the resulting sequence and observe that the terms appear to
alternate between odd and even numbers. Explain informally why the numbers will continue to alternate in this way.
Number and Operations in Base Ten2
4.NBT
Generalize place value understanding for multi-digit whole numbers.
1.
Recognize that in a multi-digit whole number, a digit in one place
represents ten times what it represents in the place to its right. For
example, recognize that 700 ÷ 70 = 10 by applying concepts of place value and division.
2. Read and write multi-digit whole numbers using base-ten numerals,
number names, and expanded form. Compare two multi-digit numbers
based on meanings of the digits in each place, using >, =, and < symbols to record the results of comparisons.
3. Use place value understanding to round multi-digit whole numbers to any place.
Use place value understanding and properties of operations to perform multi-digit arithmetic.
4. Fluently add and subtract multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm.
5. Multiply a whole number of up to four digits by a one-digit whole
number, and multiply two two-digit numbers, using strategies based
on place value and the properties of operations. Illustrate and explain
the calculation by using equations, rectangular arrays, and/or area models.

Number and Operations—Fractions3
4.NF
Extend understanding of fraction equivalence and ordering.
1.
Explain why a fraction a/b is equivalent to a fraction (n × a)/(n × b)
by using visual fraction models, with attention to how the number and
size of the parts differ even though the two fractions themselves are
the same size. Use this principle to recognize and generate equivalent fractions.
2. Compare two fractions with different numerators and different
denominators, e.g., by creating common denominators or numerators,
or by comparing to a benchmark fraction such as 1/2. Recognize that
comparisons are valid only when the two fractions refer to the same
whole. Record the results of comparisons with symbols >, =, or <, and
justify the conclusions, e.g., by using a visual fraction model.
Build fractions from unit fractions by applying and extending
previous understandings of operations on whole numbers.
3. Understand a fraction a/b with a > 1 as a sum of fractions 1/b.
a. Understand addition and subtraction of fractions as joining and separating parts referring to the same whole.
b. Decompose a fraction into a sum of fractions with the
same denominator in more than one way, recording each
decomposition by an equation. Justify decompositions, e.g., by
using a visual fraction model. Examples: 3/8 = 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 ;
3/8 = 1/8 + 2/8 ; 2 1/8 = 1 + 1 + 1/8 = 8/8 + 8/8 + 1/8.
c. Add and subtract mixed numbers with like denominators, e.g., by
replacing each mixed number with an equivalent fraction, and/or
by using properties of operations and the relationship between addition and subtraction.
d. Solve word problems involving addition and subtraction
of fractions referring to the same whole and having like
denominators, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to represent the problem.
4. Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication to multiply a fraction by a whole number.
a. Understand a fraction a/b as a multiple of 1/b. For example, use
a visual fraction model to represent 5/4 as the product 5 × (1/4),
recording the conclusion by the equation 5/4 = 5 × (1/4).
b. Understand a multiple of a/b as a multiple of 1/b, and use this
understanding to multiply a fraction by a whole number. For
example, use a visual fraction model to express 3 × (2/5) as 6 × (1/5),
recognizing this product as 6/5. (In general, n × (a/b) = (n × a)/b.)
c. Solve word problems involving multiplication of a fraction by a
whole number, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations
to represent the problem. For example, if each person at a party will
eat 3/8 of a pound of roast beef, and there will be 5 people at the
party, how many pounds of roast beef will be needed? Between what two whole numbers does your answer lie?
3Grade 4 expectations in this domain are limited to fractions with denominators 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 100.

=== Page 31 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS grade 4   |   31
Understand decimal notation for fractions, and compare decimal fractions.
5. Express a fraction with denominator 10 as an equivalent fraction with
denominator 100, and use this technique to add two fractions with
respective denominators 10 and 100.4 For example, express 3/10 as 30/100, and add 3/10 + 4/100 = 34/100.
6. Use decimal notation for fractions with denominators 10 or 100. For
example, rewrite 0.62 as 62/100; describe a length as 0.62 meters; locate 0.62 on a number line diagram.
7. Compare two decimals to hundredths by reasoning about their size.
Recognize that comparisons are valid only when the two decimals
refer to the same whole. Record the results of comparisons with the
symbols >, =, or <, and justify the conclusions, e.g., by using a visual model.
Measurement and Data
4.MD
Solve problems involving measurement and conversion of
measurements from a larger unit to a smaller unit.
1.
Know relative sizes of measurement units within one system of units
including km, m, cm; kg, g; lb, oz.; l, ml; hr, min, sec. Within a single
system of measurement, express measurements in a larger unit in
terms of a smaller unit. Record measurement equivalents in a two column table. For example, know that 1 ft is 12 times as long as 1 in.
Express the length of a 4 ft snake as 48 in. Generate a conversion table for
feet and inches listing the number pairs (1, 12), (2, 24), (3, 36), ...
2. Use the four operations to solve word problems involving distances,
intervals of time, liquid volumes, masses of objects, and money,
including problems involving simple fractions or decimals, and
problems that require expressing measurements given in a larger unit
in terms of a smaller unit. Represent measurement quantities using
diagrams such as number line diagrams that feature a measurement scale.
3. Apply the area and perimeter formulas for rectangles in real world and
mathematical problems. For example, find the width of a rectangular
room given the area of the flooring and the length, by viewing the area
formula as a multiplication equation with an unknown factor.
Represent and interpret data.
4. Make a line plot to display a data set of measurements in fractions of
a unit (1/2, 1/4, 1/8). Solve problems involving addition and subtraction
of fractions by using information presented in line plots. For example,
from a line plot find and interpret the difference in length between the
longest and shortest specimens in an insect collection.
Geometric measurement: understand concepts of angle and measure angles.
5. Recognize angles as geometric shapes that are formed wherever two
rays share a common endpoint, and understand concepts of angle
measurement:
a. An angle is measured with reference to a circle with its center at
the common endpoint of the rays, by considering the fraction of
the circular arc between the points where the two rays intersect
the circle. An angle that turns through 1/360 of a circle is called a
“one-degree angle,” and can be used to measure angles.
b. An angle that turns through n one-degree angles is said to have an angle measure of n degrees.
4Students who can generate equivalent fractions can develop strategies for adding
fractions with unlike denominators in general. But addition and subtraction with un like denominators in general is not a requirement at this grade.

=== Page 32 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS grade 4   |   32
6. Measure angles in whole-number degrees using a protractor. Sketch angles of specified measure.
7. Recognize angle measure as additive. When an angle is decomposed
into non-overlapping parts, the angle measure of the whole is the sum
of the angle measures of the parts. Solve addition and subtraction
problems to find unknown angles on a diagram in real world and
mathematical problems, e.g., by using an equation with a symbol for the unknown angle measure.
Geometry
4.G
Draw and identify lines and angles, and classify shapes by properties of their lines and angles.
1.
Draw points, lines, line segments, rays, angles (right, acute, obtuse),
and perpendicular and parallel lines. Identify these in two-dimensional figures.
2. Classify two-dimensional figures based on the presence or absence of
parallel or perpendicular lines, or the presence or absence of angles of
a specified size. Recognize right triangles as a category, and identify right triangles.
3. Recognize a line of symmetry for a two-dimensional figure as a line
across the figure such that the figure can be folded along the line
into matching parts. Identify line-symmetric figures and draw lines of symmetry.

Mathematics | Grade 5
In Grade 5, instructional time should focus on three critical areas:  (1)
developing fluency with addition and subtraction of fractions, and
developing understanding of the multiplication of fractions and of division
of fractions in limited cases (unit fractions divided by whole numbers and
whole numbers divided by unit fractions); (2) extending division to 2-digit
divisors, integrating decimal fractions into the place value system and
developing understanding of operations with decimals to hundredths, and
developing fluency with whole number and decimal operations; and (3) developing understanding of volume.
(1) Students apply their understanding of fractions and fraction models to
represent the addition and subtraction of fractions with unlike denominators
as equivalent calculations with like denominators. They develop fluency
in calculating sums and differences of fractions, and make reasonable
estimates of them. Students also use the meaning of fractions, of
multiplication and division, and the relationship between multiplication and
division to understand and explain why the procedures for multiplying and
dividing fractions make sense. (Note: this is limited to the case of dividing
unit fractions by whole numbers and whole numbers by unit fractions.)
(2) Students develop understanding of why division procedures work
based on the meaning of base-ten numerals and properties of operations.
They finalize fluency with multi-digit addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division.  They apply their understandings of models for decimals,
decimal notation, and properties of operations to add and subtract
decimals to hundredths. They develop fluency in these computations, and
make reasonable estimates of their results. Students use the relationship
between decimals and fractions, as well as the relationship between
finite decimals and whole numbers (i.e., a finite decimal multiplied by an
appropriate power of 10 is a whole number), to understand and explain
why the procedures for multiplying and dividing finite decimals make
sense. They compute products and quotients of decimals to hundredths efficiently and accurately.
(3) Students recognize volume as an attribute of three-dimensional
space. They understand that volume can be measured by finding the total
number of same-size units of volume required to fill the space without
gaps or overlaps. They understand that a 1-unit by 1-unit by 1-unit cube
is the standard unit for measuring volume. They select appropriate units,
strategies, and tools for solving problems that involve estimating and
measuring volume. They decompose three-dimensional shapes and find
volumes of right rectangular prisms by viewing them as decomposed into
layers of arrays of cubes. They measure necessary attributes of shapes in
order to determine volumes to solve real world and mathematical problems.

Operations and Algebraic Thinking
5.OA
Write and interpret numerical expressions.
1.
Use parentheses, brackets, or braces in numerical expressions, and evaluate expressions with these symbols.
2. Write simple expressions that record calculations with numbers, and
interpret numerical expressions without evaluating them. For example,
express the calculation “add 8 and 7, then multiply by 2” as 2 × (8 + 7).
Recognize that 3 × (18932 + 921) is three times as large as 18932 + 921,
without having to calculate the indicated sum or product.
Analyze patterns and relationships.
3. Generate two numerical patterns using two given rules. Identify
apparent relationships between corresponding terms. Form ordered
pairs consisting of corresponding terms from the two patterns, and
graph the ordered pairs on a coordinate plane. For example, given the
rule “Add 3” and the starting number 0, and given the rule “Add 6” and the
starting number 0, generate terms in the resulting sequences, and observe
that the terms in one sequence are twice the corresponding terms in the
other sequence. Explain informally why this is so.
Number and Operations in Base Ten
5.NBT
Understand the place value system.
1.
Recognize that in a multi-digit number, a digit in one place represents
10 times as much as it represents in the place to its right and 1/10 of what it represents in the place to its left.
2. Explain patterns in the number of zeros of the product when
multiplying a number by powers of 10, and explain patterns in the
placement of the decimal point when a decimal is multiplied or
divided by a power of 10. Use whole-number exponents to denote powers of 10.
3. Read, write, and compare decimals to thousandths.
a. Read and write decimals to thousandths using base-ten numerals,
number names, and expanded form, e.g., 347.392 = 3 × 100 + 4 ×
10 + 7 × 1 + 3 × (1/10) + 9 × (1/100) + 2 × (1/1000).
b. Compare two decimals to thousandths based on meanings of the
digits in each place, using >, =, and < symbols to record the results of comparisons.
4. Use place value understanding to round decimals to any place.
Perform operations with multi-digit whole numbers and with decimals to hundredths.
5. Fluently multiply multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm.
6. Find whole-number quotients of whole numbers with up to four-digit
dividends and two-digit divisors, using strategies based on place
value, the properties of operations, and/or the relationship between
multiplication and division. Illustrate and explain the calculation by
using equations, rectangular arrays, and/or area models.
7. Add, subtract, multiply, and divide decimals to hundredths, using
concrete models or drawings and strategies based on place value,
properties of operations, and/or the relationship between addition and
subtraction; relate the strategy to a written method and explain the reasoning used.

=== Page 36 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS grade 5   |   36
Number and Operations—Fractions
5.NF
Use equivalent fractions as a strategy to add and subtract fractions.
1.
Add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators (including mixed
numbers) by replacing given fractions with equivalent fractions in
such a way as to produce an equivalent sum or difference of fractions
with like denominators. For example, 2/3 + 5/4 = 8/12 + 15/12 = 23/12. (In general, a/b + c/d = (ad + bc)/bd.)
2. Solve word problems involving addition and subtraction of fractions
referring to the same whole, including cases of unlike denominators,
e.g., by using visual fraction models or equations to represent the
problem. Use benchmark fractions and number sense of fractions
to estimate mentally and assess the reasonableness of answers. For
example, recognize an incorrect result 2/5 + 1/2 = 3/7, by observing that 3/7 < 1/2.
Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication and division to multiply and divide fractions.
3. Interpret a fraction as division of the numerator by the denominator
(a/b = a ÷ b). Solve word problems involving division of whole
numbers leading to answers in the form of fractions or mixed numbers,
e.g., by using visual fraction models or equations to represent the
problem. For example, interpret 3/4 as the result of dividing 3 by 4, noting
that 3/4 multiplied by 4 equals 3, and that when 3 wholes are shared
equally among 4 people each person has a share of size 3/4. If 9 people
want to share a 50-pound sack of rice equally by weight, how many
pounds of rice should each person get? Between what two whole numbers does your answer lie?
4. Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication to
multiply a fraction or whole number by a fraction.
a. Interpret the product (a/b) × q as a parts of a partition of q
into b equal parts; equivalently, as the result of a sequence of
operations a × q ÷ b. For example, use a visual fraction model to
show (2/3) × 4 = 8/3, and create a story context for this equation. Do
the same with (2/3) × (4/5) = 8/15. (In general, (a/b) × (c/d) = ac/bd.)
b. Find the area of a rectangle with fractional side lengths by tiling it
with unit squares of the appropriate unit fraction side lengths, and
show that the area is the same as would be found by multiplying
the side lengths. Multiply fractional side lengths to find areas of
rectangles, and represent fraction products as rectangular areas.
5. Interpret multiplication as scaling (resizing), by:
a. Comparing the size of a product to the size of one factor on
the basis of the size of the other factor, without performing the indicated multiplication.
b. Explaining why multiplying a given number by a fraction greater
than 1 results in a product greater than the given number
(recognizing multiplication by whole numbers greater than 1 as
a familiar case); explaining why multiplying a given number by
a fraction less than 1 results in a product smaller than the given
number; and relating the principle of fraction equivalence a/b =
(n×a)/(n×b) to the effect of multiplying a/b by 1.
6. Solve real world problems involving multiplication of fractions and
mixed numbers, e.g., by using visual fraction models or equations to represent the problem.
7. Apply and extend previous understandings of division to divide unit
fractions by whole numbers and whole numbers by unit fractions.1
a. Interpret division of a unit fraction by a non-zero whole number,
1Students able to multiply fractions in general can develop strategies to divide frac tions in general, by reasoning about the relationship between multiplication and
division. But division of a fraction by a fraction is not a requirement at this grade.

=== Page 37 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS grade 5   |   37
and compute such quotients. For example, create a story context
for (1/3) ÷ 4, and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient.
Use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that (1/3) ÷ 4 = 1/12 because (1/12) × 4 = 1/3.
b. Interpret division of a whole number by a unit fraction, and
compute such quotients. For example, create a story context for
4 ÷ (1/5), and use a visual fraction model to show the quotient. Use
the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that 4 ÷ (1/5) = 20 because 20 × (1/5) = 4.
c. Solve real world problems involving division of unit fractions by
non-zero whole numbers and division of whole numbers by unit
fractions, e.g., by using visual fraction models and equations to
represent the problem. For example, how much chocolate will each
person get if 3 people share 1/2 lb of chocolate equally? How many 1/3-cup servings are in 2 cups of raisins?
Measurement and Data
5.MD
Convert like measurement units within a given measurement system.
1.
Convert among different-sized standard measurement units within a
given measurement system (e.g., convert 5 cm to 0.05 m), and use
these conversions in solving multi-step, real world problems.
Represent and interpret data.
2. Make a line plot to display a data set of measurements in fractions of
a unit (1/2, 1/4, 1/8). Use operations on fractions for this grade to solve
problems involving information presented in line plots. For example,
given different measurements of liquid in identical beakers, find the
amount of liquid each beaker would contain if the total amount in all the beakers were redistributed equally.
Geometric measurement: understand concepts of volume and relate volume to multiplication and to addition.
3. Recognize volume as an attribute of solid figures and understand concepts of volume measurement.
a. A cube with side length 1 unit, called a “unit cube,” is said to have
“one cubic unit” of volume, and can be used to measure volume.
b. A solid figure which can be packed without gaps or overlaps
using n unit cubes is said to have a volume of n cubic units.
4. Measure volumes by counting unit cubes, using cubic cm, cubic in, cubic ft, and improvised units.
5. Relate volume to the operations of multiplication and addition and
solve real world and mathematical problems involving volume.
a. Find the volume of a right rectangular prism with whole-number
side lengths by packing it with unit cubes, and show that the
volume is the same as would be found by multiplying the edge
lengths, equivalently by multiplying the height by the area of the
base. Represent threefold whole-number products as volumes,
e.g., to represent the associative property of multiplication.
b. Apply the formulas V = l × w × h and V = b × h for rectangular
prisms to find volumes of right rectangular prisms with whole number edge lengths in the context of solving real world and mathematical problems.
c. Recognize volume as additive. Find volumes of solid figures
composed of two non-overlapping right rectangular prisms by
adding the volumes of the non-overlapping parts, applying this technique to solve real world problems.

=== Page 38 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS grade 5   |   38
Geometry
5.G
Graph points on the coordinate plane to solve real-world and mathematical problems.
1.
Use a pair of perpendicular number lines, called axes, to define a
coordinate system, with the intersection of the lines (the origin)
arranged to coincide with the 0 on each line and a given point in
the plane located by using an ordered pair of numbers, called its
coordinates. Understand that the first number indicates how far to
travel from the origin in the direction of one axis, and the second
number indicates how far to travel in the direction of the second
axis, with the convention that the names of the two axes and the
coordinates correspond (e.g., x-axis and x-coordinate, y-axis and y-coordinate).
2. Represent real world and mathematical problems by graphing points
in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane, and interpret coordinate values of points in the context of the situation.
Classify two-dimensional figures into categories based on their properties.
3. Understand that attributes belonging to a category of two dimensional figures also belong to all subcategories of that category.
For example, all rectangles have four right angles and squares are
rectangles, so all squares have four right angles.
4. Classify two-dimensional figures in a hierarchy based on properties.

=== Page 39 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS grade 6   |   39
Mathematics | Grade 6
In Grade 6, instructional time should focus on four critical areas: (1)
connecting ratio and rate to whole number multiplication and division
and using concepts of ratio and rate to solve problems; (2) completing
understanding of division of fractions and extending the notion of number
to the system of rational numbers, which includes negative numbers;
(3) writing, interpreting, and using expressions and equations; and (4) developing understanding of statistical thinking.
(1) Students use reasoning about multiplication and division to solve
ratio and rate problems about quantities. By viewing equivalent ratios
and rates as deriving from, and extending, pairs of rows (or columns) in
the multiplication table, and by analyzing simple drawings that indicate
the relative size of quantities, students connect their understanding of
multiplication and division with ratios and rates. Thus students expand the
scope of problems for which they can use multiplication and division to
solve problems, and they connect ratios and fractions. Students solve a
wide variety of problems involving ratios and rates.
(2) Students use the meaning of fractions, the meanings of multiplication
and division, and the relationship between multiplication and division to
understand and explain why the procedures for dividing fractions make
sense. Students use these operations to solve problems. Students extend
their previous understandings of number and the ordering of numbers
to the full system of rational numbers, which includes negative rational
numbers, and in particular negative integers. They reason about the order
and absolute value of rational numbers and about the location of points in all four quadrants of the coordinate plane.
(3) Students understand the use of variables in mathematical expressions.
They write expressions and equations that correspond to given situations,
evaluate expressions, and use expressions and formulas to solve problems.
Students understand that expressions in different forms can be equivalent,
and they use the properties of operations to rewrite expressions in
equivalent forms. Students know that the solutions of an equation are the
values of the variables that make the equation true. Students use properties
of operations and the idea of maintaining the equality of both sides of
an equation to solve simple one-step equations. Students construct and
analyze tables, such as tables of quantities that are in equivalent ratios,
and they use equations (such as 3x = y) to describe relationships between quantities.
(4) Building on and reinforcing their understanding of number, students
begin to develop their ability to think statistically. Students recognize that a
data distribution may not have a definite center and that different ways to
measure center yield different values. The median measures center in the
sense that it is roughly the middle value. The mean measures center in the
sense that it is the value that each data point would take on if the total of
the data values were redistributed equally, and also in the sense that it is a
balance point. Students recognize that a measure of variability (interquartile
range or mean absolute deviation) can also be useful for summarizing
data because two very different sets of data can have the same mean and

=== Page 40 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS grade 6   |   40
median yet be distinguished by their variability. Students learn to describe
and summarize numerical data sets, identifying clusters, peaks, gaps, and
symmetry, considering the context in which the data were collected.
Students in Grade 6 also build on their work with area in elementary
school by reasoning about relationships among shapes to determine area,
surface area, and volume. They find areas of right triangles, other triangles,
and special quadrilaterals by decomposing these shapes, rearranging
or removing pieces, and relating the shapes to rectangles. Using these
methods, students discuss, develop, and justify formulas for areas of
triangles and parallelograms. Students find areas of polygons and surface
areas of prisms and pyramids by decomposing them into pieces whose
area they can determine. They reason about right rectangular prisms
with fractional side lengths to extend formulas for the volume of a right
rectangular prism to fractional side lengths. They prepare for work on
scale drawings and constructions in Grade 7 by drawing polygons in the coordinate plane.

Ratios and Proportional Relationships
6.RP
Understand ratio concepts and use ratio reasoning to solve problems.
1.
Understand the concept of a ratio and use ratio language to describe
a ratio relationship between two quantities. For example, “The ratio
of wings to beaks in the bird house at the zoo was 2:1, because for
every 2 wings there was 1 beak.” “For every vote candidate A received, candidate C received nearly three votes.”
2. Understand the concept of a unit rate a/b associated with a ratio a:b
with b ≠ 0, and use rate language in the context of a ratio relationship.
For example, “This recipe has a ratio of 3 cups of flour to 4 cups of sugar,
so there is 3/4 cup of flour for each cup of sugar.” “We paid $75 for 15
hamburgers, which is a rate of $5 per hamburger.”1
3. Use ratio and rate reasoning to solve real-world and mathematical
problems, e.g., by reasoning about tables of equivalent ratios, tape
diagrams, double number line diagrams, or equations.
a. Make tables of equivalent ratios relating quantities with whole number measurements, find missing values in the tables, and plot
the pairs of values on the coordinate plane. Use tables to compare ratios.
b. Solve unit rate problems including those involving unit pricing and
constant speed. For example, if it took 7 hours to mow 4 lawns, then
at that rate, how many lawns could be mowed in 35 hours? At what rate were lawns being mowed?
c. Find a percent of a quantity as a rate per 100 (e.g., 30% of a
quantity means 30/100 times the quantity); solve problems
involving finding the whole, given a part and the percent.
d. Use ratio reasoning to convert measurement units; manipulate
and transform units appropriately when multiplying or dividing quantities.
The Number System
6.NS
Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication and division to divide fractions by fractions.
1.
Interpret and compute quotients of fractions, and solve word
problems involving division of fractions by fractions, e.g., by using
visual fraction models and equations to represent the problem. For
example, create a story context for (2/3) ÷ (3/4) and use a visual fraction
model to show the quotient; use the relationship between multiplication
and division to explain that (2/3) ÷ (3/4) = 8/9 because 3/4 of 8/9 is 2/3.
(In general, (a/b) ÷ (c/d) = ad/bc.) How much chocolate will each person
get if 3 people share 1/2 lb of chocolate equally? How many 3/4-cup
servings are in 2/3 of a cup of yogurt? How wide is a rectangular strip of land with length 3/4 mi and area 1/2 square mi?
Compute fluently with multi-digit numbers and find common factors and multiples.
2. Fluently divide multi-digit numbers using the standard algorithm.
3. Fluently add, subtract, multiply, and divide multi-digit decimals using the standard algorithm for each operation.
4. Find the greatest common factor of two whole numbers less than or
equal to 100 and the least common multiple of two whole numbers
less than or equal to 12. Use the distributive property to express a
sum of two whole numbers 1–100 with a common factor as a multiple
of a sum of two whole numbers with no common factor. For example, express 36 + 8 as 4 (9 + 2).
1Expectations for unit rates in this grade are limited to non-complex fractions.

=== Page 43 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS grade 6   |   43
Apply and extend previous understandings of numbers to the system of rational numbers.
5. Understand that positive and negative numbers are used together
to describe quantities having opposite directions or values (e.g.,
temperature above/below zero, elevation above/below sea level,
credits/debits, positive/negative electric charge); use positive and
negative numbers to represent quantities in real-world contexts, explaining the meaning of 0 in each situation.
6. Understand a rational number as a point on the number line. Extend
number line diagrams and coordinate axes familiar from previous
grades to represent points on the line and in the plane with negative number coordinates.
a. Recognize opposite signs of numbers as indicating locations
on opposite sides of 0 on the number line; recognize that the
opposite of the opposite of a number is the number itself, e.g., –(–3) = 3, and that 0 is its own opposite.
b. Understand signs of numbers in ordered pairs as indicating
locations in quadrants of the coordinate plane; recognize that
when two ordered pairs differ only by signs, the locations of the
points are related by reflections across one or both axes.
c. Find and position integers and other rational numbers on a
horizontal or vertical number line diagram; find and position pairs
of integers and other rational numbers on a coordinate plane.
7. Understand ordering and absolute value of rational numbers.
a. Interpret statements of inequality as statements about the relative
position of two numbers on a number line diagram. For example,
interpret –3 > –7 as a statement that –3 is located to the right of –7 on a number line oriented from left to right.
b. Write, interpret, and explain statements of order for rational
numbers in real-world contexts. For example, write –3 oC > –7 oC to express the fact that –3 oC is warmer than –7 oC.
c. Understand the absolute value of a rational number as its distance
from 0 on the number line; interpret absolute value as magnitude
for a positive or negative quantity in a real-world situation. For
example, for an account balance of –30 dollars, write |–30| = 30 to describe the size of the debt in dollars.
d. Distinguish comparisons of absolute value from statements about
order. For example, recognize that an account balance less than –30
dollars represents a debt greater than 30 dollars.
8. Solve real-world and mathematical problems by graphing points in all
four quadrants of the coordinate plane. Include use of coordinates and
absolute value to find distances between points with the same first coordinate or the same second coordinate.
Expressions and Equations
6.EE
Apply and extend previous understandings of arithmetic to algebraic expressions.
1.
Write and evaluate numerical expressions involving whole-number exponents.
2. Write, read, and evaluate expressions in which letters stand for numbers.
a. Write expressions that record operations with numbers and with
letters standing for numbers. For example, express the calculation “Subtract y from 5” as 5 – y.

=== Page 44 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS grade 6   |   44
b. Identify parts of an expression using mathematical terms (sum,
term, product, factor, quotient, coefficient); view one or more
parts of an expression as a single entity. For example, describe the
expression 2 (8 + 7) as a product of two factors; view (8 + 7) as both a single entity and a sum of two terms.
c. Evaluate expressions at specific values of their variables. Include
expressions that arise from formulas used in real-world problems.
Perform arithmetic operations, including those involving whole number exponents, in the conventional order when there are no
parentheses to specify a particular order (Order of Operations).
For example, use the formulas V = s3 and A = 6 s2 to find the volume
and surface area of a cube with sides of length s = 1/2.
3. Apply the properties of operations to generate equivalent expressions.
For example, apply the distributive property to the expression 3 (2 + x) to
produce the equivalent expression 6 + 3x; apply the distributive property
to the expression 24x + 18y to produce the equivalent expression
6 (4x + 3y); apply properties of operations to y + y + y to produce the equivalent expression 3y.
4. Identify when two expressions are equivalent (i.e., when the two
expressions name the same number regardless of which value is
substituted into them). For example, the expressions y + y + y and 3y
are equivalent because they name the same number regardless of which number y stands for.
Reason about and solve one-variable equations and inequalities.
5. Understand solving an equation or inequality as a process of
answering a question: which values from a specified set, if any, make
the equation or inequality true? Use substitution to determine whether
a given number in a specified set makes an equation or inequality true.
6. Use variables to represent numbers and write expressions when
solving a real-world or mathematical problem; understand that a
variable can represent an unknown number, or, depending on the purpose at hand, any number in a specified set.
7. Solve real-world and mathematical problems by writing and solving
equations of the form x + p = q and px = q for cases in which p, q and x are all nonnegative rational numbers.
8. Write an inequality of the form x > c or x < c to represent a constraint
or condition in a real-world or mathematical problem. Recognize that
inequalities of the form x > c or x < c have infinitely many solutions;
represent solutions of such inequalities on number line diagrams.
Represent and analyze quantitative relationships between dependent and independent variables.
9. Use variables to represent two quantities in a real-world problem that
change in relationship to one another; write an equation to express
one quantity, thought of as the dependent variable, in terms of the
other quantity, thought of as the independent variable. Analyze the
relationship between the dependent and independent variables using
graphs and tables, and relate these to the equation. For example, in a
problem involving motion at constant speed, list and graph ordered pairs
of distances and times, and write the equation d = 65t to represent the relationship between distance and time.
Geometry
6.G
Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, surface area, and volume.
1.
Find the area of right triangles, other triangles, special quadrilaterals,
and polygons by composing into rectangles or decomposing into
triangles and other shapes; apply these techniques in the context of solving real-world and mathematical problems.

=== Page 45 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS grade 6   |   45
2. Find the volume of a right rectangular prism with fractional edge
lengths by packing it with unit cubes of the appropriate unit fraction
edge lengths, and show that the volume is the same as would be
found by multiplying the edge lengths of the prism. Apply the
formulas V = l w h and V = b h to find volumes of right rectangular
prisms with fractional edge lengths in the context of solving real-world and mathematical problems.
3. Draw polygons in the coordinate plane given coordinates for the
vertices; use coordinates to find the length of a side joining points with
the same first coordinate or the same second coordinate. Apply these
techniques in the context of solving real-world and mathematical problems.
4. Represent three-dimensional figures using nets made up of rectangles
and triangles, and use the nets to find the surface area of these
figures. Apply these techniques in the context of solving real-world and mathematical problems.
Statistics and Probability
6.SP
Develop understanding of statistical variability.
1.
Recognize a statistical question as one that anticipates variability in
the data related to the question and accounts for it in the answers. For
example, “How old am I?” is not a statistical question, but “How old are the
students in my school?” is a statistical question because one anticipates variability in students’ ages.
2. Understand that a set of data collected to answer a statistical question
has a distribution which can be described by its center, spread, and overall shape.
3. Recognize that a measure of center for a numerical data set
summarizes all of its values with a single number, while a measure of
variation describes how its values vary with a single number.
Summarize and describe distributions.
4. Display numerical data in plots on a number line, including dot plots, histograms, and box plots.
5. Summarize numerical data sets in relation to their context, such as by:
a. Reporting the number of observations.
b. Describing the nature of the attribute under investigation,
including how it was measured and its units of measurement.
c. Giving quantitative measures of center (median and/or mean) and
variability (interquartile range and/or mean absolute deviation), as
well as describing any overall pattern and any striking deviations
from the overall pattern with reference to the context in which the data were gathered.
d. Relating the choice of measures of center and variability to the
shape of the data distribution and the context in which the data were gathered.

Mathematics | Grade 7
In Grade 7, instructional time should focus on four critical areas: (1)
developing understanding of and applying proportional relationships;
(2) developing understanding of operations with rational numbers and
working with expressions and linear equations; (3) solving problems
involving scale drawings and informal geometric constructions, and
working with two- and three-dimensional shapes to solve problems
involving area, surface area, and volume; and (4) drawing inferences about populations based on samples.
(1) Students extend their understanding of ratios and develop
understanding of proportionality to solve single- and multi-step problems.
Students use their understanding of ratios and proportionality to solve
a wide variety of percent problems, including those involving discounts,
interest, taxes, tips, and percent increase or decrease. Students solve
problems about scale drawings by relating corresponding lengths between
the objects or by using the fact that relationships of lengths within an
object are preserved in similar objects. Students graph proportional
relationships and understand the unit rate informally as a measure of the
steepness of the related line, called the slope. They distinguish proportional relationships from other relationships.
(2) Students develop a unified understanding of number, recognizing
fractions, decimals (that have a finite or a repeating decimal
representation), and percents as different representations of rational
numbers. Students extend addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
to all rational numbers, maintaining the properties of operations and the
relationships between addition and subtraction, and multiplication and
division. By applying these properties, and by viewing negative numbers
in terms of everyday contexts (e.g., amounts owed or temperatures below
zero), students explain and interpret the rules for adding, subtracting,
multiplying, and dividing with negative numbers. They use the arithmetic
of rational numbers as they formulate expressions and equations in one
variable and use these equations to solve problems.
(3) Students continue their work with area from Grade 6, solving problems
involving the area and circumference of a circle and surface area of three dimensional objects. In preparation for work on congruence and similarity
in Grade 8 they reason about relationships among two-dimensional figures
using scale drawings and informal geometric constructions, and they gain
familiarity with the relationships between angles formed by intersecting
lines. Students work with three-dimensional figures, relating them to two dimensional figures by examining cross-sections. They solve real-world
and mathematical problems involving area, surface area, and volume of
two- and three-dimensional objects composed of triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, cubes and right prisms.
(4) Students build on their previous work with single data distributions to
compare two data distributions and address questions about differences
between populations. They begin informal work with random sampling
to generate data sets and learn about the importance of representative samples for drawing inferences.

Grade 7 Overview

Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS grade 7   |   48
Ratios and Proportional Relationships
7.RP
Analyze proportional relationships and use them to solve real-world and mathematical problems.
1.
Compute unit rates associated with ratios of fractions, including ratios
of lengths, areas and other quantities measured in like or different
units. For example, if a person walks 1/2 mile in each 1/4 hour, compute
the unit rate as the complex fraction 1/2/1/4 miles per hour, equivalently 2 miles per hour.
2. Recognize and represent proportional relationships between quantities.
a. Decide whether two quantities are in a proportional relationship,
e.g., by testing for equivalent ratios in a table or graphing on a
coordinate plane and observing whether the graph is a straight line through the origin.
b. Identify the constant of proportionality (unit rate) in tables,
graphs, equations, diagrams, and verbal descriptions of proportional relationships.
c. Represent proportional relationships by equations. For example, if
total cost t is proportional to the number n of items purchased at
a constant price p, the relationship between the total cost and the number of items can be expressed as t = pn.
d. Explain what a point (x, y) on the graph of a proportional
relationship means in terms of the situation, with special attention
to the points (0, 0) and (1, r) where r is the unit rate.
3. Use proportional relationships to solve multistep ratio and percent
problems. Examples: simple interest, tax, markups and markdowns,
gratuities and commissions, fees, percent increase and decrease, percent error.
The Number System
7.NS
Apply and extend previous understandings of operations with
fractions to add, subtract, multiply, and divide rational numbers.
1.
Apply and extend previous understandings of addition and subtraction
to add and subtract rational numbers; represent addition and
subtraction on a horizontal or vertical number line diagram.
a. Describe situations in which opposite quantities combine to
make 0. For example, a hydrogen atom has 0 charge because its two constituents are oppositely charged.
b. Understand p + q as the number located a distance |q| from p,
in the positive or negative direction depending on whether q is
positive or negative. Show that a number and its opposite have
a sum of 0 (are additive inverses). Interpret sums of rational numbers by describing real-world contexts.
c. Understand subtraction of rational numbers as adding the
additive inverse, p – q = p + (–q). Show that the distance between
two rational numbers on the number line is the absolute value of
their difference, and apply this principle in real-world contexts.
d. Apply properties of operations as strategies to add and subtract rational numbers.
2. Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication and
division and of fractions to multiply and divide rational numbers.
a. Understand that multiplication is extended from fractions to
rational numbers by requiring that operations continue to
satisfy the properties of operations, particularly the distributive
property, leading to products such as (–1)(–1) = 1 and the rules
for multiplying signed numbers. Interpret products of rational numbers by describing real-world contexts.

=== Page 49 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS grade 7   |   49
b. Understand that integers can be divided, provided that the divisor
is not zero, and every quotient of integers (with non-zero divisor)
is a rational number. If p and q are integers, then –(p/q) = (–p)/q =
p/(–q). Interpret quotients of rational numbers by describing real world contexts.
c. Apply properties of operations as strategies to multiply and divide rational numbers.
d. Convert a rational number to a decimal using long division; know
that the decimal form of a rational number terminates in 0s or eventually repeats.
3. Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving the four operations with rational numbers.1
Expressions and Equations
7.EE
Use properties of operations to generate equivalent expressions.
1.
Apply properties of operations as strategies to add, subtract, factor,
and expand linear expressions with rational coefficients.
2. Understand that rewriting an expression in different forms in a
problem context can shed light on the problem and how the quantities
in it are related. For example, a + 0.05a = 1.05a means that “increase by 5%” is the same as “multiply by 1.05.”
Solve real-life and mathematical problems using numerical and algebraic expressions and equations.
3. Solve multi-step real-life and mathematical problems posed with
positive and negative rational numbers in any form (whole numbers,
fractions, and decimals), using tools strategically. Apply properties of
operations to calculate with numbers in any form; convert between
forms as appropriate; and assess the reasonableness of answers using
mental computation and estimation strategies. For example: If a woman
making $25 an hour gets a 10% raise, she will make an additional 1/10 of
her salary an hour, or $2.50, for a new salary of $27.50. If you want to place
a towel bar 9 3/4 inches long in the center of a door that is 27 1/2 inches
wide, you will need to place the bar about 9 inches from each edge; this
estimate can be used as a check on the exact computation.
4. Use variables to represent quantities in a real-world or mathematical
problem, and construct simple equations and inequalities to solve problems by reasoning about the quantities.
a. Solve word problems leading to equations of the form px + q = r
and p(x + q) = r, where p, q, and r are specific rational numbers.
Solve equations of these forms fluently. Compare an algebraic
solution to an arithmetic solution, identifying the sequence of the
operations used in each approach. For example, the perimeter of a
rectangle is 54 cm. Its length is 6 cm. What is its width?
b. Solve word problems leading to inequalities of the form px + q > r
or px + q < r, where p, q, and r are specific rational numbers. Graph
the solution set of the inequality and interpret it in the context of
the problem. For example: As a salesperson, you are paid $50 per
week plus $3 per sale. This week you want your pay to be at least
$100. Write an inequality for the number of sales you need to make, and describe the solutions.
Geometry
7.G
Draw, construct, and describe geometrical figures and describe the relationships between them.
1.
Solve problems involving scale drawings of geometric figures,
including computing actual lengths and areas from a scale drawing
and reproducing a scale drawing at a different scale.
1Computations with rational numbers extend the rules for manipulating fractions to complex fractions.

=== Page 50 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS grade 7   |   50
2. Draw (freehand, with ruler and protractor, and with technology)
geometric shapes with given conditions. Focus on constructing
triangles from three measures of angles or sides, noticing when the
conditions determine a unique triangle, more than one triangle, or no triangle.
3. Describe the two-dimensional figures that result from slicing three dimensional figures, as in plane sections of right rectangular prisms and right rectangular pyramids.
Solve real-life and mathematical problems involving angle measure, area, surface area, and volume.
4. Know the formulas for the area and circumference of a circle and use
them to solve problems; give an informal derivation of the relationship between the circumference and area of a circle.
5. Use facts about supplementary, complementary, vertical, and adjacent
angles in a multi-step problem to write and solve simple equations for an unknown angle in a figure.
6. Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving area, volume
and surface area of two- and three-dimensional objects composed of
triangles, quadrilaterals, polygons, cubes, and right prisms.
Statistics and Probability
7.SP
Use random sampling to draw inferences about a population.
1.
Understand that statistics can be used to gain information about a
population by examining a sample of the population; generalizations
about a population from a sample are valid only if the sample is
representative of that population. Understand that random sampling
tends to produce representative samples and support valid inferences.
2. Use data from a random sample to draw inferences about a population
with an unknown characteristic of interest. Generate multiple samples
(or simulated samples) of the same size to gauge the variation in
estimates or predictions. For example, estimate the mean word length in
a book by randomly sampling words from the book; predict the winner of
a school election based on randomly sampled survey data. Gauge how far off the estimate or prediction might be.
Draw informal comparative inferences about two populations.
3. Informally assess the degree of visual overlap of two numerical
data distributions with similar variabilities, measuring the difference
between the centers by expressing it as a multiple of a measure of
variability. For example, the mean height of players on the basketball
team is 10 cm greater than the mean height of players on the soccer team,
about twice the variability (mean absolute deviation) on either team; on
a dot plot, the separation between the two distributions of heights is noticeable.
4. Use measures of center and measures of variability for numerical data
from random samples to draw informal comparative inferences about
two populations. For example, decide whether the words in a chapter
of a seventh-grade science book are generally longer than the words in a chapter of a fourth-grade science book.
Investigate chance processes and develop, use, and evaluate probability models.
5. Understand that the probability of a chance event is a number
between 0 and 1 that expresses the likelihood of the event occurring.
Larger numbers indicate greater likelihood. A probability near 0
indicates an unlikely event, a probability around 1/2 indicates an event
that is neither unlikely nor likely, and a probability near 1 indicates a likely event.

=== Page 51 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS grade 7   |   51
6. Approximate the probability of a chance event by collecting data on
the chance process that produces it and observing its long-run relative
frequency, and predict the approximate relative frequency given the
probability. For example, when rolling a number cube 600 times, predict
that a 3 or 6 would be rolled roughly 200 times, but probably not exactly 200 times.
7. Develop a probability model and use it to find probabilities of events.
Compare probabilities from a model to observed frequencies; if the
agreement is not good, explain possible sources of the discrepancy.
a. Develop a uniform probability model by assigning equal
probability to all outcomes, and use the model to determine
probabilities of events. For example, if a student is selected at
random from a class, find the probability that Jane will be selected and the probability that a girl will be selected.
b. Develop a probability model (which may not be uniform) by
observing frequencies in data generated from a chance process.
For example, find the approximate probability that a spinning penny
will land heads up or that a tossed paper cup will land open-end
down. Do the outcomes for the spinning penny appear to be equally likely based on the observed frequencies?
8. Find probabilities of compound events using organized lists, tables, tree diagrams, and simulation.
a. Understand that, just as with simple events, the probability of a
compound event is the fraction of outcomes in the sample space for which the compound event occurs.
b. Represent sample spaces for compound events using methods
such as organized lists, tables and tree diagrams. For an event
described in everyday language (e.g., “rolling double sixes”),
identify the outcomes in the sample space which compose the event.
c. Design and use a simulation to generate frequencies for
compound events. For example, use random digits as a simulation
tool to approximate the answer to the question: If 40% of donors
have type A blood, what is the probability that it will take at least 4 donors to find one with type A blood?

Mathematics | Grade 8
In Grade 8, instructional time should focus on three critical areas: (1) formulating
and reasoning about expressions and equations, including modeling an association
in bivariate data with a linear equation, and solving linear equations and systems
of linear equations; (2) grasping the concept of a function and using functions
to describe quantitative relationships; (3) analyzing two- and three-dimensional
space and figures using distance, angle, similarity, and congruence, and
understanding and applying the Pythagorean Theorem.
(1) Students use linear equations and systems of linear equations to represent,
analyze, and solve a variety of problems. Students recognize equations for
proportions (y/x = m or y = mx) as special linear equations (y = mx + b),
understanding that the constant of proportionality (m) is the slope, and the graphs
are lines through the origin. They understand that the slope (m) of a line is a
constant rate of change, so that if the input or x-coordinate changes by an amount
A, the output or y-coordinate changes by the amount m·A. Students also use a linear
equation to describe the association between two quantities in bivariate data (such
as arm span vs. height for students in a classroom). At this grade, fitting the model,
and assessing its fit to the data are done informally. Interpreting the model in the
context of the data requires students to express a relationship between the two
quantities in question and to interpret components of the relationship (such as slope and y-intercept) in terms of the situation.
Students strategically choose and efficiently implement procedures to solve linear
equations in one variable, understanding that when they use the properties of
equality and the concept of logical equivalence, they maintain the solutions of the
original equation. Students solve systems of two linear equations in two variables
and relate the systems to pairs of lines in the plane; these intersect, are parallel, or
are the same line. Students use linear equations, systems of linear equations, linear
functions, and their understanding of slope of a line to analyze situations and solve problems.
(2) Students grasp the concept of a function as a rule that assigns to each input
exactly one output. They understand that functions describe situations where one
quantity determines another. They can translate among representations and partial
representations of functions (noting that tabular and graphical representations
may be partial representations), and they describe how aspects of the function are reflected in the different representations.
(3) Students use ideas about distance and angles, how they behave under
translations, rotations, reflections, and dilations, and ideas about congruence and
similarity to describe and analyze two-dimensional figures and to solve problems.
Students show that the sum of the angles in a triangle is the angle formed by a
straight line, and that various configurations of lines give rise to similar triangles
because of the angles created when a transversal cuts parallel lines. Students
understand the statement of the Pythagorean Theorem and its converse, and can
explain why the Pythagorean Theorem holds, for example, by decomposing a
square in two different ways. They apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find distances
between points on the coordinate plane, to find lengths, and to analyze polygons.
Students complete their work on volume by solving problems involving cones, cylinders, and spheres.

Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS grade 8   |   54
The Number System
8.NS
Know that there are numbers that are not rational, and approximate them by rational numbers.
1.
Know that numbers that are not rational are called irrational.
Understand informally that every number has a decimal expansion; for
rational numbers show that the decimal expansion repeats eventually,
and convert a decimal expansion which repeats eventually into a rational number.
2. Use rational approximations of irrational numbers to compare the size
of irrational numbers, locate them approximately on a number line
diagram, and estimate the value of expressions (e.g., π2). For example,
by truncating the decimal expansion of √2, show that √2 is between 1 and
2, then between 1.4 and 1.5, and explain how to continue on to get better approximations.
Expressions and Equations
8.EE
Work with radicals and integer exponents.
1.
Know and apply the properties of integer exponents to generate
equivalent numerical expressions. For example, 32 × 3–5 = 3–3 = 1/33 = 1/27.
2. Use square root and cube root symbols to represent solutions to
equations of the form x2 = p and x3 = p, where p is a positive rational
number. Evaluate square roots of small perfect squares and cube roots
of small perfect cubes. Know that √2 is irrational.
3. Use numbers expressed in the form of a single digit times an integer
power of 10 to estimate very large or very small quantities, and to
express how many times as much one is than the other. For example,
estimate the population of the United States as 3 × 108 and the population
of the world as 7 × 109, and determine that the world population is more than 20 times larger.
4. Perform operations with numbers expressed in scientific notation,
including problems where both decimal and scientific notation are
used. Use scientific notation and choose units of appropriate size
for measurements of very large or very small quantities (e.g., use
millimeters per year for seafloor spreading). Interpret scientific notation that has been generated by technology.
Understand the connections between proportional relationships, lines, and linear equations.
5. Graph proportional relationships, interpreting the unit rate as the
slope of the graph. Compare two different proportional relationships
represented in different ways. For example, compare a distance-time
graph to a distance-time equation to determine which of two moving objects has greater speed.
6. Use similar triangles to explain why the slope m is the same between
any two distinct points on a non-vertical line in the coordinate plane;
derive the equation y = mx for a line through the origin and the
equation y = mx + b for a line intercepting the vertical axis at b.
Analyze and solve linear equations and pairs of simultaneous linear equations.
7.  Solve linear equations in one variable.
a. Give examples of linear equations in one variable with one
solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solutions. Show which
of these possibilities is the case by successively transforming the
given equation into simpler forms, until an equivalent equation of
the form x = a, a = a, or a = b results (where a and b are different numbers).
b. Solve linear equations with rational number coefficients, including
equations whose solutions require expanding expressions using
the distributive property and collecting like terms.

=== Page 55 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS grade 8   |   55
8. Analyze and solve pairs of simultaneous linear equations.
a. Understand that solutions to a system of two linear equations
in two variables correspond to points of intersection of their
graphs, because points of intersection satisfy both equations simultaneously.
b. Solve systems of two linear equations in two variables
algebraically, and estimate solutions by graphing the equations.
Solve simple cases by inspection. For example, 3x + 2y = 5 and 3x +
2y = 6 have no solution because 3x + 2y cannot simultaneously be 5 and 6.
c. Solve real-world and mathematical problems leading to two linear
equations in two variables. For example, given coordinates for two
pairs of points, determine whether the line through the first pair of
points intersects the line through the second pair.
Functions
8.F
Define, evaluate, and compare functions.
1.
Understand that a function is a rule that assigns to each input exactly
one output. The graph of a function is the set of ordered pairs
consisting of an input and the corresponding output.1
2. Compare properties of two functions each represented in a different
way (algebraically, graphically, numerically in tables, or by verbal
descriptions). For example, given a linear function represented by a table
of values and a linear function represented by an algebraic expression,
determine which function has the greater rate of change.
3. Interpret the equation y = mx + b as defining a linear function, whose
graph is a straight line; give examples of functions that are not linear.
For example, the function A = s2 giving the area of a square as a function
of its side length is not linear because its graph contains the points (1,1),
(2,4) and (3,9), which are not on a straight line.
Use functions to model relationships between quantities.
4. Construct a function to model a linear relationship between two
quantities. Determine the rate of change and initial value of the
function from a description of a relationship or from two (x, y) values,
including reading these from a table or from a graph. Interpret the rate
of change and initial value of a linear function in terms of the situation
it models, and in terms of its graph or a table of values.
5. Describe qualitatively the functional relationship between two
quantities by analyzing a graph (e.g., where the function is increasing
or decreasing, linear or nonlinear). Sketch a graph that exhibits the
qualitative features of a function that has been described verbally.
Geometry
8.G
Understand congruence and similarity using physical models, trans parencies, or geometry software.
1.
Verify experimentally the properties of rotations, reflections, and
translations:
a. Lines are taken to lines, and line segments to line segments of the same length.
b. Angles are taken to angles of the same measure.
c. Parallel lines are taken to parallel lines.
2. Understand that a two-dimensional figure is congruent to another if
the second can be obtained from the first by a sequence of rotations,
reflections, and translations; given two congruent figures, describe a
sequence that exhibits the congruence between them.
1Function notation is not required in Grade 8.

=== Page 56 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS grade 8   |   56
3. Describe the effect of dilations, translations, rotations, and reflections on two-dimensional figures using coordinates.
4. Understand that a two-dimensional figure is similar to another if the
second can be obtained from the first by a sequence of rotations,
reflections, translations, and dilations; given two similar two dimensional figures, describe a sequence that exhibits the similarity between them.
5. Use informal arguments to establish facts about the angle sum and
exterior angle of triangles, about the angles created when parallel lines
are cut by a transversal, and the angle-angle criterion for similarity of
triangles. For example, arrange three copies of the same triangle so that
the sum of the three angles appears to form a line, and give an argument in terms of transversals why this is so.
Understand and apply the Pythagorean Theorem.
6. Explain a proof of the Pythagorean Theorem and its converse.
7. Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to determine unknown side lengths
in right triangles in real-world and mathematical problems in two and three dimensions.
8. Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to find the distance between two points in a coordinate system.
Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving volume of cylinders, cones, and spheres.
9. Know the formulas for the volumes of cones, cylinders, and spheres
and use them to solve real-world and mathematical problems.
Statistics and Probability
8.SP
Investigate patterns of association in bivariate data.
1.
Construct and interpret scatter plots for bivariate measurement
data to investigate patterns of association between two quantities.
Describe patterns such as clustering, outliers, positive or negative
association, linear association, and nonlinear association.
2. Know that straight lines are widely used to model relationships
between two quantitative variables. For scatter plots that suggest a
linear association, informally fit a straight line, and informally assess
the model fit by judging the closeness of the data points to the line.
3. Use the equation of a linear model to solve problems in the context
of bivariate measurement data, interpreting the slope and intercept.
For example, in a linear model for a biology experiment, interpret a slope
of 1.5 cm/hr as meaning that an additional hour of sunlight each day is
associated with an additional 1.5 cm in mature plant height.
4. Understand that patterns of association can also be seen in bivariate
categorical data by displaying frequencies and relative frequencies in
a two-way table. Construct and interpret a two-way table summarizing
data on two categorical variables collected from the same subjects.
Use relative frequencies calculated for rows or columns to describe
possible association between the two variables. For example, collect
data from students in your class on whether or not they have a curfew on
school nights and whether or not they have assigned chores at home. Is
there evidence that those who have a curfew also tend to have chores?

Mathematics Standards for High School
The high school standards specify the mathematics that all students should
study in order to be college and career ready. Additional mathematics that
students should learn in order to take advanced courses such as calculus,
advanced statistics, or discrete mathematics is indicated by (+), as in this
example:
(+) Represent complex numbers on the complex plane in rectangular
and polar form (including real and imaginary numbers).
All standards without a (+) symbol should be in the common mathematics
curriculum for all college and career ready students. Standards with a (+)
symbol may also appear in courses intended for all students.
The high school standards are listed in conceptual categories:
•
Number and Quantity •
Algebra •
Functions •
Modeling •
Geometry •
Statistics and Probability
Conceptual categories portray a coherent view of high school
mathematics; a student’s work with functions, for example, crosses a
number of traditional course boundaries, potentially up through and including calculus.
Modeling is best interpreted not as a collection of isolated topics but in
relation to other standards. Making mathematical models is a Standard for
Mathematical Practice, and specific modeling standards appear throughout
the high school standards indicated by a star symbol (★). The star symbol
sometimes appears on the heading for a group of standards; in that case, it
should be understood to apply to all standards in that group.

Mathematics | High School—Number and Quantity
Numbers and Number Systems. During the years from kindergarten to eighth
grade, students must repeatedly extend their conception of number. At first,
“number” means “counting number”: 1, 2, 3... Soon after that, 0 is used to represent
“none” and the whole numbers are formed by the counting numbers together
with zero. The next extension is fractions. At first, fractions are barely numbers
and tied strongly to pictorial representations. Yet by the time students understand
division of fractions, they have a strong concept of fractions as numbers and have
connected them, via their decimal representations, with the base-ten system used
to represent the whole numbers. During middle school, fractions are augmented by
negative fractions to form the rational numbers. In Grade 8, students extend this
system once more, augmenting the rational numbers with the irrational numbers
to form the real numbers. In high school, students will be exposed to yet another
extension of number, when the real numbers are augmented by the imaginary numbers to form the complex numbers.
With each extension of number, the meanings of addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division are extended. In each new number system—integers,
rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers—the four operations stay
the same in two important ways: They have the commutative, associative, and
distributive properties and their new meanings are consistent with their previous meanings.
Extending the properties of whole-number exponents leads to new and productive
notation. For example, properties of whole-number exponents suggest that (51/3)3
should be 5(1/3)3 = 51 = 5 and that 51/3 should be the cube root of 5.
Calculators, spreadsheets, and computer algebra systems can provide ways for
students to become better acquainted with these new number systems and their
notation. They can be used to generate data for numerical experiments, to help
understand the workings of matrix, vector, and complex number algebra, and to experiment with non-integer exponents.
Quantities. In real world problems, the answers are usually not numbers but
quantities: numbers with units, which involves measurement. In their work in
measurement up through Grade 8, students primarily measure commonly used
attributes such as length, area, and volume. In high school, students encounter a
wider variety of units in modeling, e.g., acceleration, currency conversions, derived
quantities such as person-hours and heating degree days, social science rates such
as per-capita income, and rates in everyday life such as points scored per game or
batting averages. They also encounter novel situations in which they themselves
must conceive the attributes of interest. For example, to find a good measure of
overall highway safety, they might propose measures such as fatalities per year,
fatalities per year per driver, or fatalities per vehicle-mile traveled. Such a conceptual
process is sometimes called quantification. Quantification is important for science,
as when surface area suddenly “stands out” as an important variable in evaporation.
Quantification is also important for companies, which must conceptualize relevant
attributes and create or choose suitable measures for them.

Number and Quantity Overview

Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS high school — number and quantity   |   60
The Real Number System
N-RN
Extend the properties of exponents to rational exponents.
1.
Explain how the definition of the meaning of rational exponents
follows from extending the properties of integer exponents to
those values, allowing for a notation for radicals in terms of rational
exponents. For example, we define 51/3 to be the cube root of 5
because we want (51/3)3 = 5(1/3)3 to hold, so (51/3)3 must equal 5.
2. Rewrite expressions involving radicals and rational exponents using the properties of exponents.
Use properties of rational and irrational numbers.
3. Explain why the sum or product of two rational numbers is rational;
that the sum of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational;
and that the product of a nonzero rational number and an irrational number is irrational.
Quantities★
N-Q
Reason quantitatively and use units to solve problems.
1.
Use units as a way to understand problems and to guide the solution
of multi-step problems; choose and interpret units consistently in
formulas; choose and interpret the scale and the origin in graphs and data displays.
2. Define appropriate quantities for the purpose of descriptive modeling.
3. Choose a level of accuracy appropriate to limitations on measurement when reporting quantities.
The Complex Number System
N-CN
Perform arithmetic operations with complex numbers.
1.
Know there is a complex number i such that i2 = –1, and every complex number has the form a + bi with a and b real.
2. Use the relation i2 = –1 and the commutative, associative, and
distributive properties to add, subtract, and multiply complex numbers.
3. (+) Find the conjugate of a complex number; use conjugates to find moduli and quotients of complex numbers.
Represent complex numbers and their operations on the complex plane.
4. (+) Represent complex numbers on the complex plane in rectangular
and polar form (including real and imaginary numbers), and explain
why the rectangular and polar forms of a given complex number represent the same number.
5. (+) Represent addition, subtraction, multiplication, and conjugation of
complex numbers geometrically on the complex plane; use properties
of this representation for computation. For example, (–1 + √3 i)3 = 8
because (–1 + √3 i) has modulus 2 and argument 120°.
6. (+) Calculate the distance between numbers in the complex plane as
the modulus of the difference, and the midpoint of a segment as the average of the numbers at its endpoints.
Use complex numbers in polynomial identities and equations.
7.  Solve quadratic equations with real coefficients that have complex solutions.
8. (+) Extend polynomial identities to the complex numbers. For example, rewrite x2 + 4 as (x + 2i)(x – 2i).
9. (+) Know the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra; show that it is true for quadratic polynomials.

Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS high school — number and quantity   |   61
Vector and Matrix Quantities
N-VM
Represent and model with vector quantities.
1.
(+) Recognize vector quantities as having both magnitude and
direction. Represent vector quantities by directed line segments, and
use appropriate symbols for vectors and their magnitudes (e.g., v, |v|, ||v||, v).
2. (+) Find the components of a vector by subtracting the coordinates of
an initial point from the coordinates of a terminal point.
3. (+) Solve problems involving velocity and other quantities that can be represented by vectors.
Perform operations on vectors.
4. (+) Add and subtract vectors.
a. Add vectors end-to-end, component-wise, and by the
parallelogram rule. Understand that the magnitude of a sum of
two vectors is typically not the sum of the magnitudes.
b. Given two vectors in magnitude and direction form, determine the magnitude and direction of their sum.
c. Understand vector subtraction v – w as v + (–w), where –w is the
additive inverse of w, with the same magnitude as w and pointing
in the opposite direction. Represent vector subtraction graphically
by connecting the tips in the appropriate order, and perform vector subtraction component-wise.
5. (+) Multiply a vector by a scalar.
a. Represent scalar multiplication graphically by scaling vectors and
possibly reversing their direction; perform scalar multiplication component-wise, e.g., as c(vx, vy) = (cvx, cvy).
b. Compute the magnitude of a scalar multiple cv using ||cv|| = |c|v.
Compute the direction of cv knowing that when |c|v ≠ 0, the
direction of cv is either along v (for c > 0) or against v (for c < 0).
Perform operations on matrices and use matrices in applications.
6. (+) Use matrices to represent and manipulate data, e.g., to represent payoffs or incidence relationships in a network.
7. (+) Multiply matrices by scalars to produce new matrices, e.g., as when all of the payoffs in a game are doubled.
8. (+) Add, subtract, and multiply matrices of appropriate dimensions.
9. (+) Understand that, unlike multiplication of numbers, matrix
multiplication for square matrices is not a commutative operation, but
still satisfies the associative and distributive properties.
10. (+) Understand that the zero and identity matrices play a role in matrix
addition and multiplication similar to the role of 0 and 1 in the real
numbers. The determinant of a square matrix is nonzero if and only if the matrix has a multiplicative inverse.
11. (+) Multiply a vector (regarded as a matrix with one column) by a
matrix of suitable dimensions to produce another vector. Work with matrices as transformations of vectors.
12. (+) Work with 2 × 2 matrices as transformations of the plane, and
interpret the absolute value of the determinant in terms of area.

Mathematics | High School—Algebra
Expressions. An expression is a record of a computation with numbers, symbols
that represent numbers, arithmetic operations, exponentiation, and, at more
advanced levels, the operation of evaluating a function. Conventions about the
use of parentheses and the order of operations assure that each expression is
unambiguous. Creating an expression that describes a computation involving a
general quantity requires the ability to express the computation in general terms, abstracting from specific instances.
Reading an expression with comprehension involves analysis of its underlying
structure. This may suggest a different but equivalent way of writing the expression
that exhibits some different aspect of its meaning. For example, p + 0.05p can be
interpreted as the addition of a 5% tax to a price p. Rewriting p + 0.05p as 1.05p
shows that adding a tax is the same as multiplying the price by a constant factor.
Algebraic manipulations are governed by the properties of operations and
exponents, and the conventions of algebraic notation. At times, an expression is the
result of applying operations to simpler expressions. For example, p + 0.05p is the
sum of the simpler expressions p and 0.05p. Viewing an expression as the result of
operation on simpler expressions can sometimes clarify its underlying structure.
A spreadsheet or a computer algebra system (CAS) can be used to experiment
with algebraic expressions, perform complicated algebraic manipulations, and understand how algebraic manipulations behave.
Equations and inequalities. An equation is a statement of equality between two
expressions, often viewed as a question asking for which values of the variables the
expressions on either side are in fact equal. These values are the solutions to the
equation. An identity, in contrast, is true for all values of the variables; identities are
often developed by rewriting an expression in an equivalent form.
The solutions of an equation in one variable form a set of numbers; the solutions of
an equation in two variables form a set of ordered pairs of numbers, which can be
plotted in the coordinate plane. Two or more equations and/or inequalities form a
system. A solution for such a system must satisfy every equation and inequality in the system.
An equation can often be solved by successively deducing from it one or more
simpler equations. For example, one can add the same constant to both sides
without changing the solutions, but squaring both sides might lead to extraneous
solutions. Strategic competence in solving includes looking ahead for productive
manipulations and anticipating the nature and number of solutions.
Some equations have no solutions in a given number system, but have a solution
in a larger system. For example, the solution of x + 1 = 0 is an integer, not a whole
number; the solution of 2x + 1 = 0 is a rational number, not an integer; the solutions
of x2 – 2 = 0 are real numbers, not rational numbers; and the solutions of x2 + 2 = 0 are complex numbers, not real numbers.
The same solution techniques used to solve equations can be used to rearrange
formulas. For example, the formula for the area of a trapezoid, A = ((b1+b2)/2)h, can be solved for h using the same deductive process.
Inequalities can be solved by reasoning about the properties of inequality. Many,
but not all, of the properties of equality continue to hold for inequalities and can be useful in solving them.
Connections to Functions and Modeling. Expressions can define functions,
and equivalent expressions define the same function. Asking when two functions
have the same value for the same input leads to an equation; graphing the two
functions allows for finding approximate solutions of the equation. Converting a
verbal description to an equation, inequality, or system of these is an essential skill in modeling.

Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS high school — algebra   |   64
Seeing Structure in Expressions
A-SSE
Interpret the structure of expressions 1.
Interpret expressions that represent a quantity in terms of its context.★
a. Interpret parts of an expression, such as terms, factors, and coefficients.
b. Interpret complicated expressions by viewing one or more of their
parts as a single entity. For example, interpret P(1+r)n as the product of P and a factor not depending on P.
2. Use the structure of an expression to identify ways to rewrite it. For
example, see x4 – y4 as (x2)2 – (y2)2, thus recognizing it as a difference of
squares that can be factored as (x2 – y2)(x2 + y2).
Write expressions in equivalent forms to solve problems
3. Choose and produce an equivalent form of an expression to reveal and
explain properties of the quantity represented by the expression.★
a. Factor a quadratic expression to reveal the zeros of the function it defines.
b. Complete the square in a quadratic expression to reveal the
maximum or minimum value of the function it defines.
c. Use the properties of exponents to transform expressions for
exponential functions. For example the expression 1.15t can be
rewritten as (1.151/12)12t ≈ 1.01212t to reveal the approximate equivalent monthly interest rate if the annual rate is 15%.
4. Derive the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series (when the
common ratio is not 1), and use the formula to solve problems. For example, calculate mortgage payments.★
Arithmetic with Polynomials and Rational Expressions
A-APR
Perform arithmetic operations on polynomials 1.
Understand that polynomials form a system analogous to the integers,
namely, they are closed under the operations of addition, subtraction,
and multiplication; add, subtract, and multiply polynomials.
Understand the relationship between zeros and factors of polynomials
2. Know and apply the Remainder Theorem: For a polynomial p(x) and a
number a, the remainder on division by x – a is p(a), so p(a) = 0 if and only if (x – a) is a factor of p(x).
3. Identify zeros of polynomials when suitable factorizations are
available, and use the zeros to construct a rough graph of the function defined by the polynomial.
Use polynomial identities to solve problems
4. Prove polynomial identities and use them to describe numerical
relationships. For example, the polynomial identity (x2 + y2)2 = (x2 – y2)2 +
(2xy)2 can be used to generate Pythagorean triples.
5. (+) Know and apply the Binomial Theorem for the expansion of (x
+ y)n in powers of x and y for a positive integer n, where x and y are
any numbers, with coefficients determined for example by Pascal’s
Triangle.1
1The Binomial Theorem can be proved by mathematical induction or by a com binatorial argument.

=== Page 65 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS high school — algebra   |   65
Rewrite rational expressions
6. Rewrite simple rational expressions in different forms; write a(x)/b(x)
in the form q(x) + r(x)/b(x), where a(x), b(x), q(x), and r(x) are
polynomials with the degree of r(x) less than the degree of b(x), using
inspection, long division, or, for the more complicated examples, a computer algebra system.
7. (+) Understand that rational expressions form a system analogous
to the rational numbers, closed under addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division by a nonzero rational expression; add,
subtract, multiply, and divide rational expressions.
Creating Equations★
A-CED
Create equations that describe numbers or relationships 1.
Create equations and inequalities in one variable and use them to
solve problems. Include equations arising from linear and quadratic
functions, and simple rational and exponential functions.
2. Create equations in two or more variables to represent relationships
between quantities; graph equations on coordinate axes with labels and scales.
3. Represent constraints by equations or inequalities, and by systems of
equations and/or inequalities, and interpret solutions as viable or non viable options in a modeling context. For example, represent inequalities
describing nutritional and cost constraints on combinations of different foods.
4. Rearrange formulas to highlight a quantity of interest, using the same
reasoning as in solving equations. For example, rearrange Ohm’s law V =
IR to highlight resistance R.
Reasoning with Equations and Inequalities
A-REI
Understand solving equations as a process of reasoning and explain the reasoning 1.
Explain each step in solving a simple equation as following from the
equality of numbers asserted at the previous step, starting from the
assumption that the original equation has a solution. Construct a viable argument to justify a solution method.
2. Solve simple rational and radical equations in one variable, and give
examples showing how extraneous solutions may arise.
Solve equations and inequalities in one variable
3. Solve linear equations and inequalities in one variable, including
equations with coefficients represented by letters.
4. Solve quadratic equations in one variable.
a. Use the method of completing the square to transform any
quadratic equation in x into an equation of the form (x – p)2 = q
that has the same solutions. Derive the quadratic formula from this form.
b. Solve quadratic equations by inspection (e.g., for x2 = 49), taking
square roots, completing the square, the quadratic formula and
factoring, as appropriate to the initial form of the equation.
Recognize when the quadratic formula gives complex solutions
and write them as a ± bi for real numbers a and b.
Solve systems of equations
5. Prove that, given a system of two equations in two variables, replacing
one equation by the sum of that equation and a multiple of the other produces a system with the same solutions.

=== Page 66 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS high school — algebra   |   66
6. Solve systems of linear equations exactly and approximately (e.g., with
graphs), focusing on pairs of linear equations in two variables.
7. Solve a simple system consisting of a linear equation and a quadratic
equation in two variables algebraically and graphically. For example,
find the points of intersection between the line y = –3x and the circle x2 + y2 = 3.
8. (+) Represent a system of linear equations as a single matrix equation in a vector variable.
9. (+) Find the inverse of a matrix if it exists and use it to solve systems
of linear equations (using technology for matrices of dimension 3 × 3 or greater).
Represent and solve equations and inequalities graphically
10. Understand that the graph of an equation in two variables is the set of
all its solutions plotted in the coordinate plane, often forming a curve (which could be a line).
11. Explain why the x-coordinates of the points where the graphs of
the equations y = f(x) and y = g(x) intersect are the solutions of the
equation f(x) = g(x); find the solutions approximately, e.g., using
technology to graph the functions, make tables of values, or find
successive approximations. Include cases where f(x) and/or g(x)
are linear, polynomial, rational, absolute value, exponential, and logarithmic functions.★
12. Graph the solutions to a linear inequality in two variables as a half plane (excluding the boundary in the case of a strict inequality), and
graph the solution set to a system of linear inequalities in two variables
as the intersection of the corresponding half-planes.

Mathematics | High School—Functions
Functions describe situations where one quantity determines another. For example,
the return on $10,000 invested at an annualized percentage rate of 4.25% is a
function of the length of time the money is invested. Because we continually make
theories about dependencies between quantities in nature and society, functions
are important tools in the construction of mathematical models.
In school mathematics, functions usually have numerical inputs and outputs and are
often defined by an algebraic expression. For example, the time in hours it takes for
a car to drive 100 miles is a function of the car’s speed in miles per hour, v; the rule
T(v) = 100/v expresses this relationship algebraically and defines a function whose name is T.
The set of inputs to a function is called its domain. We often infer the domain to be
all inputs for which the expression defining a function has a value, or for which the function makes sense in a given context.
A function can be described in various ways, such as by a graph (e.g., the trace of
a seismograph); by a verbal rule, as in, “I’ll give you a state, you give me the capital
city;” by an algebraic expression like f(x) = a + bx; or by a recursive rule. The graph
of a function is often a useful way of visualizing the relationship of the function
models, and manipulating a mathematical expression for a function can throw light on the function’s properties.
Functions presented as expressions can model many important phenomena. Two
important families of functions characterized by laws of growth are linear functions,
which grow at a constant rate, and exponential functions, which grow at a constant
percent rate. Linear functions with a constant term of zero describe proportional relationships.
A graphing utility or a computer algebra system can be used to experiment with
properties of these functions and their graphs and to build computational models
of functions, including recursively defined functions.
Connections to Expressions, Equations, Modeling, and Coordinates.
Determining an output value for a particular input involves evaluating an expression;
finding inputs that yield a given output involves solving an equation. Questions
about when two functions have the same value for the same input lead to
equations, whose solutions can be visualized from the intersection of their graphs.
Because functions describe relationships between quantities, they are frequently
used in modeling. Sometimes functions are defined by a recursive process, which
can be displayed effectively using a spreadsheet or other technology.

Interpreting Functions
F-IF
Understand the concept of a function and use function notation 1.
Understand that a function from one set (called the domain) to
another set (called the range) assigns to each element of the domain
exactly one element of the range. If f is a function and x is an element
of its domain, then f(x) denotes the output of f corresponding to the
input x. The graph of f is the graph of the equation y = f(x).
2. Use function notation, evaluate functions for inputs in their domains,
and interpret statements that use function notation in terms of a context.
3. Recognize that sequences are functions, sometimes defined
recursively, whose domain is a subset of the integers. For example, the
Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively by f(0) = f(1) = 1, f(n+1) = f(n) + f(n-1) for n ≥ 1.
Interpret functions that arise in applications in terms of the context
4. For a function that models a relationship between two quantities,
interpret key features of graphs and tables in terms of the quantities,
and sketch graphs showing key features given a verbal description
of the relationship. Key features include: intercepts; intervals where the
function is increasing, decreasing, positive, or negative; relative maximums
and minimums; symmetries; end behavior; and periodicity.★
5. Relate the domain of a function to its graph and, where applicable, to
the quantitative relationship it describes. For example, if the function
h(n) gives the number of person-hours it takes to assemble n engines in a
factory, then the positive integers would be an appropriate domain for the function.★
6. Calculate and interpret the average rate of change of a function
(presented symbolically or as a table) over a specified interval.
Estimate the rate of change from a graph.★
Analyze functions using different representations

including step functions and absolute value functions.
c. Graph polynomial functions, identifying zeros when suitable
factorizations are available, and showing end behavior.
d. (+) Graph rational functions, identifying zeros and asymptotes
when suitable factorizations are available, and showing end behavior.
e. Graph exponential and logarithmic functions, showing intercepts
and end behavior, and trigonometric functions, showing period, midline, and amplitude.
8. Write a function defined by an expression in different but equivalent
forms to reveal and explain different properties of the function.
a. Use the process of factoring and completing the square in a
quadratic function to show zeros, extreme values, and symmetry
of the graph, and interpret these in terms of a context.
b. Use the properties of exponents to interpret expressions for
exponential functions. For example, identify percent rate of change
in functions such as y = (1.02)t, y = (0.97)t, y = (1.01)12t, y = (1.2)t/10, and
classify them as representing exponential growth or decay.

9. Compare properties of two functions each represented in a different
way (algebraically, graphically, numerically in tables, or by verbal
descriptions). For example, given a graph of one quadratic function and
an algebraic expression for another, say which has the larger maximum.
Building Functions
F-BF
Build a function that models a relationship between two quantities 1.
Write a function that describes a relationship between two quantities.★
a. Determine an explicit expression, a recursive process, or steps for calculation from a context.
b. Combine standard function types using arithmetic operations. For
example, build a function that models the temperature of a cooling
body by adding a constant function to a decaying exponential, and relate these functions to the model.
c. (+) Compose functions. For example, if T(y) is the temperature in
the atmosphere as a function of height, and h(t) is the height of a
weather balloon as a function of time, then T(h(t)) is the temperature
at the location of the weather balloon as a function of time.
2. Write arithmetic and geometric sequences both recursively and
with an explicit formula, use them to model situations, and translate between the two forms.★
Build new functions from existing functions
3. Identify the effect on the graph of replacing f(x) by f(x) + k, k f(x),
f(kx), and f(x + k) for specific values of k (both positive and negative);
find the value of k given the graphs. Experiment with cases and
illustrate an explanation of the effects on the graph using technology.
Include recognizing even and odd functions from their graphs and algebraic expressions for them.
4.  Find inverse functions.
a. Solve an equation of the form f(x) = c for a simple function f
that has an inverse and write an expression for the inverse. For
example, f(x) =2 x3 or f(x) = (x+1)/(x–1) for x ≠ 1.
b. (+) Verify by composition that one function is the inverse of another.
c. (+) Read values of an inverse function from a graph or a table, given that the function has an inverse.
d. (+) Produce an invertible function from a non-invertible function by restricting the domain.
5. (+) Understand the inverse relationship between exponents and
logarithms and use this relationship to solve problems involving logarithms and exponents.

Distinguish between situations that can be modeled with linear functions and with exponential functions.
a. Prove that linear functions grow by equal differences over equal
intervals, and that exponential functions grow by equal factors over equal intervals.
b. Recognize situations in which one quantity changes at a constant rate per unit interval relative to another.

2. Construct linear and exponential functions, including arithmetic and
geometric sequences, given a graph, a description of a relationship, or
two input-output pairs (include reading these from a table).
3. Observe using graphs and tables that a quantity increasing
exponentially eventually exceeds a quantity increasing linearly,
quadratically, or (more generally) as a polynomial function.

abct = d where a, c, and d are numbers and the base b is 2, 10, or e;
evaluate the logarithm using technology.

Mathematics | High School—Modeling
Modeling links classroom mathematics and statistics to everyday life, work, and
decision-making. Modeling is the process of choosing and using appropriate
mathematics and statistics to analyze empirical situations, to understand them
better, and to improve decisions. Quantities and their relationships in physical,
economic, public policy, social, and everyday situations can be modeled using
mathematical and statistical methods. When making mathematical models,
technology is valuable for varying assumptions, exploring consequences, and comparing predictions with data.
A model can be very simple, such as writing total cost as a product of unit price
and number bought, or using a geometric shape to describe a physical object like
a coin. Even such simple models involve making choices. It is up to us whether
to model a coin as a three-dimensional cylinder, or whether a two-dimensional
disk works well enough for our purposes. Other situations—modeling a delivery
route, a production schedule, or a comparison of loan amortizations—need more
elaborate models that use other tools from the mathematical sciences. Real-world
situations are not organized and labeled for analysis; formulating tractable models,
representing such models, and analyzing them is appropriately a creative process.
Like every such process, this depends on acquired expertise as well as creativity.
Some examples of such situations might include:
•
Estimating how much water and food is needed for emergency
relief in a devastated city of 3 million people, and how it might be distributed.
•
Planning a table tennis tournament for 7 players at a club with 4
tables, where each player plays against each other player.
•
Designing the layout of the stalls in a school fair so as to raise as much money as possible.
•
Analyzing stopping distance for a car.
•
Modeling savings account balance, bacterial colony growth, or investment growth.
•
Engaging in critical path analysis, e.g., applied to turnaround of an aircraft at an airport.
•
Analyzing risk in situations such as extreme sports, pandemics, and terrorism.
•
Relating population statistics to individual predictions.
In situations like these, the models devised depend on a number of factors: How
precise an answer do we want or need? What aspects of the situation do we most
need to understand, control, or optimize? What resources of time and tools do we
have? The range of models that we can create and analyze is also constrained by
the limitations of our mathematical, statistical, and technical skills, and our ability
to recognize significant variables and relationships among them. Diagrams of
various kinds, spreadsheets and other technology, and algebra are powerful tools
for understanding and solving problems drawn from different types of real-world situations.
One of the insights provided by mathematical modeling is that essentially the same
mathematical or statistical structure can sometimes model seemingly different situations. Models can also shed light on the mathematical structures themselves, for example, as when a model of bacterial growth makes more vivid the explosive growth of the exponential function.
The basic modeling cycle is summarized in the diagram. It
involves (1) identifying variables in the situation and selecting
those that represent essential features, (2) formulating
a model by creating and selecting geometric, graphical,
tabular, algebraic, or statistical representations that describe
relationships between the variables, (3) analyzing and performing operations
on these relationships to draw conclusions, (4) interpreting the results of the
mathematics in terms of the original situation, (5) validating the conclusions by
comparing them with the situation, and then either improving the model or, if it

=== Page 73 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS high school — modeling   |   73
is acceptable, (6) reporting on the conclusions and the reasoning behind them.
Choices, assumptions, and approximations are present throughout this cycle.
In descriptive modeling, a model simply describes the phenomena or summarizes
them in a compact form. Graphs of observations are a familiar descriptive model—
for example, graphs of global temperature and atmospheric CO2 over time.
Analytic modeling seeks to explain data on the basis of deeper theoretical ideas,
albeit with parameters that are empirically based; for example, exponential growth
of bacterial colonies (until cut-off mechanisms such as pollution or starvation
intervene) follows from a constant reproduction rate. Functions are an important tool for analyzing such problems.
Graphing utilities, spreadsheets, computer algebra systems, and dynamic geometry
software are powerful tools that can be used to model purely mathematical
phenomena (e.g., the behavior of polynomials) as well as physical phenomena.
Modeling Standards Modeling is best interpreted not as a collection of isolated
topics but rather in relation to other standards. Making mathematical models is
a Standard for Mathematical Practice, and specific modeling standards appear
throughout the high school standards indicated by a star symbol (★).

Mathematics | High School—Geometry
An understanding of the attributes and relationships of geometric objects can be
applied in diverse contexts—interpreting a schematic drawing, estimating the amount
of wood needed to frame a sloping roof, rendering computer graphics, or designing a
sewing pattern for the most efficient use of material.
Although there are many types of geometry, school mathematics is devoted primarily
to plane Euclidean geometry, studied both synthetically (without coordinates) and
analytically (with coordinates). Euclidean geometry is characterized most importantly
by the Parallel Postulate, that through a point not on a given line there is exactly one
parallel line. (Spherical geometry, in contrast, has no parallel lines.)
During high school, students begin to formalize their geometry experiences from
elementary and middle school, using more precise definitions and developing careful
proofs. Later in college some students develop Euclidean and other geometries carefully from a small set of axioms.
The concepts of congruence, similarity, and symmetry can be understood from
the perspective of geometric transformation. Fundamental are the rigid motions:
translations, rotations, reflections, and combinations of these, all of which are here
assumed to preserve distance and angles (and therefore shapes generally). Reflections
and rotations each explain a particular type of symmetry, and the symmetries of an
object offer insight into its attributes—as when the reflective symmetry of an isosceles
triangle assures that its base angles are congruent.
In the approach taken here, two geometric figures are defined to be congruent if there
is a sequence of rigid motions that carries one onto the other. This is the principle
of superposition. For triangles, congruence means the equality of all corresponding
pairs of sides and all corresponding pairs of angles. During the middle grades, through
experiences drawing triangles from given conditions, students notice ways to specify
enough measures in a triangle to ensure that all triangles drawn with those measures are
congruent. Once these triangle congruence criteria (ASA, SAS, and SSS) are established
using rigid motions, they can be used to prove theorems about triangles, quadrilaterals, and other geometric figures.
Similarity transformations (rigid motions followed by dilations) define similarity
in the same way that rigid motions define congruence, thereby formalizing the
similarity ideas of "same shape" and "scale factor" developed in the middle grades.
These transformations lead to the criterion for triangle similarity that two pairs of corresponding angles are congruent.
The definitions of sine, cosine, and tangent for acute angles are founded on right
triangles and similarity, and, with the Pythagorean Theorem, are fundamental in many
real-world and theoretical situations. The Pythagorean Theorem is generalized to non right triangles by the Law of Cosines. Together, the Laws of Sines and Cosines embody
the triangle congruence criteria for the cases where three pieces of information suffice
to completely solve a triangle. Furthermore, these laws yield two possible solutions in
the ambiguous case, illustrating that Side-Side-Angle is not a congruence criterion.
Analytic geometry connects algebra and geometry, resulting in powerful methods
of analysis and problem solving. Just as the number line associates numbers with
locations in one dimension, a pair of perpendicular axes associates pairs of numbers
with locations in two dimensions. This correspondence between numerical coordinates
and geometric points allows methods from algebra to be applied to geometry and vice
versa. The solution set of an equation becomes a geometric curve, making visualization
a tool for doing and understanding algebra. Geometric shapes can be described by
equations, making algebraic manipulation into a tool for geometric understanding,
modeling, and proof. Geometric transformations of the graphs of equations correspond to algebraic changes in their equations.
Dynamic geometry environments provide students with experimental and modeling
tools that allow them to investigate geometric phenomena in much the same way as
computer algebra systems allow them to experiment with algebraic phenomena.

Mathematics | High School—Statistics and Probability★
Decisions or predictions are often based on data—numbers in context. These
decisions or predictions would be easy if the data always sent a clear message, but
the message is often obscured by variability. Statistics provides tools for describing
variability in data and for making informed decisions that take it into account.
Data are gathered, displayed, summarized, examined, and interpreted to discover
patterns and deviations from patterns. Quantitative data can be described in terms
of key characteristics: measures of shape, center, and spread. The shape of a data
distribution might be described as symmetric, skewed, flat, or bell shaped, and it
might be summarized by a statistic measuring center (such as mean or median)
and a statistic measuring spread (such as standard deviation or interquartile range).
Different distributions can be compared numerically using these statistics or
compared visually using plots. Knowledge of center and spread are not enough to
describe a distribution. Which statistics to compare, which plots to use, and what
the results of a comparison might mean, depend on the question to be investigated and the real-life actions to be taken.
Randomization has two important uses in drawing statistical conclusions. First,
collecting data from a random sample of a population makes it possible to draw
valid conclusions about the whole population, taking variability into account.
Second, randomly assigning individuals to different treatments allows a fair
comparison of the effectiveness of those treatments. A statistically significant
outcome is one that is unlikely to be due to chance alone, and this can be evaluated
only under the condition of randomness. The conditions under which data are
collected are important in drawing conclusions from the data; in critically reviewing
uses of statistics in public media and other reports, it is important to consider the
study design, how the data were gathered, and the analyses employed as well as the data summaries and the conclusions drawn.
Random processes can be described mathematically by using a probability model:
a list or description of the possible outcomes (the sample space), each of which is
assigned a probability. In situations such as flipping a coin, rolling a number cube,
or drawing a card, it might be reasonable to assume various outcomes are equally
likely. In a probability model, sample points represent outcomes and combine to
make up events; probabilities of events can be computed by applying the Addition
and Multiplication Rules. Interpreting these probabilities relies on an understanding
of independence and conditional probability, which can be approached through the analysis of two-way tables.
Technology plays an important role in statistics and probability by making it
possible to generate plots, regression functions, and correlation coefficients, and to
simulate many possible outcomes in a short amount of time.
Connections to Functions and Modeling. Functions may be used to describe
data; if the data suggest a linear relationship, the relationship can be modeled
with a regression line, and its strength and direction can be expressed through a correlation coefficient.

Interpreting Categorical and Quantitative Data
S-ID
Summarize, represent, and interpret data on a single count or measurement variable 1.
Represent data with plots on the real number line (dot plots, histograms, and box plots).
2. Use statistics appropriate to the shape of the data distribution to
compare center (median, mean) and spread (interquartile range,
standard deviation) of two or more different data sets.
3. Interpret differences in shape, center, and spread in the context of
the data sets, accounting for possible effects of extreme data points (outliers).
4. Use the mean and standard deviation of a data set to fit it to a normal
distribution and to estimate population percentages. Recognize that
there are data sets for which such a procedure is not appropriate.
Use calculators, spreadsheets, and tables to estimate areas under the normal curve.
Summarize, represent, and interpret data on two categorical and quantitative variables
5. Summarize categorical data for two categories in two-way frequency
tables. Interpret relative frequencies in the context of the data
(including joint, marginal, and conditional relative frequencies).
Recognize possible associations and trends in the data.
6. Represent data on two quantitative variables on a scatter plot, and describe how the variables are related.
a. Fit a function to the data; use functions fitted to data to solve
problems in the context of the data. Use given functions or choose
a function suggested by the context. Emphasize linear, quadratic, and exponential models.
b. Informally assess the fit of a function by plotting and analyzing residuals.
c. Fit a linear function for a scatter plot that suggests a linear association.
Interpret linear models
7. Interpret the slope (rate of change) and the intercept (constant term) of a linear model in the context of the data.
8. Compute (using technology) and interpret the correlation coefficient of a linear fit.
9. Distinguish between correlation and causation.
Making Inferences and Justifying Conclusions
S-IC
Understand and evaluate random processes underlying statistical experiments 1.
Understand statistics as a process for making inferences about
population parameters based on a random sample from that population.
2. Decide if a specified model is consistent with results from a given
data-generating process, e.g., using simulation. For example, a model
says a spinning coin falls heads up with probability 0.5. Would a result of 5 tails in a row cause you to question the model?
Make inferences and justify conclusions from sample surveys, experiments, and observational studies
3. Recognize the purposes of and differences among sample surveys,
experiments, and observational studies; explain how randomization relates to each.

=== Page 82 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS high school — statistics   |   82
4. Use data from a sample survey to estimate a population mean or
proportion; develop a margin of error through the use of simulation models for random sampling.
5. Use data from a randomized experiment to compare two treatments;
use simulations to decide if differences between parameters are significant.
6. Evaluate reports based on data.
Conditional Probability and the Rules of Probability
S-CP
Understand independence and conditional probability and use them to interpret data 1.
Describe events as subsets of a sample space (the set of outcomes)
using characteristics (or categories) of the outcomes, or as unions,
intersections, or complements of other events (“or,” “and,” “not”).
2. Understand that two events A and B are independent if the probability
of A and B occurring together is the product of their probabilities, and
use this characterization to determine if they are independent.
3.  Understand the conditional probability of A given B as P(A and
B)/P(B), and interpret independence of A and B as saying that the
conditional probability of A given B is the same as the probability
of A, and the conditional probability of B given A is the same as the probability of B.
4. Construct and interpret two-way frequency tables of data when two
categories are associated with each object being classified. Use the
two-way table as a sample space to decide if events are independent
and to approximate conditional probabilities. For example, collect
data from a random sample of students in your school on their favorite
subject among math, science, and English. Estimate the probability that a
randomly selected student from your school will favor science given that
the student is in tenth grade. Do the same for other subjects and compare the results.
5. Recognize and explain the concepts of conditional probability and
independence in everyday language and everyday situations. For
example, compare the chance of having lung cancer if you are a smoker
with the chance of being a smoker if you have  lung cancer.
Use the rules of probability to compute probabilities of compound events in a uniform probability model
6. Find the conditional probability of A given B as the fraction of B’s
outcomes that also belong to A, and interpret the answer in terms of the model.
7. Apply the Addition Rule, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A and B), and interpret the answer in terms of the model.
8. (+) Apply the general Multiplication Rule in a uniform probability
model, P(A and B) = P(A)P(B|A) = P(B)P(A|B), and interpret the answer in terms of the model.
9. (+) Use permutations and combinations to compute probabilities of compound events and solve problems.
Using Probability to Make Decisions
S-MD
Calculate expected values and use them to solve problems 1.
(+) Define a random variable for a quantity of interest by assigning
a numerical value to each event in a sample space; graph the
corresponding probability distribution using the same graphical displays as for data distributions.
2. (+) Calculate the expected value of a random variable; interpret it as the mean of the probability distribution.

=== Page 83 ===
Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS high school — statistics   |   83
3. (+) Develop a probability distribution for a random variable defined
for a sample space in which theoretical probabilities can be calculated;
find the expected value. For example, find the theoretical probability
distribution for the number of correct answers obtained by guessing on
all five questions of a multiple-choice test where each question has four
choices, and find the expected grade under various grading schemes.
4. (+) Develop a probability distribution for a random variable defined
for a sample space in which probabilities are assigned empirically; find
the expected value. For example, find a current data distribution on the
number of TV sets per household in the United States, and calculate the
expected number of sets per household. How many TV sets would you
expect to find in 100 randomly selected households?
Use probability to evaluate outcomes of decisions
5. (+) Weigh the possible outcomes of a decision by assigning
probabilities to payoff values and finding expected values.
a. Find the expected payoff for a game of chance. For example, find
the expected winnings from a state lottery ticket or a game at a fast food restaurant.
b. Evaluate and compare strategies on the basis of expected values.
For example, compare a high-deductible versus a low-deductible
automobile insurance policy using various, but reasonable, chances of having a minor or a major accident.
6. (+) Use probabilities to make fair decisions (e.g., drawing by lots, using a random number generator).
7. (+) Analyze decisions and strategies using probability concepts (e.g.,
product testing, medical testing, pulling a hockey goalie at the end of a game).

Note on courses and transitions
The high school portion of the Standards for Mathematical Content specifies the
mathematics all students should study for college and career readiness. These
standards do not mandate the sequence of high school courses. However, the
organization of high school courses is a critical component to implementation
of the standards. To that end, sample high school pathways for mathematics – in
both a traditional course sequence (Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II) as well
as an integrated course sequence (Mathematics 1, Mathematics 2, Mathematics 3)
– will be made available shortly after the release of the final Common Core State
Standards. It is expected that additional model pathways based on these standards will become available as well.
The standards themselves do not dictate curriculum, pedagogy, or delivery of
content. In particular, states may handle the transition to high school in different
ways. For example, many students in the U.S. today take Algebra I in the 8th
grade, and in some states this is a requirement. The K-7 standards contain the
prerequisites to prepare students for Algebra I by 8th grade, and the standards are
designed to permit states to continue existing policies concerning Algebra I in 8th grade.
A second major transition is the transition from high school to post-secondary
education for college and careers. The evidence concerning college and career
readiness shows clearly that the knowledge, skills, and practices important for
readiness include a great deal of mathematics prior to the boundary defined by
(+) symbols in these standards. Indeed, some of the highest priority content for
college and career readiness comes from Grades 6-8. This body of material includes
powerfully useful proficiencies such as applying ratio reasoning in real-world and
mathematical problems, computing fluently with positive and negative fractions
and decimals, and solving real-world and mathematical problems involving
angle measure, area, surface area, and volume. Because important standards for
college and career readiness are distributed across grades and courses, systems
for evaluating college and career readiness should reach as far back in the
standards as Grades 6-8. It is important to note as well that cut scores or other
information generated by assessment systems for college and career readiness
should be developed in collaboration with representatives from higher education
and workforce development programs, and should be validated by subsequent
performance of students in college and the workforce.

Addition and subtraction within 5, 10, 20, 100, or 1000. Addition or subtraction
of two whole numbers with whole number answers, and with sum or minuend
in the range 0-5, 0-10, 0-20, or 0-100, respectively. Example: 8 + 2 = 10 is an
addition within 10, 14 – 5 = 9 is a subtraction within 20, and 55 – 18 = 37 is a subtraction within 100.
Additive inverses. Two numbers whose sum is 0 are additive inverses of one
another. Example: 3/4 and – 3/4 are additive inverses of one another because 3/4 + (– 3/4) = (– 3/4) + 3/4 = 0.
Associative property of addition. See Table 3 in this Glossary.
Associative property of multiplication. See Table 3 in this Glossary.
Bivariate data. Pairs of linked numerical observations. Example: a list of heights and weights for each player on a football team.
Box plot. A method of visually displaying a distribution of data values by using
the median, quartiles, and extremes of the data set. A box shows the middle 50% of the data.1
Commutative property. See Table 3 in this Glossary.

one problem into another. See also: computation algorithm.
Congruent. Two plane or solid figures are congruent if one can be obtained from
the other by rigid motion (a sequence of rotations, reflections, and translations).
Counting on. A strategy for finding the number of objects in a group without
having to count every member of the group. For example, if a stack of books
is known to have 8 books and 3 more books are added to the top, it is not
necessary to count the stack all over again. One can find the total by counting
on—pointing to the top book and saying “eight,” following this with “nine, ten, eleven. There are eleven books now.”
Dot plot. See: line plot.
Dilation. A transformation that moves each point along the ray through the
point emanating from a fixed center, and multiplies distances from the center by a common scale factor.
Expanded form. A multi-digit number is expressed in expanded form when it is
written as a sum of single-digit multiples of powers of ten. For example, 643 = 600 + 40 + 3.
Expected value. For a random variable, the weighted average of its possible
values, with weights given by their respective probabilities.
First quartile. For a data set with median M, the first quartile is the median of
the data values less than M. Example: For the data set {1, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 22,
120}, the first quartile is 6.2  See also: median, third quartile, interquartile range.
Fraction. A number expressible in the form a/b where a is a whole number and
b is a positive whole number. (The word fraction in these standards always refers
to a non-negative number.) See also: rational number.
Identity property of 0. See Table 3 in this Glossary.
Independently combined probability models.  Two probability models are
said to be combined independently if the probability of each ordered pair in
the combined model equals the product of the original probabilities of the two individual outcomes in the ordered pair.

2Many different methods for computing quartiles are in use. The method defined
here is sometimes called the Moore and McCabe method. See Langford, E.,
“Quartiles in Elementary Statistics,” Journal of Statistics Education Volume 14,
Number 3 (2006).

Common Core State Standards for MATHEMATICS glossary   |   86
Integer. A number expressible in the form a or –a for some whole number a.
Interquartile Range. A measure of variation in a set of numerical data, the

Midline. In the graph of a trigonometric function, the horizontal line halfway between its maximum and minimum values.
Multiplication and division within 100. Multiplication or division of two whole
numbers with whole number answers, and with product or dividend in the range
0-100. Example: 72 ÷ 8 = 9.
Multiplicative inverses. Two numbers whose product is 1 are multiplicative
inverses of one another. Example:  3/4 and 4/3 are multiplicative inverses of one another because 3/4 × 4/3 = 4/3 × 3/4 = 1.

that have uncertain outcomes (such as tossing a coin, selecting a person at
random from a group of people, tossing a ball at a target, or testing for a medical condition).
Probability model. A probability model is used to assign probabilities to
outcomes of a chance process by examining the nature of the process. The set
of all outcomes is called the sample space, and their probabilities sum to 1. See
also: uniform probability model.
Random variable. An assignment of a numerical value to each outcome in a sample space.
Rational expression. A quotient of two polynomials with a non-zero denominator.
Rational number. A number expressible in the form a/b  or – a/b  for some

Sample space. In a probability model for a random process, a list of the individual outcomes that are to be considered.
Scatter plot. A graph in the coordinate plane representing a set of bivariate
data. For example, the heights and weights of a group of people could be displayed on a scatter plot.5
Similarity transformation. A rigid motion followed by a dilation.
Tape diagram. A drawing that looks like a segment of tape, used to illustrate
number relationships. Also known as a strip diagram, bar model, fraction strip, or length model.
Terminating decimal. A decimal is called terminating if its repeating digit is 0.
Third quartile. For a data set with median M, the third quartile is the median of
the data values greater than M. Example: For the data set {2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14,
15, 22, 120}, the third quartile is 15. See also: median, first quartile, interquartile range.
Transitivity principle for indirect measurement. If the length of object A is
greater than the length of object B, and the length of object B is greater than
the length of object C, then the length of object A is greater than the length of
object C. This principle applies to measurement of other quantities as well.
Uniform probability model.  A probability model which assigns equal
probability to all outcomes.  See also: probability model.
Vector. A quantity with magnitude and direction in the plane or in space,
defined by an ordered pair or triple of real numbers.
