## CONCLUSION

This chapter included studies on the impact of Cognitive Coaching on self-

directed learning, the five states of mind, and the states of mind of efficacy, flexibility, consciousness, craftsmanship, and interdependence. In addition, the chapter included studies on the impact of Cognitive Coaching on students, the professional lives of educators, supervisory relationships, the staff as a team, mentoring and teacher preparation programs, and teachers' personal lives. Research on the 12 recommendations for implementing Cognitive Coaching was also included. The chapter concluded with suggestions for further research.

Much research has been done to investigate the impacts of Cognitive Coaching, and much remains to be done. As school districts involve teachers in investigating the outcomes of Cognitive Coaching training and use with students, teachers, the school, and the community, the field will advance even further.
