## Evaluation

Evaluation is the assessment and judgment of performance based on clearly defined external criteria or standards. In most systems, personnel authorized by their position as administrator, supervisor, or department chairperson conduct evaluations. Evaluation serves the following purposes:

- To provide and operate with a uniform set of explicit criteria for all personnel to judge themselves and know the criteria for the district's evaluation program
- Recognize and help to reinforce outstanding service (some districts award bonuses and merit pay)
- Screen ineffective teachers
- Provide constructive feedback
- Provide direction for staff development practices
- Unify teachers and administrators in their collective efforts to educate students

When evaluation is an act of one person judging the performance of another, it is inconsistent with the goal of self-directed learning. However, 'integrating Cognitive Coaching into the evaluation process brings a growth producing dimension often missing from traditional evaluation processes' (Dolcemascolo, Miori-Merola, and Ellison 2014).
