About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills
that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking AP
courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and AP
Exams are developed and scored by college faculty and
experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges and
universities in the United States grant credit, advanced
placement, or both on the basis of successful AP Exam
scores; more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the content
and skills that are the focus of the corresponding
college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also
organizes the content and skills into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many AP teachers have
told us they follow in order to focus their instruction.
The intention of this publication is to respect teachers’
time and expertise by providing a roadmap that they
can modify and adapt to their local priorities and
preferences. Moreover, by organizing the AP course
content and skills into units, the AP Program is able
to provide teachers and students with free formative assessments—Personal Progress Checks—that
teachers can assign throughout the year to measure
student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students: Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their AP
programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We
encourage the elimination of barriers that restrict access
to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic
groups that have been traditionally underserved. College
Board also believes that all students should have access
to academically challenging coursework before they
enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP
success. It is only through a commitment to equitable
preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses: The
AP Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this
publication is optional, the AP Program does have a
short list of curricular and resource requirements that
must be fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to
offer AP courses must participate in the AP Course
Audit, a process through which AP teachers’ course materials are reviewed by college faculty. The AP
Course Audit was created to provide teachers and
administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource requirements for AP courses and
to help colleges and universities validate courses
marked “AP” on students’ transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’ courses meet or exceed
the curricular and resource expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.
﻿ | 1
AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism Course and Exam Description

=== Page 9 ===
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the AP teacher and the school principal (or designated
administrator) to confirm awareness and understanding
of the curricular and resource requirements. A syllabus
or course outline, detailing how course requirements
are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and course
offerings of colleges and universities. Using this research
and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP
teachers work within the scope of the corresponding
college course to articulate what students should know
and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course.
The resulting course framework is the heart of this course
and exam description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The AP
Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor; all
AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision, piloting,
and analysis to ensure that questions are accurate, fair,
and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development,
College Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher
education institutions. This feedback is carefully
considered to ensure that AP courses and exams are
able to provide students with a college-level learning
experience and the opportunity to demonstrate their
qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam development process, relies on the expertise of
both AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple choice questions are scored by machine, the free response questions and through-course performance
assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands
of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are
scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion
are scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained,
and their work is monitored throughout the Reading
for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief
Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers
in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of
the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a
curve. Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which
means that every student who meets the criteria for
an AP score of 2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no
matter how many students that is. The criteria for the
number of points students must earn on the AP Exam
to receive scores of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently validates for credit and placement
purposes—include:
Bullet The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
§Bullet The number of points researchers have found to be predictive that an AP student will succeed when placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
§Bullet Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP
scores as follows:
AP Score

College Grade
Equivalent 5
Extremely well qualified
A 4

While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the United States have
adopted statewide credit policies that ensure college
credit for scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and
universities. To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/ placement policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/creditpolicies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for
seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score
the free-response sections of the AP Exams. Ninety eight percent of surveyed educators who took part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an AP
Reader, including opportunities to:
§Bullet Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
§Bullet Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP
scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure to the quality and depth of the responses from the
entire pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
§Bullet Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
§Bullet Score from home: AP Readers have online distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects. Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
§Bullet Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs): AP
Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enables students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide suggests a
sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds skill instruction across units, organizes content
into topics, and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course topics and skills, create
customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.
*To report misuses, please call, 877-274-6474 (International: +1- 212-632-1781).

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
§Bullet Teachers and students sign in to, or create, their College Board accounts.
§Bullet Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
§Bullet Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
§Bullet Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP coordinator.
§Bullet Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and AP coordinators
to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following additional benefits:
§Bullet Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
§Bullet Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
Bullet Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student pack.
The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
§Bullet Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

About the AP Physics C:
Electricity and Magnetism Course
AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism is a calculus-based, college-level physics course,
especially appropriate for students planning to specialize or major in physical science or
engineering. The course explores topics such as electrostatics; conductors, capacitors, and
dielectrics; electric circuits; magnetic fields; and electromagnetism. Introductory differential
and integral calculus is used throughout the course.
College Course Equivalent
It is strongly recommended that Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism be taught as a
second-year physics course. A first-year physics course aimed at developing a thorough
understanding of important physical principles and that permits students to explore concepts
in the laboratory provides a richer experience in the process of science and better prepares
them for the more analytical approaches taken in AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism.
However, secondary school programs for the achievement of AP course goals can take other
forms as well, and the imaginative teacher can design approaches that best fit the needs of
his or her students. In some schools, AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism has been taught
successfully as a intensive first-year course; but in this case there may not be enough time
to cover the material in sufficient depth to reinforce the students’ conceptual understanding
or to provide adequate laboratory experiences. This approach can work for highly motivated,
able students but is not generally recommended. Independent study or other first-year
physics courses supplemented with extra work for individual motivated students are also
possibilities that have been successfully implemented.
If AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism is taught as a second-year course, it is
recommended that the course meet for at least 250 minutes per week (the equivalent of a
50-minute period every day). However, if it is to be taught as a first-year course, approximately
90 minutes per day (450 minutes per week) is recommended in order to devote sufficient
time to study the material to an appropriate depth and allow time for labs. In a school that
uses block scheduling, one of the AP Physics C courses, but not both, can be taught in a single semester.
Whichever approach is taken, the nature of the AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism
course requires teachers to spend time on the extra preparation needed for both class and
laboratory. AP teachers should have a teaching load that is adjusted accordingly.
Prerequisites
Students should have taken or be concurrently taking calculus.

Lab Requirement
AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism should include a hands-on laboratory component
comparable to a semester-long introductory college-level physics laboratory. Students
should spend a minimum of 25% of instructional time engaged in hands-on laboratory work.
Students ask questions, make observations and predictions, design experiments, analyze
data, and construct arguments in a collaborative setting, where they direct and monitor their
progress. Each student should complete a lab notebook or portfolio of lab reports.

AP PHYSICS C: ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM

=== Page 18 ===
Introduction
The AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism course outlined in this
framework reflects a commitment to what physics teachers, professors, and
researchers have agreed is the main goal of a college-level physics course: to
help students develop a deep understanding of the foundational principles
that shape our understanding of electricity and magnetism. By confronting
complex physical situations or scenarios, the course is designed to enable
students to develop the ability to reason about physical phenomena using
important science practices, such as creating and analyzing representations
of physical scenarios, designing experiments, analyzing data, and using mathematics to model and to solve problems.
To foster this deeper level of learning, the AP Physics
C: Electricity and Magnetism course defines concepts,
skills, and understandings required by representative
colleges and universities for granting college credit
and placement. Students will practice reasoning skills
used by physicists by discussing and debating, with
peers, the physical phenomena investigated in class,
as well as by designing and conducting inquiry-based
laboratory investigations to solve problems through
first-hand observations, data collection, analysis, and interpretation.
This document is not a complete curriculum. Teachers
create their own local curriculum by selecting, for each
concept, content that enables students to explore the
course learning objectives and meets state or local
requirements. This result is a course that prepares students for college credit and placement.

Content
Based on the Understanding by Design® (Wiggins and McTighe) model, this
course framework provides a clear and detailed description of the course
requirements necessary for student success. The framework specifies what
students must know, be able to do, and understand, with a focus on big ideas
that encompass core principles, theories, and processes of the discipline.
The framework also encourages instruction that prepares students to make
connections across domains through a broader way of thinking about the physical world.
Big Ideas
The big ideas serve as the foundation of the course and develop understanding
as they spiral throughout the course. The big ideas enable students to create
meaningful connections among course concepts. Often, these big ideas are
abstract concepts or themes that become threads that run throughout the
course. Revisiting the big ideas and applying them in a variety of contexts allows
students to develop deeper conceptual understanding. Following are the big
ideas of the course and a brief description of each.

BIG IDEA 1: CHANGE (CHG)
Interactions produce changes in motion.
BIG IDEA 2: FORCE INTERACTIONS (ACT)
Forces characterize interactions between objects or systems.
BIG IDEA 3: FIELDS (FIE)
Fields predict and describe interactions.
BIG IDEA 4: CONSERVATION (CNV)
Conservation laws constrain interactions.

UNITS
The course content is organized into commonly taught
units. The units have been arranged in a logical sequence
frequently found in many college courses and textbooks.
The five units in AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism, and
their weightings on the multiple-choice section of AP Exam, are listed below.
Pacing recommendations at the unit level and on the Course
at Glance provide suggestions for how teachers can teach
the required course content and administer the Personal
Progress Checks. The suggested class periods are based
on a schedule in which the class meets five days a week
for 45 minutes each day. While these recommendations
have been made to aid in planning, teachers are free to
adjust the pacing based on the needs of their students,
alternate schedules (e.g., block scheduling), or their school’s academic calendar.
TOPICS
Each unit is divided into teachable segments called topics.
Visit the topic pages (starting on p. 31) to see all required
content for each topic. Although most topics can be taught

Introduction
Designed with input from the community of AP Physics C: Electricity and
Magnetism educators, the unit guides offer teachers helpful guidance in
building students' skills and knowledge. The suggested sequence was
identified through a thorough analysis of the syllabi of highly effective AP
teachers and the organization of typical college textbooks.
This unit structure respects new AP teachers’ time by providing one
possible sequence they can adopt or modify rather than having to build
from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units enable the AP
Program to provide interested teachers with formative assessments—the
Personal Progress Checks—that they can assign their students at the end
of each unit to gauge progress toward success on the AP Exam. However,
experienced AP teachers who are pleased with their current course
organization and exam results should feel no pressure to adopt these
units, which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism Course and Exam Description
The Unit at a Glance table shows the topics, related enduring
understandings, and suggested skills. The ”class periods”
column has been left blank so teachers can customize the time they spend on each topic.
The suggested skills show how teachers can link the content
in that topic to specific skills, which have been thoughtfully
chosen in a way to allow teachers to scaffold those skills
throughout the course. The questions on the Personal Progress
Checks are based on this.
Using the Unit Guides
UNIT OPENERS
Developing Understanding provides an overview that
contextualizes and situates the key content of the unit within the scope of the course.
Big ideas serve as the foundation of the course and develop
understanding as they spiral throughout the course. The
essential questions are thought-provoking questions that motivate students and inspire inquiry.
Building the Science Practices describes specific aspects of
the practices that are appropriate to focus on in that unit.
Preparing for the AP Exam provides helpful tips and common
student misunderstandings identified from prior exam data.
UNIT 1
Building the
Science Practices
3.A
4.B
6.B
Physicists often create and use representations and models to analyze phenomena, make predictions, and communicate ideas. Unit 1 provides multiple opportunities for students to create and use visual representations to demonstrate an understanding of the relationships between the variables that describe the motion of objects or systems.
Unit 1 will also teach students to demonstrate consistency between different graphical representations of the same physical situation. Being able to identify, create, and use graphs that represent the same physical situation demonstrates a deeper understanding of concepts than simply creating or using one representation.
Introducing this skill in Unit 1 is important because identifying consistencies and creating graphs that are consistent with each other gets easier with practice.
Lastly, students will practice and be challenged to identify which fundamental law, definition, and/or mathematical relationship will apply to in a given situation. Selecting the appropriate solution technique is a critical problem-solving skill that should be given space to be developed.
Preparing for the AP Exam
By the end of this unit, students should be able to create, describe, analyze, interpret, and make connections between representations and models, including electric field and electric potential diagrams.
Equally important is how students label and construct such visual representations. Labels shouldn’t contain logical flaws, biases, or inconsistencies, and diagrams should be constructed using conventional symbols such as arrows, boundaries, axes, and particles that clearly communicate significant features of the phenomenon or system.
Identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies is another skill that will appear on the AP
Exam. However, students often struggle to create effective graphs. It’s essential that scaffolded instruction is provided to help them choose appropriate quantities and labels (with units), correctly plot given data points, draw a best-fit line, use scales that span the data, and to include values in the range and domain necessary for the reasonable interpretation of the data.
Developing Understanding
In Unit 1, students will begin the study of electric force, which acts on all objects with a property
called charge. The electric force, in contrast to gravitational force, is one of attraction or
repulsion and therefore leads to different effects on objects. This knowledge will help students
understand the role electrostatics has in common devices such as photocopiers, defibrillators,
and printers, as well as television, radio, and radar industries. In the units that follow, students will
apply their knowledge of electric charges and force to electric circuits, and how the motion of electric charges helps create magnetic fields.

Building the
Science Practices
1.E
2.E
7.B
In this course, students will need scaffolded practice with modifying conditions or features of a representation of a physical situation. While it is important that students be able to calculate a numeric or symbolic solution to a problem, it is also vital that students are able to think about what would happen to their result if the initial conditions or assumptions—such as adding or removing friction, or the resistance of a wire being zero—were changed. Students should be able to justify their claims with evidence from experimental data, either collected in the lab or given to them as sample data. Students should also be able to show consistency between their claims made from experimental data and claims made by starting with the fundamental principles of physics.
In Unit 2, students should be able to make observations and collect data from representations of lab setups, as well as identify and/or describe potential sources of experimental error. Although detailed error analysis calculations will not be required on the exam, students should be able to determine the relationship between variables within an equation when an existing variable changes.
Preparing for the AP Exam
One of the free-response questions may ask students to justify the selection of data needed to answer a scientific question and design a plan for collecting that data. To better prepare students for this, it's recommended that teachers provide them with scaffolded activities and labs to determine the appropriate data needed to answer these questions. Teachers can refer to the learning objectives aligned to Unit 2 to create these activities.
Unit 2 also asks students to develop logical and coherent arguments. For example, students may have to make a claim about the capacitance of a capacitor with and without a dielectric, and justify it using scientific reasoning and evidence via physical principles or empirical data. If the scenario involves existing variables changing and/or being introduced, students could describe changes in the capacitance of a capacitor if the plates are moved closer together if a dielectric is introduced.
Developing Understanding
Previously, students investigated why all objects have an electric charge. In Unit 2, students will
examine how that charge can move through an object. Conductors, capacitors, and dielectrics
are presented to demonstrate that a charge’s movement is dependent on an object’s material.
In electronics, each of these are important based on the type of movement or desired object
behavior. Additionally, this unit examines how the behavior of these elements is impacted by electric
fields. Students should be provided with opportunities (laboratory investigations or activities) to
describe and examine the function of each of these elements, along with capacitors. Knowledge of
conductors, capacitors, and dielectrics will prepare students for understanding how electric circuits
work in Unit 3 and how they behave when one or more electrical element is altered or modified.

Dielectrics: Electrostatics with Conductors
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ACT-2.A a. Recognize that the excess charge on a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium resides entirely on the surface of a conductor.
b. Describe the consequence of the law of electrostatics and that it is responsible for the other law of conductors (that states there is an absence of an electric field inside of a conductor).
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ACT-2.A.1
The mutual repulsion of all charges on the surface of a conductor will eventually create a state of electrostatic equilibrium on the conductor. This will result in a uniform charge density for uniform shapes (spheres, cylinders,  planes, etc.) and an absence of an electric field inside of all conductors (uniform or nonuniform shapes).
a. The electric field just outside of a conductor must be completely perpendicular to the surface and have no components tangential to the surface. This is also a consequence of the electrostatic equilibrium on the surface of a conductor.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
ACT-2
Excess charge on an insulated conductor will spread out on the entire conductor until there is no more movement of the charge.

CNV-4.D.1
The general definition of capacitance can be used in conjunction with the properties of the electric field of two large oppositely charged plates to determine the general definition for the parallel-plate capacitor in terms of the geometry of that capacitor. The relationship is:
C e q uals (epsilon subscript 0 A) over d where A is the surface area of a plate and d is the distance of separation between the plates.
The plates in a capacitor can be considered to have a very large surface area compared with the distance of separation between the plates. This condition makes this an ideal capacitor with a constant electric field between the plates.

Building the
Science Practices
1.C
2.D
3.D
Students are required to create representations to depict a physical situation, use that representation to solve problems, and be able to show consistency between multiple sets of representations of the same physical scenario. Demonstrating consistency between different types of representations of the same physical situation requires a deeper conceptual understanding than simply calculating a mathematical problem.
The analysis, interpretation, and application of quantitative information are vital skills for AP Physics students. Scientific inquiry experiences should be designed and implemented with increasing student involvement to help enhance inquiry learning and the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The laboratory focus in Unit 3 guides students to make observations and collect data.
Unit 3 requires students to be familiar with collecting data and determining appropriate experimental procedures to answer scientific questions. To do so, students can be asked to analyze a familiar experiment by providing a written explanation of how they would make observations or collect data in the given scenario.
Preparing for the AP Exam
In Unit 3, students are expected to describe the physical meaning of representations and the relationship between them, while demonstrating consistency across them.
This may include describing the relationship between circuit diagrams, equations, and a written description of a scenario, (and demonstrating consistency between them).
Students are also expected to select relevant features of representations to solve problems.
Students should also be able to identify, describe, and compare patterns and trends
in different plots (e.g., potential versus current and current versus resistance). Linearizing data collected to determine a best-fit line or curve is also a skill needed for the exam.
Often, the free-response questions have a mathematical focus, requiring students to, for instance, extract quantities from narratives or mathematical relationships (such as Ohm’s
Law and Kirchhoff’s Rules), calculate and solve problems, and/or select an appropriate law, definition, or mathematical relationship or a model to describe a physical situation.
Developing Understanding
Whether or not they’re aware, students interact with electric circuits regularly through charging
their phones, powering up their laptops, or simply switching on a light. Unit 3 serves to illuminate
how, and why, our various appliances function by exploring the nature and importance of electric
currents, circuits, and resistance. Through activities and lab investigations, students will have
opportunities to relate knowledge across the course by using the electrical components they
learned about in Unit 2 and will come to discover in Unit 3 to create, modify, and analyze circuits.
Students will also analyze the relationships that exist between current, resistance, and power, in
addition to exploring and applying Ohm’s Law and Kirchhoff’s Rules.

Science Practices
5.B
6.C
2.F
Although earlier units centered on collecting and analyzing data from laboratory investigations, the instructional focus of this unit supports students’ proficiency in predicting and justifying how modifications to an experimental procedure will alter results. Making predictions based on fundamental principles of physics is a critical skill for students to develop. Without this skill, students will be unable to determine whether their experimental results match with expected results.
For success in this unit and on the AP
Exam, students should be provided with scaffolded practice in crafting clear, concise calculations and derivations that follow a logical computational pathway. Because
AP Readers cannot grade what they cannot see or understand, students must have experience with clearly annotating their calculations and derivations and putting them in a logical, sequential, and readable format.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Students are expected to apply appropriate laws, definitions, or mathematical relationships to solve problems or derive expressions. For example, students will use force and centripetal force equations on a charged, moving particle to determine the radius of curvature of a charged particle moving through a magnetic field. Students are also expected to calculate an unknown quantity with units from known quantities.
For students who struggle with this skill, we recommend they start with known physics formulas and then show, step by step (including numeric substitutions), how a final answer is achieved. Students will also develop logical and coherent arguments by using empirical data and/or physical principles to justify a claim.
Developing Understanding
In previous units, students discovered that the electric field allows charged objects to interact
without contact. Unit 4 introduces students to magnetism and how magnetic fields are
generated, behave, and relate to electricity. Students will learn how magnetic fields impact
motion and interact with other magnetic fields. Laboratory investigations and/or activities
should be provided for students to apply both the Biot–Savart Law (using calculations
to determine the strength of a magnetic field) and Ampère’s Law (deriving mathematical
relationships which relate the magnitude of the magnetic field to current). This knowledge from
previous units helps students to make connections between electric fields and magnetic fields as well as between Gauss’s Law and Ampère’s Law.

Topic
Suggested Activity 1 4.1
Identify Subtasks
Have students research some model of old CRT television. Ask them to find the
potential difference through which electrons are accelerated to determine their
speed entering the magnetic field region, then the strength of the magnetic field
needed to deflect them to different points on the screen.
2 4.2
Identify Subtasks
Have students research the current in an east-west traveling high-tension power line
and find the length of such a power line near their home. Also have them research the
magnetic field strength of Earth, and determine the force the Earth’s magnetic field exerts on the wire. Compare to the wire’s weight.
3 4.3
Create a Plan
Have students use their research of high-tension power lines to determine how far
from such a power line a person must stand before the magnetic field created by the
power line is equal to that of the Earth. Have them conduct the same research for the
distance from a wire to a hair dryer or vacuum cleaner in the home.
4 4.4
Create a Plan
Have students research the magnetic field strength of a typical MRI machine, as well
as the magnetic field strength of the machine's length and radius. Next, have them
determine how that magnetic field can be created with a same-radius, same-length
solenoid. Include factors such as length and radius of the wire making the solenoid, its
resistance, the current and voltage necessary, and the cost of the wire.
5 4.4
Desktop Experiment
Obtain a piece of rectangular aluminum foil about 1 foot wide and 2 feet long.
Connect it to a battery and resistance (so current travels the long way) and orient it
so that current travels toward magnetic north. A compass on the foil should deflect
between 30 and 60 degrees (or adjust the voltage/resistance). Have students use the
compass deflection and Ampere’s Law to determine the magnetic field of Earth.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
CHG-1.B.1
The direction of the magnetic force is always in a direction perpendicular to the velocity of the moving charged particle. This results in a trajectory that is either a curved path or a complete circular path (if it moves in the field for a long enough time).

Describe the conditions under which a moving charged particle can move through a region of crossed electric and magnetic fields with a constant velocity.
CHG-1.C.1
The magnetic force is always acting in a perpendicular direction to the moving particle.
The result of this is a centripetal force of a constant magnitude and a centripetal acceleration of constant magnitude.
a. 
CHG-1.D.1
The magnetic force is defined as cross product between the velocity vector and the magnetic-field vector. The result of this is a force that is always perpendicular to the velocity vector.
CHG-1.E.1
In a region containing both a magnetic field and an electric field, a moving charged particle will experience two different forces independent from each other. Depending on the physical parameters, it is possible for each force to be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, thus producing a net force of zero on the moving charged particle.

7.D
In Unit 5, students are not only required to create and use representations (including graphs, equations, and tables of data), but must also be able to explain how the representation illustrates a physical principle, process, concept, or theory. Students will be expected to use representations, as well as data and/or fundamental laws of physics, to provide reasoning to justify a claim. By the end of Unit 5, students should be proficient in calculating unknown quantities with unit and/or symbolic expressions from known quantities by selecting and following a logical computational pathway. As in Unit 4, merely solving for a final answer is insufficient; students require practice crafting clear, concise, arguments, derivations, and calculations that follow a logical pathway.
Preparing for the AP Exam

Students will need to determine the relationships between variables and models to describe a physical situation. For example, students may be asked to determine the changes in an induced current when the magnetic flux through the loop is changing or if the magnetic field is turned on and off.
On the exam, students are also expected to make a claim or prediction based on scientific reasoning, such as using Lenz’s
Law to infer the direction of an induced current in a loop. Students often struggle with the direction of the magnetic field, believing that if the magnetic field points into the loop, the loop will induce a magnetic field in the opposite direction. However, if
Lenz’s Law is correctly applied, students will understand that it relates to changing magnetic flux (i.e., the induced field opposes the change in magnetic flux, not the direction of the magnetic field itself).
Developing Understanding
Throughout the course, students explored the vital roles electricity and magnetism play in
our daily lives. Unit 5 examines electromagnetism through the concept of electromagnetic
induction and the application of Maxwell’s equations. Through activities and detailed laboratory
investigations, students will study, apply, and analyze the concept of induction, as well as
investigate the relationship between Faraday’s Law and Lenz’s Law. Additionally, students are
expected to call upon their knowledge obtained in earlier units—particularly that of charges,
currents, and electric and magnetic fields—to better understand Maxwell’s equations and to be
able to mathematically demonstrate, as well as reason with, how these fields are generated.

e. Calculat

e the magnitude and direction of induced
EMF and induced current in a conductive loop (or conductive bar) when a physical quantity related to magnetic field or area is changing with a specified non-linear function of time.
Induced currents arise in a conductive loop (or long wire) when there is a change in magnetic flux occurring through the loop. This change is defined by Faraday’s Law:
d p si l o
n subscript i equals negative N (d phi subscript B) over (d t) where ei is the induced EMF and N is number of
turns. (In a coil or solenoid, the N refers to the
number of turns of coil or conductive loops in the solenoid.) a. The negativ

e sign in the expression embodies
Lenz’s Law and is an important part of the relationship.
b. L enz’s Law is the relationship that allows the direction of the induced current to be determined. The law states that any induced
EMF and current induced in a conductive loop will create an induced current and induced magnetic field to oppose the direction change in external flux.
c. L enz’s Law is essentially a law relating to conservation of energy in a system and has mechanical consequences.

Lab Experiments
Although laboratory work has often been separated
from classroom work, research shows that experience
and experiment are often more instructionally effective when flexibly integrated into the development of
concepts. When students build their own conceptual understanding of the principles of physics, their
familiarity with the concrete evidence for their ideas
leads to deeper understanding and gives them a sense
of ownership of the knowledge they have constructed.
Scientific inquiry experiences in AP Physics C:
Electricity and Magnetism should be designed and
implemented with increasing student involvement to
help enhance inquiry learning and the development of
critical thinking and problem-solving skills and abilities.
Typically, the level of investigations in an AP Physics
C: Electricity and Magnetism classroom should focus
primarily on the continuum between guided and open
inquiry. However, depending on students’ familiarity with a topic, a given laboratory experience might
incorporate a sequence involving all four levels of
inquiry (confirmation, structured inquiry, guided inquiry, and open inquiry).
Lab Manuals and Lab Notebooks
College Board publishes AP Physics 1 and 2 Inquiry-
Based Lab Investigations: A Teachers Manual to
support the guided inquiry lab requirement for the course.
It includes labs that teachers can choose from to satisfy
the guided inquiry lab component for the course. Many
publishers and science classroom material distributors
offer affordable lab manuals with outlined experiments
and activities as well as lab notebooks for recording lab
data and observations. Students can use any type of
notebook to fulfill the lab notebook requirement, even an
online document. Consider the needs of the classroom when deciding what type of lab notebook to use.
Lab Materials
A wide range of equipment may be used in the physics laboratory, from generic lab items, such
as metersticks, rubber balls, springs, string, metal spheres, calibrated mass sets, beakers, glass and
cardboard tubes, electronic balances, stopwatches,
clamps, and ring stands, to items more specific to
physics, such as tracks, carts, light bulbs, resistors, magnets, and batteries. Successful guided inquiry
student work can be accomplished with both simple, inexpensive materials and with more sophisticated
physics equipment, such air tracks, force sensors,
and oscilloscopes. Remember that the AP lab should
provide experience for students equivalent to that of a
college laboratory, so teachers are encouraged to make
every effort to provide a range of experiences—from experiments students contrive from plumbing pipe,
string, and duct tape to experiments in which students
gather and analyze data using calculators or computer interfaced equipment.
There are avenues that teachers can explore as a
means of getting access to more expensive equipment, such as computers and probes. Probes can often
be rented for short periods of time from instrument
suppliers. Alternatively, local colleges or universities
may allow high school students to complete a lab as a
field trip on their campus, or they may allow teachers to
borrow their equipment. They may even donate their old
equipment. Some schools have partnerships with local
businesses that can help with laboratory equipment and
materials. Teachers can also utilize online donation sites such as Donors Choose and Adopt-A-Classroom.
Lab Time
For AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism to be
comparable to a college physics course, it is critical that teachers make laboratory work an important
part of their curriculum. An analysis of data from
AP Physics examinees, regarding the length of time they spent per week in the laboratory, shows that increased laboratory time correlates with higher
AP scores. Flexible or modular scheduling must be
implemented to meet the time requirements identified
in the course outline. At minimum, one double period
a week is needed. Furthermore, it is important that the
AP Physics laboratory program be adapted to local
conditions and funding as it aims to offer the students
a well-rounded experience with experimental physics.
Adequate laboratory facilities should be provided so
that each student has a work space where equipment and materials can be left overnight if necessary.
Sufficient laboratory equipment for the anticipated enrollment and appropriate instruments should be
provided. Students in AP Physics should have access
to computers with software appropriate for processing laboratory data and writing reports.

How to Set Up a Lab Program
Physics is not just a subject. Rather, it is a way of
approaching scientific discovery that requires personal observation and physical experimentation. Being successful in this endeavor requires students to synthesize and use a broad spectrum of knowledge
and skills, including mathematical, computational,
experimental, and practical skills, and to develop
habits of mind that might be characterized as thinking
like a physicist. Student-directed, inquiry-based lab
experience supports the AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism course and AP Course Audit curricular
requirements. It provides opportunities for students to
design experiments, collect data, apply mathematical
routines and methods, and refine testable explanations and predictions. Each AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism course should include a hands-on
laboratory component comparable to a semester-long,
introductory, college-level physics laboratory. Students
should spend a minimum of 25% of instructional time engaged in hands-on laboratory work.
The AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism Exam directly assesses the learning objectives of the
course framework, which means that the inclusion of
appropriate experiments aligned with those learning
objectives is important for student success. Teachers
should select experiments that provide students with the broadest laboratory experience possible.
We encourage teachers to be creative in designing
their lab program while ensuring that students explore
and develop understandings of these core techniques.
After completion, students should be able to describe
how to construct knowledge, model (create an abstract
representation of a real system), design experiments, analyze visual data, and communicate physics.
Students should also develop an understanding of
how changes in the design of the experiments would
affect the outcome of their results. Many questions on
the AP Exam are written in an experimental context,
so these skills will prove invaluable for both concept comprehension and exam performance.
Because AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism is equivalent to a college course, the equipment and
time allotted to laboratories should be similar to that
in a college course. Therefore, school administrators should realize the implications, in both cost and
time, of incorporating serious laboratories into their program. Schools must ensure that students have access to scientific equipment and all materials
necessary to conduct hands-on, college-level physics laboratory investigations.
Getting Students Started
There are no prescriptive “steps” to the iterative process of inquiry-based investigations. However,
there are some common characteristics of inquiry that
will support students in designing their investigations.
Often, this simply begins with using the learning objectives to craft a question for students to
investigate. Teachers may choose to give students a
list of materials they are allowed to use in their design
or require that students request the equipment they
feel they need to investigate the question. Working with
learning objectives to craft questions may include:
§Bullet Selecting learning objectives from the course framework that relate to the subject under study,
and that may set forth specific tasks, in the form of “Design an experiment to ”.
§Bullet Rephrasing or refining the learning objectives that
align to the unit of study to create an inquiry-based investigation for students.
Students should be given latitude to make design modifications or ask for additional equipment
appropriate for their design. It is also helpful for
individual groups to report to the class their basic
design to elicit feedback on feasibility. Guided student groups can proceed through the experiment, with the teacher allowing them the freedom to make mistakes—as long as those mistakes don’t endanger students or equipment or lead the groups too far
off task. Students should have many opportunities for
post-lab reporting so that groups can understand the
successes and challenges of individual lab designs.

Communication, Group
Collaboration, and the
Laboratory Record
Laboratory work is an excellent means through which students can develop and practice communication skills. Success in subsequent work in physics
depends heavily on an ability to communicate about
observations, ideas, and conclusions. Students must
learn to recognize that an understanding of physics is
relatively useless unless they can communicate their
knowledge effectively to others. By working together
in a truly collaborative manner to plan and carry out
experiments, students learn oral communication skills and teamwork. Students must be encouraged to take
full individual responsibility for the success, or failure, of the collaboration.
After students are given a question for investigation,
they may present their findings in either a written or
oral report to the teacher and class for feedback and
critique on their final design and results. Students
should be encouraged to critique and challenge one another’s claims based on the evidence collected during the investigation.
Laboratory Safety
Giving students the responsibility for design of their own laboratory experience involves special responsibilities for teachers. To ensure a safe
working environment, teachers should first provide
the limitations and safety precautions necessary for potential procedures and equipment students may
use during their investigation. Teachers should also
provide specific guidelines prior to students’ discussion on investigation designs for each experiment, so
that those precautions can be incorporated into final student-selected lab designs and included in the
background or design plan in a laboratory record. It may
also be helpful to print the precautions that apply to
that specific lab as Safety Notes to place on the desk or
wall near student workstations. Additionally, a general
set of safety guidelines should be set forth for students
at the beginning of the course. The following is a list of possible general guidelines teachers may post:
§Bullet Before each lab, make sure you know and record the
potential hazards involved in the investigation, as
well as the precautions you will take to stay safe.
§Bullet Before using equipment, make sure you know the proper method of use to acquire good data and avoid damage to equipment.
§Bullet Know where safety equipment is located in the lab,
such as the fire extinguisher, safety goggles, and the first aid kit.
§Bullet Follow the teacher’s special safety guidelines as set forth prior to each experiment. (Students should
record these as part of their design plan for a lab.)
§Bullet When in doubt about the safety or advisability of a
procedure, check with the teacher before proceeding.
Teachers should interact constantly with students as
they work to observe safety practices and anticipate
and discuss with them any problems that may arise.
Walking among student groups, asking questions, and
showing interest in students’ work allows teachers to
keep the pulse of what students are doing and maintain a watchful eye for potential safety issues.

Selecting and Using Course Materials
Teachers will benefit from a wide array of materials
to help students become proficient with the science
practices and skills necessary to develop a conceptual understanding of the relationships, laws, and
phenomena studied in AP Physics C: Electricity and
Magnetism. In addition to using a college-level textbook
that will provide required course content, students
should have regular opportunities to create and use
data, representations, and models. Rich, experimental
investigation is the cornerstone of AP Physics, and
diverse source material allows teachers more flexibility
in designing the types of learning activities that will help develop the habits of thinking like a physicist.
Textbooks
While nearly all college-level physics textbooks
address the five units of AP Physics C: Electricity and
Magnetism, it’s important for teachers to identify other
types of secondary sources to supplement the chosen
textbook accordingly, ensuring that each of the five
topic areas, as well as the science practices, receive adequate attention.
AP Central provides an example textbook list to help
determine whether a text is considered appropriate in
meeting the AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism
Course Audit resource requirement. Teachers can also select textbooks locally.
Guided Inquiry in AP Physics
C: Electricity and Magnetism
AP Physics courses require students to engage with
data in a variety of ways. The analysis, interpretation,
and application of quantitative information are vital skills
for students in AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism.
Scientific inquiry experiences in this course should be designed and implemented with increasing student
involvement to help enhance inquiry learning and the
development of critical thinking and problem-solving
skills and abilities. Typically, the level of investigations in
an AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism classroom should focus primarily on the continuum between guided and open inquiry. However, depending on
students’ familiarity with a topic, a given laboratory
experience might incorporate a sequence involving all

Instructional Strategies
The AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism course framework outlines the concepts and skills students must
master in order to be successful on the AP Exam. To address those concepts and skills effectively, teachers should
incorporate a variety of instructional approaches and best practices into their daily lessons and activities. Teachers
can help students develop mastery of the skills by engaging them in learning activities that allow them to apply their
understanding of course concepts. Teachers may consider the following strategies as they plan instruction. Please
note they are listed alphabetically and not by order of importance or instruction.
Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Ask the Expert
Students are assigned as “experts” on problems they have mastered. Groups rotate through the expert stations to learn about problems they have not yet mastered.
Students share their knowledge and learn from one another.
Assign students as “experts” on questions involving different solution techniques.
Have them rotate through stations in groups, working with the station expert to justify a set of claims with corresponding physical laws.
Changing
Representations
These tasks require students to translate from one representation (e.g., an electric field diagram) to another (e.g., an equipotential curves or surfaces diagram). Students often learn how to cope with one representation without really learning the role and value of representations and their relationship to problem solving. Getting them to go back and forth between/among different representations for a concept helps them to develop a more robust understanding of each representation. Among the representations that will be employed are mathematical relationships, so this task can serve, at times, as a bridge between conceptual understanding and traditional problem solving.
Students create pictures, tables, graphs, lists, equations, models, and/or verbal expressions to interpret text or data. This helps organize information using multiple ways to present data and answer a question or show a problem’s solution.
As students learn about electric field, electric force, and potential, ask them to move between different representations (e.g., free body diagrams of the charges, electric field, and potential diagrams).

Strategy

Purpose
Example
Concept-Oriented
Demonstration
These tasks involve an actual demonstration, but with the students doing as much of the description, prediction, and explanation as possible. Although the demonstration should produce results students don’t expect, students should nonetheless feel comfortable making predictions about what will happen.
Involving an actual demonstration, students are asked to predict and explain.
This strategy is useful for helping students to practice writing descriptions, predictions, and explanations.
Often when conducting an experiment, data collection takes the most amount of time and gets the most amount of focus, so students mistakenly believe it to be the most important piece. If teachers supplement their longer laboratory experiments with concept-oriented demonstrations, students can practice important laboratory skills (description, prediction, and explanation) without taking huge amounts of class time collecting data.
Conf licting
Contentions
Conflicting contentions tasks present students with two or three statements that disagree in some way, and students decide which contention they agree with and explain why. These tasks are very useful for contrasting statements of students’ alternate conceptions with physically accepted statements. This process is facilitated in these tasks because they can be phrased as “which statement do you agree with and why” rather than asking “which statement is correct or true.” These tasks complement “What if
Anything Is Wrong?” tasks.
These tasks help contrast statements of students’ alternate conceptions with physically accepted statements.
This strategy is useful for helping students begin to understand how to write a full argument. By providing the arguments, and having students identify good claims (and not-so-good claims) and good evidence and reasoning (and not-so-good evidence and reasoning), teachers can help scaffold the practice of argumentation for their students.

Purpose
Example
Construct an
Argument
Students use mathematical reasoning to present assumptions about mathematical situations, support conjectures with mathematically relevant and accurate data, and provide a logical progression of ideals leading to a conclusion that makes sense.
Helps develop reasoning skills and enhances communication skills in supporting conjectures and conclusions. This strategy also helps develop the process of evaluating mathematical information.
This strategy can be used with word problems that do not lend themselves to immediate application of a formula or mathematical process.
Create a Plan
Students analyze the tasks in a problem and create a process for completing the tasks by finding the information needed, interpreting data, choosing how to solve a problem, communicating the results, and verifying accuracy.
Assists in breaking tasks into smaller parts and identifying the steps needed to complete the entire task.
When scaffolding how to design an experiment, a good first step is assigning small groups to analyze the tasks necessary to design the experiment. Have students identify the steps needed to answer the question by collecting and analyzing data.
Included in this discussion is a plan for what to do with the collected data.
Debriefing
Students discuss the understanding of a concept to lead to a consensus on its meaning.
Helps clarify misconceptions and deepen understanding of context.
To discern the difference between electric field and potential, have students discuss and address the distinction between the ideas of electric field and potential to help in clarifying the concept and mathematical process.
Desktop
Experiments
Tasks
These tasks involve students performing a demonstration at their desks (either in class or at home), using a predict-and-explain format.
After doing the experiment, students “reformulate” or reconsider their previous explanations in light of what happened. Desktop experiment tasks are narrow in scope, usually qualitative in nature, and typically use simple equipment.
Students are presented with a small desktop experiment and asked to use the apparatus provided to answer a given question.
Direct Measurement Videos make excellent “desktop” experiments that students can work with either in class or for homework. Desktop experiment tasks can include small experiments using toy cars or spring scales, for example.

Discussion
Groups
Students work in groups to discuss content, create problem solutions, and explain and justify a solution.
Aids in understanding through the sharing of ideas, interpretation of concepts, and analysis of problem scenarios.
Once students learn all methods of problem solving and can select which is the most appropriate given a particular situation, have them discuss in small groups (no writing) why a specific method should be used over another.
Friends Without
Pens
Students are given a free response problem, quiz, or challenging problem. This strategy takes place in two
rounds: the first round is the timed “friends without pens” round, in which students are grouped together and can discuss—but not write about—the question. At the end of the first round, students return to their desks for the “pens without friends” round, where they tackle the assignment in the traditional, independent sense.
This can be a scaffolding tool if students are being introduced to a new type of assignment or a particularly difficult or challenging AP level question.
Students identify and discuss, with their peers, adequate claims, evidence, and reasoning. They then return to their desks to create the full argument.
Four-Square
Problem Solving
Students are given a situation, perhaps one that came from a traditional, plug-and-chug problem.
They then divide a sheet of paper into four quadrants.
In each quadrant, the student(s) put some representation of what is going on in the problem.
Possible representations include motion maps or graphs, free-body diagrams, energy bar graphs, momentum bar graphs, mathematical models (equation with symbols), well-labeled diagrams, or written responses (two to three strong clear sentences).
Re-expressing or re representing data is a key skill necessary for student success in this course.
Multiple opportunities with this task scaffolds the needed practice for students to get into the habit of creating and using representations to make claims and answer questions.
In Unit 3, students can regularly and repeatedly complete four-square problem solving with work and energy questions. They can sketch graphs or free-body diagrams, write paragraphs, and solve numerical and/or symbolic problems.

Example
Graph and Switch
Students generate a graph (or sketch of a graph) to model a certain function, and then switch calculators (or papers) to review each other’s solutions.
Allows students to practice creating different representations of functions as well as both giving and receiving feedback on each other’s work.
As students learn about graphs of potential energy, have them graph potential energy versus position and force versus position.
Students individually graph and explain how their graphs support claims and are consistent with each other.
They then share their steps with a partner and receive feedback on their graphs, claims, evidence, and reasoning.
Identify
Subtasks
Students break a problem into smaller pieces with outcomes leading to a solution.
Helps organize the pieces of a complex problem and reach a complete solution.
Another scaffolding technique:
When first exposing students to AP-level questions that involve several steps of reasoning and logic, additional questions can be added to help guide students to the final claim, evidence, and reasoning.
For example, have students sketch a free-body diagram, discuss the system, and/or draw energy bar charts. After the first few units, students should be able to identify (first in groups and then individually) what the subtasks would be (free-body diagram, etc.) to start thinking about the claim, evidence, and reasoning.
Marking the Text
Students highlight, underline, and/or annotate text to focus on key information to help understand the text or solve the problem.
Helps the student identify important information in the text and make notes in the text about the interpretation of tasks required and concepts to apply to reach a solution.
This strategy can be used with AP-level problems as well as problems from the text, or sample laboratory procedures.
Have students read through the question, experimental design (or another student’s experimental design) and underline the pronouns, equipment, key information (i.e., the car begins at rest), and so on, to identify important information and to be able to ask clarifying questions.

Meaningful,
Meaningless
Calculations
Students are presented with an unreduced expression for a calculation for a physical quantity describing a physical situation. They must decide whether the calculation is meaningful (i.e., it gives a value that tells us something legitimate about the physical situation) or is meaningless (i.e., the expression is a totally inappropriate use of a relation). These calculations should not be trivially meaningless, such as substituting a wrong numerical value into the expression. These items are best when the quantity calculated fits with students’ alternative conceptions.
Students are presented with an unreduced calculation for a physical calculation that involves a mathematical relationship, and students are asked if the calculation makes any sense.
These calculations can take many forms, but the most useful are those where the “meaningless” calculations illustrate common student misconceptions. Students could be asked about a situation in which there is a uniform magnetic field of specified magnitude directed toward the left and an electron traveling parallel to the field at a speed of 300 m/s. The students could then be told, “A student finds the magnetic force acting on the electron as the product of the speed, the charge, and the magnitude of the field. Is this a meaningful calculation for this situation?”
Model Questions
Students answer items from released AP Physics Exams.
Provides rigorous practice and assesses students’ ability to apply multiple physical practices on content as either a multiple choice or a free-response question.
Model questions can be AP released or AP-level questions.
These questions can be given as written or scaffolded for students earlier in the year to provide them with support.
Note Taking
Students create a record of information while reading a text or listening to a speaker.
Helps organize ideas and process information.
Have students write down verbal descriptions of the steps needed to solve a problem so that a record of the processes can be referred to at a later point in time.

Example
Predict and Explain
Predict and explain tasks describe a physical situation that is set up at a point where some event is about to occur. Students predict and explain what they think will happen. These tasks must involve situations with which the students are familiar or have sufficient background information in to enable them to understand the situation. This is important, because otherwise students usually do not feel comfortable enough to attempt to answer.
Stimulates thinking by asking students to make, check, and correct predictions based on evidence from the outcome.
When a pair of capacitors is set into a circuit, what would happen to the time to charge and/or discharge the circuit if a third capacitor is set in series with the original two capacitors?
Qualitative
Reasoning
These tasks can take a variety of forms, with their common denominator being qualitative analysis.
Frequently, students are presented with an initial and final situation and asked how some quantity, or aspect, will change.
Qualitative comparisons (e.g., the quantity increases, decreases, or stays the same) are often the appropriate answer.
Qualitative reasoning tasks can frequently contain elements found in some of the other task formats (e.g., different qualitative representations and a prediction or explanation).
Students are presented with a physical situation and asked to apply a principle to qualitatively reason what will happen. These questions are commonly found in multiple-choice question subtypes.
Ask students what would happen to the electric field surrounding a uniformly charged conducting sphere if the sphere were to have twice the charge, half the radius, or has become a hollow shell.
Additional questions could include asking the students about the electric field inside the sphere versus inside the shell.
Quickwrite
Students write for a short, specific amount of time about a designated topic.
Helps generate ideas in a short amount of time.
To help synthesize concepts after having learned how to calculate the derivative, students list as many real world situations as possible in which knowing the instantaneous rate of change of a function is advantageous.

Example
Ranking
Ranking tasks present students with a set of variations—sometimes three or four but usually six to eight—on a basic physical situation. The variations not only differ in value (numeric or symbolic) for the variables involved but also frequently include variables that are not important to the task. The students’ objective is to rank the variations on the basis of a specified physical quantity. Students must also explain the reasoning for their ranking scheme and rate their confidence in their ranking.
These tasks require students to engage in a comparison reasoning process that they seldom have opportunities to do in traditional problem solving.
Given six different circuits containing identical resistors, students are asked to rank the circuits by greatest total resistance.
Sharing and Responding
Students communicate with another person or a small group of peers who respond to a proposed problem solution.
Gives students the opportunity to discuss their work with peers, make suggestions for improvement to the work of others, and/or receive appropriate and relevant feedback on their own work.
Group students to review individual work (graphs, derivations, problem solutions, experimental designs, etc.).
Have the groups make any necessary corrections and build a single complete solution together.
Simplify the
Problem
Students use “friendlier” numbers or functions to help solve a problem.
Provides insight into the problem or the strategies needed to solve the problem.
For example, have students use the definition of an electric field surrounding a point charge to model the electric field around a uniformly charged conducting sphere.
Troubleshooting
Troubleshooting tasks are variations on the “What if
Anything Is Wrong?” task.
Students are explicitly told that there is an error in the given situation. Their job is to determine what the error is and explain how to correct it. These tasks can often produce interesting insights into students’ thinking because they will, at times, identify some correct aspect of the situation as erroneous.
This helps develop additional items.
Allows students to troubleshoot errors and misconceptions by focusing on problems that may arise when they do the same procedures themselves.
Provide students with a derivation or problem solution and ask them to find the incorrect step(s). Students must not only identify, but also explain, the mistake or misunderstanding that led to the mistake. This can also be done with diagrams and other representations.

Definition
Purpose
Example “What if
Anything Is
Wrong?”
Requires students to analyze a statement or diagrammed situation to determine whether it is correct or not. If everything is correct, the student is asked to explain the statement/situation and why it works as described.
If something is incorrect, the student has to identify the error and explain how to correct it. These are open-ended exercises, so they provide insight into students’ ideas, since they will often have interesting reasons for accepting incorrect situations and for rejecting legitimate situations. Often, students’ responses provide ideas for other items.
Allows students to troubleshoot errors and focus on problems that may arise when they do the same procedures themselves.
Provide students a force diagram that may or may not have incorrect forces drawn on it. Or, give students graphs of force and potential energy that “match” and ask them to determine whether the graphs do indeed correspond. This technique can also be used in derivations and problem solving where students are given the “complete” solution and are asked to verify that it was done correctly.
Write and Switch
Like graph and switch, but with writing. Students make observations, collect data, or make a claim and then switch papers.
Allows students to practice writing and giving and receiving feedback on each other’s work.
As students learn about creating an argument, they can draft an initial argument themselves, share their claim, evidence and reasoning with a partner, and receive feedback on their argument.
Working
Backward
This task reverses the order of the problem steps. For example, the given information could be an equation with specific values for all, or all but one, of the variables. The students must then construct a physical situation for which the given equation would apply. Such working backward tasks require students to take numerical values, including units, and translate them into physical variables. Working backward problems also require students to reason about these situations in an unusual way, and they often allow for more than one solution.
Provides another way to check possible answers for accuracy.
Students are given an equation such as 4

m e q u a l s 6 m over s minus 9 m over s squared  and are asked to create another representation from this equation. For example, a written scenario that this equation could represent may include position versus time graphs, velocity versus time graphs, motion maps, and so on.

Developing the Science
Practices
Throughout the course, students will develop skills that are fundamental to the discipline of physics. Since these
practices represent the complex skills that adept physicists demonstrate, students will benefit from multiple
opportunities to develop them in a scaffolded manner. Through the use of guided questioning, discussion
techniques, and other instructional strategies, teachers can help their students practice applying these skills in new
contexts, providing an important foundation for their college and career readiness.
Analyze and/or use [non-narrative/non-mathematical] representations of physical situations, excluding graphs.
The real world is extremely complex. When physicists describe and explain phenomena, they try to simplify real
objects, systems, and processes to make the analysis manageable. These simplifications or models are used to
predict how new phenomena will occur. A simple model may treat a system as an object, neglecting the system’s
internal structure and behavior. More complex models are models of a system of objects, such as an ideal gas.
A process can be simplified, too, and models can be both conceptual and mathematical. To make a good model,
one needs to identify a set of the most important characteristics of a phenomenon or system that may simplify
analysis. Inherent in the construction of models that physicists invent is the use of representations. Examples of
representations used to model introductory physics are pictures, free-body diagrams, force diagrams, graphs,
energy bar charts, and momentum bar charts. Representations help in analyzing phenomena, making predictions,
and communicating ideas. AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism requires students to use and/or analyze and/or
re-express models and representations of natural or man-made systems.

Science Practice 2: Question and Method
Determine scientific questions and methods.
Scientific questions can range in scope from broad to narrow, as well as in specificity, from determining influencing
factors and/or causes to determining mechanism. The question posed will determine the type of data to be
collected and will influence the plan for collecting data. Designing and improving experimental designs and/or
data collection strategies is a learned skill. Class discussion can reveal issues of measurement uncertainty and
assumptions in the data collection. Students need to understand that the results of collecting and using data to
determine a numerical answer to a question is best thought of as an interval, not a single number. This interval, the
experimental uncertainty, is due to a combination of uncertainty in the instruments used and the process of taking
the measurement. Although detailed error analysis is not necessary to convey this pivotal idea, it is important that
students make some reasoned estimate of the interval within which they know the value of a measured data point
and express their results in a way that makes this clear.
Laboratory experience is also important in helping students understand the topics being considered. Thus it is
valuable to ask students to write informally about what they have done, observed, and concluded in well-organized
laboratory notebooks. Some questions or parts of questions on the AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism
Exam deal with lab-related skills, such as design of experiments, data analysis, and error analysis, and are intended
to distinguish between students who have had laboratory experience and those who have not. In addition, the
understanding gained in the laboratory may improve a student’s test performance overall.
Examples of scientific experiments include guided, inquiry-based, hands-on lab investigations; individual, hands-on
lab investigations; lab demonstrations; or lab-based, hands-on classroom activities.

Science Practice 3: Representing Data and Phenomena
Create visual representations or models of physical situations.
The AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism course requires several key skills, including drawing and interpreting
graphs and representing data or physical relationships in graphical form. Students need to be able to think about
the material in their physics courses in terms of conceptual, verbal, graphical, and mathematical ideas. As part of
these comprehensive skills for understanding the physical world around them, students must be able to perform
graphical analysis in its many forms. With the use of graphing calculators, students appear to be losing the ability
to draw, interpret, and understand graphs. There appears to be a disconnect between what students learn in their
mathematics courses and how they apply that knowledge in their physics course. For example, even if students
have learned graphing in previous math courses and understand the concept of slope, they may have difficulty
understanding that the slope of a displacement-versus-time graph is the velocity. The AP Physics C: Electricity and
Magnetism course should provide opportunities to bridge the gap between physics and mathematics for students.
The following table provides examples of strategies for implementing data and phenomena representation resources into the course:

Have students identify correct graphs by giving them a “What if Anything Is Wrong?” task.
Present students with a set of data and matching graph and have them identify what, if anything, is wrong with the graph. The “wrong” things can be simple at first (scales not uniform, labels left off), and then later in the course can be scaffolded to be more difficult and address student misconceptions.

Science Practice 4: Data Analysis
Analyze quantitative data represented in graphs.
Students often think that to make a graph they need to connect the data points or that the best-fit function is always
linear. Thus, it is important that they can construct a best-fit curve even for data that do not fit a linear relationship.
Students should be able to represent data points as intervals whose size depends on the experimental uncertainty.
After students find a pattern in the data, they need to ask why this pattern is present and try to explain it using
the knowledge that they have. When dealing with a new phenomenon, they should be able to devise a testable
explanation of the pattern if possible. It is important that students understand that instruments do not produce
exact measurements and learn what steps they can take to decrease the uncertainty.
Students should be able to design a second experiment to determine the same quantity and then check for
consistency across the two measurements, comparing two results by writing them both as intervals and not as
single, absolute numbers. Finally, students should be able to revise their reasoning based on the new data, data
for some that may appear anomalous. The analysis, interpretation, and application of quantitative information are
vital skills for students in AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism. Analysis skills can be taught using any type
of data, but students will be more invested in the data analysis if it is data they have collected through their own
investigations. Teachers should provide opportunities for students to analyze data, draw conclusions, and apply
their knowledge of the enduring understandings and learning objectives.

Have students practice demonstrating consistency between graphical representations by doing four-square problem solving.
Students are given a physical scenario from the textbook,

Science Practice 5: Theoretical Relationships
Determine the effects on a quantity when another quantity or the physical situation changes.
Physicists commonly use mathematical representations to describe and explain phenomena as well as to solve
problems. When students work with these representations, they should understand the connections between
the mathematical description, the physical phenomena, and the concepts represented in the mathematical
descriptions. When using equations or mathematical representations, students need to be able to justify why
using a particular equation to analyze a particular situation is useful as well as to be aware of the conditions under
which the equations/mathematical representations can be used. Because students tend to rely too much on
mathematical representations, when solving a problem they need to be able to describe the problem situation in
multiple ways, including pictorial representations and force diagrams, and then choose an appropriate mathematical
representation instead of first choosing a formula whose variables seem to match the givens in the problem.
Students should be able to work with the algebraic form of the equation before substituting values, and should be
able to evaluate the equation(s) and the answer in terms of units and limiting case analysis. Students should also
be able to translate between functional relationships in equations (proportionalities, inverse proportionalities, etc.)
and cause-and-effect relationships in the physical world. Finally, students are expected to be able to evaluate a
numerical result in terms of whether it makes sense. In many physical situations, simple mathematical routines may
be needed to arrive at a result even though they are not the focus of a learning objective.

Science Practice 6: Mathematical Routines
Solve problems of physical situations using mathematical relationships.
Students need to be proficient in problem solving and in the application of fundamental principles to a wide
variety of situations. Problem-solving abilities can be fostered by scaffolded practice and exposure to a range
of challenging problems. In general, the purpose of allowing calculators and equation sheets to be used on both
sections of the AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism Exam is to place greater emphasis on the understanding
and application of fundamental physical principles and concepts. The availability of equations for all students
means that, on the exam, little or no credit will be awarded for simply writing down equations. For solving problems,
a sophisticated scientific or graphing calculator is no substitute for a thorough grasp of the physics involved. It
should be noted that although fewer topics are covered in AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism than in AP
Physics 1, they are covered in greater depth and with greater analytical and mathematical sophistication, including calculus applications.
The following table provides examples of questions and instructional strategies for implementing mathematical routine resources into the course:

Strategies 6.A Extract quantities from narratives or mathematical relationships to solve problems.
§Bullet What quantities are given?
§Bullet What quantity is needed to answer the question?
§Bullet What relationship(s) link the needed with the given quantities?
Have students practice extracting quantities from narratives and/or mathematical relationships by giving them working backward tasks. These tasks require students to reason about physical situations in an unusual way, and often allow for more than one solution.
For example, give students the following equation and ask them to create another representation or a written explanation of the physical scenario.
Mu subscr ip t s

§Bullet §Bullet Are the steps clearly written out and annotated?
§Bullet Are any steps skipped?
§Bullet Is the unknown quantity clearly labeled as the final answer, complete with units?
Have students practice calculating unknown quantities from known quantities by assigning them a “What if Anything Is

Science Practice 7: Argumentation
Develop an explanation or scientific argument.
A scientific explanation, accounting for an observed phenomenon, needs to be experimentally testable. One should
be able to use it to make predictions about new phenomenon. A theory uses a unified approach to account for a
large set of phenomena and gives accounts that are consistent with multiple experimental outcomes within the
range of applicability of the theory. Examples of theories in physics include the kinetic molecular theory, quantum
theory, and atomic theory. Students should understand the difference between explanations and theories.
Students should be prepared to offer evidence to construct reasoned arguments for their claim from the evidence,
and to use the claim or explanation to make predictions. A prediction states the expected outcome of a particular
experimental design based on an explanation or a claim under scrutiny.
Physicists examine data and evidence to develop claims about physical phenomena. As they articulate their claims,
physicists use reasoning processes that rely on their awareness of different types of relationships, connections,
and patterns within the data and evidence. They then formulate a claim and develop an argument that explains how
the claim is supported by the available evidence. AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism teachers should help
students learn how to create persuasive and meaningful arguments by improving their proficiency with each of these skills.
