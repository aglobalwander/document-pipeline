## Trust in the Environment

Just as a picture is drawn by an artist, surroundings are created by the activities of the mind.

-Buddha

Many authors indicate that the culture of the workplace influences staff performance more than teachers' experience, skills, knowledge, training, or staff development (Seashore-Lewis, Marks, and Kruse 1996). Subtle signals from the environment, culture, and climate of the organization influence co-workers' thoughts, behaviors, and perceptions. Employees are quick to perceive the congruity between a learning organization's stated core values and its day-to-day practices. If there is consistency, greater trust will exist; the organization 'walks its talk.' If there is inconsistency, suspicion and mistrust will arise.
