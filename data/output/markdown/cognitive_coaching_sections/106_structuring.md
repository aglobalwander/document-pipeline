## STRUCTURING

Structuring is defined as the many ways in which a coach clearly communicates expectations about purposes and the use of such resources as time, space, and materials. Where the coach and colleague sit during a coaching conversation can influence a feeling of a co-creating or a supervisory relationship.

Verbal structuring should be clear, conscious, and deliberate. It should be based on a common understanding of the purposes for the coaching, the roles the coach should play, the time allotments, the most desirable location for the conversation, and the placement of the coach during the observation. Examples of verbal structuring behavior include the following:

- Since you want me to observe the group members' participation, I'll need to sit in a place in the room where I can see them all during the meeting. Where would that be?

- It will take us about 15 minutes for a planning conversation. Let's set a time that would be convenient for both of us.
- Here is a copy of the map of the coaching cycle. During the planning conversation, I'll be asking you to share with me your goals and objectives, which instructional strategies you plan to use to achieve those goals, and by what indicators you'll know your students achieved your purposes. I'll also be asking you to give me directions for what to look for during the lesson that will be of assistance to you.
