## Eye Movement

With the advent of research in brain specialization, scientists have investigated the relationship between particular types of eye-movement patterns and variations in brain functioning (Garmston, Lipton, and Kaiser 1998). Although controlled laboratory testing has yielded inconsistent results, the relationship between eye movements and cognitive functioning has been well documented (Jensen 1996; Ornstein 1991, 39; Kinsbourne 1972, 1973; Kocel, Galin, Ornstein, and Merrin 1972). Coaches use this information to guide interactions, as we explore in this chapter.

In 1977 Robert Dilts conducted a study at the Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute in San Francisco that correlated eye movements to specific cognitive processes. Electrodes tracked both the eye movements and brain-wave characteristics of subjects who were asked questions related to using the various senses of sight, hearing, and feeling for tasks involving both memory and mental construction. Dilts's findings tended to confirm other tests that showed that lateralization of eye movements accompanied brain activity during different cognitive tasks. This pattern also seemed to hold for tasks requiring different senses.

Cognitive activity in one hemisphere triggers eye movements in the opposite hemisphere. The following eye-movement patterns provide a

description of internal sensory activity for 90 percent of right-handed persons (figure 10.3). This information is reversed for many (but not all) left-handed persons.

- Looking up and to one's left allows us to access stored pictures (visual recall). This is seen often in reflecting conversations (figure 10.4).
- Looking up and to one's right indicates the creation of new images (visual construct). This is seen often in planning conversations (figure 10.5).
- Eyes go horizontally to one's left when we are accessing stored sounds (auditory recall), as when we are recalling in a reflecting conversation.
- Eyes go horizontally to one's right when we are creating new sounds, as in mentally rehearsing before we speak (auditory construct).
- Eyes down and to one's left is common when we are talking to ourselves (internal dialogue). This position and the next must be differentiated from another cause of looking down: a learned behavior that indicates respect, in some cultures.
- Looking down and to one's right is common when we are experiencing feelings (kinesthetic).
- Looking straight ahead when answering a question may mean accessing memorized information, such as 'What is your name?'

The coach's question invites the teacher to locate internal resources to employ with her challenge. The coach waits while the teacher's eyes indicate for the coach that an internal search is occurring. She searches at the 10 and 2 o'clock positions, pauses at 2:00, returns to 10:00, then drops her eyes to what appears to be 7:00. Since this teacher is a normally organized right-hander, the coach can infer that she has been accessing visual memory and visual construction with a final check to emotions. Readers wishing to gain skills in inferring cognitive processes from observing eye movements might observe the entire reflecting conversation with this teacher in chapter 11.

Coaches use eye-movement information to select language congruent with the representational system the teacher is using. More important, because eye movements reveal the duration of cognitive processing, the coach knows when to use wait time and how long to wait. Eye movements signal that someone is focusing attention internally, when additional comments or questions can't be processed.

Auditory processing is quick. Persons who process information visually take slightly longer, and processing kinesthetically takes the longest. Science educator Mary Budd Rowe found that teachers who extended their wait time after asking students questions (from the normal one-half second to three to five seconds) produced impressive gains in students' higher-

order thinking (Rowe 1996). Later neurological research finds that it takes that long to receive information, process it, and formulate a response.

An example of eye movements may be seen in video 10.1, which can be found at www.thinkingcollaborative.com/supporting-audio-videos/10-1/. Carolee asks Ochan a question, which initiates Ochan's internal search. Notice her eye movements. From what you have learned about eye movements and representational systems, what are some inferences you might make about Ochan's internal search?
