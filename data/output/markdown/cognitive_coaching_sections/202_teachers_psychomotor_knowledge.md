## Teachers' Psychomotor Knowledge

Psychomotor knowledge includes the physical skills and abilities a teacher uses to negotiate daily life in the classroom. Most psychomotor skills are stored in memory in a fashion identical to mental processes, and they are

stored in an 'if-then' syntax. As such, they have a strong linguistic base: For example, if the students are misbehaving, then the teacher silently moves to a space reserved for group discipline, stands with authority and a serious expression, and directs students in a credible voice about proper behavior. If she believes that students have listened and understood, then she pauses, walks silently back to the instructional position, changes to a more melodic teaching voice, and resumes teaching (Grinder 1993).

Because psychomotor skills are usually learned through observation, instruction, and behavioral feedback, they have strong nonlinguistic representations. The affective system is usually not engaged unless a teacher had some strong negative or positive emotional experience connected to the skills. Psychomotor learning is not the domain of Cognitive Coaching; rather, it is the function of a consulting relationship. (See chapter 5 for the distinctions between consulting and Cognitive Coaching.)

Our brains constantly strive to satisfy and resolve discrepancies perceived in the environment. Information that the brain has not processed remains in memory for very short periods of time. Merely experiencing something or memorizing without acting on that information commits it only to short-term memory. This fact may explain the unusual power of Cognitive Coaching.

Most data perceived by the brain are either not attended to (and therefore never enter short-term memory) or are not processed and are forgotten within 18 seconds (Wolfe 1987). Much of the daily experience of teaching, therefore, is forgotten and not explained, its potential influence for teacher learning lost. Processing the instructional experience allows the teacher to facilitate construction of new meanings and insights.

The coach's role is to engage and mediate the teacher's cognitive systems. When Cognitive Coaching is used, teachers may process the same teaching event as least six times, providing an effective form of mental rehearsal. Mental rehearsal techniques can help improve performance even in areas as complex as teaching (Williams 2012).

- 1.  Before the planning conversation, teachers formulate their objectives and plans.
- 2.  During the planning conversation, they engage in deep, proactive mental rehearsal during which the coach questions, paraphrases, and clarifies in ways that help the teacher to be more precise with lesson strategies.
- 3.  Instruction then occurs, with the teacher's conscious awareness about

key elements greatly heightened.

- 4.  The teacher recalls the instructional event in preparation for the reflecting conversation.
- 5.  The teacher recalls the instructional event during the reflecting conversation.
- 6.  Finally, the teacher continues to reflect and refine after the reflecting conversation, especially when closure was not reached on a subject or issue.

The long-range outcome of Cognitive Coaching is to habituate the intellectual formation of effective thinking: acquiring the habits and dispositions of self-directed learning. The teacher must aim to continue growing intellectually by internalizing these intellectual processes and experiencing them when the coach is not present: to be self-managing, self-monitoring, and self-modifying. In this way, the intellectual functions and mental processes of effective teaching become automatic.
