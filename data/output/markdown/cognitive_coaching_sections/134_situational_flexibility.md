## SITUATIONAL FLEXIBILITY

In chapter 1, we described four types of support provided to teachers as they mature in the profession: coaching, collaborating, consulting, and evaluating. Table 5.1 summarizes the purposes and intended outcomes of three of these.

As can be seen in tables 1.1 and 5.1, these forms of interaction are guided by consciously chosen purposes and outcomes. These support functions share a set of skills (described in chapter 3) and, for our purposes, exist within a framework of beliefs and concepts that we call Cognitive Coaching. Therefore, each is used as a stance within a support provider's repertoire for its contribution to the development of professional expertise and self-directedness.

Skillful coaches may depart from Cognitive Coaching periodically to conduct these other forms of interactions. Because they continually strive to fulfill their identity as mediators, however, they consciously begin with and return to the beliefs, values, principles, maps, and tools of Cognitive Coaching as their 'default position.'
