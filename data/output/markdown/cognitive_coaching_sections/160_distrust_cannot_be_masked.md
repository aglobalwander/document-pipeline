## Distrust Cannot Be Masked

You can't trick someone into a trusting relationship. Babad, Bernieri, and Rosenthal (1991) conducted a study in which five groups of judges viewed 10-second film clips of teachers talking to or about students. The judges, who ranged from fourth graders to experienced teachers, were asked to rate the students' scholastic excellence and the teacher's love for each student. In some cases, the judges heard teachers talking about students; in other cases they simply watched, with no sound, as the teacher talked to a student (who was not visible). In each case, one was a good student of high potential and one was a weak student of limited potential.

None of the judges had difficulty detecting students' excellence and teachers' love. The negative affect that teachers tried to conceal was detected by observers through 'leaks' in communication channels that are not under as much conscious control as what the teachers were saying to the students (Babad, Bernieri, and Rosenthal 1991). The teachers' words gave them away when they talked about students; their actions alone gave them away when they talked to students. We can consciously take action to nurture trust and rapport, but we can't mask our true feelings.
