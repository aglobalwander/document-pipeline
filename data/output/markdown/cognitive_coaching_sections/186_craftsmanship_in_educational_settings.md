## Craftsmanship in Educational Settings

To further appreciate craftsmanship, consider studies from the League of Professional Schools (Lunsford 1995). They found that in schools where teachers are the most successful, these same teachers have the highest dissatisfaction with their work. The drive for elaboration, clarity, refinement, and precision-all attributes of craftsmanship-serve as energy sources from which faculties improve instruction and student learning.

Teachers are required to cope with complex, often unexpected tasks. Meeting a challenge requires readiness not only to excel in a familiar area but also to confront unfamiliar and complex problems. Meeting a challenge relates to something that does not already exist; it entails anticipating potential outcomes and strategies. Teachers who exhibit craftsmanship can meet challenges. Such teachers:

- Strive to continually perfect their craft

- Set and work to attain personal high standards
- Pursue ongoing learning
- Seek precision, mastery, refinement, and pride in their artistry
- Generate and hold clear visions and goals
- Strive for exactness of critical thought processes and communication
- Test and revise, constantly honing strategies to reach goals
- Attend to what they know and what they still need to learn

The craftsman-like teacher is also precise in managing temporal dimensions. Teachers orchestrate across six time dimensions: sequence (in what order), duration (for how long), rhythm (at what tempo, pattern, and speed), simultaneity (along with what else), synchronization (with whom and what), and short- and long-term perspectives. A craftsman-like teacher strives for excellence in each of these dimensions.
