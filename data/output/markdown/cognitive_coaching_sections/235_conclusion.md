## CONCLUSION

Teaching is one of the most cognitively complex professions. Although the knowledge base of teaching and learning is vast and continually expanding, there is still uncertainty as to what works in various schools in diverse communities with each unique group of students. Intersecting with teachers' cognitive and professional development are stages of adult growth and teaching standards. We believe, therefore, that what makes teaching a profession is the continual inquiry, expansion of repertoire, and accumulation of knowledge through practice.

The professional educator continually experiments, inquires, tests, gathers data, revises, and modifies thought and practice. Such accumulated knowledge influences teaching decisions in at least the six domains described here. Continuing inquiry into these areas constitutes career-long agendas for professional growth. Cognitive Coaching helps teachers to

integrate, extend, and apply this information in the crucible of classroom work.
