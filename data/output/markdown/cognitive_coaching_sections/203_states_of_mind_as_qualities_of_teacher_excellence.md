## STATES OF MIND AS QUALITIES OF TEACHER EXCELLENCE

In chapter 7, we introduced and explored five states of mind-efficacy, flexibility, consciousness, craftsmanship, and interdependence-as sources of excellence that drive human performance. Our aim is to focus the coach's capacities on mediating the energy sources that fuel self-directed learning, behavior, and, ultimately, the development of capacities for effective action in holonomous settings. The five states of mind we described are also the wellsprings that nurture teachers, professional learning communities, and schools.

Cognitive Coaches, being intensely concerned with teacher quality, realize the manifestations of those states of mind in the complexity of everyday classroom situations:

- What is the likelihood teachers will persevere through disappointment and challenge in their teaching, spending additional time, consulting others, and reviewing and revising their decisions when hoped for results have not occurred? (Efficacy)
- What is the likelihood that faced with a stubborn student problem the teacher will look at it from various perspectives and can see the

- viewpoints of a student, a disappointed parent, or a teacher from years past? (Flexibility)
- What is the likelihood that in the process of teaching and concentrating on the responses of an individual student, the teacher can also cast a sharp eye over the classroom to monitor the full class? (Consciousness)
- What is the likelihood that the teacher will insist on quality performance from both themselves and from students-and accept nothing less? (Craftsmanship)
- What is the likelihood that the teacher will regard teaching as a collaborative pursuit, engaging with others in applying systemic solutions to persistent problems? (Interdependence) (Costa, Garmston, and Zimmerman 2014)

This vision of quality teaching requires that Cognitive Coaches focus more deeply than those observable teacher behaviors by understanding that quality has more to do with the invisible mental attitudes, thinking dispositions, and innate drives than with discrete moments of success. When teachers and Cognitive Coaches focus collectively on the five states of mind, they become more positive, productive, and powerful.

This same belief is true for teachers' work in classrooms with their students as well. For example: Flexible teachers can make a distinction between and hold both surface and deep learning, immediate and longrange outcomes in mind when planning, conducting, and reflecting upon a lesson. Surface learning is more about the content: Do students know the content, the ideas for this lesson, and doing what is needed to demonstrate mastery? Deep learning, however, is more about understanding, relating, and extending ideas, and an intention to understand and transfer meaning for oneself and to other situations in school, life, and work.
