The IB Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous, academically challenging and
balanced programme of education designed to prepare students aged 16 to 19
for success at university and life beyond. The DP aims to encourage students to be
knowledgeable, inquiring, caring and compassionate, and to develop intercultural
understanding, open-mindedness and the attitudes necessary to respect and evalu ate a range of viewpoints. Approaches to teaching and learning (ATL) within the DP
are deliberate strategies, skills and attitudes that permeate the teaching and learning
environment. In the DP students develop skills from five ATL categories: thinking,
research, social, self-management and communication.
To ensure both breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding, students must
choose at least one subject from five groups: 1) their best language, 2) additional lan guage(s), 3) social sciences, 4) experimental sciences, and 5) mathematics. Students
may choose either an arts subject from group 6, or a second subject from groups
1 to 5. At least three and not more than four subjects are taken at higher level (240
recommended teaching hours), while the remaining are taken at standard level (150
recommended teaching hours). In addition, three core elements—the extended
essay, theory of knowledge and creativity, action, service—
are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.
These IB DP subject briefs illustrate four key course components.

I. Course description and aims
Chemistry is an experimental science that combines academic study
with the acquisition of practical and investigational skills. Chemical
principles underpin both the physical environment in which we live
and all biological systems. Chemistry is often a prerequisite for many
other courses in higher education, such as medicine, biological science and environmental science.
Both theory and practical work should be undertaken by all students
as they complement one another naturally, both in school and in the
wider scientific community. The DP chemistry course allows students
to develop a wide range of practical skills  and to increase facility in the
use of mathematics. It also allows students to develop interpersonal
and information technology skills, which are essential to life in the 21st century.
By studying chemistry students should become aware of how scientists
work and communicate with each other. While the scientific method
may take on a wide variety of forms, it is the emphasis on a practical
approach through experimental work that characterizes the subject.
Teachers provide students with opportunities to develop manipulative
skills, design investigations, collect data, analyse results and evaluate and communicate their findings.
Through the overarching theme of the nature of science, the aims of
the DP chemistry course are to enable students to:
1.	 appreciate scientific study and creativity within a global context through stimulating and challenging opportunities
2.	 acquire a body of knowledge, methods and techniques that char acterize science and technology
3.	 apply and use a body of knowledge, methods and techniques that characterize science and technology
4.	 develop an ability to analyse, evaluate and synthesize scientific in formation
5.	 develop a critical awareness of the need for, and the value of, effec tive collaboration and communication during scientific activities
6.	 develop experimental and investigative scientific skills including the use of current technologies
7.	 develop and apply 21st century communication skills in the study of science
8.	 become critically aware, as global citizens, of the ethical implica tions of using science and technology
9.	 develop an appreciation of the possibilities and limitations of sci ence and technology
10.	develop an understanding of the relationships between scientific
disciplines and their influence on other areas of knowledge.

The group 4 project
The group 4 project is a collaborative activity where students from
different group 4 subjects, within or between schools, work together. It
allows for concepts and perceptions from across disciplines to be shared
while appreciating the environmental, social and ethical implications of
science and technology. It can be practically or theoretically based and
aims to develop an understanding of the relationships between scien tific disciplines and their influence on other areas of knowledge. The
emphasis is on interdisciplinary cooperation and the scientific processes.
III. Assessment model
Studying this course, students should be able to fulfill the following assessment objectives:
1.	 Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of:
• facts, concepts, and terminology • methodologies and techniques • communicating scientific information.
2.	 Apply:
• facts, concepts, and terminology • methodologies and techniques
• methods of communicating scientific information.
3.	 Formulate, analyse and evaluate:
• hypotheses, research questions and predictions • methodologies and techniques • primary and secondary data • scientific explanations.
4.	 Demonstrate the appropriate research, experimental, and person al skills necessary to carry out insightful and ethical investigations.
