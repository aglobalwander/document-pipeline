## When to Consult

How does a support provider know when to switch from coaching to consulting? One coach describes her thinking process as follows. First, she knows the teacher well enough to detect when the teacher lacks necessary information or ideas. Second, based on her knowledge of what has worked for this teacher in the past (including the teacher's information processing style and the degree of risk to the teacher in acting on possibilities in this situation), she knows the teacher has the capacity to implement ideas she might offer. Third, the teacher may request help.

The following is a description of how coaching, collaborating, and consulting might be woven together over a three-week period with a beginning teacher.

- 1.  Coach: The teacher expresses interest in guided reading. The support person invites reflection about her intention, values, goals, and planning.
- 2.  Consult: The teacher realizes there are gaps in her knowledge about

- how to conduct guided reading. The support person shares ideas, locates information, and gives the teacher an article about guided reading.
- 3.  Collaborate: The support person discusses the article and engages the teacher in co-planning. She and the teacher share ideas about how to get started.
- 4.  Consult: At the teacher's request, the support person models a guided reading lesson. When asked for strategies, she offers some for consideration.
- 5.  Coach: The teacher asks the support person to observe. The support person, fully into the coaching role, gathers requested data and conducts a reflecting conversation after the lesson.
- 6.  Collaborate: The support person and the beginning teacher examine student data together and determine an area for future instruction. Together they plan the next lesson.

The best coaches see their work as a dance in which they are constantly deciding when to turn, dip, or bop while maintaining a partnership with the teacher.

When coaching, support providers may be especially generous with silence. They also might ask teachers to elaborate on the values and beliefs they hold about learning. Sometimes they allow teachers to 'fail forward' in order to develop rich learning from lessons that did not go as the teacher wanted. Efficacious people who 'fail forward' learn from their experiences and apply it to new situations. Coaches also ask 'take-away' questions for the teacher to ponder after the coaching conversation. Such questions do not require an answer in the moment. Rather, they are intended for later reflection. Occasionally, coaches model their own reflective thought.

Practices unique to collaboration might include physically helping a new teacher to arrange a classroom or supplies, procuring materials, demonstrating, co-planning, or co-teaching.

Even beginning teachers have a wealth of life experiences on which to draw as we engage them in planning and reflecting about instruction. Teachers report far more satisfaction with coaching than with consulting, and even young and inexperienced teachers bring the cognitive capacity for coaching. Some new teachers may require more collaborating and consulting, and the coach does so with a mind-set to move toward gradual release in more coaching and less collaborating and consulting.

We do not regard these functions as points on a continuum; rather, we

view them as a mosaic being chosen in the moment, based on perceived appropriateness to meet various intentions and teacher permission. In fact, support providers may want to start interactions with coaching and collaborating and move to consulting only when they see a need. Some supervision models presumed that reflective conversations are only appropriate for teachers with advanced skills and that, prior to this level of development, teachers needed to be 'taught' about instruction in 'coaching' conversations that are in reality forms of consulting.
