About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills
that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking AP
courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and AP
Exams are developed and scored by college faculty and
experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges and
universities in the United States grant credit, advanced placement, or both on the basis of successful AP
Exam scores—more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the content
and skills that are the focus of the corresponding
college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also
organizes the content and skills into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many AP teachers have
told us they follow in order to focus their instruction.
The intention of this publication is to respect teachers’
time and expertise by providing a roadmap that they
can modify and adapt to their local priorities and
preferences. Moreover, by organizing the AP course
content and skills into units, the AP Program is able
to provide teachers and students with free formative assessments—Personal Progress Checks—that
teachers can assign throughout the year to measure
student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students:
Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically
challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to equitable preparation and
access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses:
The AP Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle that each school implements its own curriculum that will enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP
courses must participate in the AP Course Audit, a
process through which AP teachers’ course materials
are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.

AP Music Theory Course and Exam Description

=== Page 9 ===
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the AP teacher
and the school principal (or designated administrator) to
confirm awareness and understanding of the curricular
and resource requirements. A syllabus or course outline,
detailing how course requirements are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The AP
Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor; all
AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision, piloting,
and analysis to ensure that questions are accurate, fair,
and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development, College
Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher education
institutions. This feedback is carefully considered to
ensure that AP courses and exams are able to provide
students with a college-level learning experience and
the opportunity to demonstrate their qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam development process, relies on the expertise of both AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course
performance assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands of college faculty and expert AP
teachers. Most are scored at the annual AP Reading,
while a small portion is scored online. All AP Readers
are thoroughly trained, and their work is monitored
throughout the Reading for fairness and consistency.
In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response questions and performance assessments are weighted and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a curve.
Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which means that
every student who meets the criteria for an AP score of
2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no matter how many
students that is. The criteria for the number of points
students must earn on the AP Exam to receive scores
of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently
validates for credit and placement purposes—include:
§§ The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
§§ The number of points researchers have found to be predictive that an AP student will succeed when
placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
§§ Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting
AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’ achievement in the equivalent college course.
Frequent and regular research studies establish the validity of AP scores as follows:
AP Score

AP Music Theory Course and Exam Description

=== Page 10 ===
While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for
scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and universities.
To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/placement policy, a search engine is available at apstudent .collegeboard.org/creditpolicies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score the free-response sections of the AP Exams.
Ninety-eight percent of surveyed educators who took
part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an AP
Reader, including opportunities to:
§§ Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning AP
Readers—both high school and college educators— make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the AP Reading.
§§ Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP
scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure to the quality and depth of the responses from the
entire pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
§§ Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
§§ Score from home: AP Readers have online distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects. Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
§§ Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs): AP
Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide suggests a
sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds skill instruction across units, organizes content
into topics, and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers, and
free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress Checks are
formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher effectiveness
or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course topics and skills, create
customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.
* To report misuses, please call 877-274-6474 (International: +1-212-632-1781).

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
§§ Teachers and students sign in to, or create, their College Board accounts.
§§ Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
§§ Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
§§ Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP coordinator.
§§ Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and AP coordinators
to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following additional benefits:
§§ Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
§§ Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
§§ Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student
pack. The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
§§ Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

§§ Review the overview at the start of each unit guide to identify essential questions,
conceptual understandings, and skills for each unit.
§§ Use the Unit at a Glance table to identify related topics that build toward a common
understanding, and then plan appropriate pacing for students.
§§ Identify useful strategies in the Instructional Approaches section to help teach the concepts and skills.
Teach
When teaching, supporting resources could be used to build students’ conceptual understanding and their mastery of skills.
§§ Use the topic pages in the unit guides to identify the required content.
§§ Integrate the content with a skill, considering any appropriate scaffolding.
§§ Employ any of the instructional strategies previously identified.
§§ Use the available resources on the topic pages to bring a variety of assets into the classroom.
Assess

About the AP Music
Theory Course
The AP Music Theory course corresponds to one-to-two semesters of typical, introductory
college music theory coursework that covers topics such as musicianship, theory, and musical
materials and procedures. Musicianship skills, including dictation and listening skills, sight singing, and harmony, are an important part of the course. Through the course, students develop
the ability to recognize, understand, and describe basic materials and processes of tonal music
that are heard or presented in a score. Development of aural (listening) skills is a primary objective.
Performance is also part of the curriculum through the practice of sight-singing. Students learn
basic concepts and terminology by listening to and performing a wide variety of music. Notational
skills, speed, and fluency with basic materials are emphasized.
College Course Equivalent
Because college curricula vary for beginning music theory courses, the college-level course
equivalency of AP Music Theory will vary from one institution to the next.
Prerequisites
There are no prerequisite courses for AP Music Theory. Prospective students should be
able to read and write musical notation and have basic performance skills with voice or an instrument.
AP MUSIC THEORY RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS
§§ The school ensures that each student has access to his or her own copy of a recently published college-level music theory textbook.
§§ The school provides access to audio equipment and materials that facilitate listening practice for the students throughout the course.
§§ The school ensures that each AP Music Theory classroom includes a piano or electronic keyboard and sound reproduction equipment.

Introduction
The AP Music Theory course focuses on concepts and skills emphasized
within introductory college music theory courses, with the goal of helping
students become sophisticated and thoughtful music listeners, performers,
and composers. AP Music Theory students learn to recognize, understand,
describe, and produce the basic elements and processes of performed and
notated music. To become proficient with these skills, students need to
consistently practice applying course concepts through aural analysis, score
analysis, sight-singing, dictation, and composition.
The course framework integrates the teaching of
written and aural (listening) skills to support students’
learning, offering options for course design, learning activities, and assessment strategies.  Detailed information is provided about what students need
to know and be able to do to achieve success on the
AP Music Theory Exam, to earn opportunities for
college credit and placement, and to be well prepared for subsequent music theory studies. Teachers are
encouraged to adapt the course to their own and their
students’ diverse musical backgrounds and interests.
Teachers can create their own curriculum by selecting
content that enables students to achieve the course learning objectives and that meets state or local curricular requirements.
The AP Program is guided by high school and college
faculty in defining coursework equivalent to first year college classes in music theory, considering
variances in college curricula. The course framework
details a range of understandings and skills typical of introductory college courses. The AP Music Theory
Exam measures the degree to which students have developed the knowledge and skills essential for placement out of introductory college coursework.
These concepts and skills can be addressed with a thorough analysis of diverse music, including music from standard Western tonal repertoire and
contemporary art music, jazz, popular music, and the music of non-Western cultures. Although beginning
college courses focus on the system of major–minor tonality, they often introduce modal, pentatonic, whole-tone, and other scales.  Although some
AP Music Theory learning objectives are explicitly linked to European art music from the common
practice period (c. 1600–1900 CE), teachers should
include a variety of music in their instruction to
respond to students’ interests and to prepare them for the AP Music Theory Exam.

BIG IDEA 1: PITCH (PIT)
Specific frequencies of sound, known as pitches, are basic units of music.
Pitches that are deliberately sequenced through time create melodies, and
groups of pitches presented successively or simultaneously form chords.
Within an established musical style, chords relate to one another in the
context of harmony. Individual voices can also be imbued with a cohesive
sense of motion and interaction through musical voice leading, which is rooted in historical traditions.

BIG IDEA 2: RHYTHM (RHY)
Music exists in the dimension of time, where long and short sounds and
silences can be combined in myriad ways. This temporal aspect, called
rhythm, is often governed by a layered structure of interrelated pulses
known as meter. Rhythms are typically grouped into distinctive rhythmic
patterns, which help define the specific identity of a musical passage.
Musicians use established rhythmic devices to expand expressive
possibilities, often achieving their effect by challenging the regularity of the meter or transforming rhythmic patterns.
BIG IDEA 3: FORM (FOR)
Music exhibits a structural aspect known as form, in which a musical
composition is organized in a hierarchy of constituent parts. The specific
ways these parts are related, contrasted, and/or developed produce the
unique profile of an individual composition. Specific formal types and
functions may be identified when parts of a composition follow established
melodic-harmonic patterns or fulfill established roles within the overall hierarchical structure.
BIG IDEA 4: MUSICAL DESIGN (DES)
Texture, timbre, and expression contribute to the overall design and
character of a piece of music or musical performance. The texture of
a musical passage arises from the way its layers are produced and
distributed, and how they interact to form the totality of sound. Timbre
refers to the distinct sounds of specific instruments and voices, arising
from the physical manner in which those sounds are produced. Expressive
elements are related to musical interpretation and include dynamics, articulation, and tempo.

Introduction
Designed with extensive input from the community of AP Music Theory
educators, these unit guides offer teachers guidance in building students’
skills and understandings. The suggested sequence was identified through
a thorough analysis of the syllabi of highly effective AP teachers and the organization of typical college textbooks.
This unit structure respects AP teachers’ time by providing one possible
sequence they can adapt and modify, rather than having to build from
scratch. An additional benefit is that these units enable the AP Program
to provide interested teachers with formative assessments—the Personal
Progress Checks—that they can assign their students at the end of
each unit to gauge progress toward success on the AP exam. However,
experienced AP teachers who are satisfied with their current course
organization and exam results should feel no pressure to adopt these
units, which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

AP Music Theory Course and Exam Description

=== Page 33 ===
UNIT 1
Building Course Skills
This unit presents foundational elements of music, showing how pitch and rhythm work together to become melody and meter. Students learn to identify pitches and rhythms in performed music through contextual listening exercises and in notated music through score analysis exercises. They should also routinely engage in composition exercises and apply musical concepts.
To begin understanding the “language” of music, students need multiple opportunities to engage with the symbols and terms, including expressive elements, used to describe pitch and rhythm in performed music. They should also practice audiation— making musical sense of what they see in a score through melodic dictation and sight singing exercises that reinforce relationships between aural and written forms of music.
Students should work with simple scalar patterns in simple meter, enabling success with notation and singing. The goal of sight singing is not for students to develop trained voices but to practice converting music between aural and written forms.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The AP Music Theory course requires students to apply their knowledge in both aural and written contexts. Students need regular opportunities throughout the course to practice hearing, notating, analyzing, singing, and composing music.
On the exam, both melodic dictation and sight-singing free-response questions are a challenge for students. Early on, students should understand that pitches relate to each other within a diatonic context.
Establishing a system (e.g., solfège, moveable do, or numbers) for understanding these relationships early in the year can help students recognize pitch relationships rather than hearing or reading pitches in isolation.
As students learn to see written music as a way to communicate to others what is heard, they benefit from regular contextual listening exercises in which they recognize the written forms of and even discrepancies in what they hear and what is written in a score, which constitutes a portion of the multiple-choice section of the exam.
Developing Understanding
This first unit is designed to help students develop a foundational understanding of pitch
and rhythm and introduce them to the basics of major scales and keys, meter, tempo, and
dynamics. Students build skills working with materials, processes, and relationships based
on the tradition known as Western music. They establish the essential learning routines
of listening to and notating music, reading and analyzing scores, singing from scores, and
composing. These activities are complimentary: Students achieve musical understanding
by experiencing musical concepts in a variety of contexts and applying and extending their
learning to discover connections across the diversity of musical expression. In subsequent
units, students build their knowledge of pitch and rhythm, developing skills with more complex and sophisticated musical ideas and examples.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
PIT-1.A
Identify pitches on the staff, using treble, bass, and C clefs, in— a.  performed music b.  notated music
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-1.A.1
Music consists of discrete tones with specific frequencies called pitches. In music notation, the specific pitch of a note is shown by the note’s position on the lines and spaces of a staff, which are assigned specific letter names by a clef (treble, bass, alto, or tenor clefs).
The distance spanned from a given pitch up or down to the next pitch of the same letter name is called an octave. Pitch may be further
distinguished by accidentals (e.g., sharps, flats, and naturals). When a pitch requires use of an accidental, the accidental should be drawn to the left of the notehead.
BOUNDARY STATEMENT
On aural sections of the AP Music Theory
Exam, students are expected to demonstrate relative pitch, not absolute pitch. That is, when students are asked to identify and/ or notate heard pitches, they will always be given one or more pitches as a starting point.
PIT-1.A.2
Enharmonic equivalents are tones of the same pitch spelled differently according to their musical contexts (e.g., C♯ and D♭).
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
PIT-1
Pitch fundamentals— Specific frequencies of sound, known as pitches, are basic
units of music. Pitches can be presented successively and simultaneously in myriad
ways, providing a basis for musical expression across a broad spectrum of genres, media, and styles.

Interactive Word Wall
Write related words or symbols on individual cards for your word wall, such as
symbols for dynamics, terms for tempos, or different note values. Ask students to
arrange the cards in a given order, e.g. softest-to-loudest dynamics, slowest-to fastest tempos, etc.
2 1.5
Note-taking
Have students create flash cards for each major key that show the key signature in
treble and bass clef. Have students exchange cards and check each other’s work.
3 1.6
Manipulatives/Kinesthetics
Play a short musical excerpt, and ask students to tap the beat with one hand. If
students are hearing different pulses as the beat, help them establish which pulse the
group should perform. Then, have them tap the subdivision of the beat with the other
hand and identify whether the subdivision is simple or compound.
4 1.3
Graphic Organizer
Display a large diagram of a piano keyboard, and mark half steps and whole steps.
Then do the same with a diagram of a guitar fretboard. Be sure to note the similarities
and differences between the two reference images/patterns, including how the frets
get closer together as one moves higher up the neck.
5 1.4
Taking a Different Look
Draw a chromatic scale on a clock face (a circle), with C at the 12 o’clock position,
C♯ at 1 o’clock, etc. Circle all the notes in a C Major scale, and connect the circles to
create a seven-sided polygon. Have students study that shape. Repeat the process
for a D Major scale, noting that the shape is the same, just rotated.
6 1.8
Composing
Write several different short, rhythmic patterns (one or two beats long) on note cards.
Have students select and order a handful of cards to make a longer rhythm, which they then perform.

treble and bass clef. Have students exchange cards and check each other’s work.
3 1.6
Manipulatives/Kinesthetics
Play a short musical excerpt, and ask students to tap the beat with one hand. If
students are hearing different pulses as the beat, help them establish which pulse the
group should perform. Then, have them tap the subdivision of the beat with the other
hand and identify whether the subdivision is simple or compound.
4 1.3
Graphic Organizer
Display a large diagram of a piano keyboard, and mark half steps and whole steps.
Then do the same with a diagram of a guitar fretboard. Be sure to note the similarities
and differences between the two reference images/patterns, including how the frets
get closer together as one moves higher up the neck.
5 1.4
Taking a Different Look
Draw a chromatic scale on a clock face (a circle), with C at the 12 o’clock position,
C♯ at 1 o’clock, etc. Circle all the notes in a C Major scale, and connect the circles to
create a seven-sided polygon. Have students study that shape. Repeat the process
for a D Major scale, noting that the shape is the same, just rotated.
6 1.8
Composing
Write several different short, rhythmic patterns (one or two beats long) on note cards.
Have students select and order a handful of cards to make a longer rhythm, which they then perform.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
PIT-1.A
Identify pitches on the staff, using treble, bass, and C clefs, in— a. performed music b. notated music
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-1.A.1
Music consists of discrete tones with specific frequencies called pitches. In music notation, the specific pitch of a note is shown by the note’s position on the lines and spaces of a staff, which are assigned specific letter names by a clef (treble, bass, alto, or tenor clefs).
The distance spanned from a given pitch up or down to the next pitch of the same letter name is called an octave. Pitch may be further
distinguished by accidentals (e.g., sharps, flats, and naturals). When a pitch requires use of an accidental, the accidental should be drawn to the left of the notehead.
BOUNDARY STATEMENT
On aural sections of the AP Music Theory
Exam, students are expected to demonstrate relative pitch, not absolute pitch. That is, when students are asked to identify and/ or notate heard pitches, they will always be given one or more pitches as a starting point.
PIT-1.A.2
Enharmonic equivalents are tones of the same pitch spelled differently according to their musical contexts (e.g., C♯ and D♭).
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
PIT-1
Pitch fundamentals— Specific frequencies of sound, known as pitches, are basic
units of music. Pitches can be presented successively and simultaneously in myriad

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
PIT-3.A
Sight-sing the pitches and rhythms of a melody that is notated in treble or bass clef.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-3.A.1
Accurate performance of a notated melody rests largely on accurate rendering of the notated pitches. Even when a melody is transposed to a key other than the notated key, melodic intervals separating pitches are retained, allowing the melody to retain its characteristic sound.
PIT-3.A.2
Although complete pitch accuracy is the goal, a sight-singing performance demonstrates partial mastery when it retains the tonic pitch or approximates the melody with correct contour.
PIT-3.A.3
In performing rhythm, it is important to sustain notes for their full duration, especially on cadential notes where inexperienced performers may be tempted to cut short the duration.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
PIT-3
Melody—Pitches that are deliberately sequenced through time produce an expressive musical statement known as a melody.
Teacher’s Note
We recommend students regularly practice sight-singing (skill 3.D.) as new topics
are introduced. To be prepared for the exam, students should eventually be able
to sight-sing the pitches and rhythms of a melody that is:
a. notated in treble or bass clef b. composed in a major or minor key
c. composed in simple or compound meter inclusive of a limited use of chro matically altered pitches
d. inclusive of a limited use of chromatically altered pitches

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-1.F.1
When a particular major or minor scale is used prominently within a musical passage, the music is said to be in the corresponding key of that scale. For instance, a passage that uses the pitches of the D major scale and asserts D as the central pitch is said to be “in the key of D major.”
PIT-1.F.2
The specific pitches of a major or minor scale are represented by its key signature, a grouping of sharps or flats presented in a specific order.
Pitches that belong to a given major or minor scale are said to be diatonic; pitches that do not belong to the given scale are said to be chromatic.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
RHY-1.C
Describe the meter type in— a. performed music b. notated music
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
RHY-1.C.1
Meter types are identified based on two relationships—the relationship of the beat to the division (simple versus compound) and the relationship of the beat to the measure.
A meter in which the beat is grouped into two beat measures is called duple, and meters in which the beats are grouped into three- and four-beat measures are called triple and quadruple, respectively. For example, meter known as common time 4 4 would be considered a simple quadruple meter: “simple” because its quarter-note beat parses into two eighth-note divisions and “quadruple” because its beat groups into four-beat measures.

Music Fundamentals I
UNIT 1
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
RHY-1.D.1
Time signatures (or meter signatures) represent meter in a score. The upper and lower numbers of a time signature work together to imply how many beats are in a measure, which rhythmic value gets one beat, and whether the meter is simple or compound.
More specifically— §§ The upper number of a time signature reveals whether the meter is simple (2, 3, or 4) or compound (6, 9, or 12) and whether the meter is duple (2 or 6), triple (3 or 9), or quadruple (4 or 12).
§§ The lower number represents the rhythmic value of the beat in simple meters and the rhythmic value of the division in compound meters.
To illustrate, in a simple meter such as 3 8, the upper number indicates a simple triple meter, and the lower number shows that the eighth note gets the beat. In a compound meter such as 9 8, the upper number indicates a compound triple meter, and the lower number shows that the eighth note is the division. Each measure of 9 8 contains nine eighth-note divisions, and each group of three divisions forms a dotted-quarter beat.
RHY-1.D.2
Metrical accents arise from patterns of strong and weak beats that occur at regularly occurring intervals in a meter. At the beat level, the first beat of a measure, called the downbeat, is always strongest; the subsequent beats in the measure are felt as weak beats and, in some cases, lesser strong beats. In a measure of 4 4, beat one is the downbeat, beat three constitutes a lesser strong beat, and beats two and four fill out the measure as weak beats. At the division level, divisions occurring
directly on beats are felt as strong in relation to the intervening divisions, or offbeats, which are comparatively weak.

RHY-2.A
For rhythmic patterns in simple and compound meter— a. Identify the rhythmic pattern b. Notate the rhythmic pattern c. Sight-sing the rhythmic pattern
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
RHY-2.A.1
Rhythmic patterns arise from the various ways rhythmic values can fill up a beat. Simple beats have a limited number of rhythmic patterns; compound beats have only a few more possible rhythmic patterns. Learning and knowing these rhythmic patterns by sight and sound facilitates reading, notating, and analyzing music. Rhythmic patterns may be identified in performed excerpts and in scores, notated from performed excerpts, and performed through sight-singing. Some rhythmic patterns are so common and distinctive that they have names, such as dotted rhythms.
RHY-2.A.2
In notating rhythm, care should be taken to sequence rhythmic values and draw beams so the location of beats is most clearly visible.
There may be no beaming across the half-bar (e.g., across beats 2 and 3 in quadruple meter).
Notes, rests, ties, and beams that obscure the beat structure of a measure are difficult for the performer to interpret and considered wrong.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
RHY-2
Rhythmic patterns—Musical sounds and silences may be produced individually but
are typically grouped into distinctive rhythmic patterns. These patterns help define
the specific identity of a musical passage as it combines with other passages to create larger rhythmic formations.

Tempo
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
DES-3.A
Identify and apply tempo markings, including those that indicate adjustments to the prevailing tempo, used in— a. performed music b. notated music
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
DES-3.A.1
Tempo describes the relative speed of music’s beat pulse. Tempo may be expressed by words that indicate this relative speed, ranging from very slow speeds, such as largo, larghetto, and grave; to slow speeds, such as lento and adagio; moderately slow speeds, such as andante and andantino; moderate speeds, such as moderato; and faster speeds, such as allegretto, allegro, vivace, presto, and prestissimo. Composers in different musical traditions have used words from different languages to indicate tempos, and performers are responsible for learning the meaning of tempo markings that appear in notated music.
Tempo can also be indicated by a “metronome marking,” which identifies a note value, such as a quarter note, as a beat-note, and then labels the number of beats per minute, such as “quarter note = 88”. Tempo markings are typically placed at the start of a movement or section of a piece.

Directions to adjust the musical tempo may be used, including some to increase the speed (accelerando) and some to slow it down, either gradually (ritardando) or abruptly (ritenuto).
Additionally, terms may be applied that suggest general freedom with respect to tempo (rubato).
BOUNDARY STATEMENT
With respect to tempo markings, students taking the AP Music Theory Exam will only be asked to know specific meanings for the Italian terms listed in DES-3.A.1. However, students should understand that there exists a much broader vocabulary in many languages on which composers draw to express tempo and tempo relationships.

Dynamics and Articulation
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
DES-3.B
Identify dynamics and changes in dynamics in— a. performed music b. notated music
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
DES-3.B.1
Dynamics describe, in relative terms, how loud or soft music is. Dynamics are typically marked in music using abbreviations for the
Italian words ranging from very soft to very loud—pp stands for pianissimo, p stands for piano, mp stands for mezzo piano, mf stands
for mezzo forte, f stands for forte, and ff stands for fortissimo. Changes in dynamics may be shown with graphic symbols (sometimes
called hairpins ＜ ＞), with Italian words that call for gradual or sudden changes (crescendo, decrescendo, subito), or with abbreviations for the Italian words. A dynamic accent gives a momentary increase of volume to a specific note or notes. Dynamic accents can be indicated with sf or sfz, which stand for sforzando. Terraced dynamics indicate the sudden contrast of a loud passage of music followed by a soft passage of music, or a soft passage followed by a loud passage.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
DES-3.C.1
Articulation is an aspect of performance that describes the way a sound starts (its “attack”) and ends and how detached or connected adjacent pitches are. Articulations may be shown with symbols—such as staccato dots, legato (or tenuto) lines, slurs, or marcato accents—or indicated with words, such as sempre tenuto. Different types of accents have different markings. Interpretation of articulations may vary according to musical style or type of instrument and from performer to performer. Related to articulation is the tremolo, which is the rapid and continuous repetition of a single pitch.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
DES-3.C
Identify articulation and changes in articulation in— a. performed music b. notated music
DES-3.D
Sight-sing a notated melody, applying all indicated markings for— a. dynamics b. articulation c. tempo
DES-3.D.1
Singing a melody at sight, without extended rehearsal or prior familiarity with it, requires observation and performance not only of the pitch and rhythm but also of the indicated expressive elements of dynamics, articulation, and tempo. In performing a melody with a single tempo marking, the performer should maintain steady tempo throughout. It is important to perform with continuity throughout—avoiding hesitations and restarts—to maintain the momentum of musical motion and properly observe the metric framework of the melody. No alterations in the tempo should be made unless the notation specifically indicates a change in tempo.
BOUNDARY STATEMENT
Melodies that appear in sight-singing questions on the AP Music Theory Exam contain simple markings that indicate a loud dynamic level (e.g., forte) and a moderate tempo (e.g., moderato); markings related to articulation are limited to standard phrase slurs. These markings are specifically chosen to promote clarity of vocal projection and allow students to prioritize pitch/rhythm accuracy. It can be assumed that students will not be asked to perform melodies that require a nuanced rendering of expressive elements, such as crescendos, ritardandos, or distinctive articulations.

UNIT 2
Building Course Skills
Students add to their understanding of pitch relationships established in Unit 1 by exploring minor scales and intervals. They examine timbre, features of melody, motive, and texture, all of which are applied to contextual listening exercises. As students learn and apply melodic and rhythmic concepts, they are introduced to motives in performed and notated music, and they start to identify and analyze patterns in music, skills further developed in subsequent units.
Students should continue to keep basic concepts of pitch and rhythm at the center of their study through exercises in contextual listening, notation, sight-singing, and converting between aural and written forms. Error-detection exercises reinforce understanding of the relationship between what’s heard in a performance and seen in notated music. Students practice hearing and notating intervals, identifying their sizes and qualities. This study of intervals enriches their understanding of melodies and prepares them for examining relationships among pitches of a chord in Unit 3.
Preparing for the AP Exam
It is important that students practice hearing, reading, notating, and singing major and minor melodies in simple and compound meters on treble and bass clefs early on so that they develop fluency and the ability to move comfortably across different modes, meters, and clefs, as they are required to demonstrate proficiency in diverse musical contexts.
As students explore the foundational music skills of the course, they should pay particular attention to the rules of proper musical notation. Musical notation is a symbolic language that conveys to readers what is heard. Using proper musical notation ensures that a musical idea is clearly communicated to a reader. On the AP Music Theory Exam, students lose points when their ideas are not communicated clearly due to improper musical notation. They can therefore benefit from continuous guidance in proper musical notation by examining proper notation in written music and practicing proper notation in their own writing.
Developing Understanding
In this unit, students connect their learning from Unit 1 about major scales with learning
about pitch patterns and relationships in minor keys. Students investigate major/minor key
relationships and are introduced to additional scale types. They also focus on distances
between pitches, known as intervals, underpinning later work with chords and harmonic
progressions. Features of melody are identified, and students begin to recognize relationships
of musical notation and performance, specifically with respect to transposition. They learn
to identify instruments played in performed music and hear how musical lines interact to
produce texture, while expanding their knowledge of rhythm and meter. In the next unit,
students begin to engage with harmonic ideas, learning about triads and seventh chords.

Sample Activity 1 2.1
Tonality Switch
Using solfège or another established sight-singing method, have students sing a
melody written in a major key. Switch the key to natural minor on the same tonic and
have them sing it again. Finally, have students sing the same melody in melodic minor.
2 2.2
Retrieval Practice
Assign each student a name tag with a major or minor key. Then ask the students to
move around the room and pair up as you call out different key relationships, such
as “find your parallel key,” “find your relative key,” “find a closely related key,” “find a
distantly related key,” or “find a key that has four notes in common with you.” 3 2.7 and 2.10
Ask the Expert
Play a melody on a C instrument and show its notation.  Ask a student who plays a
transposing instrument to perform the melody as notated. Ask students to figure out
what interval separates the two performances and how to notate the melody so the instruments can play in unison.

PIT-1.I
Identify minor and relative keys in— a. performed music b. notated music
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-1.H.1
Musical passages or compositions can shift from one key to another. The key to which a passage shifts can form various key relationships with the original key, including a relative key which shares the same key
signature as the original but starts on a different tonic. For example, D major and B minor both have two sharps in their key signature, but their tonics are D and B, respectively.
PIT-1.I.1
A minor key has the same key signature as the major of which it is a relative.
PIT-1.I.2
The term “mode” is used in reference to major and minor keys. For example, a major key and a minor key are described as being in the “major mode” and in the “minor mode,” respectively.
A shift from G major to G minor, for instance, would constitute a “change in mode.”

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-1.J.2
Closely related keys are keys whose key signatures differ from the original by no more than one accidental; these are the most common keys to which a musical passage might shift. For example, in relation to an opening tonic of D major (i.e., two sharps in the key signature), the closely related keys would consist of the relative key (B minor), the major and minor keys bearing one additional sharp (A major and F♯ minor), and the major and minor keys bearing one less sharp (G major and E minor). The following is an alternative
explanation: The keys closely related to a given key are those whose tonic triads are the diatonic major and minor triads of the original key. For the key of D major, the closely related keys would be the supertonic key (E minor), the mediant key (F♯ minor), the subdominant key (G major), the dominant key (A major), and the submediant key (B minor). Relative keys are a subset of closely related keys.

Additional scales identified in music theory include chromatic, whole-tone, and pentatonic scales. Melodic passages may employ these scales. Chromatic scales have twelve pitches, each a half-step apart. Whole-tone scales have six notes, each a whole step apart. Pentatonic scales (major and minor) have five pitches from the seven pitches of a major or minor scale.
Major pentatonic scales contain scale degrees ˆ1, ˆ2, ˆ3, ˆ5, and ˆ6 of the major scale. Minor
pentatonic scales contain scale degrees ˆ1, ˆ3, ˆ4, ˆ5, and ˆ7 of the natural minor scale.

Interval Size and Quality
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
PIT-1.L
Describe the size and quality of an interval in— a. performed music b. notated music
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-1.L.1
The distance in pitch between two notes is called an interval, designated by distance between pitches (e.g., second or fifth) and quality (major, minor, perfect, diminished, or augmented). Two examples are a major second or a diminished seventh. Some intervals are alternatively designated by unique names, for example, the unison (prime) and the tritone.
Intervals that sound identical but encompass different pitch spellings are enharmonic equivalents (e.g., the augmented fourth, D up to G♯, and the diminished fifth, D up to A♭).
PIT-1.L.2
Harmonic intervals describe the distance between simultaneous pitches; melodic intervals describe the distance between successive pitches. Melodic intervals are generally categorized into two generic types—a step traverses adjacent pitches of neighboring letter names (e.g., C up to D), while a leap traverses an interval larger than a step (e.g., C up to E).

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-1.M.1
An interval’s inversion may be determined by transferring the lower note up an octave.
An interval plus its inversion equals a perfect octave. Put another way, when an octave is divided into two smaller intervals, the resulting two intervals are interval inversions of each other. Sizes and qualities of intervals and their inversions relate consistently as follows— §§ perfect intervals remain perfect when inverted §§ major intervals become minor when inverted, and vice versa §§ diminished intervals become augmented when inverted, and vice versa §§ the sum of respective sizes of the original and inverted intervals always equals nine (e.g., a second inverts to become a seventh, or two plus seven equals nine)

PIT-1.M.2
Intervals whose sizes are smaller than or equal to an octave may be called simple intervals.
When an octave is added to a simple interval, the result is a corresponding larger interval called a compound interval. For example, an octave added to a major third yields a major tenth. Because a simple interval and its corresponding compound interval contain like pitches—sounding in different octaves—the two intervals sound similar.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
PIT-1.N
Identify sounding pitches that correspond to the notated pitches of a transposing instrument when given the specific level and direction of transposition.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-1.N.1
Transposing instruments are those whose notated pitches are different from actual pitches that sound when played. Because many standard instruments in the tradition known as
Western music belong to this category, musical scores often contain one or more instrumental parts that require the conversion of notated pitches into sounding pitches before analysis may proceed.

With the exception of instruments whose transposition is an octave (e.g., double bass), transposing instruments included on the
AP Music Theory Exam will be presented as follows—The specific level of transposition will be indicated in the score and the direction of transposition will be specified further in the question directions (e.g., “Clarinet in B♭ sounding a Major 2nd below notated pitch”).
Students do not need to memorize the transpositions of specific musical instruments.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING

Timbre
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
DES-2.A
Identify performance media and vocal and instrumental timbres in performed music.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
DES-2.A.1
Some common examples of standard performance media (or instrumentation) are—string orchestra, string quartet, SATB choir, brass quintet, jazz trio, and solo piano.
Unique ensembles may be established using a distinctive mix of voices and instruments.
An individual voice or instrument may be
identified by its distinctive timbre, which refers to the unique quality of sound based on how the sound is produced. The sound quality is
also affected by register (i.e., which part of the voice or instrument’s total range is used). The most comfortable register of a given voice or instrument, known as its tessitura, is most frequently used, but sometimes voices and instruments use extreme parts of their ranges to create special effects.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
DES-2
Timbre—As we perceive distinctive qualities of imagery, taste, smell, and touch, we
can perceive distinctive qualities of musical sound, known as timbre. Timbre is based
on the specific instruments and/or voices used for performance and the physical manner in which they produce sound.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
DES-2.A.2
Common instrumental families in the tradition known as Western music include strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion, and keyboards.
Each of these families has many standard members, and each member is distinguished by its timbre and register (how high or low its pitches sound). The string family includes violin, viola, cello, bass, harp, and guitar. The brass family includes trumpet, French horn, trombone, euphonium, and tuba. The woodwind family includes flute, oboe, clarinet, saxophone (which comes in several different sizes, covering different registers), and bassoon. The percussion family has many members, such as drums, cymbals, marimba, and others. The keyboard family includes piano, harpsichord, and organ. In addition to these standard families, there are alternate groupings of instruments, such as winds, used to describe a combined assemblage of woodwind and brass instruments. A rhythm section consists of a harmony instrument (such as piano or guitar), a bass instrument (typically double bass), and usually a drum set that form the core instrumentation of a jazz ensemble. In the
Baroque period, the basso continuo included a harmony instrument (often a harpsichord) and bass instrument (such as cello) to provide the core sound of the group.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-3.C.1
Melody is produced by pitch and rhythm together, combining to create a succession of pitches through time that express a musical statement.
PIT-3.C.2
Melodies may be derived from specific scales and modes and are often organized in patterns of musical motives and phrases.
PIT-3.C.3
The pitch succession that comprises a melody may exhibit several technical features. Contour is the unique melodic shape created by the specific rise and fall of pitches. Conjunct and disjunct refer to melodic steps (conjunct) or leaps (disjunct) within a melody or melodic segment. Register refers to the relative span
of pitch (e.g. high, medium, or low) of notes in a given melody or part thereof. Range refers to the overall compass of pitch in a given melody, from its lowest to its highest pitch.

Texture and Texture Types
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
DES-1.A
Identify texture types in— a. performed music b. notated music
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
DES-1.A.1
Texture refers to how musical components combine simultaneously to form an overall sound. Texture is influenced by how music is produced (e.g., the distinctive qualities of sound, or timbres), the density and spacing of pitches, and the pitch range encompassed.
DES-1.A.2
Texture types are determined by the number of musical lines present, the melodic character of these lines, and the ways in which the lines are combined simultaneously. The main types of musical texture are monophony, homophony (including chordal homophony and melody with accompaniment), polyphony (nonimitative and imitative), and heterophony. These terms appear as nouns (e.g., homophony) and as adjectives (e.g., homophonic). Other terms used to describe texture include technical terms (e.g., canon/canonic) and casual terms (e.g., call and response). Counterpoint (adjective:
contrapuntal) is a term that relates closely to polyphony. Counterpoint refers specifically to the practice of composing polyphonic music, often using historical conventions, and the texture that results.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
DES-1
Texture—As the substance and structure of a physical object provides tactile
texture, the substance and structure of music provides aural texture. The texture

Rhythmic
Devices
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
RHY-3.A
Identify rhythmic devices in— a. performed music b. notated music
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
RHY-3.A.1
A variety of rhythmic devices and features are used in music. Some features enliven rhythm by challenging the regularity of an established meter. For example, syncopation occurs when rhythm places accent on weak beats or divisions.  A cross-rhythm (or polyrhythm) is a simultaneous occurrence of two or more rhythmic patterns that do not derive from one another and are not rooted in the same meter.
Hemiola, in its most fundamental meaning, refers to any arrangement of rhythm and meter that articulates a 3 to 2 ratio. Thus, hemiola occurs when three notes of equal duration take up the time previously held by two notes of equal duration, or vice versa.
Common manifestations of hemiola include the following— §§ Measures of compound duple meter (e.g., 6 8) juxtaposed with measures that articulate a simple triple meter (e.g., 3 4), with the division pulse remaining constant (e.g., a static eighth-note pulse).
§§ Two measures of triple meter that are accented as Strong-weak-Strong-weak-
Strong-weak instead of the usual Strong weak-weak-Strong-weak-weak.

RHY-3.A.1
The contrasting metric structures that form a hemiola may be heard successively or simultaneously, with the latter forming an example of polyrhythm or “two-against-three” polyrhythm.
RHY-3.A.2
Other rhythmic devices include the following— §§ An agogic accent is a note that naturally receives more emphasis due to its extended (or longer) duration.
§§ An anacrusis, or pickup, is a rhythm or rhythms that start before the first downbeat of a phrase.
§§ A fermata is a symbol placed over a note or rest that indicates it is to be held longer than its normal duration.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
RHY-1.E.1
Borrowed divisions occur when compound divisions (three divisions per beat) substitute for division values in a simple meter (two divisions per beat), and vice versa. Such divisions are sometimes called triplets and duplets, respectively. Borrowed rhythmic values may also occur at the beat level; for instance, three quarter note triplets may take the place of two quarter notes. Beats may be divided into other portions (such as 5s and 7s), sometimes called irregular divisions.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
RHY-1
Rhythm and meter—Music exists in the dimension of time, where long and short
sounds and silences can be combined in myriad ways. This temporal aspect, called
rhythm, is often governed by a layered structure of interrelated pulses known as meter.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
RHY-1.E.2
Meter types created by recurring regularly spaced patterns of accent on the different levels of pulse (division, beat, and measure) are called symmetrical meters. However, meters are not always regularly periodic at all levels of pulse. For instance, 5 8 contains beats of unequal size, with the first beat containing three eighth-note divisions and the second containing two eighth-note divisions, or vice versa. This is an example of an asymmetrical or irregular meter. Music may use time signatures that shift often, such as a measure of 3 4 followed by a measure of 4 4; this is known as changing or mixed meter.

UNIT 3
Building Course Skills
As students begin to study harmonic concepts, they hear and analyze a variety of chords in real musical contexts, studying relationships of triads and seventh chords built on scale degrees of a given key. They may also benefit from hearing chords of various qualities in isolation to compare and differentiate them. Students learn symbols and terms for describing harmonic relationships through simple harmonic dictation exercises in preparation for Units 4 and 5, which deal with harmonic progressions, functions, and voice leading.
Students learn to use Roman and Arabic numbers to communicate the scale degree of the root, the quality, and the bass note of any diatonic chord. They begin to study and apply processes of realizing a figured bass. Developing proficiency in notating
chords is essential: Students use Roman and Arabic numbers and figured bass notation throughout the course to notate harmonic progressions and demonstrate understanding of chord qualities and relationships.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Unit 3 introduces harmonic dictation, a skill with which students often struggle on the
AP Music Theory Exam. It helps to begin ear training early on, to differentiate among the various qualities and inversions of triads and seventh chords. Although differentiating among chords in isolation helps students learn key differences between major and minor chords or chords in root and inverted positions, the exam asks students to demonstrate their understanding of chords within a progression, which requires knowledge of how chords (and their qualities) relate to each other in a diatonic context.
As students further develop proper musical notation skills, Unit 3 introduces systems of notating harmony. Students must become proficient in properly reading and applying
Roman and Arabic numerals to diatonic chords, since five free-response questions require the use of this notation system and one asks students to realize a figured bass line.
Developing Understanding
In this third unit of music fundamentals, students further strengthen their foundational
understanding of pitch relationships in performed and notated music. Having learned how to
recognize and relate pitch patterns and rhythmic structures in performances and in scores,
students now begin to engage with harmony, recognizing and relating groupings of pitches
presented simultaneously. They use notation to identify chord qualities and to indicate
harmonic progressions, with a focus on seventh chords. Although skills and concepts of
rhythm, meter, and melody aren’t specifically addressed in this unit, students should continue
practicing and applying them in creative exercises in preparation for further development in
Unit 4, which introduces harmony and voice leading.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
PIT-1.O
Describe the quality of a chord in— a. performed music b. notated music
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-1.O.1
A chord consists of three or more pitches sounding simultaneously; the term also applies to collections of successive pitches that form a perceived grouping, often through arpeggiation (i.e., the use of arpeggios). In the tradition known as Western music, the two basic kinds of chord are— §§ triads—chords whose essence consists of three distinct pitches stacked on adjacent lines or spaces (i.e., stacked in thirds) §§ seventh chords—chords whose essence consists of four distinct pitches stacked on adjacent lines or spaces (i.e., stacked in thirds)
PIT-1.O.2
When the pitches of a chord are arranged in their essential configuration of stacked thirds, each pitch, or chord member, is given a specific name—the bottom note on which the chord is built is called the root, and the notes stacked
above the root are called the third, the fifth, and in the case of seventh chords, the seventh.

Identify chords using letters and Roman/Arabic numerals that indicate specific scale degree of the root, quality, and bass note in— a. performed music b. notated music
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-2.A.1
Triads and seventh chords built on the scale degrees of a given key constitute the diatonic chords of that key. These chords are identified using a system of symbols in which Roman numerals indicate the scale degree on which the given chord is built and the quality of the given chord. Uppercase and lowercase Roman numerals are used to indicate major and minor triads, respectively, and additional symbols are added to denote other chord qualities (e.g., lowercase Roman numerals with “o” indicating diminished triads and uppercase Roman numerals with “+” indicating augmented triads).
The diatonic chords of a key can also be identified using the scale degree names of each chord’s respective root (e.g., tonic, supertonic, mediant, etc.). For example, the triad built on scale degree two may be called the “supertonic triad,” the triad built on scale degree four may be called the “subdominant triad,” and the seventh chord built on scale degree five may be called the “dominant seventh chord.”

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
PIT-2.A
Identify chords using letters and Roman/Arabic numerals that indicate specific scale degree of the root, quality, and bass note in— a. performed music b. notated music
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-2.A.2
The pitches of a chord may be arranged in various ways, with special attention paid to the chord member that appears in the bass (i.e., lowest part of the chord). When the chordal root appears in the bass, the chord is said to be in root position. When chord members other than the root appear in the bass, chord inversions result. First inversion and second inversion occur when the chordal third and fifth, respectively, appear in the bass. Specific chord inversions are labeled using a system of Arabic numerals that denote intervals to be rendered above given bass notes, a convention based on an 18th-century system of musical shorthand known as figured bass. With pitch content clearly defined, these Arabic numerals may be used to imply specific chords and their inversions.
An alternate system for labeling chords identifies a triad’s root by capital letter-name (e.g., C) and its quality by abbreviation (e.g., “m” for minor); a C-minor triad may be labeled “Cm.” Chord labels such as these are used prominently in lead sheets, where they appear above the notated melody and indicate specific chord progressions.

UNIT 3
Music Fundamentals III: Triads and Seventh Chords
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-2.B.1
The Arabic numerals, or figures, that appear in a figured bass denote pitches at specific intervals above each given bass note.
(Octave equivalents of those pitches are also acceptable.) Since the resultant pitches are to be used in writing each corresponding chord, these Arabic numerals imply harmonies to which Roman numerals may be applied.
PIT-2.B.2
In figured bass notation, a figure with a slash or plus sign indicates the pitch denoted by that figure is to be raised a half step. An accidental appearing alone (i.e., without an Arabic numeral) indicates that the pitch lying a third above the bass should be inflected as shown (e.g., “♯” appearing under a given bass pitch of A denotes the pitch C♯).

UNIT 4
Building Course Skills
Students explore 18th-century voice leading procedures to consider how independent voices create melodies and work together to create harmonies.
A scaffolded approach to voice leading begins with focusing on the tonic dominant-tonic (T-D-T) phrase. This simple harmonic phrase type is expanded upon in Unit 5, where predominant function, more cadential patterns, and voice-leading 6 4 chords are introduced. In preparation for later focus on phrase relationships and formal sections in Unit 8, students should continue to engage in motivic analysis and study cadences associated with the
T-D-T phrase.
Students may benefit from exploring counterpoint with two voices before voice leading with four voices. In fact, species counterpoint may give them a step-by-step method for developing counterpoint skills.
Students will need ongoing feedback to guide their development of these skills.
Students should begin discerning the relationships of chords in a harmonic progression, rather than hearing a progression as a succession of isolated chords.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The AP Music Theory Exam asks students to engage in both four-part and two-part voice leading. Students may find it helpful to begin focusing on and applying procedures of 18th-century voice leading to the outer voices within the T-D-T phrase before adding inner voices. In fact, students should not postpone attempting exercises like Free-
Response Question 7 until the end of the year; they can complete a modified version of such an exercise in this unit, demonstrating their current skills with and understanding of voice leading and harmony.
Students should see how the skills and knowledge they have developed in previous units are applied in this unit. In addition, they should continue to develop and demonstrate their skills with and conceptual understanding of melody, harmony, and proper musical notation as they encounter new concepts through sight-singing, dictation, contextual listening, error detection, and composition exercises.
Developing Understanding
Unit 4 expands on harmonic materials and processes introduced in Unit 3 and also introduces
the procedures of 18th-century style voice leading. Students begin by learning and applying
conventions of soprano–bass line relationships through score analysis, error detection,
writing exercises, and contextual listening. They then learn conventions of chord spelling,
spacing, and doubling, in order to form harmonies from the combination of independent sounding melodic lines. Through their study of cadences, students learn to identify and
describe phrases as structural units of musical form. In Unit 5, students will continue to study
voice-leading conventions and procedures in four-voice (SATB) harmonic progressions.

Topic
Suggested Activity 1 4.1
Manipulatives/Kinesthetics
Have pairs of students walk from one side of the room to the other while you call out
types of motion (parallel, oblique, similar, contrary). The students should demonstrate
that motion by moving closer or further apart as they walk.
2 4.1 and 4.2

Give students two chords, and ask them to part-write them so that they demonstrate
one of the following errors: voice crossing, voice overlap, spacing error, or direct
fifths. Pair students up and ask them to find and explain the error their partner has
written. Have students share their findings as a class.
3 4.3
Listen and Analyze
Play a recorded excerpt of an 18th-century common-practice symphonic work with a
simple harmonic progression. Work with students to (1) identify when the harmonies
change, (2) notate a bass line that represents those harmonies, then (3) determine
which harmonies fulfill the functions of tonic, dominant, or predominant.
4 4.3
Recomposing
Select a well-known, tonal melody such as “Happy Birthday” or your school’s fight
song. Recompose the endings of each phrase with a different type of cadence than in
the typical version. Have students play or sing the recomposed version and discuss the expressive effects of the new cadences.
5 4.4
Marking the Score
In a chorale-style excerpt, ask students to circle chordal sevenths that resolve
down by step in blue, and chordal sevenths that don’t in green, then explain those
exceptions. Have students circle all leading tones that resolve up in yellow, and any that don’t in red, then explain those exceptions.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
PIT-4.A
Identify and apply the procedures of 18th-century voice leading through— a. score analysis b. error detection c. writing exercises d. contextual listening
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-4.A.1
Voice leading describes how individual voices or parts move as a harmonic progression advances from each chord to the next. This motion must take into consideration correct chord spelling, spacing, and doubling.
Emulating works of the common practice era, voice leading should achieve linear smoothness and bring about independence of voices (or parts). Additionally, tendency tones are resolved according to stylistic precedent (e.g., a chordal seventh resolving down by step).
PIT-4.A.2
The linear movement between two given voices can happen in four ways— §§ parallel motion—voices move in the same direction (both up or both down) by the same melodic interval.
§§ similar motion—voices move in the same direction but not by the same melodic interval.
§§ oblique motion—one voice remains stationary while the second moves up or down.
§§ contrary motion—voices move in opposite directions.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
PIT-4
Voice Leading—Individual voices of a composition are imbued with a cohesive
sense of motion and interaction through musical voice leading, which is rooted in historical traditions.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-4.A.3
Following are general conventions of 18th-century voice leading— §§ Voice leading should proceed mostly by step without excessive leaps.
§§ When possible, pitches common to adjacent chords, or common tones, should be retained in the same voice part(s).
§§ For clarity of voice leading, any chord should maintain soprano-alto-tenor-bass (SATB) order from high to low to avoid voice crossing.
§§ If a perfect fifth between two voices is not immediately repeated, it should proceed to an interval other than another perfect fifth between the same voices. This applies to parallel motion (i.e., parallel fifths) as well as contrary motion; it also applies to nonadjacent chords on successive beats.
§§ If a perfect octave or unison between two voices is not immediately repeated, it should proceed to an interval other than another perfect octave or perfect unison between the same voices. This applies to parallel motion (i.e., parallel octaves) as well as contrary motion; it also applies to nonadjacent chords on successive beats.
§§ All voices should proceed melodically with the following intervals—major and minor second, major and minor third, perfect fourth, and perfect fifth. All melodic augmented and diminished intervals should be excluded, as they produce uncharacteristic dissonances.
All melodic intervals larger than a perfect fifth should also be excluded, as they create uncharacteristic disjunct motion.
§§ The leading tone in an outer voice (i.e., soprano or bass) should always resolve up by step to avoid an unresolved leading tone.
PIT-4.A.4
When composing outer voices, the normative conventions of 18th-century voice leading
should be maintained (e.g., avoid parallel fifths).
In addition— §§ Outer voices may include leading tones as long as those leading tones are not doubled in another voice and resolve to the tonic by ascending in stepwise motion, to avoid an unresolved leading tone.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
PIT-2.E
Compose a bass line added to a given soprano line, following the normative harmonic procedures of 18th-century music.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE §§ Note-against-note dissonances between outer voices may be included only if they imply an acceptable harmonic progression— for example, a note-against-note fourth would work only as part of an acceptable pattern of second-inversion chords, such as the cadential, neighboring (pedal), or passing 6 4 chord patterns.
A chromatically inflected pitch that is appropriate in the musical context may be included as long as the preinflected pitch does not appear in another voice directly preceding the inflected pitch in question (i.e., avoid a cross relation).
PIT-4.A.5
When chords are spaced in close position, all upper parts (i.e., all parts except the bass) are
placed as close together as chord tones will allow.
Any other spacing is considered an open position.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-2.E.1
When a bass line is added to a soprano line, harmonic progressions are implied. To keep these harmonic progressions plausible and strong, these conventions should be followed— §§ All implied chords must allow the corresponding soprano notes to make harmonic sense.
§§ An acceptable harmonic progression can be made using tonic, supertonic, subdominant, and dominant triads exclusively, as long as the normative procedures of harmonic progression are followed.
§§ Repeated instances of a specific harmony— that is, repeating a particular chord in a particular position (root position or inversion)— are acceptable only if the repeated harmonies start on a strong beat.
However, at the beginning of a phrase, the repeated harmonies may start on a weak beat.

PIT-2.G
Notate the pitches and rhythms of the outer voices (soprano and bass lines) in a performed harmonic progression that is composed in a major or minor key and may include limited use of chromatically altered pitches.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-2.F.1
Notes of a bass line, especially when combined with other voices, can imply full chords and harmonic progressions. Such progressions may be represented through Roman numeral analysis, which may include Arabic numerals to show chord inversion and/or specific voice leading. If Roman numeral analysis is accurate, all given notes must be explainable in the chords represented by the analysis.
PIT-2.G.1
Accurate dictation of the outer voices in a performed harmonic progression depends on accurate notation of the sounding pitches and rhythms.
BOUNDARY STATEMENT
Although soprano notes should always be notated in the proper octave, octave displacement of bass-line pitches constitutes a more acceptable error and is therefore allowed on the AP Music Theory Exam.
PIT-2.G.2
Notes of the outer voices of a harmonic progression (the soprano and bass lines), provide important clues as to which chords are part of the performed harmonic progression.
Such progressions may be represented through Roman-numeral analysis, and include
Arabic numerals to show chord inversion and/or specific voice leading. In completing a Roman-numeral analysis of an outer-voice dictation, all written notes must be accounted for in the analysis.

Compose a bass line added to a given soprano line, following the normative melodic procedures of 18th-century music.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
RHY-2.C
Compose the rhythmic aspects of a bass line added to a given soprano line, following conventions of the 18th-century chorale.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-3.D.1
Melodic interest in a bass line may be created by balancing upward and downward motion and by balancing melodic steps and leaps.
PIT-3.D.2
A bass line uses melodic leaps with greater frequency than upper voices or parts, which tend toward more stepwise motion. Allowable leaps
include thirds, perfect fourths and fifths, sixths,
and octaves, and, if resolved properly, descending
diminished fifths. Octave leaps should be followed
by changes in direction. The bass line may include successive leaps in the same direction as long as the pitches outline a triad.
PIT-3.D.3
Repeated bass notes are acceptable only if they start on a strong beat. However, the repeated notes may start on a weak beat if it is the beginning of a phrase or if the second note is a suspension.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
RHY-2.C.1
Bass lines in 18th-century chorales tend to follow a particular rhythmic profile. Although they may feature note values ranging from half notes to eighth notes, the quarter note is the most frequent rhythmic value. A bass line of a chorale notated in 4 4 time that makes exclusive or almost exclusive use of half notes would be atypical of the style.

Harmony and Voice Leading I
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
FOR-1.A
Identify the beginnings, ends, and lengths of phrases in— a. performed music and b. notated music.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
FOR-1.A.1
Music is made up of syntactical units called phrases, which may generally be described as complete musical utterances that conclude with a cadence. By delineating phrases, cadences form punctuation points that regulate the overall sense of musical flow in a composition. Four-measure and eight-measure phrases are normative, but other lengths are possible.
FOR-1.A.2
A bass line should imply an appropriate cadence at each phrase ending. Appropriate cadences include perfect authentic, imperfect authentic, half, Phrygian half, plagal, and deceptive cadences. The final cadence must be a perfect authentic cadence. This group of acceptable cadence types fit generally into two categories—inconclusive cadences (i.e., half, imperfect authentic, and deceptive cadences) and conclusive cadences (i.e., perfect authentic and plagal cadences). A perfect authentic cadence is created by the V-I progression with both harmonies in root position, ending with scale degree 1 in the soprano. An imperfect authentic cadence is also a V-I progression, but chords may be inverted, with any chord tone in the soprano.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
FOR-1
Form—As with language, music exhibits a structural aspect known as form, in
which a musical composition is organized in a hierarchy of constituent parts. The
specific ways these parts are related, contrasted, and/or developed produce the
unique profile of an individual composition. Specific formal types and functions may
be identified when parts of a composition follow established melodic-harmonic
patterns or fulfill established roles within the overall hierarchical structure.
Teacher’s Note
Cadences are covered in Topic 4.3, but a brief introduction to the concept here is
useful as students begin to work with complete musical phrases.

Musical lines, whether in instrumental or vocal pieces, may be described using the terms soprano, alto, tenor, and bass (collectively known as SATB), depending on their pitch position in relation to other lines. Figured bass and chorale harmonization exercises are typically notated in SATB four-voice texture.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
DES-1
Texture—As the substance and structure of a physical object provides tactile
texture, the substance and structure of music provides aural texture. The texture
of a musical passage is based on the manner in which its layers are produced and
distributed, and how they interact to form the totality of sound.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-4.B.1
In the correct realization of a Roman-numeral progression or figured bass all chords are spelled correctly, with necessary accidentals included.
PIT-4.B.2
Doubling occurs when the number of voices or parts used is greater than what is required to represent a given chord, allowing the composer to assign one or more chord members to multiple voices or parts. In choosing pitches for doubling, these conventions are followed— §§ Double the root of a triad whenever voice leading allows.
§§ Thirds and fifths may also be doubled in triads when they result in good voice leading.
§§ In all situations, always double non-tendency tones (i.e., tones other than the leading-tone and chordal seventh).
§§ If the fifth is omitted in a root-position seventh chord, double the root.
§§ Following a complete root position Ⅴ7, the tonic triad may have three roots and a third (no fifth).
§§ In 6 4chords, always double the bass.
PIT-4.B.3

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
PIT-4.C
Apply the procedures of 18th-century chord voicing
and spacing through:
a. score analysis b. error detection c. writing exercises
PIT-4.D
Apply the conventions of 18th-century chord spelling, doubling, spacing, and voice leading to progressions that include chords in first inversion.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-4.C.1
The motion between outer voices (i.e., contrary,
similar, parallel, or oblique motion) should vary.
Progression of harmonic intervals between voices should never exceed three consecutive thirds or three consecutive sixths.
PIT-4.C.2
Following are additional conventions of 18th century voice leading— §§ A harmonic diminished fifth should proceed to an interval other than the perfect fifth above it to avoid rising unequal fifths.  One common exception to this convention occurs in the progression I—V 4 3 —I6, where a harmonic diminished fifth may rise to a perfect fifth. The most natural resolution of a diminished fifth is inward to a third.
§§ If outer voices move to a perfect interval by similar motion, the upper voice should proceed by step. Avoid direct fifths and direct octaves (also known as hidden fifths and hidden octaves).
§§ A voice, in moving to its next pitch, should never cross over an adjacent voice’s current pitch, to avoid overlapping voices. This maintains independence of voices and clarity of voice leading.
PIT-4.C.3
Although composers take care to keep each voice or part within its own optimal range, they set their chords with the freedom to distribute chord tones throughout the pitch range, creating unique voicings (or arrangements) of simple chords.
PIT-4.C.4
In spacing a chord, adjacent upper parts may be as far apart as an octave, but no more;
however, the distance between the bass pitch and its nearest neighboring part may be more than an octave.
PIT-4.D.1
When part-writing chord progressions that include first inversion triads, as with all chord progressions, the normative procedures of 18th-century voice leading should be followed.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
PIT-2.H
Identify and describe harmonic function within a chord progression in a. performed music b. notated music
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-2.H.1
Music is considered to be tonal when the pitch content is organized around a central (or tonic)
pitch and all other pitches relate to that central
pitch in a pre-established, hierarchical way. This manner of musical organization is based on a system that prevailed in the tradition known as Western music from approximately 1650 to
1900. Common practice is another term used for this type of music. Tonal organization may also be found in music of other genres and time periods, such as popular music, folk music, and jazz, as well as in some Western music composed after 1900.
PIT-2.H.2
Harmonic progression (or chord progression) refers to the particular sequence of chords that underlies a musical composition or passage. A harmonic progression may be represented as a succession of Roman numerals corresponding to the specific sequence of chords. When inversions are used, appropriate Arabic numerals are also included.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-2.H.3
Harmonic rhythm describes the rate at which chords change in a given musical passage or composition. For example, a phrase in 4 4

time starting with chords that change once per measure might subsequently progress to chords changing at a half- or quarter-note pace, demonstrating acceleration of harmonic rhythm.
PIT-2.H.4
In tonal music, the ordering of chords is governed by a web of relationships where each chord possesses a contextual role, identified as its function. Based on harmonic context, all chords in a given harmonic progression may be described as fulfilling one of the following functions—tonic, dominant, or predominant.
PIT-2.H.5
The most fundamental harmonic progression used by tonal composers to establish key is found in the following sequence of harmonic functions—tonic-dominant-tonic.
PIT-2.H.6
Common-practice repertoire includes specific chord successions that are considered normative and usable in the composition of a tonal chord progression. A chord progression that deviates from the norm is generally avoided in the common-practice approach. For instance,
V to IV, though common in some styles of popular music, is called a retrogression.
PIT-2.I.1
Cadence refers to the point of relative repose that concludes a harmonic progression or melodic phrase. Through historical practice, certain chord patterns have emerged as acceptable harmonic formulas for use at cadences. This group of acceptable cadence types fit generally into two categories— inconclusive cadences (i.e., half, imperfect authentic, and deceptive cadences) and conclusive cadences (i.e., perfect authentic and plagal cadences). A perfect authentic cadence is created by the Ⅴ-I progression with both harmonies in root position, ending with scale degree 1 in the soprano. An imperfect authentic cadence is also a Ⅴ-I progression, but chords may be inverted, with any chord tone in the soprano.  These cadence types influence phrase structure and musical form.

PIT-4.A.6
When composing music in a four-voice texture, the normative conventions for writing chordal sevenths should be followed.
PIT-4.A.7
When part-writing, chordal sevenths should be approached by common tone or by step.
When the voice-leading context precludes these options, chordal sevenths may also be approached by ascending leap or (rarely) by a descending leap of a third.
PIT-4.A.8
All chordal sevenths should resolve by a descending step, to avoid an unresolved seventh. However, the chordal seventh in a
V4 3 chord may move up by a step when appearing in a I-V4 3-I6 progression. In some cases, the chordal seventh may be retained in the same voice before resolving down by a step.
PIT-4.A.9
The fifth of a root-position dominant seventh chord may be omitted if it helps the voice leading. When the fifth is omitted in a root position seventh chord, the root should be doubled. All inverted seventh chords, however, must be spelled completely in writing the chord.

UNIT 5
Building Course Skills
In Unit 5, students further develop their understanding of voice leading and harmony as they explore predominant function in tonic-predominant-dominant-tonic (T-PD-D-T) musical phrases. Students will need to demonstrate a level of proficiency in understanding melody, harmonic relationships among diatonic chords, and basic 18th-century voice-leading procedures. Once again, as students explore predominant function, they may benefit from engaging in voice leading with two voices before voice leading with four voices.
As students’ understanding of musical phrase expands to include predominant function, they will also need to practice hearing, analyzing, and writing predominant chords. Studying common harmonic progressions that include predominant chords will help students more quickly identify these types of harmonies in both aural and written contexts. The same approach to aural and written skill building goes for the different types of 6 4 chords included in this unit.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The AP exam assesses students through such tasks as realizing a figured bass and following 18th-century voice-leading procedures. On the exam, students also indicate chords’ harmonic functions, write a given harmonic progression in four voices, and complete a bass line for a given melody while supplying the Roman and Arabic numerals that indicate the implied harmonies. Students will need numerous opportunities, accompanied by ongoing formative feedback, to practice composition exercises that assess their understanding of and skill with harmony and voice leading.
On past exams, students have demonstrated limited understanding of 6 4 chords. In Unit 5, they explore how musicians use inverted chords to fulfill specific harmonic (or even melodic) purposes. As a result, students can practice this strategic musicianship in composition exercises, like adapted versions of Free-Response Question 7.
Developing Understanding
This unit calls for students to analyze, describe, and create more complex harmonic
progressions in the form of four-part (SATB) voice leading. Attention is focused on
learning additional chord types and functions, with an emphasis on cadential and 6 4
chords. The goal is for students to expand their knowledge of voice-leading conventions
and procedures to build confidence with part writing, score analysis, and harmonic
dictation. It is also important for students to continue practicing and receiving formative
feedback to further develop and hone skills in sight-singing and error detection. Then, in
Unit 6, students will discover the expressive possibilities offered by embellishing tones and learn about motives and melodic devices.
BIG IDEA 1
Pitch §§ How do 18th-century voice-leading conventions and procedures regulate interactions of four voices in harmony?
§§ How and why are embellishing tones included in compositions?
§§ How can motives be developed and transformed?

Topic
Sample Activity 1 5.1
Composing
Present students with a three-chord tonic-dominant-tonic progression containing
a perfect authentic cadence. Compose a series of elaborations of that progression,
using three-chord tonic expansion patterns and then inserting appropriately placed
predominant harmonies into the overall progression. Play and sing the progression after each addition.
2 5.2
Activating Prior Knowledge
Invite two students to play “Heart and Soul” on the piano. Discuss the chord progression,
the function of each harmony, the voice-leading (including how it is not 18th-century
chorale-style voice leading), and particularly the use of the vi chord. Repeat the process with Pachelbel’s Canon in D.
3 5.3
Close Reading
Select four-chord excerpts from works such as J.S. Bach’s Well-Tempered Clavier
Bk. 1 C Major and C Minor Preludes. Ask students to identify the chords and their
harmonic function, then examine the voice-leading of each chord member. Sketch a
four-voice chorale-style progression that represents the structure of the excerpt, and
have students sing that while listening to a recording of the excerpt.
4 5.4
Listen and Analyze
Play a recording of a popular song that contains an example of a iii chord (e.g., "While
My Guitar Gently Weeps" by The Beatles) and ask students to identify the chord
progression. Ask them to think of other pop songs that use the iii chord. Then discuss
reasons why this chord is relatively uncommon in 18th-century classical music.
5 5.6 and 5.7
Sticky-Note Score Comment
Post score excerpts at several stations around the room, each of which contains multiple 6
4 chords. Have students work in groups to locate and label by type a 6 4 chord in each excerpt, then rotate to another excerpt.

As with most seventh chords, the chordal seventh should resolve by a descending step.
In some cases, the chordal seventh may be retained in the same voice before resolving down by a step, such as when ii7 moves to a cadential 6 4 chord.

Cadential 6 4 Chords
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
PIT-2.K
Identify the type of 6 4 chord used in notated music.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-2.K.1
In composing tonal music, care must be taken in the use of second-inversion triads, or 6 4 chords, as they may only appear in four
specific contexts: cadential 6 4, neighboring or pedal 6 4, passing 6 4, and arpeggiated 6 4 patterns.
PIT-2.K.2
The cadential 6 4 precedes the dominant, often at a cadence. Although it contains the notes of the tonic triad, it does not exercise a tonic function but serves as an embellishment of the dominant. It occurs in a metrically stronger position than the dominant chord, and upper voices most often move by step to the tones of the dominant. It may be notated as V 6 4-5 3.

Additional 6 4 Chords
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
PIT-2.L
Describe the type of 6 4 chord used in notated music.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-2.L.1
The neighboring or pedal 6 4 occurs when the third and fifth of a root-position triad are embellished by their respective upper neighbor tones while the bass remains stationary. In this pattern, the 6 4 chord usually occurs on a weak beat.
PIT-2.L.2
The passing 6 4 harmonizes the second note of a three-note ascending or descending scale fragment in the bass; it harmonizes a bass passing tone. In this pattern, the 6 4 chord usually occurs on a weak beat and the motion of the upper voices is ordinarily by step.
PIT-2.L.3
The arpeggiated 6 4 results from triad arpeggiation in the bass. With the upper voices sounding a static chord, the bass arpeggiates a complete triad, or alternatively, it oscillates between root and fifth of the chord, as often heard in a waltz or march.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-4.F.1
When part-writing a passing 6 4 chord, the fifth of the 6 4 chord should be doubled, and all voices should move in stepwise motion.
PIT-4.F.2
When part-writing a pedal (or neighboring) 6 4 chord, the third and the fifth of a root-position triad are embellished by their respective upper neighbor tones while the bass remains stationary.
PIT-4.F.3
When part-writing an arpeggiated 6 4 chord, the bass line arpeggiates the same triad. The three upper voices are stationary and only the bass moves.
PIT-4.F.4
When a bass line is added to a soprano line, harmonic progressions are implied. To keep these harmonic progressions plausible and strong, these conventions should be followed— §§ 6 4 chords may appear in tonally appropriate contexts as long as they are rhythmically appropriate to their context—that is, cadential 6 4 occur on a strong beat and passing or neighboring (pedal) six-fours on a weak beat.
§§ A chord may proceed to any other chord except for one that results in a poor chord
succession, e.g., Avoid V-IV, V-ii, ii-iii, IV-iii, ii-I, V-vi6, and iii-viio, etc.
§§ Any chord may be implied as long as it does not result in poor chord use. Poor chord use could include—root-position viio, vi6 (unless as part of a modulation, parallel motion by first-inversion chords, or other acceptable diatonic sequence), and iii6 (unless as part of parallel motion by first-inversion chords or other acceptable diatonic sequence).

UNIT 6
Building Course Skills
With a foundational understanding of melody and harmony, students are prepared to augment their understanding of counterpoint through embellishing tones (i.e., nonharmonic or nonchord tones). Unit 6 gives students an opportunity to analyze a given melody within its harmonic context and examine portions of a melody that reside outside of harmonies.
Through this study of embellishing tones, students will be empowered to analyze, sing, and compose more complex melodies.
Motives are given a more formal treatment in Unit 6, as students have a fuller musical foundation to describe, analyze, and perhaps even compose motives. Understanding motives and melodic and harmonic sequences requires that students be able to recognize pitch and rhythm patterns in music, which in turn builds the understanding that music is intentionally designed.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Students write embellishments, such as a passing tones or suspensions, only when indicated by figured bass on Free-Response
Question 5 or Roman and Arabic numerals on Free-Response Question 6; furthermore, they are encouraged to use only unaccented passing and neighbor tones on Free-
Response Question 7. Therefore, students should develop proficiency in writing embellishments when they are indicated by figured bass or Roman and Arabic numerals and also in writing with unaccented passing and neighbor tones when composing.
In order to understand motives and melodic and harmonic sequences that appear on the multiple-choice section of the exam, students need to recognize musical patterns.
Through contextual listening, score analysis exercises, sight-singing, and composition exercises, students need to hone pattern recognition skills in order to parse performed and notated music with greater ease, strategically approach sight-singing tasks, and eventually include patterns in their own compositions.
Developing Understanding
This unit continues students’ work with skills and concepts of harmony and voice leading.
Embellishing tones add variety and expressive possibility to harmonic progressions. Students
learn to identify motives—short melodic or rhythmic ideas that form the basic units of
phrases—and understand how variations are created through motivic transformation. They
also learn to identify melodic and harmonic sequences. Students’ understanding of pitch and
rhythm must be continually reinforced in this unit through ongoing practice and support with ear
training, sight-singing, error detection, harmonic and melodic dictation, score analysis, and part
writing. Next, Unit 7 calls for students to apply understanding of keys, scale degrees, and chords to identify and produce tonicization.

Marking the Score
Have students listen to the opening phrases of Mozart K. 545 and provide them with
the score. Using colored pencils, have students circle upper neighbors with one color and passing tones with another.
2 6.3
Museum Walk
Pair students and assign them an embellishing tone. Have each pair create a visually
interesting poster that contains the definition, a graphic representation of the
embellishing tone, and at least three examples from standard literature (with the
embellishing tone highlighted). One student stays and explains the poster, and the
other tours the “museum” to look at the other posters. Then switch.
3 6.4
Chunking the Score
Look at suspensions in three-chord blocks that include the preparation, dissonance,
and resolution. Ask students to identify all three parts of the suspension in the score,
and discuss how suspensions add rhythmic complexity and harmonic tension to the music.
4 6.4
Activating Prior Knowledge
When learning to identify the Arabic numerals for suspensions, have students
review their knowledge of dissonant and consonant intervals. Use this discussion to
introduce the fact that the numbers associated with each type of suspension refer to a dissonant interval that resolves to a consonance.
5 6.5
Composing
Provide students with a melodic motive such as the subject of an 18th-century
invention. Assign pairs of students a type of motivic transformation such as
augmentation or inversion, and ask them to compose the transformed version of the
motive. Have each pair sing the transformed motive for the class.
6 6.6
Predict and Confirm
Melodic Dictation: First have students listen to the carol Angels We Have Heard on
High. Give them the opening 5 notes of the third phrase (“Gloria…”) and have them
predict and notate the rest of the melodic sequence. Then have the students put a
box around each melodic motive (pattern) and note how it is sequenced down a step.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
PIT-2.M
Identify types of embellishing tones, including nonharmonic tones, in— a. performed music b. notated music
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-2.M.1
To expand individual lines and/or intensify expression, composers often enrich a chordal framework with various types of decorative notes, or embellishing tones. When these notes lie outside the pitch content of the prevailing chord they are called nonharmonic tones, or nonchord tones. Most nonharmonic tones may be classified as a specific type (e.g., passing tone), based on the way the nonharmonic tone is melodically approached and resolved.
Rhythmic placement of a nonharmonic tone—i.e., whether it falls directly on a beat or on a division between beats—serves to further define its classification, namely whether it is accented or unaccented.
PIT-2.M.2
Other terms that relate to nonharmonic tones include embellishment, ornament, trill, preparation, and resolution.
PIT-2.M.3
Common classifications of nonharmonic tones include passing tones (accented and unaccented) and neighbor tones (including lower neighbor and upper neighbor).

RHY-3.B.1
Rhythmic patterns can be transformed.
Two of the most common ways to transform a rhythmic pattern are by augmentation and diminution.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
RHY-3
Rhythmic devices—Musicians use established rhythmic devices to expand
expressive possibilities. These devices often achieve their effect by challenging the
regularity of meter or transforming rhythmic patterns.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Identify and apply melodic procedures in— a. performed music b. notated music
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-3.E.1
To enrich their works, composers often develop motives, melodic segments, or entire melodies using melodic procedures that transform those original ideas in various ways and are therefore sometimes called motivic transformation or thematic transformation. Some procedures focus solely on rhythmic transformation (e.g., augmentation), some procedures focus solely on pitch transformation (e.g., melodic inversion), and some procedures transform both pitch and rhythm (e.g., retrograde).

UNIT 7
Building Course Skills
Unit 7 requires students to have a proficient understanding of melodic and harmonic relationships and functions within a diatonic context. Without such a firm understanding earned through ear training and analysis of written music, students may not recognize tonicization when it occurs in music.
Identifying instances of tonicization in performed music requires them to engage in many contextual listening opportunities to hear and distinguish a tonicized chord from other diatonic chords. Regarding notated music, identifying instances of tonicization requires them to distinguish pitches with accidentals from expected pitches within a given key. Once they can identify instances of tonicization, students must be able to describe the function of the tonicization (e.g., secondary dominant, and secondary leading tone), which requires them to have a deep understanding of key relationships and harmonic relationships of diatonic chords in a variety of keys.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Music Theory Exam, several multiple-choice questions pertain to secondary function chords. One of the harmonic dictation free-response questions, Free-Response Question 6, and Free-Response Question 7 each presents an opportunity for students to demonstrate their understanding of secondary function chords. While students should certainly develop proficiency in tonicization through secondary functions, more importantly, they should confidently apply understanding and proficiency with skills associated with harmonic progressions and harmonic functions.
Students will encounter explicit key relationship and tonicization questions in the multiple-choice section of the AP exam. Students who find the concept of tonicization challenging should concentrate on developing proficiency with the more foundational skills and concepts associated with scales and key signatures of various keys, along with understanding melody and harmony in a diatonic context, before committing substantial time to the concepts in this unit.
Developing Understanding
In this unit, harmonic elements, relationships, and procedures introduced and developed
in earlier units are further studied. Students deepen their understanding of keys, scale
degrees, and chords as they focus on the process of tonicization. They analyze the effects
of secondary dominant chords and secondary leading-tone chords and learn how these
particular harmonic events are treated in the context of part writing. Students practice
describing key relationships in musical compositions in which a non-tonic chord
is momentarily emphasized using chords borrowed from its tonic key. In preparation for
Unit 8, the final unit, students should continue regular practice of aural skills, dictation, and sight-singing.

Suggested Activity 1 7.1
ReComposing
Using a short chorale phrase that begins and ends in the tonic, have students
recompose the end of the phrase using a secondary dominant chord that leads to
and tonicizes a stable non-tonic triad. Students should verbalize or write about their
choices, changes, and how they applied part-writing rules.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
PIT-2.Q
Identify and describe tonicization in— a. performed music b. notated music
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-2.Q.1
The particular key that starts and ends a given work is that work’s tonic, or primary, key.
However, scale degrees or chords other than the tonic may be made to sound as if they are temporary tonics; the process of achieving this is called tonicization. Tonicization possesses a fleeting quality due to its relatively brief duration and the lack of a clear cadence in the new key. Tonicization is a local harmonic event that does not change the primary key of the music. Diatonic scale degrees from the primary key are altered to achieve tonicization;
these altered scale degrees are shown with accidentals in notated music.

UNIT 7
Harmony and Voice Leading IV: Secondary Function
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-2.Q.2
The most common way to effect tonicization is through use of a secondary dominant (or applied dominant) chord. A major or minor triad other than the actual tonic chord is preceded by its own dominant chord, the secondary (or applied) dominant, allowing the original triad
to be felt as a temporary tonic (i.e., tonicized).
For instance, the Ⅴ chord in the key of C major (a G-major triad) could be preceded by its own dominant or dominant seventh chord, which would be spelled D-F♯-A and D-F♯-A-C, respectively. In this example, this “Ⅴ of Ⅴ” chord (notated Ⅴ /Ⅴ) would resolve to and tonicize the Ⅴ chord of the original key, exploiting the power of a dominant-to-tonic progression to assert a new, albeit temporary, tonic. Although the dominant (Ⅴ) is the most common chord to be tonicized by its own secondary dominant (Ⅴ /Ⅴ), any major or minor triad may also be tonicized through use of a secondary dominant, such as Ⅴ /ⅱ resolving to ii or Ⅴ /Ⅳ resolving to Ⅳ. Secondary dominants nearly always require accidentals in their spelling, and they may appear as triads or dominant seventh chords in any inversion appropriate to the harmonic context.

When part-writing secondary dominants, all doubling and voice-leading considerations of normal dominant chords should be maintained (e.g., chordal sevenths resolving down by step).
PIT-2.E.3
When a bass line is added to a soprano line, harmonic progressions are implied. Chromatic pitches may suggest the tonicization of a chord other than the prevailing tonic. One common instance would be a ♯ˆ4 resolving to ˆ5, a melodic pattern that may suggest tonicization of the dominant chord (Ⅴ) by means of a secondary dominant chord (Ⅴ /Ⅴ).

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
PIT-2.Q
Identify and describe tonicization in— a. performed music b. notated music
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PIT-2.Q.3
As with secondary (or applied) dominants, secondary leading-tone chords or secondary diminished seventh chords (also referred to as applied leading-tone chords or applied diminished seventh chords) may also be used to tonicize any major or minor triad in a given key. Secondary leading-tone chords are diminished triads and diminished seventh chords (fully or half-diminished) whose root is the leading tone of the chord being tonicized.
A “ⅶo7 of Ⅴ” (notated ⅶo7/Ⅴ) tonicizes the
Ⅴ chord and is built on ˆ4 of the original key;
in another example, ⅶo7/ ii would tonicize the ii chord and would be built on ˆ1 of the original key. As with normal leading-tone chords, the triad only appears in first-inversion (i.e., ⅶo6), but seventh chords may appear in any inversion appropriate to the harmonic context. Because the half-diminished leading tone chord only appears in the major mode, secondary leading-tone chords that are half diminished in quality may only be used to tonicize major triads.

UNIT 8
Building Course Skills
Examining modes allows students an expanded exploration and understanding of tonality by comparing the modes to major and minor scales. Contextual listening and score analysis of modes in real musical contexts can provide a better understanding of modes than merely memorizing their names and scale patterns.
This unit also includes a more in-depth study of form, which requires students to have developed proficiency in identifying and analyzing musical patterns. Before engaging with these more advanced concepts of form, students will need a deep understanding of a musical phrase, including the various types of cadences. This means they should be able to identify phrases in both performed and notated music, compare the relationships among a series of phrases, and analyze how phrases build periods. Finally, with a deeper understanding of phrase relationships, students can apply these concepts as they examine common musical forms.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The concepts of modes, phrase relationships, and forms are assessed in the multiple-choice section of the AP
Music Theory Exam. This means that students must engage in analyzing both performed and notated music to identify these concepts, identify patterns, compare patterns, and understand function. Students will need to access a variety of music (non-
Western or global, pop, jazz, fusion, etc.) that demonstrates a variety of modes and forms in order to discuss such concepts in the music they hear and in the notated music they analyze. Furthermore, this final unit provides opportunities for students to engage in a comprehensive review of the course as they apply their skills with and understanding of musical concepts developed in other units to the analysis of phrase relationships and form. Such an integrated approach to studying music is an instructionally sound way to prepare students for the AP Music Theory Exam.
Developing Understanding
Throughout the course, students have been working to construct a strong foundational
understanding of pitch, rhythm and meter, melody, harmony, and voice leading. This unit
covers the use of conventions that affect the character of music, ranging from identifying
the different tonal qualities of modes, to describing phrase relationships within a score or
performance, to recognizing common sections of a musical composition. By working with
many diverse musical examples throughout the course, students can apply understanding
of musical components, relationships, and conventions to confidently predict patterns
and effects of myriad combinations within a performance or score. This fluency enables
them to respond to complex musical problems and encourages continued discovery of the
communicative and expressive possibilities of musical forms.

Form—As with language, music exhibits a structural aspect known as form, in
which a musical composition is organized in a hierarchy of constituent parts. The
specific ways these parts are related, contrasted, and/or developed produces the
unique profile of an individual composition. Specific formal types and functions may
be identified when parts of a composition follow established melodic-harmonic
patterns or fulfill established roles within the overall hierarchical structure.

Selecting and Using Course Materials
College Board does not endorse any particular AP
Music Theory textbook. Many of the textbooks used in
notable colleges, universities, and conservatories are
suitable resources for the AP Music Theory course.
An example textbook list can be found here.
Primary Materials
When selecting primary course materials, consider the
following questions:
Does the textbook align with the scope of the AP Music
Theory course?
§§ Review the AP Music Theory course framework to determine if the textbook addresses all concepts and skills.
§§ If the textbook does not address particular concepts and/or skills, how easy would it be to address those concepts and/or skills by using other resources?
§§ Are concepts addressed that are beyond the scope of the AP Music Theory course? If so, are there so many as to be distracting or confusing, or are
they potentially beneficial? Does the design of the textbook allow these concepts to be skipped?
§§ Does the textbook reflect current introductory college-level tonal theory content and skills?
Does the textbook align with your planned instructional sequence?
§§ If not, is the text organized to facilitate teaching chapters or topics out of the given sequence?
Is the content presented in a way that is appropriate for high school students?
§§ Are the language, organization, and presentation appropriate for high school students performing college-level work?
Which textbooks are used at the colleges, universities,
and conservatories that your students will likely attend?
§§ As students transition to college music theory
coursework, it will be helpful if resources used in
their high school class correspond with those used at their target institutions.
What are the quality and quantity of musical examples included with the text?
§§ Are there enough good-quality examples to support written and aural skill development, including sight-singing?
§§ Is there an anthology? If not, do you have access to a library of musical examples curated by topic?
§§ If the anthology and recordings are cost-prohibitive, how might you address gaps in the text?
What is the quality of the in-class exercises and homework assignments?
§§ Are the instructions clear and easy for students to follow?
§§ Are they authentic or presented in context?
§§ Do they effectively assess students’ achievement of the course objectives?
§§ Are they compatible with your instructional approach and planned sequence?
Is there an accompanying website?
§§ Are the online resources useful to you and your students?
What materials will students need to access outside of class?
§§ Do all students have reliable access to them?
Supplemental Materials
Although most primary texts include exercises and
musical examples that develop both written and aural
skills, you may supplement your text with resources
that emphasize contextual listening, sight-singing, and dictation (melodic and harmonic).
CONTEXTUAL LISTENING
Students need to practice listening to identify musical
features such as tonality, timbre, and harmonic function
in performed music without reference to a score. A
high quality music theory textbook will include musical
examples in each chapter. However, it is important
to increase the quantity and broaden the diversity of
these examples for both written and aural analysis. See
“Additional Teacher Resources” on p. 171 for helpful online resources.

AP Music Theory Course and Exam Description

=== Page 177 ===
SIGHT-SINGING
Students are asked to sight-sing on the AP Music
Theory exam; therefore, your curriculum must include a
sight-singing component that supports development of
sight-singing skills. Some music theory and aural skills
textbooks are accompanied by a sight-singing text. If
this is not the case, you may select one to coordinate
with the content sequencing of your textbook. You may
also find or write carefully-sequenced sight-singing examples of your own.
DICTATION (MELODIC AND HARMONIC)
A strategically sequenced melodic and harmonic
dictation curriculum is necessary to build aural skills and musicianship necessary for success with the
AP Music Theory exam and subsequent studies.
Some sight-singing resources can serve as melodic dictation exercises as well. Many teachers create
their own exercises for harmonic dictation. Whatever
approach you use, take care that dictation exercises are
sequenced logically and are integrated to complement
aural, written, and analytical concepts and skills throughout the course.
Additional Classroom Resources
You may find the following materials and equipment,
subject to availability, helpful for enriching your music
theory instruction:
§§ An anthology or collection of scores to be studied visually and aurally §§ A workbook or teacher-prepared exercises
coordinating with a textbook or written materials for student practice §§ Recordings of musical works from a textbook, workbook, or anthology
§§ A collection of melodies for sight-singing (may be a book, part of an aural skills package, or teacher assembled) §§ Materials for melodic and harmonic dictation (may be part of an aural skills package, or teacher assembled)
§§ Quality audio equipment for playing music during
instruction (Low-quality audio produced by a single
computer for an entire class diminishes learning.) §§ Instruments for live performance of music.

Instructional Strategies
The following instructional strategies offer diverse approaches to teaching AP Music Theory concepts and skills and are adaptable to the needs and interests of teachers and students. Some are
referenced in the section on developing the course
skills (see p. 182) to show how these strategies can be used for both content and skill instruction.
No matter which instructional strategies are chosen,
students should have practice applying their music
theory knowledge and skills with a variety of musical
literature and in diverse musical contexts. Access to
a wide-ranging library of recorded music and scores, practice space, and musical equipment are ideal
supports to students’ practice of listening, analysis, performance, and composition skills. When time
allows, teachers are encouraged to use live concert performances as extensions of the classroom. Pre concert activities such as sight-singing, dictation, and
analysis of excerpts chosen from the concert program
or post-concert reports guided by well-designed study
questions help students connect the content of the
theory class with the world of live music. Also, many
meaningful exercises can be derived from the students’ own solo and ensemble repertoire.
Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Activating Prior
Knowledge
Providing an opportunity for students to think about what they already know about a concept and share their knowledge with a wider audience.
To prepare students to encounter new concepts prior to reading notated music or listening to music.
Students bring in personal music that is appropriate for class in terms of language and content. The teacher guides student identification of relevant concepts in the music.
A student selects two musical examples for the class to hear. Then, the class analyzes and compares each example according to a list of concepts on the
Interactive Word Wall (see p. 175) that the class has studied previously.
Ask the Expert (or Students as
Experts)
Assigning students as “experts” on problems they have mastered;
groups rotate through the expert stations to learn about problems they have not yet mastered.
Provides opportunities for students to share their knowledge and learn from one another.
Some students may have a natural inclination for melodic and harmonic dictation. Choose a student who excels at dictation and help them formulate a short lesson plan about how they approach dictation. Have them present their personal strategy to the class. Form a list of suggestions and pointers from all students in the class, and try their different approaches.
When learning to write minor scales, the teacher assigns students as “experts” on natural minor, harmonic minor, melodic minor, finding parallel keys, and relative keys. Students rotate through stations in groups, working with the station expert to complete exercises on that topic.

Strategy

Purpose
Example
Chunking the
Score
Breaking a score into smaller, familiar, manageable units (e.g., measures, rhythmic patterns, motives, phrases, periods, cadence patterns, chord progressions, sentences) by numbering, separating phrases, drawing boxes, etc.
Identifying common musical units “as a chunk” rather than element by element.
To reduce students’ feelings of intimidation when encountering long or complex phrases, periods, sentences, or whole scores, to increase comprehension of difficult or challenging scores.
Teach part-writing in three-chord “chunks.” Have students notate a perfect authentic cadence and sing through each voice. Form a short melody by linking the three-chord chunks together. (For
example: do-sol-do, mi-re-do, sol-fa-mi, and do-ti-do.) As the students sing the melody, notate the cadence in a variety of keys, both major and minor (pointing out the raised leading tone in the minor).
Then choose a key and alter the perfect authentic cadence to form a number of different imperfect authentic cadences, reviewing and reinforcing the differences between perfect and imperfect authentic cadences.
Close Reading
Working with a brief musical passage in great detail, identifying as many elements as possible.
To develop comprehensive understanding by engaging in one or more focused readings of a score.
Choose a string quartet, four-part vocal score, or any other easily accessible score.
Have students analyze the first strong cadence (often around measure eight).
Working backward, chord by chord, do a harmonic analysis, stopping to discuss how each chord relates to each other and mapping the chords (perhaps referencing chord progression organizers used in class). After analyzing the harmonies, have students go back to the beginning of the score and examine the melodies to analyze how a motive is developed.
Composing
Writing or creating a short original work within a defined set of parameters.
To reinforce music concepts and encourage students to order and arrange parts and elements in a way that creates a cohesive whole.
While the AP Music Theory Exam does not require students to compose original works but rather complete compositions using common-practice-style norms, incorporating music composition in instructional practice can help students learn and reinforce music theory concepts and skills. Composing requires students to synthesize all aspects of music theory and provides an important aesthetic experience that can often be lacking in the traditional music theory classroom.
Immediately following the study of major and minor scales and key signatures, the students create a composition in ABA form.
Begin by having them compose a melody in a major mode (A section) and then rewrite the melody in the relative minor (B section).
Later in the year, when students begin part-writing, revisit the composition and have them harmonize the melody using two-voice counterpoint and following 18th century stylistic norms. Have the students perform the compositions in class on their respective instruments. Assess and critique the compositions.

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Decomposing
Deconstructing a melodic passage or musical example to extract the underlying structure and show how all elements of the piece relate to its underlying structure.
To recognize that music consists of multiple layers of musical elements, compositional devices, and procedures over a fundamental framework.
Present students with a four-voice score.
Gradually, reduce the composition’s elements (nonchord tones, inversions, inner voices, etc.) until all that remains is the outer-voice counterpoint, figured bass, melody line, three chunk chords for tonic prolongations, and/or three chunk chords at the cadences. Compare the score reduction to the original score and discuss the underlying structure and the function of the other elements.
Double-Entry
Journal
Creating a two-column journal (also called dialectical journal) with a score or excerpt for listening in one column and the student’s response in the second column (e.g., asking questions of the score, forming personal responses, interpreting the score, and reflecting on the process of making meaning of the score).
To respond to a score or excerpt for listening with comments, questions, or insights to foster active involvement with music and to facilitate increased comprehension.
This approach works best when the musical example is printed either at the top or bottom of the page, with blank space above or below for students to fill in responses. Short 8- to-16-measure excerpts work best. Or, select a passage for aural analysis.
Have students generate their own questions based on the excerpt. Perhaps guide students with questioning by providing a list of stem questions (e.g., What key …? How does the motive …? Which nonchord tone …?).
Once students have generated three to five questions, they form groups for discussion of the score. Alternatively, students can create mini-quizzes for the class.
Exemplary
Models
Bringing in guests, featuring students, or using videos to show examples of performances by distinguished musicians and/or ensembles.
To expand student musical experiences in contextual listening.
Using selected segments of the Omnibus and Young People’s Concerts DVDs, students can focus on core concepts.
“What Is a Mode” and “Musical Atoms:
A Study of Intervals” from the Young
People’s concerts are excellent examples. Similarly, the discussion of “dissonance” in the “Introduction to Modern Music” from the Omnibus series helps develop a broader and more informed view of chord and nonchord tones.
Graphic
Organizer
Using a visual representation for the organization of information.
To facilitate increased comprehension and discussion.
When trying to determine the form of an aural stimulus musical excerpt, have students create a visual map or graphic representation of the excerpt. A box might represent a phrase. As the music plays, the students take notes in the boxes. What did they hear? Compare and discuss how the information in the boxes can help generate the correct notation.

Purpose
Example
I Do, We Do,
You Do
Teaching a skill by first modeling the skill and giving students an opportunity to practice the skill, first in a small group setting, then independently.
To provide opportunities for the students to observe then develop a skill through practice and increasing independence.
Model for students the procedures for voice leading tendency tones. After modeling, have students complete a voice-leading exercise in pairs. Select three pairs to show their work on the board. Then, the whole class evaluates the work on the board, identifying errors, making suggestions about how to fix or avoid errors, and/or suggesting alternative voice-leading responses.
Finally, students are given another exercise to complete independently.
Interactive
Word Wall
Creating an interactive visual display of words and concepts that serve as a constant reminder for students as these words and concepts are introduced, applied, and mastered over the course.
To provide a reinforcement of learned concepts, a reference for listening, performing, and writing, and an ever-present tool for building musical concept knowledge and awareness.
Each unit introduces new concepts, vocabulary, and/or charts that students should internalize for success in the
AP Music Theory classroom. Perhaps
make two word walls: one for vocabulary and expressive elements and the other for graphic organizers for students to reference (e.g., triads and their inversions, chord progression chart, common diatonic harmonies in major and minor keys, etc.). Be sure that the word walls can be easily covered for assessments or to increase student independence.
Listen and Analyze
Students identify, assess, classify, diagram, notate, or enumerate musical patterns (rhythms, melodies, harmonic progressions, forms, etc.) based on a variety of aural stimuli.
To reinforce the connections between the AP Music Theory course content and the act of listening to music.
Using an example of standard repertoire from the Common Practice Period (CPP), students listen to a recording and identify specific elements in the accompanying written score.
Listen and Create
Creating musical examples based on an aural stimulus.
To explore, expand, and revise musical structures based on an aural stimulus.
Students compose a short melody inspired by a specific musical element, such as a seventh chord, interval, or chord progression.
Students perform their composed melodies and then practice improvising new melodies based on the same stimulus by singing or using recorders,
Orff instruments, or the instruments they already study.

Purpose
Example
Listen and Respond
Generating responses to an aural stimulus.
To elicit a musical response (sing/play) to an aural stimulus from a variety of rhythmic, melodic, and/or harmonic sources.
Play or sing a short melodic passage that the students sing back after one hearing using a pre-established sight-singing methodology. Incrementally increase the length of the examples and range of the passages. (This strategy may also serve as a precursor and formative diagnostic for melodic dictation.)
After giving students a cue, play a short harmonic progression (only one hearing).
Then, students complete the harmonic progression.
Look for a
Pattern
Students examine music to find a trend.
To identify patterns that may be used to make predictions.
Help students identify common and predictable ways to end a musical phrase or passage.
Identify a melodic motive in a piece of music for students, perhaps listening to the motive several times. Then, ask students to continue listening to the piece of music and identify when that motive occurs again.
Manipulatives/
Kinesthetics
Using a kinesthetic approach to making meaning in which students are asked to use physical objects (beyond musical instruments) that they maneuver to build understanding of a musical concept. This strategy includes using their own bodies.
To provide a tactile and visual means of examining music to encourage multiple ways of understanding musical concepts.
Use small objects of the same size (poker chips, game pieces, blocks, etc.) to represent the value of the smallest note subdivision in a rhythmic pattern (e.g., one block = eighth note). Students see a written rhythm or hear a performed rhythm, and then construct it by grouping and arranging the items (e.g., a dotted quarter note followed by an eighth note would be represented as three blocks grouped together, followed by a single block). Similarly, use a different type of object to represent rests.
Marking the
Score
Marking parts of a score by highlighting, underlining, and/or annotating for specific musical concepts.
To focus score analysis for specific purposes and to organize information; to facilitate reexamination of a score.
Have students use colored pencils to highlight different musical elements.
When teaching nonchord tones and embellishments, have students mark each one a different color, and box the chord of resolution on suspensions.
Seeing the shape of the boxes helps students understand how to identify a suspension or retardation.
For tendency tones, draw an arrow showing the resolution of a leading tone up and a chordal seventh down. When part-writing, this reminds students to consider both notes (tendency tone and resolution) when they edit their work.

Museum Walk
Display students’ work around the room.
Students stand in front of someone’s work and examine it, offering a comment, revision, praise, and so on, and then move to the next person’s displayed work.
To give students the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding through their work and to give and receive peer feedback.
Give students a composition exercise in which the beginning segment is given and the conclusion is governed by fixed but flexible parameters. After students complete the exercise, display students’ work (anonymously, if desired).
Students examine the displayed work and analyze the various ways their peers have completed the exercise, providing feedback for their peers.
Notation Read
Aloud
Reading symbols and notational representation aloud.
To accurately interpret symbolic representations and aid in the development of good sight-singing skills.
Have students sing a passage using both note names and solfège. Set a metronome to BPM = 60, and start the song again. This time, each student has to sing the next consecutive measure (in time) as the teacher calls out either “Note
Name” or “Solfѐge.”
Note-Taking
Creating a record of information while listening to an instructor.
To facilitate active listening; to record and organize ideas that assist in processing information.
Students create and maintain a logical, well-organized notebook, from which they can consistently and confidently access past information and notes.
Music theory concepts build on each other, so a student’s ability to easily reference previous instruction is of utmost importance. Perhaps when taking notes on a concept that will be referenced throughout the year (e.g., diatonic harmony or cadences), students take notes on colored paper so that they can easily access those notes.
Predict and Confirm
Making conjectures about what will happen next in a musical passage. Students confirm or modify their conjectures based on the actual next event.
To stimulate pattern recognition by making, checking, and correcting predictions.
Play for the class a number of short familiar folk melodies that exemplify clear period structures (“Twinkle, Twinkle
Little Star,” “Jingle Bells,” etc.). Have students aurally identify the antecedent or consequent cadence pattern. Have students brainstorm other songs from popular literature with this pattern.
Play or perform an example of standard repertoire from the CPP. Have students predict the cadences before you play them. After listening to the piece a number of times, distribute the score, and have students develop a harmonic analysis of the cadences. Discuss why they were able to predict the phrase structure.

Questioning the Score
Developing questions about a score as a student reads it.
To promote students’ focus, formation of their own questions, seeking out answers, and leading their own discussions.
Distribute to the class a page of a full symphonic score. Have students generate questions about concepts, such as key, meter, harmony, orchestration, motives, and expressive elements. Next, have students ask their questions to the whole group, and encourage students to formulate responses while referencing the score (and even performed music when applicable).
An extension activity is to ask students to create AP-like multiple-choice questions about the score (perhaps providing students with question stems to assist in their writing of effective questions). After writing a set of questions, have students trade and answer each other’s questions.
Quick Write
Notating a short melodic or harmonic passage with just one hearing.
To provide a foundation for melodic and harmonic dictation.
For melodic dictation, play a two measure melodic fragment of only quarter and eighth notes and of primarily conjunct motion. Play the melodic fragment only once, and have students write what they heard. As student skill progresses, incorporate leaps, more complex rhythms, and longer melodies.
For harmonic dictation, play a three chord progression. Play the progression only once, and have students write what they heard. It may be helpful to use this strategy to focus on particular student needs, such as hearing cadential progressions or typical tonic prolongations.

ReComposing
Substantially revising the pitches, rhythms, and/or patterns of an existing work or portion of a work and providing an analysis of the intent, results, and issues encountered throughout the revision process.
To practice and explore music concepts and skills through student creation and problem solving.
Begin with a completed score. Give students a set of parameters for altering specific elements (e.g., changing the composition from major to minor, changing the meter from simple to compound, altering the main motive) and discuss how the changes impact the composition. Next, use free or online software that allows the students to create looping rhythmic patterns. Using selected parts/patterns of the completed or altered composition, have students create additive layers to explore pattern repetition, rhythmic compliments, polyrhythms, and timbre. These explorations can be intended to enhance existing structures or radically alter the style and “feel” of the work.
After students have completed the Re-
Composition, they develop a reflection in which they discuss aspects of the process, such as pre-composition (intent, idea, purpose of their ReComposition), creation (what was experienced throughout the process, intentional and/or strategic awareness/use of particular music concepts and skills), and completion phases (was the end result satisfactory, not as expected, etc.).
(Note that the two parts of this
ReComposition exercise can treated as individual assignments or projects and developed over time to better support the course timeline.)
Retrieval
Practice
Articulating newly taught content to a partner, without referencing notes.
To practice recall of essential content, move new content into long-term memory, and demonstrate understanding.
Without referencing notes, students work in pairs to review the previous day’s lesson about predominant function. One student explains the lesson, while the other listens and offers encouragement and/or feedback regarding the accuracy and depth of information shared. Then the two students switch roles and repeat the activity.
Singing on
Solfège
Singing using the solfège system.
To develop tonal memory for scales, modes, chord qualities, and inversions; to decompose melodies and harmonies into music notation.
Have students arpeggiate root position triads using solfège. Change back and forth first between major and minor qualities, and then proceed to augmented and diminished. Students will gain an understanding of the sound and construction differences among each quality of triad.

Speed Drills
Completing as much of an activity as possible in a short period of time.
To help students develop efficiency in their application of concepts and skills.
Have students complete as many given tasks (such as writing key signatures, or spelling chords) as possible in a short period of time. The same activity can be repeated in subsequent classes to help students realize their progress or identify areas for more practice.
Give students a melody to sight-sing, with only a short period of time to prepare their performance and with limited aural prompts (e.g., starting pitch only).
Sticky Note
Score Comment
Students post comments on scores with sticky notes.
To engage students in the analysis of a score by making observations and learning from the observations of peers.
Create a series of stations, each featuring a different score. Divide the class into groups of two-four students at each station. Each group is assigned a different musical element or concept to identify and analyze and uses sticky notes to mark and comment on the score. Students rotate to another station and continue the sticky note commenting process so that at the end of the activity all scores have been marked and labeled.
Finally, at the last station in the rotation, each group reviews all of the sticky notes on the score and evaluates other groups’ observations.
Taking a
Different Look
Using charts, information sets, software, or images to represent sound and musical organization.
To provide students the opportunity to form a mental representation of musical elements and musical structures.
Use music software to look at the waveform of a piece of music while listening.
Use computer software for in-time commenting and graphs of a piece of music to connect analysis and the aural experience.
Learn a song by rote, then develop a method of notating it without using standard music notation.
Think Aloud
Talking through a difficult musical task by using a form of metacognition whereby an individual expresses how he/she has approached the task.
To reflect on how individuals think about and understand musical concepts.
When teaching secondary dominants, have students verbally articulate their thought process up at the board. For example, “Okay, so I’m in the key of G minor, and I need a V7/V. What is the root of the chord of resolution? It’s a D. Okay, so what would the dominant of that chord be? It’s an A. So A is the root. Now, I have to build a dominant seventh chord on that root. That will require an accidental, right?” continued on next page

Think-Pair-
Share
Considering and thinking about a topic or question and then writing what has been learned; pairing with a peer or a small group to share ideas; sharing ideas and discussion with a larger group.
To construct meaning about a topic or question; to test thinking in relation to the ideas of others; to prepare for a discussion with a larger group.
When realizing a figured bass line, spend the first five minutes asking the students to formulate their own soprano line. Then, pair the students and have them critique each other’s lines. Have students choose the best line or create a conglomeration of both. Finally, all solutions are notated on the board, and the quality of the responses are discussed as a whole group.
One way to adapt this strategy to provide another small group opportunity before whole-group sharing is to have paired students confer with another pair to reconcile, or “square,” the groups’ thinking and/or performance on the task.
This “square” step provides students with an opportunity for rethinking or revision.
With this added step, the strategy becomes Think-Pair-Square-Share.
Tonality Switch
Singing/playing examples in a key’s parallel major/minor.
To reinforce the similarities and differences of the parallel modes; to expand and enhance the possibilities of all melodic dictation and sight-singing examples.
Using well-known nursery rhymes or folk songs, have students sing/play in major and parallel minor keys using a variety of
methods:
1. sing/play the entire tune in each mode
2. change mode by phrase
3. change mode by measure
4. change mode by 1-to-2 beats (a good mental challenge)
An extension of this activity is to have students change among scale degree numbers, solfège syllables, and/or note names when changing mode. This activity may work better at the phrase and measure level, but at slower tempi, changing by beat may provide students with an added challenge.

Developing the Course Skills
INTRODUCTION
AP Music Theory students learn to approach music through a variety of modalities. Students practice processing
and analyzing music aurally, by listening to a performance, and visually, through analysis of musical scores. They
develop the ability to convert music between aural and written forms through practice with melodic and harmonic
dictation, sight-singing, and detecting discrepancies between performed and notated music. Students also apply
their understanding of pitch, rhythm, melody, harmony, and musical design to complete harmonic progressions
and compose bass lines that harmonize a melody. The tables that follow offer key questions, class activities, and
instructional strategies to accompany each skill of the course framework. These offerings are not meant to be
exhaustive or prescriptive; they are intended as suggestions to supplement your existing teaching practices.
Skill Category 1: Apply musical terms, concepts, and relationships to performed music (aural).
Listening skills are foundational to the study of music
theory. Students must be able to listen to music and
describe features and relationships of pitch, rhythm, melody, harmony, musical design, and expressive elements using correct symbols and terminology.
On the AP Music Theory Exam, students will be asked to
answer questions about performed music accompanied
by score excerpts and questions about performed music without reference to a score.

(This skill is applied in identification and definition exercises that typically accompany the introduction of new concepts.)
How do you identify and describe how high or low a pitch is? How loud or soft?
How do you aurally discern different types of textures?
How do you distinguish tonalities such as major and minor scales without the benefit of a score?
What are the distinctive aural characteristics of each mode?
How do you aurally identify the specific interval between two pitches?
What do interval inversions sound like, and how do you aurally identify chord inversions?
What do triads and seventh chords of each quality sound like, and how do you aurally identify chord quality?
Draw what you hear. Students use writing implements to illustrate contour and dynamics. Discuss.
Form small groups and have students stand near each other at different distances to represent intervals. Use the embodiment of intervals to create tableaus of scales, chords, and inversions.
Develop a routine of singing and aurally identifying pitch patterns that reinforce the sound of elements in the lesson. Once a singing routine has been established, repetition will translate into students being able to aurally identify the practiced chords, scales, intervals, and chord inversions.

Skill Category 2: Apply musical terms, concepts, and relationships to notated music.
AP Music Theory students practice, develop, and apply analytical skills by listening to performed
music, as described in the previous introduction to
skill category 1, and by examining music scores, the
focus of skill category 2. Students analyze scores
by identifying and relating information about pitch,
rhythm, melody, harmony, form, and musical design.
While score analysis focuses on musical notation, students should combine their practice analyzing scores with ear training, seeing and hearing the
music they study. Students benefit from instruction
that strategically connects visual score analysis with
the development of aural skills articulated in skill category 1.

What are parallel and relative keys?
How do you determine and describe the pitch distance (or interval) between two notated pitches?
What is meant by “interval inversion” and how do you determine a given interval’s inverted form?
How do you notate diatonic triads and seventh chords?
Use mnemonics to help students identify notes on the staff in all four clefs. Reinforce by using the student’s hand as a musical staff, where each finger represents a line.
Use an online resource such as a music theory website or flashcards to practice rapid visual identification of notated pitches, scales, intervals, and chords.
Practice identifying triad and seventh chord types using objects of two different sizes or colors (cookies, poker chips, buttons, beads, etc.) to represent major and minor thirds. Stack or arrange the objects in various combinations to represent the qualities of various triads and seventh chords. Formatively assess students’ understanding of chord quality by having students pair up and “challenge” each other with chord construction (e.g., Student 1 challenges Student 2 to create a D major-minor seventh chord) while you observe and provide feedback to students.

Skill Category 4: Complete music based on cues, following 18th-century stylistic norms
While traditional tonal music theory instruction typically focuses on 18th-century European art music conventions, AP Music Theory students should explore the creative choices and musical processes of composers and musicians of other
traditions and time periods. To be successful with the AP Music Theory exam, students must develop proficiency in following common practice period stylistic norms, and gain familiarity with music
from the standard Western tonal repertoire. At the same time, they should also be able to consider aesthetic, pragmatic, and technical aspects of composition when engaging with the works of any
musical tradition, including contemporary art music, jazz, popular music, and the music of non-Western cultures.”

4.B: Complete a four-part harmonic progression by realizing a figured bass line and providing a Roman numeral analysis of the completed progression.
How do the Arabic numbers (figured bass) help us determine the appropriate
Roman numeral analysis?
How do I synthesize the rules of voice leading to realize chords and perform a defensible analysis?
Through a series of preliminary exercises, guide students through a thought process for realizing a four-part harmonic progression.
Sing the bass line of a given figured bass progression as a class. Identify the root of the chord and its quality. Continue with each chord and discuss how each note can smoothly lead to the next in an 18th-century progression.
Sing each line of a four-part chorale separately. If there are too few students to cover all the parts, the chorale can be played on the piano or computer using sequencing or graphic notation software. Use multimodal ways (listening, writing, singing, embodying) to identify and indicate intervals, voice leading, and harmonic analysis.

4.C: Complete a four-part harmonic progression based on the Roman numeral analysis provided.
How do you synthesize the rules of voice leading and a given Roman numeral analysis to compose a chord progression?
Given a starting pitch and Roman numeral analysis, sight-compose and sight-sing the bass line.
Divide students into groups of three or four. For each chord in a progression, sing the bass note and then the solfège syllable for each interval above the bass.
Have the students bring instruments to class and perform the exercise(s). Identify any transposing instruments and transpose the exercise as needed.

4.D: Compose a bass line to harmonize a given melody, implying appropriate harmony, and identify the implied harmony using
Roman and Arabic numerals.
How do you synthesize the rules of voice leading to compose a bass line for a given melody?
How can a Roman numeral analysis help to verify if you’ve followed the rules of voice leading in a two-part composition?
What progressions are implied by three-note patterns such as Mi-Re-Do,
Do-Ti-Do, or Sol-Fa-Mi?
How can the basic phrase structure (T-P-D-T) guide your composition?
What does a chromatically altered pitch signal?
What is the harmonic rhythm of the example?
In a timed exercise, identify implied cadences and determine each type. Defend your argument.
Given a three-note pattern, compose an accompanying bass line and provide a feasible Roman numeral analysis.
In a given key, compose a three or four-chord basic phrase in all inversions. Expand to include secondary dominant chords via chromatically altered pitches.
Divide the class into two teams.
Students choose one to three notes to harmonize, and then they pass the pen to the other team. Individuals can alter up to two bass notes (before or after the chosen note) but must change the corresponding
Roman and Arabic numeral as well. A team receives a bonus point if the other team passes the pen before an error is recognized and corrected.

Instructional Focus 1.1
Pitch and Pitch
Notation
Sing by rote: Use echoing at first, then gradually shift to call-and-response as
students’ knowledge and skills improve. Practice phonating, sirens, sequenced
warm-ups; introduce teacher selected sight-singing system syllables (e.g., solfège
or numbers); sing major scales, and tendency and active tone resolutions (Ex: fa-mi
or 4ˆ-3ˆ, la-sol or 6ˆ-5ˆ), singing octaves (do-do or (1ˆ-1ˆ) and continue throughout unit.
Listening highlighting: Use standard repertoire from the common practice period.
Integrate students’ personal music that reinforce the same concepts.
Contrast: Throughout the unit, use extreme contrasts (high/low, loud/soft, short/
long) to present new material, then gradually reduce the contrast level as concepts
are reinforced and students’ ability to discern aural detail improves.
continued on next page
Striking a balance between aural skills practice, written
skills practice, and content instruction can sometimes be difficult. Skills with an aural or performance
component—aural identification and analysis, melodic and harmonic dictation, sight-singing, and error
detection—benefit from near-daily practice, but as the
course progresses through increasingly complex topics
it can become a challenge to incorporate aural skills
practice in a way that feels organic and relevant. One way
to address this challenge is to lead learning activities that
combine aural and written skills every day. A sample daily
schedule might include some of the following strategies:
§§ Singing warm-up using scales, arpeggios, or common melodic patterns to prepare students for sight-singing exercise §§ Sight-singing a primarily diatonic melody of four to eight bars, possibly including patterns found in written or aural exercises from class or homework
§§ Engaging in a melodic or harmonic dictation exercise or in contextual listening and score analysis
§§ Conducting a brief review of concepts learned the previous day followed by formative assessment;
reviewing concepts in aural context, assessing concepts in written context, or vice versa
§§ Reteaching concepts presented in an aural context from the previous day using a written context, or vice versa
§§ Teaching new concepts in written context followed by formative assessment in aural context, or vice versa
The following chart provides suggestions for how to
pair listening and performance skills practice with
content in each unit to create a scaffolded skills progression. “Singing by rote” refers to concepts
and patterns students should be able to recall and
perform quickly in order to sight-sing confidently and to help them with aural identification tasks.
“Rhythm” refers to types of activities that involve
the performance or identification of rhythmic values
and patterns. “Listening highlighting” includes key
concepts relevant to the topic to keep in mind when choosing excerpts for aural and score analysis.
Other familiar categories of suggestions include tips for choosing melodies and progressions for
sight-singing and dictation. Depending on students’
strengths and areas for improvement, they may need
to repeat aural skills practice from previous topics as
they work toward the types of aural skills activities that appear on the exam.

Formative Assessments and Feedback continued on next page
When planning for and teaching the AP Music Theory
course, consider the foundational knowledge and skills
students already have, and what they need to develop.
Identify and address gaps in students’ knowledge and
skills through ongoing formative assessment, strategic
scaffolding, and targeted differentiation of instruction.
Formative assessment is used to check learning
progress and provide feedback to help students improve.
Unlike summative assessments, formative assessments
do not result in a score or grade. The goal is to provide
specific, detailed information about what students understand, informing the learning process before summative assessment happens. By using formative assessment as a daily practice, you can empower
students to see opportunities for growth, enable them to
take risks, and encourage them to learn from mistakes.
At the end of each unit, use the AP Classroom website to assign the Personal Progress Checks to
your students. Personal Progress Checks (PPCs) are
formative assessments designed to give you and your
students insight into their learning progress in each unit. PPCs include multiple-choice questions with
immediate feedback to students’ responses—including correction of common misconceptions—highlighting aspects of learning that need further attention.
Free-response questions are also provided for each unit, along with scoring guidelines. Because each unit’s content and accompanying PPC questions are
scaffolded to support students’ learning throughout the
year, PPC questions may vary in format from summative
exam questions. For example, Personal Progress Check
questions allow unlimited listening to a melody provided for melodic dictation, whereas melodic dictation
questions on the exam offer only four repetitions of the melody. Personal Progress Checks can be assigned
during class or as homework; they can serve as self-, peer-, or teacher-guided formative assessments.
Formative assessment enables you to better
understand and respond to students’ learning needs.
The following table includes a variety of additional formative assessment strategies you can use to support your students’ success.
Strategy
Definition
Example
Boardwalk
After a practice exercise has been completed, students write their responses to a portion or all of the exercise on the board. The student walks the class through their response—explains their process, choices, and/or thinking behind their response. The student’s response is discussed as a class.
After a harmonic dictation exercise, three students
volunteer to write their responses on the board. In turn, the students explain what they thought they heard
and if they were not sure exactly what they heard, how
they arrived at their response. After the students at the
board have explained their response, the whole class discusses the responses on the board.
Compounding/
Sequential
Quizzes
Identical quizzes that progress with missing portions for students to recall and complete, making them aware of the knowledge they have internalized and what knowledge they have left to commit to memory.
Provide students with a quiz on content knowledge
(e.g., inversions, diatonic, scales, etc.) that contains
most of the material for which they will be accountable
at the end of the course but features places for them to provide content knowledge they have already
internalized. Throughout the semester, periodically give
students the identical quiz with more places for them to provide content.

Strategy
Definition
Example
Debriefing
A form of reflection immediately following an activity in which students articulate some aspect about the lesson, a concept, a skill, etc. to demonstrate understanding and/or mastery.
At the end of a lesson about motives, students work in
pairs to develop a way of explaining what motives are such that a beginning musician can understand it.
Exit Card
Exit cards are written student responses to questions posed at the end of a class, learning activity, or the end of a day.
At the end of a lesson about cadences, a teacher shows
examples of an authentic, half, and plagal cadence on
the board and asks students to identify each type of cadence on a small sheet of paper.
Hand Signals
Ask students to display a designated hand signal to indicate their understanding of a specific concept, principal, or process: I understand _____ and can explain it – (e.g., thumbs up). I do not yet understand _____ (e.g., thumbs down). I’m not completely sure about _____ (e.g., wave hand).
As an understanding check, the teacher asks students
to use hand signals to indicate their understanding of the differences among triad qualities.
The hand signals strategy can be used in a more
complex manner for formative assessment. For example,
a teacher can play short phrases in major and minor
keys, and students use the following hand signs on their dominant hand to indicate the cadence type:
§§ Index finger to indicate a perfect authentic cadence.
§§ Index + middle fingers to indicate an imperfect authentic cadence.
§§ Index + middle + ring fingers to indicate a deceptive cadence.
§§ Index + middle + ring + little fingers to indicate a plagal cadence. (Roman numeral IV is indicated by four fingers to reinforce the subdominant.)
§§ Index + middle + ring + little fingers + thumb to indicate a half cadence. (Roman numeral V is
indicated by five fingers to reinforce the dominant.) §§ As sevenths are added, the thumb on the nondominant hand can be used to indicate the presence of a seventh chord.
(Note: If the teacher prefers, other finger combinations can be used.)
Hand signals can also be used identify changes in key
(particularly parallel keys) and identify the presence
of chromatically altered chords, melodic or harmonic sequences, and contrapuntal devices.
Inside-
Outside Circle
Inside and outside circles of students face each other. Within each pair of facing students, students quiz each other with questions they have written. The outside circle moves to create new pairs. Repeat.
After examining a score, students develop questions
about various features (e.g., identifying the type of
suspension, identifying the type of cadence, size and
quality of an interval, harmonic analysis of particular chords, etc.) notated in the score. Students then
organize themselves into inside and outside circles to
quiz each other with the questions they have written.

Example
Melody in Canon
Small groups of students sing a melody in canon to assess their skill proficiency.
Students sing “Are You Sleeping” in a canon while the
teacher walks around the room and listens to the small
groups and individuals of those groups as they sing parts in turn.
Melody Mimic
The teacher sings a melody, and the class repeats the melody while the teacher listens for areas of skill proficiency and opportunities for development.
The teacher sings a melody with an arpeggiated dominant triad. Students repeat the melody as the
teacher listens for students accurately arpeggiating the dominant triad.
Misconception
Check
Present students with common or predictable misconceptions about a designated concept, principle or process. Ask them whether they agree or disagree and to explain why.
A teacher asks students whether they agree or disagree
with the following statement: “Parallel keys share the same key signature.” Students respond and explain their reasoning.
Numbered
Heads
Together
Each student is assigned a number. Members of a group work together to agree on an answer.
The teacher randomly selects one number. The student with that number answers for the group.
Students are assigned numbers and work together in
groups of four to voice-lead a three-chord progression.
The students discuss possible responses and reach
consensus. Time is called, and the teacher randomly
selects the number fourteen, and the student assigned the
number fourteen at the beginning of the activity shares
and explains the voice-leading example for her group.
Observation
The teacher walks around the classroom and observes students as they perform targeted skills and/ or engage in content development;
the teacher evaluates students’ learning progress.
After assigning students a dictation exercise, the
teacher moves freely about the classroom to observe
how students are approaching the given exercise. On
an informal checklist, the instructor notes individual and
class skill strengths and areas for further development.
Partial-Grading
Assigning a grade to a student’s work for only one or two criteria while providing formative feedback for other criteria.
For a voice-leading assignment, a teacher grades only
the cadences and offers feedback for other concepts students have learned thus far.
Personal
Whiteboards
Students use small personal white boards to write answers to questions.
After listening to a three-chord progression, students
write on their small personal white boards the Roman and
Arabic numeral analysis of that progression. Students
then turn their white boards toward the teacher, who
quickly surveys students’ responses to evaluate both individual and whole-class skill development.
Quiz
Quizzes assess students for factual information, concepts, and discrete skills. There is usually a single best answer. Some quiz
examples are: Multiple-choice,
True/False, Short Answer, Paper and Pencil, Matching, and Extended Response.
After a few lessons about rhythm and notation, a
teacher gives students a short quiz that assess students
understanding of note duration and time signatures.

Self-
Assessment
A process in which students collect information about their own learning, analyze what it reveals about their progress toward the intended learning goals, and plan the next steps in their learning.
A teacher develops a self-assessment checklist for
students as they study rhythm. The teacher will use
information from this checklist to inform instruction,
while the student will use the checklist to identify areas
for additional practice. The checklist questions are
as follows:
1. Can I sense the basic beat?
2. Can I sense if the basic beat is organized into measures?
3. Once I know the meter, can I conduct the pattern that represents it?
4. Can I sense the difference between the beat and the division of the beat?
5. Can I sense how long individual notes or sounds last?
6. Of the items on this list, what can I do easily and well?
7. Of the items on this list, which one(s), if any, seem(s) to be particularly challenging?
Student
Conference
One-on-one conversation with students to check their level of understanding.
After completing an exercise in which students
compose a bass line to harmonize a given melody, the
teacher meets with students individually to discuss
their work, particularly the skills and concepts that the
student has mastered and the skills and concepts that students still need to develop further.
Three-Minute
Pause
Every ten or fifteen minutes during a classroom activity, ask students to reflect on and verbalize something they have learned. This pause changes the mode in which students are operating by asking them to move from listening and observing (input) to reflecting and talking (output).
Every fifteen minutes during a whole-group analysis of
a score, the teacher takes three minutes to pause the
discussion to ask students to reflect on and verbalize
something they have learned through the discussion.
Timed Relay
Race
Students collaboratively complete a timed task to reinforce concepts.
Students work together in teams of four. Each team is
given a chord progression of four chords indicated only
by Roman and Arabic numerals. In a four-voice texture,
the first student spells the first chord indicated by the
Roman and Arabic numerals. Then, the first student passes the paper to the second team member. The second team member then spells the second chord
indicated by the Roman and Arabic numerals but also follows 18th-century voice-leading procedures to
connect the chords in the progression. Then, the second team member passes the paper to the third team
member and so on until the team finishes completing the
progression. The winner of the relay race is determined
through a combination of finish time and accuracy.

Students make connections, support ideas with evidence, and demonstrate their understanding by answering questions about the content. Questions might be asked about the following:
characteristics, relationships, examples, similarities and differences, problems to solve, criteria for judging, conclusions to be drawn, evidence to support a conclusion, alternatives, or different approaches to consider.
In the middle of a lesson to check students’ understanding of seventh chords and notation, the
teacher asks a student, “What is the inversion symbol
of a seventh chord when the 3rd is in the bass?” As a
follow-up question, the teacher asks another student,
“How is that inversion symbol different from the symbol for a second-inversion triad?”
Web or Concept Map
Any of several forms of graphic organizers that allow learners to perceive relationships between concepts visually. (graphic.org/ concept.html)
Students develop a map or flow chart to show how diatonic triads commonly progress.
Summative Assessment
In addition to the Personal Progress Checks and other strategies for formative assessment, summative assessment provides important feedback about
student learning. The format and content of formative
and summative assessments often differs, due to the
different intended uses of each type of assessment.
For example, a melodic dictation question presented for the purpose of formative assessment early in
the course will be shorter and simpler than melodies students hear on the AP Exam; the melody may be
replayed an unlimited number of times with formative assessments, but with the exam, students hear the melody only four times.
Summative assessments evaluate students’ ability to
demonstrate essential understandings and skills that
are developed across units of instruction; they can
serve as indicators of performance on the AP Exam.
For example, students’ understanding of concepts and
skills from Units 1 through 3 of the course framework could be assessed using a summative quiz asking
students to connect their learning about major and minor keys, rhythm, meter, expressive elements,
melody, timbre, texture, triads, and seventh chords,
using melodic dictation, sight-singing, score analysis, error detection, and composition tasks. You can use the AP Music Theory Question Bank to design
cumulative summative assessments that align with the
understandings and skills your students have learned at different points throughout the course.
By the midpoint of the course, teachers can consider administering an entire released exam or practice
exam (available on AP Central) to begin familiarizing
students with the format and content of the AP exam.
After reviewing the questions, responses, and scoring guidelines with students, teachers can discuss the experience of taking the AP Exam. The more opportunities students have to practice with
assessments that reflect the content, format, and test taking experience of the AP Exam, the more confident and prepared they will be on exam day.
Aligning Scores with College Expectations
Because college curricula vary for beginning music
theory courses, scores for the AP Music Theory Exam are reported in composite form and as aural and
nonaural subscores. These subscores inform placement
decisions, especially for music departments offering
separate courses for written theory and aural skills.
College Board recommends that credits and advanced standing for the AP Music Theory Exam be awarded
as follows:

College Board understands that introductory music theory coursework differs among colleges and
universities with respect to content as well as to the
point in time during the first year of music theory classes when specific concepts and skills are
introduced. Music departments who find their first year of music theory coursework closely aligned to the content of the AP Music Theory program are
encouraged to grant a full year of credit to students who
earn qualifying scores on the AP Music Theory Exam.
SUBSCORES
Subscores are reported along with the overall AP Exam score. There are two subscores, one based on the
exam questions with aural stimulus and one based on
the exam questions without aural stimulus. Subscores
provide more specific information about assessment outcomes to students, AP teachers, and colleges,
universities, and schools of music that determine policy
about awarding credits and advanced placement. For
example, a student may learn that he or she needs to
concentrate on written skills such as score analysis and composition; a teacher who sees a pattern of higher nonaural than aural subscores may increase
emphasis on ear training; and college faculty who see
that a student’s written skills are superior to aural skills
may move the student into, for instance, the second
semester of classroom theory but require beginning ear-training and sight-singing classes.
For courses that cover aural skills such as listening,
dictation, and sight-singing, departments of music
rely primarily on the aural skills subscore in making decisions about placement and credit. For courses
that cover written skills such as score analysis and part
writing, departments should rely primarily on the written
skills (nonaural skills) subscore in making decisions.
And for courses that cover both aural and written skills,
departments should rely on the overall score. As with
the overall AP Exam score, subscores are reported on a scale of 1–5.

Scoring Guidelines for Question 1:  Melodic Dictation 9 points
Learning Objectives:  PIT-3.B   RHY-2.A
Skills:  3.A
General instructions:
Always begin with the regular scoring guide. Try an alternate scoring guide only if necessary. (See I.D.)
I. Regular Scoring Guide
(A)
Award 1 point for each segment correct in both pitch and rhythm.
•	 A “segment” is any half measure of the original melody, even if occurring over a bar line or beginning
on a metrically weak pulse. (In compound duple meter, a segment is any set of three contiguous eighth-note beats.)
•	 To receive credit, a segment must not overlap with any other segment receiving credit.
•	 Do not subdivide a note to identify a segment.
•	 To receive credit, a segment may be metrically shifted from its original position.
•	 Give no credit for the final dotted quarter note if notation of pitches continues thereafter.
1 point each (max 8)
(B)
If at least one segment is correct in pitch and rhythm, award 1 extra point to the total. For example, a
response that is correct in all aspects receives a score of 8 + 1, or 9. Exception: Do not award a 9 unless
all measures have the correct number of beats. Award an 8 (i.e., do not award the extra point) to an
otherwise perfect response that does not use bar lines correctly.
1 point
(C)
Record any score of 4 or higher and ignore the alternate scoring guides.
(D)
If after applying I.A. and I.B. the score is less than 4, try an alternate scoring guide.
If you try both regular and alternate scoring guides, award the higher of the scores if there is a difference.
II. Alternate Scoring Guides (Do not award the extra point to the total.)
(A)
(B)
Award 1/2 point per segment of correct pitches. (Maximum of 4 points)
OR
Award 1/4 point per segment of correct rhythm. (Maximum of 2 points) 1 2  point each (max 4)
Rounding Fractional Scores
Half-point totals round down with one exception: A total score of 1 1 2  rounds up to 2.
Quarter points should be rounded to the closest integer.
1 4  point each (max 2)
III. Scores with Additional Meaning
1 This score may also be used for a response that does not have one segment correct in both pitch
and rhythm but has two or more redeeming qualities. (Do not award the extra point.)
0 This score is used for a response that demonstrates an attempt to answer the question but has no
redeeming qualities (or only one) or a response that is off-topic or irrelevant.
— The dash is reserved for blank responses.

IV. Scoring Notes
(A)
The following notations will not receive credit: enharmonic equivalents; octave transpositions; dots
before the notehead; accidentals after the notehead.
(B)
If you use an alternate scoring guide, do not award the extra point to the total.
(C)
Scores from one guide may not be combined with those from another guide.

Big Idea 1: Pitch (PIT)
Specific frequencies of sound, known as pitches, are basic units of music. Pitches that are deliberately
sequenced through time create melodies, and groups of pitches presented successively or
simultaneously form chords. Within an established musical style, chords relate to one another in
the context of harmony. Individual voices can also be imbued with a cohesive sense of motion and
interaction through musical voice leading, which is rooted in historical traditions.

PIT-1
Pitch fundamentals—
Specific frequencies of sound, known as pitches, are basic units of music. Pitches can be presented successively and simultaneously in myriad ways, providing a basis for musical expression across a broad spectrum of genres, media, and styles.
PIT-1.A
Identify pitches on the staff, using treble, bass, and C clefs, in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
PIT-1.A.1
Music consists of discrete tones with specific frequencies called
pitches. In music notation, the specific pitch of a note is shown
by the note’s position on the lines and spaces of a staff, which
are assigned specific letter names by a clef (treble, bass, alto, or
tenor clefs). The distance spanned from a given pitch up or down
to the next pitch of the same letter name is called an octave.
Pitch may be further distinguished by accidentals (e.g., sharps,
flats, and naturals). When a pitch requires use of an accidental,
the accidental should be drawn to the left of the notehead.
BOUNDARY STATEMENT
On aural sections of the AP Music Theory Exam, students are
expected to demonstrate relative pitch, not absolute pitch.
That is, when students are asked to identify and/or notate
heard pitches, they will always be given one or more pitches as a starting point.
PIT-1.A.2
Enharmonic equivalents are tones of the same pitch spelled
differently according to their musical contexts (e.g., C♯ and D♭).
PIT-1.B
Identify pitch discrepancies between notated and performed music in one or two voices.
PIT-1.B.1
A musical score outlines specifically the pitches to be
performed. With the exception of musical styles that allow for
improvisation and ornamentation, performed pitches should not deviate from the score.
PIT-1.C
Identify half and whole steps presented in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
PIT-1.C.1
Pitch patterns include rudimentary musical structures—such as
intervals, scales, triads, and seventh chords—as well as other
short successions of notes. The half step (or semitone), the
smallest possible distance between two pitches, and the whole
step (or whole tone), the distance equivalent to two half steps,
constitute the most fundamental of pitch patterns.
PIT-1.D
Identify major scales presented in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
PIT-1.D.1
Pitches arranged in specific patterns of half and whole steps in
ascending or descending order form major and minor scales.
PIT-1.E
Identify the function of a pitch relative to a tonic and its scale, using scale degree names and/or numbers, in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
PIT-1.E.1
Pitches of a scale function relative to a central pitch,
called the tonic, and are referred to with scale degree names (tonic, supertonic, mediant, subdominant,
dominant, submediant, subtonic, and leading tone) or scale degree numbers.

PIT-1
Pitch fundamentals—
Specific frequencies of sound, known as pitches, are basic units of music. Pitches can be presented successively and simultaneously in myriad ways, providing a basis for musical expression across a broad spectrum of genres, media, and styles.
PIT-1.F
Identify major keys and key signatures in notated music.
PIT-1.F.1
When a particular major or minor scale is used prominently
within a musical passage, the music is said to be in the
corresponding key of that scale. For instance, a passage that
uses the pitches of the D major scale and asserts D as the
central pitch is said to be “in the key of D major.”
PIT-1.F.2
The specific pitches of a major or minor scale are represented
by its key signature, a grouping of sharps or flats presented in
a specific order. Pitches that belong to a given major or minor
scale are said to be diatonic; pitches that do not belong to the given scale are said to be chromatic.
PIT-1.F.3
The degree of relatedness among keys may be illustrated by
the “circle of fifths,” a visual diagram in which closely related keys appear in close proximity to each other.
PIT-1.G
Identify forms of the minor scale, including natural, harmonic, and melodic forms in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
PIT-1.G.1
Pitches arranged in specific patterns of half and whole steps in
ascending or descending order form major and minor scales.
Scales identified in music theory include altered forms of the
natural minor scale (i.e., harmonic and melodic minor scales).
Melodic passages may employ these scales.
PIT-1.H
Identify and notate a relative key and its key signature.
PIT-1.H.1
Musical passages or compositions can shift from one key to
another. The key to which a passage shifts can form various
key relationships with the original key, including a relative key
which shares the same key signature as the original but starts
on a different tonic. For example, D major and B minor both
have two sharps in their key signature, but their tonics are D and B, respectively.
PIT-1.I
Identify minor and relative keys in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
PIT-1.I.1
A minor key has the same key signature as the major of which it is a relative.
PIT-1.I.2
The term “mode” is used in reference to major and minor keys.
For example, a major key and a minor key are described as
being in the “major mode” and in the “minor mode,” respectively.
A shift from G major to G minor, for instance, would constitute a “change in mode.”
BOUNDARY STATEMENT
Students will not be required to specify the letter name of
a key on the aural section of the AP Music Theory Exam.
For example, a student may be asked if a section of music
changes from a major key to a relative minor key; however, the
student would not be asked to specify the key as F♯ minor.

Pitch fundamentals—
Specific frequencies of sound, known as pitches, are basic units of music. Pitches can be presented successively and simultaneously in myriad ways, providing a basis for musical expression across a broad spectrum of genres, media, and styles.
PIT-1.J
Describe key relationships in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
PIT-1.J.1
A parallel key is a key that shares the same tonic as the original
but has a different key signature. For example, D major has two
sharps in its key signature and is parallel to D minor, which has one flat in its key signature.
PIT-1.J.2
Closely related keys are keys whose key signatures differ from
the original by no more than one accidental; these are the
most common keys to which a musical passage might shift.
For example, in relation to an opening tonic of D major (i.e., two
sharps in the key signature), the closely related keys would
consist of the relative key (B minor), the major and minor keys
bearing one additional sharp (A major and F♯ minor), and the
major and minor keys bearing one less sharp (G major and E
minor). The following is an alternative explanation: The keys
closely related to a given key are those whose tonic triads are
the diatonic major and minor triads of the original key. For the
key of D major, the closely related keys would be the supertonic
key (E minor), the mediant key (F♯ minor), the subdominant key
(G major), the dominant key (A major), and the submediant key
(B minor). Relative keys are a subset of closely related keys.
PIT-1.J.3
Distantly related keys—keys whose key signatures differ from
the original by more than one accidental. Parallel keys are a subset of distantly related keys.
PIT-1.K
Identify chromatic, whole-tone, and pentatonic scales in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
PIT-1.K.1
Additional scales identified in music theory include chromatic,
whole-tone, and pentatonic scales. Melodic passages may
employ these scales. Chromatic scales have twelve pitches,
each a half-step apart. Whole-tone scales have six notes, each
a whole step apart. Pentatonic scales (major and minor) have
five pitches from the seven pitches of a major or minor scale.
Major pentatonic scales contain scale degrees ˆ1, ˆ2, ˆ3, ˆ5, and
ˆ6 of the major scale. Minor pentatonic scales contain scale
degrees ˆ1, ˆ3, ˆ4, ˆ5, and ˆ7 of the natural minor scale.
PIT-1.L
Describe the size and quality of an interval in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
PIT-1.L.1
The distance in pitch between two notes is called an interval,
designated by distance between pitches (e.g., second or fifth)
and quality (major, minor, perfect, diminished, or augmented).
Two examples are a major second or a diminished seventh.
Some intervals are alternatively designated by unique names,
for example, the unison (prime) and the tritone. Intervals that
sound identical but encompass different pitch spellings are
enharmonic equivalents (e.g., the augmented fourth, D up to G♯, and the diminished fifth, D up to A ♭).
PIT-1.L.2
Harmonic intervals describe the distance between
simultaneous pitches; melodic intervals describe the distance
between successive pitches. Melodic intervals are generally
categorized into two generic types—a step traverses adjacent
pitches of neighboring letter names (e.g., C up to D), while a leap
traverses an interval larger than a step (e.g., C up to E).

Pitch fundamentals—
Specific frequencies of sound, known as pitches, are basic units of music. Pitches can be presented successively and simultaneously in myriad ways, providing a basis for musical expression across a broad spectrum of genres, media, and styles.
PIT-1.L.3
Consonance (adjective consonant) refers to intervals that are
inherently stable, meaning they have no natural inclination
to move, or resolve, to other sounds. In contrast, dissonance
(adjective dissonant) refers to intervals that are inherently
unstable, meaning they have a natural inclination to move to
other, more stable, sounds (e.g., a harmonic diminished fifth resolving inward to a third).
PIT-1.M
Identify interval inversions and compound intervals in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
PIT-1.M.1
An interval’s inversion may be determined by transferring the
lower note up an octave. An interval plus its inversion equals
a perfect octave. Put another way, when an octave is divided
into two smaller intervals, the resulting two intervals are interval
inversions of each other. Sizes and qualities of intervals and their inversions relate consistently as follows— §§ perfect intervals remain perfect when inverted
§§ major intervals become minor when inverted, and vice versa
§§ diminished intervals become augmented when inverted, and vice versa
§§ the sum of respective sizes of the original and inverted
intervals always equals nine (e.g., a second inverts to become a seventh, or two plus seven equals nine)
PIT-1.M.2
Intervals whose sizes are smaller than or equal to an octave
may be called simple intervals. When an octave is added to
a simple interval, the result is a corresponding larger interval
called a compound interval. For example, an octave added to a
major third yields a major tenth. Because a simple interval and
its corresponding compound interval contain like pitches—
sounding in different octaves—the two intervals sound similar.
PIT-1.N
Identify sounding pitches that correspond to the notated pitches of a transposing instrument when given the specific level and direction of transposition.
PIT-1.N.1
Transposing instruments are those whose notated pitches are
different from actual pitches that sound when played. Because
many standard instruments in the tradition known as Western
music belong to this category, musical scores often contain
one or more instrumental parts that require the conversion
of notated pitches into sounding pitches before analysis may proceed.
BOUNDARY STATEMENT
With the exception of instruments whose transposition is an
octave (e.g., double bass), transposing instruments included
on the AP Music Theory Exam will be presented as follows—
The specific level of transposition will be indicated in the
score and the direction of transposition will be specified
further in the question directions (e.g., “Clarinet in B♭ sounding
a Major 2nd below notated pitch”). Students do not need to
memorize the transpositions of specific musical instruments.

Pitch fundamentals—
Specific frequencies of sound, known as pitches, are basic units of music. Pitches can be presented successively and simultaneously in myriad ways, providing a basis for musical expression across a broad spectrum of genres, media, and styles.
PIT-1.O
Describe the quality of a chord in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
PIT-1.O.1
A chord consists of three or more pitches sounding
simultaneously; the term also applies to collections of
successive pitches that form a perceived grouping, often
through arpeggiation (i.e., the use of arpeggios). In the tradition
known as Western music, the two basic kinds of chord are—
§§ triads—chords whose essence consists of three distinct
pitches stacked on adjacent lines or spaces (i.e., stacked in thirds)
§§ seventh chords—chords whose essence consists of four
distinct pitches stacked on adjacent lines or spaces (i.e., stacked in thirds)
PIT-1.O.2
When the pitches of a chord are arranged in their essential
configuration of stacked thirds, each pitch, or chord member,
is given a specific name—the bottom note on which the chord
is built is called the root, and the notes stacked above the root
are called the third, the fifth, and in the case of seventh chords, the seventh.
PIT-1.O.3
The structure of intervals of a given triad or seventh chord
accounts for the chord’s unique sound and allows it to be
classified as a specific chord quality (or type). In the tradition
known as Western music, the following qualities of triad are commonly found— §§ major (M) §§ minor (m) §§ diminished (o or d) §§ augmented (+ or A)
PIT-1.P
Identify modes in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
PIT-1.P.1
Scales identified in music theory include these categories
known as modes—Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian,
Aeolian, and Locrian. Melodic passages may employ these scales.

Harmony—Groupings of pitches that are successively and/ or simultaneously produced form perceivable units known as chords.
Chords relate to each other within an established musical style through the context of harmony.
PIT-2.A
Identify chords using letters and Roman/Arabic numerals that indicate specific scale degree of the root, quality, and bass note in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
PIT-2.A.1
Triads and seventh chords built on the scale degrees of a given
key constitute the diatonic chords of that key. These chords are
identified using a system of symbols in which Roman numerals
indicate the scale degree on which the given chord is built
and the quality of the given chord. Uppercase and lowercase
Roman numerals are used to indicate major and minor triads,
respectively, and additional symbols are added to denote
other chord qualities (e.g., lowercase Roman numerals with “o”
indicating diminished triads and uppercase Roman numerals with “+” indicating augmented triads).
The diatonic chords of a key can also be identified using the
scale degree names of each chord’s respective root (e.g., tonic,
supertonic, mediant, etc.). For example, the triad built on scale
degree two may be called the “supertonic triad,” the triad built
on scale degree four may be called the “subdominant triad,” and
the seventh chord built on scale degree five may be called the “dominant seventh chord.”
PIT-2.A.2
The pitches of a chord may be arranged in various ways, with
special attention paid to the chord member that appears in
the bass (i.e., lowest part of the chord). When the chordal root
appears in the bass, the chord is said to be in root position.
When chord members other than the root appear in the bass,
chord inversions result. First inversion and second inversion
occur when the chordal third and fifth, respectively, appear in
the bass. Specific chord inversions are labeled using a system
of Arabic numerals that denote intervals to be rendered above
given bass notes, a convention based on an 18th-century
system of musical shorthand known as figured bass. With pitch
content clearly defined, these Arabic numerals may be used to imply specific chords and their inversions.
An alternate system for labeling chords identifies a triad’s root
by capital letter-name (e.g., C) and its quality by abbreviation
(e.g., “m” for minor); a C-minor triad may be labeled “Cm.” Chord
labels such as these are used prominently in lead sheets, where
they appear above the notated melody and indicate specific chord progressions.
PIT-2.B
Use Roman numerals to indicate the harmonic progression implied by a figured bass.
PIT-2.B.1
The Arabic numerals, or figures, that appear in a figured bass
denote pitches at specific intervals above each given bass
note. (Octave equivalents of those pitches are also acceptable.)
Since the resultant pitches are to be used in writing each
corresponding chord, these Arabic numerals imply harmonies to which Roman numerals may be applied.
PIT-2.B.2
In figured bass notation, a figure with a slash or plus sign
indicates the pitch denoted by that figure is to be raised a half
step. An accidental appearing alone (i.e., without an Arabic
numeral) indicates that the pitch lying a third above the bass
should be inflected as shown (e.g., “♯” appearing under a given bass pitch of A denotes the pitch C♯).

Chords relate to each other within an established musical style through the context of harmony.
PIT-2.C
Describe the quality of a seventh chord in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
PIT-2.C.1
The following qualities of seventh chords are commonly found— §§ major seventh (MM; M7), or “major-major”
§§ major-minor seventh (Mm7), or “dominant seventh,” used
for major-minor chords exercising a dominant function §§ minor seventh (mm; m7), or “minor-minor”
§§ half-diminished seventh (ø7; dm), or “diminished-minor”
§§ fully-diminished seventh (o7; dd), or “diminished-diminished”
PIT-2.C.2
When a chord contains a chord member that possesses this
natural inclination to resolve (e.g., a chordal seventh), that
specific chord member may be called a chordal dissonance.
PIT-2.D
Identify seventh chords using
Roman/Arabic numerals that indicate specific scale degree of the root, quality, and bass note in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
PIT-2.D.1
Seventh chords have the potential for a third inversion in which the chordal seventh appears in the bass.
PIT-2.E
Compose a bass line added to a given soprano line, following the normative harmonic procedures of 18th-century music.
PIT-2.E.1
When a bass line is added to a soprano line, harmonic
progressions are implied. To keep these harmonic progressions
plausible and strong, these conventions should be followed—
§§ All implied chords must allow the corresponding soprano notes to make harmonic sense.
§§ An acceptable harmonic progression can be made using
tonic, supertonic, subdominant, and dominant triads
exclusively, as long as the normative procedures of harmonic progression are followed.
§§ Repeated instances of a specific harmony—that is,
repeating a particular chord in a particular position
(root position or inversion)—are acceptable only if the
repeated harmonies start on a strong beat. However, at the
beginning of a phrase, the repeated harmonies may start on a weak beat.
PIT-2.E.2
When part-writing secondary dominants, all doubling and voice leading considerations of normal dominant chords should be
maintained (e.g., chordal sevenths resolving down by step).
PIT-2.E.3
When a bass line is added to a soprano line, harmonic
progressions are implied. Chromatic pitches may suggest the
tonicization of a chord other than the prevailing tonic. One
common instance would be a ♯4^ resolving to 5^, a melodic
pattern that may suggest tonicization of the dominant chord (Ⅴ) by means of a secondary dominant chord (Ⅴ /Ⅴ).

PIT-2.F
Use Roman and Arabic numerals to indicate the specific chords and inversions implied by a bass line.
PIT-2.F.1
Notes of a bass line, especially when combined with other
voices, can imply full chords and harmonic progressions. Such
progressions may be represented through Roman numeral
analysis, which may include Arabic numerals to show chord
inversion and/or specific voice leading. If Roman numeral
analysis is accurate, all given notes must be explainable in the chords represented by the analysis.
PIT-2.G
Notate the pitches and rhythms of the outer voices (soprano and bass lines) in a performed harmonic progression that is composed in a major or minor key and may include limited use of chromatically altered pitches.
PIT-2.G.1
Accurate dictation of the outer voices in a performed harmonic
progression depends on accurate notation of the sounding pitches and rhythms.
BOUNDARY STATEMENT
Although soprano notes should always be notated in the
proper octave, octave displacement of bass-line pitches
constitutes a more acceptable error and is therefore allowed on the AP Music Theory Exam.
PIT-2.G.2
Notes of the outer voices of a harmonic progression (the
soprano and bass lines), provide important clues as to which
chords are part of the performed harmonic progression. Such
progressions may be represented through Roman-numeral
analysis, and include Arabic numerals to show chord inversion
and/or specific voice leading. In completing a Roman-numeral
analysis of an outer-voice dictation, all written notes must be accounted for in the analysis.
PIT-2.H
Identify and describe harmonic function within a chord progression in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
PIT-2.H.1
Music is considered to be tonal when the pitch content is
organized around a central (or tonic) pitch and all other pitches
relate to that central pitch in a pre-established, hierarchical
way. This manner of musical organization is based on a system
that prevailed in the tradition known as Western music from
approximately 1650 to 1900. Common practice is another
term used for this type of music. Tonal organization may also
be found in music of other genres and time periods, such as
popular music, folk music, and jazz, as well as in some Western music composed after 1900.
PIT-2.H.2
Harmonic progression (or chord progression) refers to the
particular sequence of chords that underlies a musical
composition or passage. A harmonic progression may be
represented as a succession of Roman numerals corresponding
to the specific sequence of chords. When inversions are used, appropriate Arabic numerals are also included.
PIT-2.H.3
Harmonic rhythm describes the rate at which chords change
in a given musical passage or composition. For example, a phrase in 4 4  time starting with chords that change once per
measure might subsequently progress to chords changing at
a half- or quarter-note pace, demonstrating acceleration of harmonic rhythm.

PIT-2.H.4
In tonal music, the ordering of chords is governed by a web
of relationships where each chord possesses a contextual
role, identified as its function. Based on harmonic context, all
chords in a given harmonic progression may be described
as fulfilling one of the following functions—tonic, dominant, or predominant.
PIT-2.H.5
The most fundamental harmonic progression used by tonal
composers to establish key is found in the following sequence of harmonic functions—tonic-dominant-tonic.
PIT-2.H.6
Common-practice repertoire includes specific chord
successions that are considered normative and usable
in the composition of a tonal chord progression. A chord
progression that deviates from the norm is generally avoided
in the common-practice approach. For instance, V to IV,
though common in some styles of popular music, is called a retrogression.
PIT-2.H.7
To intensify the establishment of key, predominant chords are
frequently inserted, resulting in the following order of functions
within a harmonic progression or melodic phrase—tonic predominant-dominant-tonic. Composers generally expand
the harmonic background provided by these fundamental
progressions by creating a harmonic foreground (or surface)
in which chords are ordered in myriad combinations following historical conventions of tonal music.
PIT-2.H.8
Subdominant (IV or iv) and supertonic (ii or iio) chords often
precede the dominant functional area of a phrase, and therefore are referred to as predominant harmonies.
PIT-2.I
Identify cadence types in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
PIT-2.I.1
Cadence refers to the point of relative repose that concludes
a harmonic progression or melodic phrase. Through historical
practice, certain chord patterns have emerged as acceptable
harmonic formulas for use at cadences. This group of
acceptable cadence types fit generally into two categories—
inconclusive cadences (i.e., half, imperfect authentic, and
deceptive cadences) and conclusive cadences (i.e., perfect
authentic and plagal cadences). A perfect authentic cadence
is created by the Ⅴ-I progression with both harmonies in root
position, ending with scale degree 1 in the soprano. An imperfect
authentic cadence is also a Ⅴ-I progression, but chords may be
inverted, with any chord tone in the soprano.  These cadence
types influence phrase structure and musical form.

Harmony—Groupings of pitches that are successively and/ or simultaneously produced form perceivable units known as chords.
Chords relate to each other within an established musical style through the context of harmony.
PIT-2.I.2
Certain harmonic progressions are distinctive enough in sound
and/or context to warrant specific labels, such as the Picardy
third, a major tonic chord that ends a section in a minor key.
PIT-2.I.3
Cadences such as the plagal cadence—IV (iv)–I (i)—and
Phrygian half cadence—iv6-V, minor only—use predominant
function as they conclude a phrase. The deceptive cadence
avoids the V-I resolution of authentic cadences by having a non-tonic chord substitute for tonic.
PIT-2.J
Identify and describe harmonic function and progression in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music.
PIT-2.J.1
The vi (VI) chord can function as a tonic substitute or as a weaker predominant chord.
PIT-2.J.2
Certain harmonic progressions are distinctive enough in sound
and/or context to warrant specific labels, such as the deceptive
progression, with the dominant chord followed by a chord other
than the tonic chord, typically the submediant chord.
PIT-2.J.3
The mediant triad is rarely used in harmonic progressions of
18th-century style. The mediant triad in a minor key—III—appears
more often in its role as representing the relative major key.
PIT-2.K
Identify the type of 6 4 chord used in notated music.
PIT-2.K.1
In composing tonal music, care must be taken in the use of second-inversion triads, or 6 4 chords, as they may only appear in four specific contexts: cadential 6 4, neighboring or pedal 6 4, passing 6 4, and arpeggiated 6 4 patterns.
PIT-2.K.2
The cadential 6 4 precedes the dominant, often at a cadence.
Although it contains the notes of the tonic triad, it does not
exercise a tonic function but serves as an embellishment of the
dominant. It occurs in a metrically stronger position than the
dominant chord, and upper voices most often move by step to
the tones of the dominant. It may be notated as V 6 4-5 3.
PIT-2.L
Describe the type of 6 4 chord used in notated music.
PIT-2.L.1
The neighboring or pedal 6 4 occurs when the third and fifth
of a root-position triad are embellished by their respective
upper neighbor tones while the bass remains stationary. In this pattern, the 6 4 chord usually occurs on a weak beat.
PIT-2.L.2
The passing 6 4 harmonizes the second note of a three-note
ascending or descending scale fragment in the bass; it
harmonizes a bass passing tone. In this pattern, the 6 4 chord
usually occurs on a weak beat and the motion of the upper voices is ordinarily by step.

Harmony—Groupings of pitches that are successively and/ or simultaneously produced form perceivable units known as chords.
Chords relate to each other within an established musical style through the context of harmony.
PIT-2.L.3
The arpeggiated 6 4 results from triad arpeggiation in the bass.
With the upper voices sounding a static chord, the bass
arpeggiates a complete triad, or alternatively, it oscillates
between root and fifth of the chord, as often heard in a waltz or march.
PIT-2.M
Identify types of embellishing tones, including nonharmonic tones, in— a. 	performed music b. 	notated music
PIT-2.M.1
To expand individual lines and/or intensify expression,
composers often enrich a chordal framework with various
types of decorative notes, or embellishing tones. When these
notes lie outside the pitch content of the prevailing chord
they are called nonharmonic tones, or nonchord tones. Most
nonharmonic tones may be classified as a specific type (e.g.,
passing tone), based on the way the nonharmonic tone is
melodically approached and resolved. Rhythmic placement
of a nonharmonic tone—i.e., whether it falls directly on a beat
or on a division between beats—serves to further define its
classification, namely whether it is accented or unaccented.
PIT-2.M.2
Other terms that relate to nonharmonic tones include
embellishment, ornament, trill, preparation, and resolution.
PIT-2.M.3
Common classifications of nonharmonic tones include passing
tones (accented and unaccented) and neighbor tones (including lower neighbor and upper neighbor).
PIT-2.M.4
Common classifications of nonharmonic tones also include
anticipation, escape tone, appoggiatura, and pedal point.
PIT-2.M.5
Common classifications of nonharmonic tones also include
suspension (including rearticulated suspension and chain of suspensions) and retardation.
BOUNDARY STATEMENT
When taking the AP Music Theory, exam, students need to
identify and notate suspensions. They only need to identify retardations.
PIT-2.N
Compose a bass line added to a given soprano line that incorporates unaccented passing and/or neighbor tones while following the normative harmonic procedures of 18th-century harmony and voice leading.
PIT-2.N.1
When composing a bass line in 18th-century chorale style,
the essential frame of quarter notes may be enlivened by
judicious use of eighth-note motion, commonly manifested as
unaccented passing and/or neighbor tones. Such embellishing
tones can create desirable formations with the soprano when they—
§§ complement a stationary soprano (i.e., two bass eighth notes against a quarter note in the soprano),
§§ move in parallel thirds or sixths with the soprano, §§ engage in voice exchange with the soprano.

PIT-2.O.1
In a figured bass or Roman-numeral progression, Arabic
numerals may be used to indicate specific nonharmonic tones such as 4–3 (implying a suspension).
PIT-2.P
Identify and apply harmonic sequences in— a. 	performed music b. 	notated music
PIT-2.P.1
Harmonic sequence occurs when a segment of chords is
followed immediately by one or more transpositions of the
same segment. The interval of transposition is usually held to a
constant size—for instance, a sequence up a third, if continued,
will be followed by additional transpositions up a third. Harmonic
sequence sometimes occurs with a corresponding melodic sequence.
PIT-2.Q
Identify and describe tonicization in— a. 	performed music b. 	notated music
PIT-2.Q.1
The particular key that starts and ends a given work is that
work’s tonic, or primary, key. However, scale degrees or
chords other than the tonic may be made to sound as if they
are temporary tonics; the process of achieving this is called
tonicization. Tonicization possesses a fleeting quality due to its
relatively brief duration and the lack of a clear cadence in the new
key. Tonicization is a local harmonic event that does not change
the primary key of the music. Diatonic scale degrees from the
primary key are altered to achieve tonicization; these altered
scale degrees are shown with accidentals in notated music.
PIT-2.Q.2
The most common way to effect tonicization is through use of
a secondary dominant (or applied dominant) chord. A major or
minor triad other than the actual tonic chord is preceded by
its own dominant chord, the secondary (or applied) dominant,
allowing the original triad to be felt as a temporary tonic (i.e.,
tonicized). For instance, the Ⅴ chord in the key of C major
(a G-major triad) could be preceded by its own dominant or
dominant seventh chord, which would be spelled D-F♯-A and
D-F♯-A-C, respectively. In this example, this “Ⅴ of Ⅴ” chord
(notated Ⅴ /Ⅴ) would resolve to and tonicize the Ⅴ chord of
the original key, exploiting the power of a dominant-to-tonic
progression to assert a new, albeit temporary, tonic. Although
the dominant (Ⅴ) is the most common chord to be tonicized
by its own secondary dominant (Ⅴ /Ⅴ), any major or minor triad
may also be tonicized through use of a secondary dominant,
such as Ⅴ /ⅱ resolving to ii or Ⅴ /Ⅳ resolving to Ⅳ. Secondary
dominants nearly always require accidentals in their spelling,
and they may appear as triads or dominant seventh chords in
any inversion appropriate to the harmonic context.

Harmony—Groupings of pitches that are successively and/ or simultaneously produced form perceivable units known as chords.

PIT-2.Q.3
As with secondary (or applied) dominants, secondary leading tone chords or secondary diminished seventh chords
(also referred to as applied leading-tone chords or applied
diminished seventh chords) may also be used to tonicize any
major or minor triad in a given key. Secondary leading-tone
chords are diminished triads and diminished seventh chords
(fully or half-diminished) whose root is the leading tone of the
chord being tonicized. A “ⅶo7 of Ⅴ” (notated ⅶo7/Ⅴ) tonicizes
the Ⅴ chord and is built on 4^ of the original key; in another
example, ⅶo7/ ii would tonicize the ii chord and would be built
on 1^ of the original key. As with normal leading-tone chords,
the triad only appears in first-inversion (i.e., ⅶo6), but seventh
chords may appear in any inversion appropriate to the harmonic
context. Because the half-diminished leading-tone chord only
appears in the major mode, secondary leading-tone chords
that are half-diminished in quality may only be used to tonicize major triads.
PIT-3
Melody—Pitches that are deliberately sequenced through time produce an expressive musical statement known as a melody.
PIT-3.A
Sight-sing the pitches and rhythms of a melody that is notated in treble or bass clef.
PIT-3.A.1
Accurate performance of a notated melody rests largely on
accurate rendering of the notated pitches. Even when a melody
is transposed to a key other than the notated key, melodic
intervals separating pitches are retained, allowing the melody to retain its characteristic sound.
PIT-3.A.2
Although complete pitch accuracy is the goal, a sight-singing
performance demonstrates partial mastery when it retains the
tonic pitch or approximates the melody with correct contour.
PIT-3.A.3
In performing rhythm, it is important to sustain notes for their
full duration, especially on cadential notes where inexperienced
performers may be tempted to cut short the duration.
PIT-3.B
Notate the pitches and rhythms of a performed melody— a.	 in treble or bass clef b.	 composed in a major or minor key
PIT-3.B.1
Accurate dictation of a performed melody depends on accurate
identification of the relationship of the pitches to the tonic and
the notation of the sounding pitches and rhythms. Pitches are
accurately notated when they are spelled correctly in the given key and placed in the proper octave.
PIT-3.C
Identify features of melody in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
PIT-3.C.1
Melody is produced by pitch and rhythm together, combining
to create a succession of pitches through time that express a musical statement.
PIT-3.C.2
Melodies may be derived from specific scales and modes and
are often organized in patterns of musical motives and phrases.

Melody—Pitches that are deliberately sequenced through time produce an expressive musical statement known as a melody.
PIT-3.C.3
The pitch succession that comprises a melody may exhibit
several technical features. Contour is the unique melodic shape
created by the specific rise and fall of pitches. Conjunct and
disjunct refer to melodic steps (conjunct) or leaps (disjunct)
within a melody or melodic segment. Register refers to the
relative span of pitch (e.g., high, medium, or low) of notes in
a given melody or part thereof. Range refers to the overall
compass of pitch in a given melody, from its lowest to its highest pitch.
PIT-3.C.4
Motive refers to a small musical idea that recurs and is developed
through the course of a musical composition or passage. A
motive may be compositionally developed by pitch alone, rhythm alone, or the complete pitch-rhythm combination.
PIT-3.C.5
In vocal music, text (known in popular music as lyrics) is set to
melody, and elements of text and pitch may relate in one of two ways—
§§ When each syllable of text corresponds to a single pitch, the text setting is said to be syllabic.
§§ When a syllable of text is sung with two or more pitches, the
text setting is said to be melismatic; each instance of one syllable to multiple pitches is a melisma.
PIT-3.C.6
Melodic transposition is a commonly used form of pitch
transformation; it is also a useful skill frequently required of
practicing musicians. In melodic transposition, a melody or
melodic segment is moved to a new pitch level while retaining
its intervallic and rhythmic content. For instance, a C major
melody transposed up a whole step would result in the same
tune sounding a whole step higher; it would now be in the key of D major.
PIT-3.D
Compose a bass line added to a given soprano line, following the normative melodic procedures of 18th-century music.
PIT-3.D.1
Melodic interest in a bass line may be created by balancing
upward and downward motion and by balancing melodic steps and leaps.
PIT-3.D.2
A bass line uses melodic leaps with greater frequency than
upper voices or parts, which tend toward more stepwise
motion. Allowable leaps include thirds, perfect fourths and
fifths, sixths, and octaves, and, if resolved properly, descending
diminished fifths. Octave leaps should be followed by changes
in direction. The bass line may include successive leaps in the
same direction as long as the pitches outline a triad.
PIT-3.D.3
Repeated bass notes are acceptable only if they start on a
strong beat. However, the repeated notes may start on a weak
beat if it is the beginning of a phrase or if the second note is a suspension.

PIT-3.E.1
To enrich their works, composers often develop motives,
melodic segments, or entire melodies using melodic
procedures that transform those original ideas in various ways
and are therefore sometimes called motivic transformation or
thematic transformation. Some procedures focus solely on
rhythmic transformation (e.g., augmentation), some procedures
focus solely on pitch transformation (e.g., melodic inversion),
and some procedures transform both pitch and rhythm (e.g., retrograde).
PIT-3.E.2
Melodic sequence occurs when a melodic segment is followed
immediately by one or more transpositions of the same
segment. The interval of transposition is usually held to a
constant size: for instance, a sequence up a third, if continued,
will be followed by additional transpositions up a third. Melodic
sequence may occur with a corresponding harmonic sequence.

Voice Leading—
Individual voices of a composition are imbued with a cohesive sense of motion and interaction through musical voice leading, which is rooted in historical traditions.
PIT-4.A
Identify and apply the procedures of 18th-century voice leading through— a.	 score analysis b.	 error detection c.	 writing exercises d.	 contextual listening
PIT-4.A.1
Voice leading describes how individual voices or parts move as a harmonic progression advances from each
chord to the next. This motion must take into consideration
correct chord spelling, spacing, and doubling. Emulating
works of the common practice era, voice leading should
achieve linear smoothness and bring about independence
of voices (or parts). Additionally, tendency tones are
resolved according to stylistic precedent (e.g., a chordal seventh resolving down by step).
PIT-4.A.2
The linear movement between two given voices can happen in four ways—
§§ parallel motion—voices move in the same direction (both up or both down) by the same melodic interval.
§§ similar motion—voices move in the same direction but not by the same melodic interval.
§§ oblique motion—one voice remains stationary while the second moves up or down.
§§ contrary motion—voices move in opposite directions.

Voice Leading—
Individual voices of a composition are imbued with a cohesive sense of motion and interaction through musical voice leading, which is rooted in historical traditions.
PIT-4.A.3
Following are general conventions of 18th-century voice leading—
§§ Voice leading should proceed mostly by step without excessive leaps.
§§ When possible, pitches common to adjacent chords, or
common tones, should be retained in the same voice part(s).
§§ For clarity of voice leading, any chord should maintain
soprano-alto-tenor-bass (SATB) order from high to low to avoid voice crossing.
§§ If a perfect fifth between two voices is not immediately
repeated, it should proceed to an interval other than
another perfect fifth between the same voices. This
applies to parallel motion (i.e., parallel fifths) as well as
contrary motion; it also applies to nonadjacent chords on successive beats.
§§ If a perfect octave or unison between two voices is not
immediately repeated, it should proceed to an interval other
than another perfect octave or perfect unison between the
same voices. This applies to parallel motion (i.e., parallel
octaves) as well as contrary motion; it also applies to nonadjacent chords on successive beats.
§§ All voices should proceed melodically with the following
intervals—major and minor second, major and minor third,
perfect fourth, and perfect fifth. All melodic augmented and
diminished intervals should be excluded, as they produce
uncharacteristic dissonances. All melodic intervals larger
than a perfect fifth should also be excluded, as they create uncharacteristic disjunct motion.
§§ The leading tone in an outer voice (i.e., soprano or bass) should
always resolve up by step to avoid an unresolved leading tone.
PIT-4.A.4
When composing outer voices, the normative conventions of
18th-century voice leading should be maintained (e.g., avoid parallel fifths). In addition—
§§ Outer voices may include leading tones as long as those
leading tones are not doubled in another voice and resolve
to the tonic by ascending in stepwise motion, to avoid an unresolved leading tone.
§§ Note-against-note dissonances between outer voices may be included only if they imply an acceptable
harmonic progression—for example, a note-against-note
fourth would work only as part of an acceptable pattern
of second-inversion chords, such as the cadential, neighboring (pedal), or passing 6 4 chord patterns.
A chromatically inflected pitch that is appropriate in the musical
context may be included as long as the preinflected pitch does
not appear in another voice directly preceding the inflected pitch in question (i.e., avoid a cross relation).

PIT-4.A.5
When chords are spaced in close position, all upper parts
(i.e., all parts except the bass) are placed as close together
as chord tones will allow. Any other spacing is considered an open position.
PIT-4.A.6
When composing music in a four-voice texture, the normative
conventions for writing chordal sevenths should be followed.
PIT-4.A.7
When part-writing, chordal sevenths should be approached
by common tone or by step. When the voice-leading context
precludes these options, chordal sevenths may also be
approached by ascending leap or (rarely) by a descending leap of a third.
PIT-4.A.8
All chordal sevenths should resolve by a descending step,
to avoid an unresolved seventh. However, the chordal seventh in a V4 3 chord may move up by a step when appearing in a
I-V4
3-I6 progression. In some cases, the chordal seventh may be
retained in the same voice before resolving down, such as when
II7 moves to a cadential 6 4 chord.
PIT-4.A.9
The fifth of a root-position dominant seventh chord may be
omitted if it helps the voice leading. When the fifth is omitted in
a root-position seventh chord, the root should be doubled. All
inverted seventh chords, however, must be spelled completely in writing the chord.
PIT-4.A.10
Seventh chords in inversion often connect chords in an
extended progression allowing the bass to have a melodic
stepwise quality. Voice leading into and out of these inverted
seventh chords is typically smooth, with no or minimal leaps.
PIT-4.A.11
Leading-tone seventh chords—the ⅶo7 diminished) and ⅶø7—
have two possible functions: to substitute for the Ⅴ or Ⅴ7 chord
as part of the dominant or, placed between tonic chords, to prolong the tonic in stepwise voice leading.
PIT-4.A.12
Inverted seventh chords should be spelled completely. Any
tendency tones should appear individually (i.e., not doubled) and should be resolved according to the tendency.
PIT-4.A.13
All chordal sevenths should resolve by a descending step (i.e.,
avoid an unresolved seventh). However, the chordal seventh in a V4
3 chord may move up by step when appearing in a I-V4 3
-I6 progression. In some cases, the chordal seventh may be
retained in the same voice before resolving down, such as when ii7 moves to a cadential 6 4 chord.

Doubling occurs when the number of voices or parts used
is greater than what is required to represent a given chord,
allowing the composer to assign one or more chord members
to multiple voices or parts. In choosing pitches for doubling, these conventions are followed—
§§ Double the root of a triad whenever voice leading allows.
§§ Thirds and fifths may also be doubled in triads when they result in good voice leading.
§§ In all situations, always double non-tendency tones (i.e.,
tones other than the leading-tone and chordal seventh).
§§ If the fifth is omitted in a root-position seventh chord, double the root.
§§ Following a complete root position Ⅴ7, the tonic triad may have three roots and a third (no fifth).

Individual voices of a composition are imbued with a cohesive sense of motion and interaction through musical voice leading, which is rooted in historical traditions.
PIT-4.C.2
Following are additional conventions of 18th-century voice leading—
§§ A harmonic diminished fifth should proceed to an interval
other than the perfect fifth above it to avoid rising unequal
fifths. One common exception to this convention occurs in the progression I—V4 3 —I6, where a harmonic diminished
fifth may rise to a perfect fifth. The most natural resolution of a diminished fifth is inward to a third.
§§ If outer voices move to a perfect interval by similar motion,
the upper voice should proceed by step. Avoid direct
fifths and direct octaves (also known as hidden fifths and hidden octaves).
§§ A voice, in moving to its next pitch, should never cross
over an adjacent voice’s current pitch, to avoid overlapping
voices. This maintains independence of voices and clarity of voice leading.
PIT-4.C.3
Although composers take care to keep each voice or part within
its own optimal range, they set their chords with the freedom
to distribute chord tones throughout the pitch range, creating
unique voicings (or arrangements) of simple chords.
PIT-4.C.4
In spacing a chord, adjacent upper parts may be as far apart
as an octave, but no more; however, the distance between the
bass pitch and its nearest neighboring part may be more than an octave.

PIT-4.E.2
In figured bass, Arabic numerals may be used to indicate
specific voice leading patterns. For instance, in a cadential 6 4 pattern, the figures that show 6 4 progressing to 5 3 serve as a
reminder that the sixth and fourth above the bass pitch should resolve down by step.

long as they are rhythmically appropriate to their context— that is, cadential 6 4 occur on a strong beat and passing or neighboring (pedal) six-fours on a weak beat.
§§ A chord may proceed to any other chord except for one
that results in a poor chord succession, e.g., Avoid V-IV,
V-ii, ii-iii, IV-iii, ii-I, V-vi6, and iii-viio, etc.
§§ Any chord may be implied as long as it does not result
in poor chord use. Poor chord use could include—root position viio, vi6 (unless as part of a modulation, parallel
motion by first-inversion chords, or other acceptable
diatonic sequence), and iii6 (unless as part of parallel motion
by first-inversion chords or other acceptable diatonic sequence).

Big Idea 2: Rhythm (RHY)
Music exists in the dimension of time, where long and short sounds and silences can be combined
in myriad ways. This temporal aspect, called rhythm, is often governed by a layered structure of
interrelated pulses known as meter. Rhythms are typically grouped into distinctive rhythmic patterns,
which help define the specific identity of a musical passage. Musicians use established rhythmic
devices to expand expressive possibilities, often achieving their effect by challenging the regularity of the meter or transforming rhythmic patterns.

Rhythm and meter—
Music exists in the dimension of time, where long and short sounds and silences can be combined in myriad ways. This temporal aspect, called rhythm, is often governed by a layered structure of interrelated pulses known as meter.
RHY-1.A
Identify the rhythmic values of notes and rests in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
RHY-1.A.1
Rhythmic values symbolize the duration of a note or rest. The
duration of notes and rests can be extended using ties and augmentation dots (single dots and double dots).
RHY-1.B
Describe beat division and meter type in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
RHY-1.B.1
In most music, rhythm is governed by a layered structure of
interrelated pulses called meter. Meter is fundamentally based
on three interlocking pulse speeds (beat, beat division, and measure).
RHY-1.B.2
A meter in which the beat is parsed into two divisions is called
simple, and a meter in which the beat is parsed into three divisions is called compound.
RHY-1.C
Describe the meter type in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
RHY-1.C.1
Meter types are identified based on two relationships—
the relationship of the beat to the division (simple versus
compound) and the relationship of the beat to the measure.
A meter in which the beat is grouped into two-beat measures
is called duple, and meters in which the beats are grouped into
three- and four-beat measures are called triple and quadruple,
respectively. For example, meter known as common time 4
4 would be considered a simple quadruple meter: “simple”
because its quarter-note beat parses into two eighth-note
divisions and “quadruple” because its beat groups into four beat measures.

Rhythm and meter—
Music exists in the dimension of time, where long and short sounds and silences can be combined in myriad ways. This temporal aspect, called rhythm, is often governed by a layered structure of interrelated pulses known as meter.
RHY-1.D
Describe the time signature in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
RHY-1.D.1
Time signatures (or meter signatures) represent meter in a
score. The upper and lower numbers of a time signature work
together to imply how many beats are in a measure, which
rhythmic value gets one beat, and whether the meter is simple or compound. More specifically—
§§ The upper number of a time signature reveals whether
the meter is simple (2, 3, or 4) or compound (6, 9, or 12)
and whether the meter is duple (2 or 6), triple (3 or 9), or quadruple (4 or 12).
§§ The lower number represents the rhythmic value of the beat
in simple meters and the rhythmic value of the division in compound meters.
To illustrate, in a simple meter such as 3 8, the upper number
indicates a simple triple meter, and the lower number shows
that the eighth note gets the beat. In a compound meter such as 9
8, the upper number indicates a compound triple meter, and
the lower number shows that the eighth note is the division.
Each measure of 9 8 contains nine eighth-note divisions, and
each group of three divisions forms a dotted-quarter beat.
RHY-1.D.2
Metrical accents arise from patterns of strong and weak beats
that occur at regularly occurring intervals in a meter. At the beat
level, the first beat of a measure, called the downbeat, is always
strongest; the subsequent beats in the measure are felt as weak
beats and, in some cases, lesser strong beats. In a measure of 4
4, beat one is the downbeat, beat three constitutes a lesser
strong beat, and beats two and four fill out the measure as
weak beats. At the division level, divisions occurring directly on
beats are felt as strong in relation to the intervening divisions, or offbeats, which are comparatively weak.
RHY-1.E
Identify irregularities of beat division and/or beat grouping into measures in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
RHY-1.E.1
Borrowed divisions occur when compound divisions (three
divisions per beat) substitute for division values in a simple
meter (two divisions per beat), and vice versa. Such divisions
are sometimes called triplets and duplets, respectively.
Borrowed rhythmic values may also occur at the beat level; for
instance, three quarter note triplets may take the place of two
quarter notes. Beats may be divided into other portions (such
as 5s and 7s), sometimes called irregular divisions.
RHY-1.E.2
Meter types created by recurring regularly spaced patterns
of accent on the different levels of pulse (division, beat, and
measure) are called symmetrical meters. However, meters are
not always regularly periodic at all levels of pulse. For instance, 5
8 contains beats of unequal size, with the first beat containing
three eighth-note divisions and the second containing two
eighth-note divisions, or vice versa. This is an example of an
asymmetrical or irregular meter. Music may use time signatures that shift often, such as a measure of 3 4 followed by a measure of 4 4; this is known as changing or mixed meter.

Rhythmic patterns—
Musical sounds and silences may be produced individually but are typically grouped into distinctive rhythmic patterns.
These patterns help define the specific identity of a musical passage as it combines with other passages to create larger rhythmic formations.
RHY-2.A
For rhythmic patterns in simple and compound meter— a.	 Identify the rhythmic pattern b.	 Notate the rhythmic pattern c.	 Sight-sing the rhythmic pattern
RHY-2.A.1
Rhythmic patterns arise from the various ways rhythmic
values can fill up a beat. Simple beats have a limited number
of rhythmic patterns; compound beats have only a few more
possible rhythmic patterns. Learning and knowing these
rhythmic patterns by sight and sound facilitates reading,
notating, and analyzing music. Rhythmic patterns may be
identified in performed excerpts and in scores, notated from
performed excerpts, and performed through sight-singing.
Some rhythmic patterns are so common and distinctive that they have names, such as dotted rhythms.
RHY-2.A.2
In notating rhythm, care should be taken to sequence rhythmic
values and draw beams so the location of beats is most clearly
visible. There may be no beaming across the half-bar (e.g.,
across beats 2 and 3 in quadruple meter). Notes, rests, ties, and
beams that obscure the beat structure of a measure are difficult
for the performer to interpret and considered wrong.
RHY-2.B
Identify rhythmic discrepancies between notated and performed music in one or two voices.
RHY-2.B.1
A musical score shows notation of the specific rhythms
to be performed. Except for musical styles that allow for
improvisation and ornamentation, performed rhythms should
not deviate from the score. Swing rhythms are an example of a
musical style that allows rhythms to deviate from their notation;
the addition of the word “swing” indicates that the offbeat note should occur later than it would ordinarily.
RHY-2.C
Compose the rhythmic aspects of a bass line added to a given soprano line, following conventions of the 18th-century chorale.
RHY-2.C.1
Bass lines in 18th-century chorales tend to follow a particular
rhythmic profile. Although they may feature note values
ranging from half notes to eighth notes, the quarter note is the
most frequent rhythmic value. A bass line of a chorale notated in 4
4 time that makes exclusive or almost exclusive use of half notes would be atypical of the style.

Rhythmic devices—
Musicians use established rhythmic devices to expand expressive possibilities.
These devices often achieve their effect by challenging the regularity of meter or transforming rhythmic patterns.
RHY-3.A
Identify rhythmic devices in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
RHY-3.A.1
A variety of rhythmic devices and features are used in music.
Some features enliven rhythm by challenging the regularity of
an established meter. For example, syncopation occurs when
rhythm places accent on weak beats or divisions.  A cross rhythm (or polyrhythm) is a simultaneous occurrence of two or
more rhythmic patterns that do not derive from one another
and are not rooted in the same meter. Hemiola, in its most
fundamental meaning, refers to any arrangement of rhythm
and meter that articulates a 3 to 2 ratio. Thus, hemiola occurs
when three notes of equal duration take up the time previously
held by two notes of equal duration, or vice versa. Common manifestations of hemiola include the following— §§ Measures of compound duple meter (e.g., 6 8)
juxtaposed with measures that articulate a simple triple meter (e.g., 3 4), with the division pulse remaining constant (e.g., a static eighth-note pulse).
§§ Two measures of triple meter that are accented as Strong weak-Strong-weak-Strong-weak instead of the usual
Strong-weak-weak-Strong-weak-weak.
The contrasting metric structures that form a hemiola may be
heard successively or simultaneously, with the latter forming an
example of polyrhythm or “two-against-three” polyrhythm.
RHY-3.A.2
Other rhythmic devices include the following—
§§ An agogic accent is a note that naturally receives more
emphasis due to its extended (or longer) duration.
§§ An anacrusis, or pickup, is a rhythm or rhythms that start before the first downbeat of a phrase.
§§ A fermata is a symbol placed over a note or rest that
indicates it is to be held longer than its normal duration.
RHY-3.B
Identify and apply procedures used to transform rhythmic patterns in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
RHY-3.B.1
Rhythmic patterns can be transformed. Two of the most
common ways to transform a rhythmic pattern are by augmentation and diminution.

Big Idea 3: Form (FOR)
Music exhibits a structural aspect known as form, in which a musical composition is organized in a
hierarchy of constituent parts. The specific ways these parts are related, contrasted, and/or developed
produce the unique profile of an individual composition. Specific formal types and functions may
be identified when parts of a composition follow established melodic-harmonic patterns or fulfill
established roles within the overall hierarchical structure.

FOR-1
Form—As with language, music exhibits a structural aspect known as form, in which a musical composition is organized in a hierarchy of constituent parts. The specific ways these parts are related, contrasted, and/or developed produce the unique profile of an individual composition. Specific formal types and functions may be identified when parts of a composition follow established melodic harmonic patterns or fulfill established roles within the overall hierarchical structure.
FOR-1.A
Identify the beginnings, ends, and lengths of phrases in— a.	 performed music and b.	 notated music.
FOR-1.A.1
Music is made up of syntactical units called phrases, which may
generally be described as complete musical utterances that
conclude with a cadence. By delineating phrases, cadences
form punctuation points that regulate the overall sense of
musical flow in a composition. Four-measure and eight measure phrases are normative, but other lengths are possible.
FOR-1.A.2
A bass line should imply an appropriate cadence at each phrase
ending. Appropriate cadences include perfect authentic,
imperfect authentic, half, Phrygian half, plagal, and deceptive
cadences. The final cadence must be a perfect authentic
cadence. This group of acceptable cadence types fit generally
into two categories—inconclusive cadences (i.e., half, imperfect
authentic, and deceptive cadences) and conclusive cadences
(i.e., perfect authentic and plagal cadences). A perfect authentic
cadence is created by the V-I progression with both harmonies
in root position, ending with scale degree 1 in the soprano. An
imperfect authentic cadence is also a V-I progression, but
chords may be inverted, with any chord tone in the soprano.
FOR-1.B
Identify the basic units of phrases (i.e., motives) and melodic/rhythmic procedures involving these units in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
FOR-1.B.1
Phrases are made up of short melodic and/or rhythmic
ideas called motives. Variations on these basic units can be
generated through melodic and rhythmic procedures (also
called motivic transformation). Examples include fragmentation
(which yields fragments), literal repetition, and sequential repetition.
FOR-1.C
Describe melodic relationships between phrases in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
FOR-1.C.1
Musical phrases within a passage may sound similar to one
another to promote comprehensibility, memorability, and unity,
or they may sound dissimilar to one another to create variety,
interest, and contrast. Melodic relationships that result may be
represented by lowercase letters. The most common are—
§§ a a – denotes a phrase and its literal repetition
§§ a a’ – denotes a phrase and a varied repetition
§§ a b – denotes two phrases that are melodically contrasting
FOR-1.D
Identify periods in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
FOR-1.D.1
Two phrases may combine into a period, in which the first
phrase, called the antecedent, ends with an inconclusive
cadence and the second phrase, called the consequent,
provides stronger harmonic repose with a conclusive cadence.
A parallel period consists of two phrases that are melodically
similar; a contrasting period consists of two phrases that are melodically contrasting.

Big Idea 4: Musical Design (DES)
Texture, timbre, and expression contribute to the overall design and character of a piece of music or
musical performance. The texture of a musical passage arises from the way its layers are produced
and distributed, and how they interact to form the totality of sound. Timbre refers to the distinct
sounds of specific instruments and voices, arising from the physical manner in which those sounds
are produced. Expressive elements are related to musical interpretation and include dynamics, articulation, and tempo.

Texture—As the substance and structure of a physical object provides tactile texture, the substance and structure of music provides aural texture. The texture of a musical passage is based on the manner in which its layers are produced and distributed and how they interact to form the totality of sound.
DES-1.A
Identify texture types in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
DES-1.A.1
Texture refers to how musical components combine
simultaneously to form an overall sound. Texture is influenced
by how music is produced (e.g., the distinctive qualities of
sound, or timbres), the density and spacing of pitches, and the pitch range encompassed.
DES-1.A.2
Texture types are determined by the number of musical lines
present, the melodic character of these lines, and the ways in
which the lines are combined simultaneously. The main types of
musical texture are monophony, homophony (including chordal
homophony and melody with accompaniment), polyphony
(nonimitative and imitative), and heterophony. These terms
appear as nouns (e.g., homophony) and as adjectives (e.g.,
homophonic). Other terms used to describe texture include
technical terms (e.g., canon/canonic) and casual terms (e.g.,
call and response). Counterpoint (adjective: contrapuntal) is
a term that relates closely to polyphony. Counterpoint refers
specifically to the practice of composing polyphonic music,
often using historical conventions, and the texture that results.
DES-1.B
Identify texture devices in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
DES-1.B.1
In addition to texture type (e.g., monophony), a description of
texture may include the composer’s use of various texture
devices. Examples include devices associated with the bass
line, such as Alberti bass and walking bass, and devices
associated with polyphony, such as canon, imitation, and
countermelody. Other terms further describe the unique texture
of a musical passage, such as solo/soli, accompaniment, doubling, ostinato, and tutti.
DES-1.C
Describe relationships among musical lines, including the number of lines present in a passage and the position of a line in relation to other lines in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
DES-1.C.1
Musical lines, whether in instrumental or vocal pieces, may
be described using the terms soprano, alto, tenor, and
bass (collectively known as SATB), depending on their pitch
position in relation to other lines. Figured bass and chorale
harmonization exercises are typically notated in SATB four voice texture.

Timbre—As we perceive distinctive qualities of imagery, taste, smell, and touch, we can perceive distinctive qualities of musical sound, known as timbre. Timbre is based on the specific instruments and/ or voices used for performance and the physical manner in which they produce sound.
DES-2.A
Identify performance media and vocal and instrumental timbres in performed music.
DES-2.A.1
Some common examples of standard performance media (or
instrumentation) are—string orchestra, string quartet, SATB
choir, brass quintet, jazz trio, and solo piano. Unique ensembles
may be established using a distinctive mix of voices and
instruments. An individual voice or instrument may be identified
by its distinctive timbre, which refers to the unique quality of
sound based on how the sound is produced. The sound quality
is also affected by register (i.e., which part of the voice or
instrument’s total range is used). The most comfortable register
of a given voice or instrument, known as its tessitura, is most
frequently used, but sometimes voices and instruments use
extreme parts of their ranges to create special effects.
DES-2.A.2
Common instrumental families in the tradition known as
Western music include strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion,
and keyboards. Each of these families has many standard
members, and each member is distinguished by its timbre and
register (how high or low its pitches sound). The string family
includes violin, viola, cello, bass, harp, and guitar. The brass
family includes trumpet, French horn, trombone, euphonium,
and tuba. The woodwind family includes flute, oboe, clarinet,
saxophone (which comes in several different sizes, covering
different registers), and bassoon. The percussion family has
many members, such as drums, cymbals, marimba, and others.
The keyboard family includes piano, harpsichord, and organ.
In addition to these standard families, there are alternate
groupings of instruments, such as winds, used to describe a
combined assemblage of woodwind and brass instruments.
A rhythm section consists of a harmony instrument (such as
piano or guitar), a bass instrument (typically double bass), and
usually a drum set that form the core instrumentation of a jazz
ensemble. In the Baroque period, the basso continuo included a
harmony instrument (often a harpsichord) and bass instrument
(such as cello) to provide the core sound of the group.

Expressive elements—
The variety of expressive elements extending beyond pitch, rhythm, form, texture, and timbre affects how music sounds, offering opportunities for individual interpretation.
Expressive elements include dynamics, articulation, and tempo.
DES-3.A
Identify and apply tempo markings, including those that indicate adjustments to the prevailing tempo, used in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
DES-3.A.1
Tempo describes the relative speed of music’s beat pulse.
Tempo may be expressed by words that indicate this relative
speed, ranging from very slow speeds, such as largo, larghetto,
and grave; to slow speeds, such as lento and adagio; moderately
slow speeds, such as andante and andantino; moderate speeds,
such as moderato; and faster speeds, such as allegretto,
allegro, vivace, presto, and prestissimo. Composers in different
musical traditions have used words from different languages to
indicate tempos, and performers are responsible for learning
the meaning of tempo markings that appear in notated music.
Tempo can also be indicated by a “metronome marking,” which
identifies a note value, such as a quarter note, as a beat-note,
and then labels the number of beats per minute, such as “quarter
note = 88”. Tempo markings are typically placed at the start of a movement or section of a piece.
DES-3.A.2
Directions to adjust the musical tempo may be used, including
some to increase the speed (accelerando) and some to slow
it down, either gradually (ritardando) or abruptly (ritenuto).
Additionally, terms may be applied that suggest general freedom with respect to tempo (rubato).
BOUNDARY STATEMENT
With respect to tempo markings, students taking the AP
Music Theory Exam will only be asked to know specific
meanings for the Italian terms listed in DES-3.A.1. However,
students should understand that there exists a much broader
vocabulary in many languages on which composers draw to express tempo and tempo relationships.
DES-3.B
Identify dynamics and changes in dynamics in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
DES-3.B.1
Dynamics describe, in relative terms, how loud or soft music
is. Dynamics are typically marked in music using abbreviations
for the Italian words ranging from very soft to very loud—pp
stands for pianissimo, p stands for piano, mp stands for
mezzo piano, mf stands for mezzo forte, f stands for forte,
and ff stands for fortissimo. Changes in dynamics may be
shown with graphic symbols (sometimes called hairpins ＜ ＞),
with Italian words that call for gradual or sudden changes
(crescendo, decrescendo, subito), or with abbreviations for the
Italian words. A dynamic accent gives a momentary increase
of volume to a specific note or notes. Dynamic accents can be
indicated with sf or sfz, which stand for sforzando. Terraced
dynamics indicate the sudden contrast of a loud passage of
music followed by a soft passage of music, or a soft passage followed by a loud passage.

Expressive elements include dynamics, articulation, and tempo.
DES-3.C
Identify articulation and changes in articulation in— a.	 performed music b.	 notated music
DES-3.C.1
Articulation is an aspect of performance that describes the
way a sound starts (its “attack”) and ends and how detached or
connected adjacent pitches are. Articulations may be shown
with symbols—such as staccato dots, legato (or tenuto) lines,
slurs, or marcato accents—or indicated with words, such
as sempre tenuto. Different types of accents have different
markings. Interpretation of articulations may vary according
to musical style or type of instrument and from performer to
performer. Related to articulation is the tremolo, which is the
rapid and continuous repetition of a single pitch.
DES-3.D
Sight-sing a notated melody, applying all indicated markings for— a.	 dynamics b.	 articulation c.	 tempo
DES-3.D.1
Singing a melody at sight, without extended rehearsal or prior
familiarity with it, requires observation and performance not
only of the pitch and rhythm but also of the indicated expressive
elements of dynamics, articulation, and tempo. In performing
a melody with a single tempo marking, the performer should
maintain steady tempo throughout. It is important to perform
with continuity throughout—avoiding hesitations and restarts—
to maintain the momentum of musical motion and properly
observe the metric framework of the melody. No alterations in
the tempo should be made unless the notation specifically indicates a change in tempo.
BOUNDARY STATEMENT
Melodies that appear in sight-singing questions on the
AP Music Theory Exam contain simple markings that
indicate a loud dynamic level (e.g., forte) and a moderate
tempo (e.g., moderato); markings related to articulation
are limited to standard phrase slurs. These markings are
specifically chosen to promote clarity of vocal projection and
allow students to prioritize pitch/rhythm accuracy. It can be
assumed that students will not be asked to perform melodies
that require a nuanced rendering of expressive elements,
such as crescendos, ritardandos, or distinctive articulations.
