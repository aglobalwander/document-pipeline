AP Equity and Access Policy
College Board strongly encourages educators to make equitable access a guiding
principle for their AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared
students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination
of barriers that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and
socioeconomic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented. Schools
should make every effort to ensure their AP classes reflect the diversity of their
student population. College Board also believes that all students should have
access to academically challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes,
which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to
equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.

About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking
AP courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and
AP Exams are developed and scored by college faculty
and experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges
and universities in the United States grant credit,
advanced placement, or both on the basis of successful
AP Exam scores—more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the content
and skills that are the focus of the corresponding
college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also
organizes the content and skills into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many AP teachers have
told us they follow in order to focus their instruction.
The intention of this publication is to respect teachers’
time and expertise by providing a roadmap that they
can modify and adapt to their local priorities and
preferences. Moreover, by organizing the AP course
content and skills into units, the AP Program is able
to provide teachers and students with free formative assessments—Personal Progress Checks—that
teachers can assign throughout the year to measure
student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students:
Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically
challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to equitable preparation and
access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses:
The AP Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP courses
must participate in the AP Course Audit, a process through which AP teachers’ course materials are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.

AP Psychology Course and Exam Description

=== Page 9 ===
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the
AP teacher and the school principal (or designated
administrator) to confirm awareness and understanding
of the curricular and resource requirements. A syllabus
or course outline, detailing how course requirements
are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The
AP Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor;
all AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision,
piloting, and analysis to ensure that questions are
accurate, fair, and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development,
College Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher
education institutions. This feedback is carefully
considered to ensure that AP courses and exams are
able to provide students with a college-level learning
experience and the opportunity to demonstrate their
qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam
development process, relies on the expertise of both
AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice
questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course performance
assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands
of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are
scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion
is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained,
and their work is monitored throughout the Reading
for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief
Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers
in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of
the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a curve.
Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which means that
every student who meets the criteria for an AP score of
2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no matter how many
students that is. The criteria for the number of points a
student must earn on the AP Exam to receive scores of 3,
4, or 5—the scores that research consistently validates for credit and placement purposes—include:
§§ The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
§§ The number of points researchers have found to be predictive that an AP student will succeed when placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
§§ Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP scores as follows:
AP Score

A 4

AP Psychology Course and Exam Description

=== Page 10 ===
While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and
universities. To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/ placement policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/creditpolicies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score the free-response sections of the AP Exams.
Ninety-eight percent of surveyed educators who took
part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an
AP Reader, including opportunities to:
§§ Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning AP Readers—both high school and college educators—make improvements to the way
they teach or score because of their experience at the AP Reading.
§§ Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure
to the quality and depth of the responses from the
entire pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
§§ Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
§§ Score from home: AP Readers have online
distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects.
Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
§§ Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs):
AP Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide suggests a
sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds skill instruction across units, organizes content
into topics, and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress
throughout the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with
content and skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress
over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course topics and skills, create
customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.
*To report misuses, please call, 877-274-6474 (International: +1-212-632-1781).

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
§§ Teachers and students sign in to or create their College Board accounts.
§§ Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
§§ Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
§§ Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP Coordinator.
§§ Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and
AP Coordinators to complete, overall, it helps save time and provides the following
additional benefits:
§§ Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
§§ Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
§§ Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student pack.
The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
§§ Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

§§ Review the overview at the start of each unit guide to identify essential questions,
conceptual understandings, and skills for each unit.
§§ Use the Unit at a Glance table to identify related topics that build toward a common
understanding and then plan appropriate pacing for students.
§§ Identify useful strategies in the Instructional Approaches section to help teach the concepts and skills.
Teach
When teaching, supporting resources could be used to build students’ conceptual understanding and their mastery of skills.
§§ Use the topic pages in the unit guides to identify the required content.
§§ Integrate the content with a skill, considering any appropriate scaffolding.
§§ Employ any of the instructional strategies previously identified.
§§ Use the available resources on the topic pages to bring a variety of assets into the classroom.
Assess

§§ At the end of each unit, use AP Classroom to assign students the online Personal
Progress Checks, as homework or as an in-class task.
§§ Provide question-level feedback to students through answer rationales; provide unit- and
skill-level feedback using the progress dashboard.
§§ Create additional practice opportunities using the AP Question Bank and assign them through AP Classroom.

About the
AP Psychology Course
The AP Psychology course introduces students to the systematic and scientific study of
human behavior and mental processes. While considering the psychologists and studies
that have shaped the field, students explore and apply psychological theories, key concepts,
and phenomena associated with such topics as the biological bases of behavior, sensation
and perception, learning and cognition, motivation, developmental psychology, testing
and individual differences, treatments of psychological disorders, and social psychology.
Throughout the course, students employ psychological research methods, including
ethical considerations, as they use the scientific method, evaluate claims and evidence, and effectively communicate ideas.
College Course Equivalent
The AP Psychology course is designed to be the equivalent of the Introduction to Psychology
course usually taken during the first college year.
Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites for AP Psychology. Students should be able to read a college-level
textbook and write grammatically correct, complete sentences.

Content
The course framework provides a clear and detailed description of the course
requirements necessary for student success. The framework specifies what
students must know, be able to do, and understand, with a focus on ideas that
encompass core principles, theories, and processes of the discipline. The
framework also encourages instruction that prepares students for advanced
coursework in the field of psychology at the undergraduate level.
UNITS
The nine units in AP Psychology and their weighting on the multiple-choice section of the AP Exam are listed on the following page.
Pacing recommendations at the unit level and on the Course at a Glance provide
suggestions for how to teach the required course content and administer the
Personal Progress Checks. The suggested class periods are based on a schedule
in which the class meets five days a week for 45 minutes each day. While these
recommendations have been made to aid planning, teachers should of course
adjust pacing based on the needs of their students, alternate schedules (e.g., block scheduling), or their school’s academic calendar.
TOPICS
Each unit is broken down into teachable segments called topics. The topic pages
(starting on page 32) contain the required content for each topic.

Guides
Introduction
Designed with extensive input from the community of AP Psychology
educators, the unit guides offer teachers helpful guidance in building
students’ skills and knowledge. The suggested sequence was identified
through a thorough analysis of the syllabi of highly effective AP teachers
and the organization of typical college textbooks.
This unit structure respects new AP teachers’ time by providing one
possible sequence they can adopt or modify rather than having to
build from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units enable the
AP Program to provide interested teachers with formative assessments—
the Personal Progress Checks—that they can assign their students at
the end of each unit to gauge progress toward success on the AP Exam.
However, experienced AP teachers who are satisfied with their current
course organization and exam results should feel no pressure to adopt
these units, which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

Many theories, schools of thought, and perspectives exist in the field of psychology.
This course surveys and applies those ideas, training students to identify the major theories and perspectives. Within the major fields of psychology, appropriate research methodology is crucial to produce reliable and valid results and avoid bias. In this unit, students are introduced to research methods and designs that will help them learn how to avoid ethical misconduct and design flaws.
Students will learn to differentiate between research designs, identify the advantages and disadvantages of each, and determine why one research method should be used over another. Students will also learn which research methods and modes of questioning are appropriate for different fields of psychology as well as how to use appropriate descriptive statistics when presenting their data.
Preparing for the AP Exam
This course requires students to use their knowledge in a variety of real-world scenarios.
Students should have opportunities to practice applying psychological concepts in their explanations. The AP Exam includes two seven-point free-response questions:
one that relates to content understanding and application and another that relates to the understanding of research method and design and/or data and statistical analysis.
Unit 1 provides foundational knowledge about the field of psychology and introduces students to the research methods associated with various theories, schools of thought, and perspectives. From the start, students can begin to answer research method questions.
Students often struggle with knowing which types of research questions can be studied with which methods. Students also struggle with graphic representations of data, in part because they often confuse the independent with the dependent variable. Teachers can give students opportunities to practice constructing graphs, emphasizing the correct placement of the variables on the axes.
Students also struggle with using statistics, particularly statistical significance—they might describe correlational research rather than statistical significance or use the term “confidence interval” without connecting it back to the data. Without further explanation, exam graders cannot confirm a student’s understanding of statistical significance.
Scientific Foundations of Psychology
Developing Understanding
Psychology is the scientific study of behavior and mental processes. This course examines
the history of psychology and psychological theories, contemporary perspectives on
psychology, and how psychological research is conducted. As scientists, psychologists
collect data and make observations about the ways in which humans and animals behave
and think in order to understand behavior and mental processes. Psychologists use a variety
of research methods and designs to conduct their research. These tools help them develop
psychological theories about behavior and mental processes. To ensure that their results
are valid and reliable, psychologists’ research must adhere to strict ethical and procedural
guidelines. Historical research is the foundation of the field of psychology and has become
the basis for the many subfields within psychology that exist today.

Building Course Skills
1.A  1.B  2
Unit 2 focuses on blending knowledge about physiological processes and psychology to provide better explanations of behavior and mental processes. This course teaches students how biological and anatomical structures play an active role in an individual’s mental and behavioral development.
To demonstrate an understanding of these biological bases of psychology, students should describe the concept or apply it to a scenario.
As students learn to describe this blended physiological and psychological knowledge, they should be able to apply it to behavior and mental processes in other fields of psychology (e.g., memory, learning, development, and social psychology). This approach will help students understand how psychological theories, schools of thought, and perspectives were developed.
Students will also continue to build on their understanding of the appropriate use of research methods and designs from Unit 1.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Students often struggle with knowing which neurotransmitters function with which biological processes and how those functions relate to behavior and mental processes. Teachers can give students opportunities to map the neurotransmitter pathways and describe outcomes in both successful and disrupted transmission.
Students will also benefit from many opportunities to connect psychological processes to an individual’s physiology.
They often struggle to make accurate and complete connections between anatomy and physiology as it relates to behavior and mental processes. If a question asks students to give an explanation, they would need to provide an answer in terms of evidence and/or reasoning.
Biological Bases of Behavior
Developing Understanding
The structures of human biological systems and their functions influence our behavior
and mental processes. Some psychologists study behaviors and mental processes from
a biological perspective. This includes an examination of the influence that the interaction
between human biology and our environment has on behavior and mental processes. This
is a recurring topic throughout the course that will be used to explain many psychological
phenomena. The biological perspective also provides insight into the causes of and
treatments for psychological disorders. There is a complex interaction between a person’s
biology and their behavior and mental processes. Heredity and environment play a role, as do variations in a person’s consciousness.
ESSENTIAL
QUESTIONS §§ How can biology influence our behavior and mental processes?
§§ What happens when a particular neurotransmitter is absent from the body?
§§ How do biological and environmental factors interact to influence our behaviors and mental processes?

a written or electronic sleep log for one to two weeks. Afterward, have them calculate
their data and discuss any dreams they recorded. Follow up by giving them dream
scenarios with an explanation from each dream theory. Students can then write a letter to
the school administration about why school start times should be later for teens.

1.A  1.B  1.C  3
Unit 3 builds on the biological foundation of psychology established in the previous unit. This progress toward understanding the brain, sensory organs, and central nervous system highlights the physiological processes involved in an individual’s perception of their surroundings. Students should be able to describe examples of anatomical structures, physiological processes, and psychological concepts related to sensation and perception.
Understanding the effects of sensation and perception on behavior and mental processes builds on what students learned in Unit 1 about psychological theories and perspectives, particularly their strengths and weaknesses. Students will also increase their understanding of scientific investigation, furthering their understanding of the physiological process of energy transduction as it relates to chemical senses.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Much like Unit 2, the content of this unit requires students to make connections between physiology and psychology. For example, students may be asked to relate a person’s receipt of information in their environment with their perception of that information. Students tend to provide an inadequate amount of detail to demonstrate understanding in response to questions related to anatomy. For example, an inadequate response about the role of the cerebellum would be, “It helps you move.”
This is not enough information, because the parietal lobe also aids in movement.
The response, “It helps you coordinate your movement,” indicates deeper knowledge.
In some cases, when a familiar word appears in a free-response question, students tend to give a definition of the word as their response when more is needed to earn the point.
Sensation and Perception
Developing Understanding
Psychologists study sensation and perception to explain how and why externally gathered
sensations and perceptions impact behaviors and mental processes. Using input from
several anatomical structures, the sensations we perceive process and interpret information
about the environment around us and our place within it. This results in perceptions that
influence how we think and behave. In this way, sensation and perception provide a bridge
between the biological and cognitive perspectives, offering aspects of both for explaining how we think and behave.
ESSENTIAL
QUESTIONS §§ How do we process the information we receive from our environments?
§§ How does our interpretation of the information we receive from the environment influence our behaviors and mental processes?

1.B
This unit integrates knowledge about physiological processes and psychological concepts from Units 2 and 3 within the context of learning processes. Major learning theories are introduced, as well as the experiments that were conducted to refine these theories. This increased understanding of research methods and
design, first introduced in Unit 1, will reinforce the importance of valid and reliable research methods. This is a great place in the course to introduce case studies as a research method. This unit also gives students the opportunity to move from an understanding of the major theories to the research that was conducted to refine them and then to the data analysis involved in explaining the psychological phenomena.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Classical and operant conditioning are learning methods that help explain behavior and mental processes. While these theories share many common attributes and involve similar processes, they are different, and they explain behavior and mental processes differently. Teachers can model these theories with examples that are accessible and interesting to help students recognize the differences and better understand how each theory explains behavior and mental processes. On the AP Exam, students often confuse classical and operant conditioning and describe the incorrect one. Students should be able to describe the principles of classical and/or operant conditioning and explain how they function to alter behavior and mental processes.
Learning
Developing Understanding
Some psychologists focus their study on how humans and other animals learn and how some
experiences can lead to changes in behavior and mental processes. Because the process
of learning requires both physiological and psychological processes to work together, the
two preceding units provide the foundation for this unit. Many psychologists who study learning
focus on observable behaviors and how those behaviors can be changed or reinforced. Other
learning psychologists study how the individual’s observations of other peoples’ behaviors
influence changes in that individual’s mental processes and resulting behaviors.

Cognition, which covers both memory processes and individual differences in intelligence, plays a major role in the field of psychology today. Building on the anatomical structures and biological processes learned in Units 2 and 3, this unit emphasizes the memory processes of encoding, storing, and retrieving information from the brain. Students are moving beyond definitional understanding of psychological concepts and perspectives and are now reasoning systematically.
Students should be able to connect the in-depth presentation of the cognitive perspective to other psychological perspectives introduced in Units 1 and 2.
They will also continue their analysis and interpretation of quantitative data in relation to cognitive research, building understanding of why particular research methods are used for specific types of data collection.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Students tend to have difficulty articulating ideas about thinking and problem solving.
They will often state an accurate idea about cognition but fail to expand on the idea enough to earn full credit for the answer.
Students should be able to demonstrate knowledge of the similarities and differences in short-term and procedural memory and the factors that affect each to achieve success on the AP Exam. Students should also be able to explain how the elements of memory contribute to a person’s behavior.
The ability to demonstrate an understanding of how information is encoded, stored, and retrieved in memory is also crucial. Students should be able to describe the acquisition of language, the factors that facilitate it, and its use in communicating ideas. Additionally, they may have to answer questions about normal curves as well as about positive and negative correlation.
Cognitive Psychology
Developing Understanding
In this unit, knowledge surrounding sensation, perception, and learning provides the
foundation for an understanding of cognition. Cognitive psychologists focus their research
on the complex nature of the brain, particularly the areas of memory processes and
intelligence and the influence of mental processes on behavior. Understanding how this
information is gathered and processed gives insight into how we make sense of and perceive
the world. Some cognitive psychologists attempt to answer how and why cognitive processes
fail despite (or because of) the complexity of our biological structures. Teachers can offer
students opportunities to provide their own explanations for these phenomena. Other
psychologists study intelligence and the reasons for individual differences. This cognitive
perspective offers one way to understand how our thinking impacts our behavior, which
can in turn provide insight into psychological disorders and their treatment.
ESSENTIAL
QUESTIONS §§ What roles do memory and thinking play in our behaviors?
§§ What is intelligence and how can we study it to understand it?

Building Course Skills
1.A  1.B  1.C  3
Building on knowledge from earlier units, students will pull together aspects of physiological, cognitive, psychological, and moral development to understand how behavior and mental processes change over the course of a person’s life. This includes the role of adolescent development and the decline of adults as they age.
Students will reinforce biological, cognitive, and cultural perspectives studied in earlier units while discussing theories of stage development and continuous development.
Students are also introduced to cross sectional research and longitudinal research designs, which build on the research methods learned in Unit 1. Students will further their understanding of analyzing and interpreting data through these new research designs and in relation to the specific context of developmental psychology.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Students should be able to explain physical, intellectual, social, and moral development, along with the development of personality, in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood.
Additionally, they should be able to explain the comparison between stages of development.
A common student error on the AP Exam is failure to provide specific outcomes about how life experience helps or hinders development. Students should provide a thorough explanation of the relationship between life experience and development within the given scenario. Students tend to discuss the stages of development but fail to expand on the concepts to show mastery. It is important to a student’s success on the exam that they write complete thoughts with cogent, accurate information. Teachers can provide students with opportunities to write about development at each stage of life in real-world contexts. Students will also answer questions related to research methods, including validity, ethics, and correct method of study. They may be asked about experimental design and should be prepared to answer questions such as What are the flaws in a research study?
Would this design pass IRB? What is the appropriate method for a research question?
Developmental
Psychology
Developing Understanding
Developmental psychology encompasses the study of the behavior of organisms from
conception to death. In this unit, students will learn to examine the processes that contribute to
behavioral change throughout a person’s life. The major areas of emphasis in the course include
prenatal development, motor development, socialization, cognitive development, adolescence,
and adulthood. Developmental psychologists seek to understand how changes in our biology
and social situations over a lifespan influence our behaviors and mental processes. Development
can be studied from several different perspectives, including biological or cognitive
perspectives. Developmental psychologists may focus on one or more developmental periods
or the entire course of a lifespan, using cross-sectional and longitudinal research methods.

§§ Why don’t psychologists agree?
Building Course Skills
1.A  1.C  2  3
Individual differences in various aspects of personality, motivation, and emotion are the focus of this unit. Students should be comfortable with identifying and explaining how biological structures and physiological processes help explain behavior or mental processes in relation to motivation, emotion, and personality. In addition, students will gain experience evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of psychological theories and perspectives relating to motivation and emotion.
Students should be able to identify theories and perspectives about personality, describe their strengths and weaknesses, and explain how they apply to behavior and mental processes. While learning about the different ways personality can be measured, students will calculate the appropriate statistic for a given data set. Students should also be able to explain how data illustrates the different theories of motivation, emotion, stress, and personality.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Students often confuse what it means to be panicked versus stressed.
Teachers can provide students with case studies and/or real-world opportunities that will help them understand what it means to be stressed and how bodies respond to stress, as opposed to being panicked.
Students should be able to compare the psychological and physiological responses to stress and panic.
Students may struggle with accurately discussing concepts related to personality.
A common mistake is to describe temporary aspects of a personality trait rather than personality characteristics. This can be addressed by providing students with multiple opportunities throughout the course to write about personality, ensuring that they are using terminology correctly and appropriately. Questions about research methodology and ethical research design in regard to this unit’s content will most likely appear on the exam.
Motivation, Emotion, and Personality
Developing Understanding
Psychologists use theory to categorize and explain different personalities. These explanations
have been influenced by the various branches of psychology. Some psychologists study what
motivates us and/or our emotional responses to experiences to understand our individual
differences. Other psychologists seek to understand personality, including why different
personalities exist, how they are developed, and if and how they change. Originating from
the psychodynamic perspective, the study of personality involves consideration of behavior
and mental processes and how they interact to produce an individual’s personality. A full
explanation of personality also involves incorporating humanistic and social-cognitive perspectives from earlier units.

best explains each behavior and why (for example, running a marathon would not be well explained by drive-reduction theory).
2 7.3
Think-Pair-Share
Have students watch the well-known clip “These pretzels are making me thirsty” from the
show Seinfeld (S3E11). In small groups, have them discuss how facial expressions and
intonation convey emotion. Provide them with other scenarios and have them discuss how
different theorists would explain the emotions conveyed in each scenario.
3 7.5
Jigsaw
Select a fictional character familiar to your students. Have them discuss that character’s
personality in terms of the different psychological perspectives. Then divide students
into groups and have each group select their own character and repeat the discussion.
Students can then share with the class or you can use the jigsaw strategy.

This unit provides students with the opportunity to evaluate many of the psychological concepts, theories, and perspectives they learned about in earlier units through the lens of psychological disorders and their treatments. Students will learn how to evaluate biological, psychological, and sociocultural theories in relation to abnormality. They will be introduced to a survey of psychological disorders and dive deeper into some of the more common disorders and their treatment.
Students will conduct valid research, identify ethical flaws, and use appropriate data and data collection processes.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Students often have difficulty using key terms and phrases correctly to answer questions posed as scenarios. Teachers can provide students with opportunities to work with scenarios related to psychological disorders. Students will benefit from examples of real-world situations in which particular disorders may be exacerbated or subdued. Students should be able to give the general characteristics and common treatments of the disorder. They should also be able to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each treatment and explain why it is deemed appropriate.
Students often have difficulty articulating which psychological perspectives are associated with which treatments. When the scenarios involve a certain type of research, students should be expected to define the method and write accurately about validity, ethics, and outcome. Students may encounter questions about research methodology in clinical trials on the exam.
They should be able answer questions about the ethics of a research plan, correct modality, and research design.
Clinical Psychology
Developing Understanding
Psychologists who study psychological disorders, along with practitioners who treat
disorders, often utilize a particular theoretical perspective. Each perspective attempts to
explain the origin of a disorder and/or determine the best method for treatment. These
explanations and treatments build on the history, theories, and perspectives introduced in
the first two units as well as on cognitive psychology in particular. Through observing behavior
and engaging in discussion that illuminates a client’s thought process, psychologists gather
information and draw conclusions. For some psychologists, a single perspective cannot fully
explain a disorder. This leads them to more integrated perspectives to understand and treat psychological disorders.
ESSENTIAL
QUESTIONS §§ Why is psychological perspective necessary in the treatment of disorders?
§§ How are psychological disorders treated?

As the course nears completion, students should be able to describe and explain behavior and mental processes within the context of social psychology. As they learn new social psychology theories, students will build on their knowledge of psychological theories in general. These theories specifically build on the biological, cognitive, and sociocultural theories discussed in earlier units. The history of social psychology is filled with studies that are no longer considered ethical. Through these missteps, students will learn how to conduct valid research, identify ethical flaws, and use appropriate data and data collection processes.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Students often have difficulty using social psychology key terms and phrases correctly to answer questions posed as scenarios.
Common examples of interchanged behaviors include conformity, obedience, and compliance. Students often struggle to provide the depth or breadth required to show mastery of the content. Teacher can provide opportunities for students to work with scenarios related to social settings and interactions. Students should give general characteristics of the behaviors associated with interactions and common responses to social stimuli. When the scenarios involve a certain type of research, students should be expected to define the method and write accurately about validity, ethics, and outcome.
Social Psychology
Developing Understanding
In this final unit, psychological concepts and theoretical perspectives are pulled together
from throughout the course. Social psychology is the study of how other people and groups
influence behavior and mental processes as well as how behavior and mental processes
influence our experiences in social situations. Social psychology also involves the study
of how our perceptions of social situations impact how we interact with others and how
others interact with us. Social psychologists may focus on one aspect of social situations
or interactions and may do so from a variety of theoretical perspectives, including other integrative perspectives.

Selecting and Using
Course Materials
In addition to using a textbook that will cover the
required course content, students should also examine
primary source material in different and varied forms as well as other types of scientific scholarship.
Textbooks
Any textbook used in the course should be written at the college level and encourage a conceptual
understanding of psychology. The ideal textbook will
use sufficient examples and approaches that enable
students to make connections across different domains within psychology and also between psychology and other social and natural sciences.
AP Central has a list of textbook examples that meet the resource requirements.
Primary Sources
While publishers are increasingly including primary
source material in textbooks, introducing students to a
wide variety of source material provides opportunities
to analyze data from diverse sources. These sources should include data tables, charts, graphs, and
diagrams. Ancillary materials and online resources that accompany most recently published textbooks may also provide quality materials to supplement
classroom instruction. If a textbook does not provide
ample primary sources, or its sources are too brief, it can be supplemented with journal articles and/
or abstracts from scientific literature related to particular topic areas.

Instructional Strategies
The AP Psychology course framework outlines the concepts and skills students
must master in order to be successful on the AP Exam. To address those concepts
and skills effectively, it helps to incorporate a variety of instructional approaches
into daily lessons and activities. The following table presents strategies that can help
students apply their understanding of course concepts.
Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Ask the Expert (or Students as
Experts)
Students are assigned as “experts” on concepts they have mastered;
groups rotate through the expert stations to learn about concepts they have not yet mastered.
Provides opportunities for students to share their knowledge and learn from one another.
Assign students as “experts” on psychological disorders. Have them rotate through stations in groups, working with the station expert to complete a series of questions on the topic.
Construct an
Argument
Students use reasoning to present assumptions about scenarios, support conjectures with scientifically relevant and accurate data, and provide a logical progression of ideas leading to a conclusion that makes sense.
Helps develop the process of evaluating scientific information, developing reasoning skills and enhancing communication skills in supporting conjectures and conclusions.
Present students with a written or visual scenario of the results of a research study. Then have them work together to draw conclusions about the study and support their conclusions with data by having each student or group of students add a sentence to the conclusion. Once the conclusion is complete, read the conclusion (or show it on a screen) and then facilitate a class discussion.
Debate
Engaging in an informal or formal argumentation of an issue.
Provides students with an opportunity to collect and orally present evidence supporting the affirmative and negative arguments of a proposition or an issue.
When learning about developmental psychology, have students debate a situation in a given scenario from the perspective of the key contributors to the field.
Fishbowl
Some students form an inner circle and model appropriate discussion techniques while an outer circle of students listens, responds, and evaluates.
Provides students with an opportunity to engage in a formal discussion and to experience the roles of both participant and active listener;
students also have the responsibility of supporting their opinions and responses using specific evidence.
Divide students into two groups and ask them to form two concentric circles. The inner circle explains psychological disorders to the students in the outer circle. The outer circle explains treatments of psychological disorders to students in the inner circle.

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Graph and Switch
Generate a graph to represent data and then switch papers to review each other’s representations.
Allows students to practice evaluating different representations of data as they give and receive feedback on each other’s work.
Given an unlabeled graph, have students label the independent and dependent variables and other required parts of the graph.
Graphic
Organizer
Representing ideas and information visually (e.g., pictures, tables, graphs, lists, models,
Venn diagrams, flowcharts, cluster maps, concept maps, concept webs) for the organization and/or interpretation of information.
Provides a visual system for organizing multiple ideas, details, and/or textual support to facilitate increased comprehension and discussion.
Use graphic organizers to help students understand research methods. Students can draw flowcharts to outline the steps of a research study.
Index Card
Summaries/
Questions
Periodically, distribute index cards and ask students to write on both sides, with these
instructions: (Side 1)
Based on our study of (unit topic), list a big idea that you understand and word it as a summary statement. (Side 2)
Identify something about (unit topic) that you do not yet fully understand and word it as a statement or question.
Functions as a formative assessment technique.
At the beginning or end of class, show students an image of a normal distribution. On one side of an index card, have students summarize what the graph is showing and why it is important.
On the other side of the card, have them write a question about the topic. Collect the cards and read through them, noticing any trends in student responses. Address all questions that day (if done at the beginning of class) or the next day (if given at the end of class).
Jigsaw
Reading different texts or passages from a single text, students take on the role of “experts”; sharing information from that reading, students share with a specific group and then return to their initial group to share their new knowledge.
Allows students to summarize and present information to others in a way that facilitates an understanding of a text (or multiple texts) without having each student read the text in its entirety.
Use this strategy to help students learn about psychological disorders.
Divide students into groups and assign each group a disorder. Have them learn about their disorder
in detail: cause, symptoms, consequences, and treatments.
Once students are experts, divide them into groups so that there is one student from each area of expertise in a group. Have each student share their expertise with their new group.
Manipulatives
Using a kinesthetic approach to making meaning in which students are asked to assemble parts of a whole as a way of understanding a concept.
Provides a tactile and visual means of examining a concept in order to encourage multiple ways of understanding the concept.
Have students use clay to model the brain or the neuron, using different colors to indicate different parts of the organ/cell.

Purpose
Example
Misconception
Check
Present students with common or predictable misconceptions about a designated concept, principle, or process. Ask them whether they agree or disagree and to explain why. The misconception check can also be presented in the form of a multiple-choice or true-false quiz.
Functions as a formative assessment technique.
Provide students with a statement on the board or on paper, such as, “Culture influences intelligence.”
Ask them if the statement is true or false and to explain their reasoning. Address any misconceptions according to the answers they give.
One-Minute
Essay
A one-minute essay question (or a one-minute question) is a focused question with a specific goal that can, in fact, be answered within a minute or two.
Functions as a formative assessment technique.
Give students one minute to respond to a prompt such as, “Describe strategies to improve memory.” Once students have completed their essay, have them share their answers; then facilitate a class discussion.
Quickwrite
Writing for a short, specific amount of time about a designated topic related to a text.
Allows students to generate multiple ideas in a quick fashion that could be turned into longer pieces of writing at a later time (may be considered as part of the drafting process).
Prior to teaching about motivation, ask students to take a few minutes to explain why they think motivation is important. At the conclusion of the lesson, have them revisit their answer and revise it to reflect what they learned.
Think-Pair-
Share
Considering and thinking about a topic or question and then writing what has been learned; pairing with a peer or a small group to share ideas; sharing ideas and discussion with a larger group.
Allows students to construct meaning about a topic or question; to test thinking in relation to the ideas of others; to prepare for a discussion with a larger group.
When teaching about behaviors, ask students to reflect on their current learning with the following
prompt: “Explain how each behavior can be explained by the different psychological perspectives.” Then have them turn to a neighbor and share their answer. After two to three minutes of sharing, engage the class in a discussion to ensure that students are building the necessary foundational understandings.

Developing Course Skills
Throughout the course, students will develop skills that are fundamental to the
discipline of psychology. Students will benefit from multiple opportunities to develop these skills in a scaffolded manner.
The tables on the pages that follow look at each skill category and provide examples
of tasks for each skill, along with sample activities and strategies for incorporating that skill into the course.

Skill Category 1: Define, explain, and apply concepts, behavior, theories, and perspectives
Psychological theories and perspectives are ways of
thinking about psychological concepts, principles, and processes. They are often developed from scientific research to help explain behavior and mental processes. Studying these theories and perspectives in the context of research and their
related concepts, principles, and processes can help
students distinguish between the various theories and
perspectives. These theories and perspectives should be revisited throughout the course at appropriate times. Teachers can include examples that are accessible and interesting to students.
Explanation involves more than simply identifying or
describing a psychological principle, process, concept,
theory, or perspective; it requires discussion of how
and/or why the concept, theory, or perspective applies
to the situation or context. Students should practice explaining how a concept, theory, or perspective
applies in a variety of contexts using their knowledge to accurately explain the application.

Skill Category 2: Analyze and interpret quantitative data
Data is important because of the information it conveys about psychological concepts, theories, and perspectives. To understand the information conveyed, students should practice describing the
data and then identifying and describing the patterns
and trends in the data. These patterns and trends can
make the data meaningful for the researcher and lead to the discovery and/or development of concepts, theories, and perspectives.
Researchers use data to understand behavior and mental processes. Students should practice making connections between given data and different psychological principles, processes, concepts,
theories, and perspectives. Connecting the collection
and construction of data to the analysis of data helps
students understand the implications of the data and
its relationship to psychological concepts, theories, and perspectives.
The appropriate statistic is determined by a number
of factors, including the question being researched,
the research method and design being used, and the
information the researcher is seeking. Students should
practice identifying the most appropriate descriptive
statistic (e.g., mean, median, mode) for a given data set
based on the research question, method, and design.
They should also practice calculating each of the required descriptive statistics.
Skill Category 2: Data Analysis
Key Tasks
Sample Activity
Instructional
Strategies §§ Analyze the results of a research study.
§§ Connect the results of a research study to a psychological principle, process, concept, theory, or perspective.
§§ Use statistics to analyze data.
Give students a data table or graph from a research study of interest to them in the context of the current unit. First, ask them to identify specific data points and then have them describe the data presented in a graph, chart, or table. They should then be able to describe patterns and trends in the data. Using the data set, have them calculate the mean and identify the median and the mode. Students should then be able to describe a psychological principle, process, concept, theory, or perspective illustrated by the data.

Skill Category 3: Analyze psychological research studies
In addition to the research question asked, the research method, design, and/or measure determines what
conclusions can be drawn from data. Students should
practice identifying the types of conclusions (e.g.,
correlation, causation) that can be drawn from each
type of research method, design, and measure. They
should also practice identifying possible research
methods, designs, and measures based on conclusions.
Research design flaws can impact the data collected
and the conclusions a researcher can draw. In order to
identify a research design flaw, students should know
the different research methods and designs and the types of conclusions that can be drawn from each.
They should then compare the conclusions of a given
researcher with their method and design to determine if there are flaws and, if so, what they are.
Once students identify a research design flaw, they
should be able to explain why it is a flaw in order to
explain how it can be corrected. To do this, they will rely
on their knowledge about methods and designs and the conclusions one can draw from them.
Skill Category 3: Scientific Investigation
Key Tasks
Sample Activity
Instructional
Strategies §§ Identify the research method or design used.
§§ Describe ethical and/or research design flaws.
§§ Describe the appropriate use of a research method or design.
§§ Explain how ethical and/or research design flaws can be corrected.
§§ Explain why a research method or design is appropriate.
§§ Describe implications or limitations of the research.
§§ Explain why conclusions are or are not appropriate based on the method and/or design.
Have students evaluate a research study (select one of interest to your students) by identifying the hypothesis, methods, and results of the study. Then have them identify the conclusions and any alternative explanations. Lastly, have them describe how the design of the research plan can be improved.

Section II: Free-Response
The following are examples of the free-response questions found on the exam.
QUESTION 1: CONCEPT APPLICATION
Todd needs to visit his pediatrician, Dr. Lazarus, for his annual checkup. Todd is
afraid to go to see Dr. Lazarus, because he has received shots in her office before.
Todd’s mother is ambivalent about bringing Todd to see Dr. Lazarus, because she
knows he does not like it, but she brings him anyway. In order to entice Todd to go
see the doctor, Todd’s mother first asks Todd if he wants to go for a ride in the car.
After he says yes, she asks him if he wants to go to the park that is near the doctor’s
office. Finally, she asks Todd if he would be good while they went to the doctor. Todd
reluctantly agrees. Todd is cooperative while in the office, so Dr. Lazarus gives him a lollipop after the visit.

QUESTION 2: RESEARCH DESIGN
A researcher was interested in studying whether participants who were angry would
become less angry if they had a chance to release their anger. At 10:00 in the morning,
6 students met individually with a confederate named Steve. They were each asked to
write an essay, which Steve evaluated. He told each student, “This is the worst essay
I ever read.” They were then asked to sit in a room quietly for 10 minutes. At 1:00 in
the afternoon, a second group of 6 students each wrote an essay, and Steve once again
said the essays were the worst he had ever read. This second group was then asked to
punch a punching bag. After either sitting quietly or punching the punching bag, the
students were given the opportunity to blast a horn when Steve entered the room. The
researcher operationally defined anger as the length of time that the students blasted the
horn. The researcher assumed students who were given an opportunity to punch the
punching bag would be less likely to blast the horn in Steve’s presence. The table below
indicates how long, in seconds, each subject blasted the horn when Steve was present.
Assume all differences are significant.

General Scoring Notes
1.	 Answers should be presented in sentences cogent enough for the meaning of
the response to come through. Spelling and grammatical mistakes do not reduce
the score of a response, but spelling must be close enough that the reader is convinced of the word.
2.	 Do not score any notes made on the question section of the booklet. Score only
what has been written in the blanks provided in the booklet.
3.	 Definitions alone are not acceptable, but they may be used to enhance the application.
4.	 Within a point, a student will not be penalized for misinformation unless it directly
contradicts correct information that otherwise would have scored a point. A correct
application with an incorrect definition is not considered a direct contradiction and will still earn the point.
5.	 Rubric examples provided for each point are not exhaustive.
6.	 Responses that simply repeat the terms from the question are not acceptable.
7.	 A response can earn a point only if it clearly conveys what part of the question
is being answered. It may be possible to infer what part of the question is being
answered if it is consistent with the order of the question.

Part B
All responses in Part B must explain, describe, or calculate data in respect to the research study conducted in the question.
Catharsis
One point for a response that explains that students were supposed to experience the release of
strong negative feelings by punching the punching bag.
Acceptable explanations include:
•	 The researcher thought by punching the bag, the students would experience catharsis and release their negative energy towards Steve.
•	 The researcher got the students angry at Steve. The researcher thought those students that got
to experience catharsis by punching the bag would have less anger towards Steve.
1 point
1.B
Hypothesis
One point for a response that explains that the researcher’s hypothesis was not supported, as
those students who punched the bag actually ended up honking the horn at Steve for longer periods of time.
Acceptable explanations include:
•	 The hypothesis was not supported. Those students who were given the opportunity to experience
catharsis actually ended up angrier at Steve (which you can see because they blew the horn longer) in the end.
•	 The researcher was incorrect. Students who got to take out their anger on the bag did the
opposite of what the researcher thought and blasted the horn in Steve’s face for a longer period of time than those who sat quietly.
1 point 2
Ethical Flaws
One point for a response that describes the need for debriefing the students, because the researcher used deception.
Acceptable descriptions include:
•	 It appears as if the researcher never debriefed the students. He used deception, so ethically he should debrief them.
•	 This scenario never describes any sort of debriefing. The students were likely upset after Steve
told them their essay was horrible. The researcher needs to debrief the students and explain to them the true reason for the study.” 1 point 3
Mean
One point for calculating the mean to be 35.
Unacceptable response:
Just identification of the median or the mode.
1 point 3
Total for question 2 7 points
