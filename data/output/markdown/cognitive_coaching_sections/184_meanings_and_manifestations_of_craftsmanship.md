## Meanings and Manifestations of Craftsmanship

Excellence in performance is the soul of craftsmanship. People working toward craftsmanship strive for precision. They seek perfection, elegance, refinement, and specificity. They generate and hold clear visions and goals. They monitor progress toward those goals. Achievement of these goals generates an increase in dopamine, the brain's reward system. The holonomous person who is both flexible and craftsman-like attends to the big picture and to details. In one setting, a holonomous teacher may be excruciatingly detailed. In another setting, that teacher might be artfully vague. For example, when giving classroom instructions, the teacher may give detailed instructions ('Fold your papers in half and then half again . . .') whereas when seeking cooperation from a parent, the teacher may be deliberately vague: 'Because we both want Rafael to succeed . . . .'
