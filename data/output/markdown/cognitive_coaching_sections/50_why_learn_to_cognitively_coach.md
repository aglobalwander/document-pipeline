## WHY LEARN TO COGNITIVELY COACH?

Children grow into the intellectual life around them.

-Lev Vygotsky

The answer to this question is fairly simple and direct: to enhance student learning! Enhanced student learning, however, depends on the expertise of the teacher (Hattie 2003). The expertise of the teacher, however, depends largely on the school community in which that teacher operates (Hargreaves and Fullan 2012). And the power and effectiveness of the school community depend largely on the skills and dispositions of its educational leaders (Leithwood and Seashore-Lewis 2011). Cognitive Coaches, therefore, dedicate themselves to the cascading effects of enhancing others, who, in turn, ultimately produce maximum growth in students' acquisition of desired outcomes.
