About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking
AP courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and
AP Exams are developed and scored by college faculty
and experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges
and universities in the United States grant credit,
advanced placement, or both on the basis of successful
AP Exam scores; more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the
content and science practices that are the focus of the corresponding college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also organizes the content and
science practices into a series of units that represent
a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks
and that many AP teachers have told us they follow in
order to focus their instruction. The intention of this
publication is to respect teachers’ time and expertise
by providing a roadmap that they can modify and adapt
to their local priorities and preferences. Moreover, by
organizing the AP course content and science practices
into units, the AP Program is able to provide teachers and students with free formative assessments—
Personal Progress Checks—that teachers can assign throughout the year to measure student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop science practices.
Enrolling Students:
Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically
challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to equitable preparation and
access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses:
The AP Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle that each school implements its own curriculum that will enable students to develop the content
understandings and science practices described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP courses
must participate in the AP Course Audit, a process through which AP teachers’ course materials are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.

﻿ V.1 | 1
AP Physics 1: Algebra-Based Course and Exam Description

=== Page 9 ===
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the
AP teacher and the school principal (or designated
administrator) to confirm awareness and understanding
of the curricular and resource requirements. A syllabus
or course outline, detailing how course requirements
are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and science practices that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The
AP Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor;
all AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision,
piloting, and analysis to ensure that questions are
accurate, fair, and valid and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges) and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development,
College Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher
education institutions. This feedback is carefully
considered to ensure that AP courses and exams are
able to provide students with a college-level learning
experience and the opportunity to demonstrate their
qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam
development process, relies on the expertise of both
AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice
questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course performance
assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands
of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are
scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion
is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained,
and their work is monitored throughout the Reading
for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief
Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers
in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of
the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a curve.
Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which means that
every student who meets the criteria for an AP score of
2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no matter how many
students that is. The criteria for the number of points
students must earn on the AP Exam to receive scores
of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently
validates for credit and placement purposes—include:
§§ The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
§§ The number of points researchers have found to be predictive that an AP student will succeed when placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
§§ Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP scores as follows:
AP Score

teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
§§ Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure
to the quality and depth of the responses from the entire pool of AP Exam takers and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
§§ Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
§§ Score from home: AP Readers have online distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects. Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
§§ Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs):
AP Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.
How to Apply
Visit collegeboard.org/apreading for eligibility
requirements and to start the application process.
While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for
scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and universities.
To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/placement
policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org /creditpolicies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score the free-response sections of the AP Exams.
Ninety-eight percent of surveyed educators who took
part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an
AP Reader, including opportunities to:

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and science practices, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide
suggests a sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds skill instruction across units, organizes
content into topics, and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and science
practices through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect
answers, and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal
Progress Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate
teacher effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds
for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
science practices that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress
over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to
use in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course topics and science
practices, create customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable
students to practice and get feedback on each question.
*To report misuses, please call, 877-274-6474 (International: +1-212-632-1781).

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
§§ Teachers and students sign in to, or create, their College Board accounts.
§§ Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
§§ Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
§§ Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP coordinator.
§§ Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and
AP coordinators to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following
additional benefits:
§§ Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
§§ Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
§§ Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student
pack. The AP ID connects student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
§§ Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

§§ Review the overview at the start of each unit guide to identify essential questions,
conceptual understandings, and science practices for each unit.
§§ Use the Unit at a Glance table to identify related topics that build toward a common
understanding, and then plan appropriate pacing for students.
§§ Identify useful strategies in the Instructional Approaches section to help teach the concepts and science practices.
Teach
When teaching, supporting resources can be used to build students’ conceptual understanding and mastery of science practices.
§§ Use the topic pages in the unit guides to identify the required content.
§§ Integrate the content with a skill, considering any appropriate scaffolding.
§§ Employ any of the instructional strategies previously identified.
§§ Use the available resources on the topic pages to bring a variety of assets into the classroom.
Assess
Teachers can measure student understanding of the content and science practices covered
in the unit and provide actionable feedback to students.
§§ At the end of each unit, use AP Classroom to assign students the online Personal Progress
Checks, as homework or as an in-class task.
§§ Provide question-level feedback to students through answer rationales; provide unit- and
skill-level feedback using the progress dashboard.
§§ Create additional practice opportunities using the AP Question Bank and assign them through AP Classroom.

About the
AP Physics 1 Course
AP Physics 1 is an algebra-based, introductory college-level physics course. Students
cultivate their understanding of physics through inquiry-based investigations as they explore
these topics: kinematics, dynamics, circular motion and gravitation, energy, momentum,
simple harmonic motion, torque and rotational motion, electric charge and electric force, DC circuits, and mechanical waves and sound.
College Course Equivalent
AP Physics 1 is a full-year course that is the equivalent of a first-semester introductory college course in algebra-based physics.
Prerequisites
There are no prerequisite courses. Students should have completed Geometry and be
concurrently taking Algebra II or an equivalent course. Although the Physics 1 course
includes basic use of trigonometric functions, this understanding can be gained either in the
concurrent math course or in the AP Physics 1 course itself.
Laboratory Requirement
This course requires that twenty-five percent of instructional time will be spent in hands-on
laboratory work, with an emphasis on inquiry-based investigations that provide students
with opportunities to demonstrate the foundational physics principles and apply the science practices.
Inquiry-based laboratory experiences support the AP Physics 1 course and AP Course
Audit curricular requirements by providing opportunities for students to engage in the seven
science practices as they design plans for experiments, make predictions, collect and analyze
data, apply mathematical routines, develop explanations, and communicate about their work.
Colleges may require students to present their laboratory materials from AP science courses
before granting college credit for laboratory work, so students should be encouraged to retain
their laboratory notebooks, reports, and other materials.

Introduction
The AP Physics 1 course outlined in this framework reflects a commitment
to what physics teachers, professors, and researchers have agreed is the
main goal of a college-level physics course: to help students develop a
deep understanding of the foundational principles that shape classical
mechanics. By confronting complex physical situations or scenarios, the
course is designed to enable students to develop the ability to reason about
physical phenomena using important science practices, such as explaining
relationships, applying and justifying the use of mathematical routines,
designing experiments, analyzing data, and making connections across multiple topics within the course.
To foster this deeper level of learning, the AP Physics 1 course defines concepts, science practices, and
understandings required by representative colleges and universities for granting college credit and placement.
Students will practice reasoning skills used by physicists by discussing and debating, with peers, the physical
phenomena investigated in class, as well as by designing and conducting inquiry-based laboratory investigations to
solve problems through first-hand observations, data collection, analysis, and interpretation.
This document is not a complete curriculum. Teachers create their own local curriculum by selecting, for each
concept, content that enables students to explore the course learning objectives and meets state or local
requirements. The result is a course that prepares students for college credit and placement.

Course Framework
Components
Overview
This course framework provides a clear and detailed description of the course
requirements necessary for student success. The framework specifies what
students must know, be able to do, and understand to qualify for college credit or placement.
The course framework includes two essential components:
1   SCIENCE PRACTICES
The science practices are central to the study and practice of physics.
Students should develop and apply the described practices on a regular basis over the span of the course.
2   COURSE CONTENT
The course content is organized into commonly taught units of study that
provide a suggested sequence for the course and detail required content
and conceptual understandings that colleges and universities typically
expect students to master to qualify for college credit and/or placement.
This content is grounded in big ideas, which are cross-cutting concepts
that build conceptual understanding and spiral throughout the course.

Course
Content
Based on the Understanding by Design® (Wiggins and McTighe) model, this course
framework provides a clear and detailed description of the course requirements
necessary for student success. The framework specifies what students must know,
be able to do, and understand, with a focus on six big ideas that encompass core
principles, theories, and processes of physics. The framework also encourages
instruction that prepares students to make connections across domains through
a broader way of thinking about the physical world.
Big Ideas
The big ideas serve as the foundation of the course and allow students to create
meaningful connections among concepts. They are often abstract concepts or themes
that become threads that run throughout the course. Revisiting the big ideas and
applying them in a variety of contexts allows students to develop deeper conceptual
understanding. Below are the big ideas of the course and a brief description of each.
2
BIG IDEA 1: SYSTEMS (SYS)
Objects and systems have properties such as mass and charge. Systems may have internal structure.
BIG IDEA 2: FIELDS (FLD)
Fields existing in space can be used to explain interactions.
BIG IDEA 3: FORCE INTERACTIONS (INT)
The interactions of an object with other objects can be described by forces.
BIG IDEA 4: CHANGE (CHA)
Interactions between systems can result in changes in those systems.
BIG IDEA 5: CONSERVATION (CON)
Changes that occur as a result of interactions are constrained by conservation laws.

Unit
Guides
Introduction
Designed with input from the community of AP Physics 1 educators, the
unit guides offer teachers helpful guidance in building students’ skills and
knowledge. The suggested sequence was identified through a thorough
analysis of the syllabi of highly effective AP teachers and the organization of typical college textbooks.
This unit structure respects new AP teachers’ time by providing one
possible sequence they can adopt or modify rather than having to
build from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units enable the
AP Program to provide interested teachers with formative assessments—
the Personal Progress Checks—that they can assign their students at
the end of each unit to gauge progress toward success on the AP Exam.
However, experienced AP teachers who are satisfied with their current
course organization and exam results should feel no pressure to adopt
these units, which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

Using the Unit Guides
UNIT OPENERS
The Unit Overview contextualizes and situates the key content of
the unit within the scope of the course. It also describes specific
aspects of the science practices that are appropriate to focus on in that unit.
Big ideas serve as the foundation of the course and develop
understanding as they spiral throughout the course. The
essential questions are thought-provoking questions that motivate students and inspire inquiry.
Preparing for the AP Exam provides helpful tips and common
student misunderstandings identified from prior exam data.
BIG IDEA 3
Force Interactions INT § How can the motion of objects be predicted and/or explained?
§ Can equations be used to answer questions regardless of the questions’ specificity?
§ How can the idea of frames of reference allow two people to tell the truth yet have conflicting reports?
BIG IDEA 4
Change CHA § How can we use models to help us understand motion?
§ Why is the general rule for stopping your car “when you double your speed, you must give yourself four times as much distance to stop?”
Kinematics
Unit Overview
The world is in a constant state of motion. To understand the world, students must first
understand movement. Unit 1 introduces students to the study of motion and serves as a
foundation for all of AP Physics 1 by beginning to explore the complex idea of acceleration and
showing them how representations can be used to model and analyze scientific information
as it relates to the motion of objects. By studying kinematics, students will learn to represent
motion—both uniform and accelerating—in narrative, graphical, and/or mathematical forms
and from different frames of reference. These representations will help students analyze the
specific motion of objects and systems while also dispelling some common misconceptions
they may have about motion, such as exclusively using negative acceleration to describe
an object slowing down. Additionally, students will have the opportunity to go beyond their
traditional understanding of mathematics. Instead of solving equations, students will use them
to support their reasoning and tighten their grasp on the laws of physics. Lastly, students will
begin making predictions about motion and justifying claims with evidence by exploring the
relationships between the physical quantities of acceleration, velocity, position, and time. This
is an important starting point for students, as these fundamental science practices will spiral
throughout the course and appear in multiple units.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Physics 1 Exam, there is an experimental design question in the free-response
section that is worth 12 points. Students must be able to justify their selection of the kind of
data needed to answer the question and then design a plan to collect that data.
When presented with an experimental design question, students often do not know where to
start. Students should be given scaffolded opportunities to determine the appropriate data
needed to answer a scientific question. To create laboratory experiments for students who
struggle with identifying the data needed to answer a particular question, please refer to the learning objectives linked to this unit.

3.A.1.3
Analyze experimental data describing the motion of an object and be able to express the results of the analysis using narrative, mathematical, and graphical representations. [SP 5.1]
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
3.A.1
An observer in a reference frame can describe the motion of an object using such quantities as position, displacement, distance, velocity, speed, and acceleration.
a.	 Displacement, velocity, and acceleration are all vector quantities.
b.	 Displacement is change in position. Velocity is the rate of change of position with time. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with time. Changes in each property are expressed by subtracting initial values from final values.
Relevant Equations:

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE e.	 In inertial reference frames, forces are detected by their influence on the motion (specifically the velocity) of an object. So force, like velocity, is a vector quantity.
A force vector has magnitude and direction.
When multiple forces are exerted on an object, the vector sum of these forces, referred to as the net force, causes a change in the motion of the object. The acceleration of the object is proportional to the net force.
f.	 The kinematic equations only apply to constant acceleration situations. Circular motion and projectile motion are both included. Circular motion is further covered in Unit 3. The three kinematic equations describing linear motion with constant acceleration in one and two dimensions are 0 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 1 2 2 ( ) x x x x x x x x v v a t x x v t a t v v a x x = + = + + = + − g.

This also includes situations where there is both a radial and tangential acceleration for an object moving in a circular path.
Relevant Equation:

For uniform circular motion of radius r, v is proportional to omega, ω (for a given r), and proportional to r (for a given omega, ω). Given a radius r and a period of rotation T, students derive and apply v = (2πr)/T.

Dynamics
Unit Overview
In Unit 2, students are introduced to the term force, which is the interaction of an object with
another object. Part of the larger study of dynamics, forces are used as the lens through
which students analyze and come to understand a variety of physical phenomena. This
is accomplished by revisiting and building upon the representations presented in Unit 1,
specifically the introduction to the free-body diagram. Translation, however, is key in this
unit: Students must be able to portray the same object–force interactions through different
graphs, diagrams, and mathematical relationships. Students will continue to make meaning
from models and representations that will help them further analyze systems, the interactions
between systems, and how these interactions result in change.
Alongside mastering the use of specific force equations, Unit 2 also encourages students
to derive new expressions from fundamental principles to help them make predictions in
unfamiliar, applied contexts. The skill of making predictions will be nurtured throughout the
course to help students craft sound scientific arguments.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The AP Physics 1 Exam requires students to be able to re-express key elements of natural
phenomena across multiple representations in the domain. This skill appears in the
Qualitative/Quantitative Translation (QQT), a long free-response question that requires
students to go between words and mathematics in describing and analyzing a situation.
A QQT question might ask students to work with multiple representations or to evaluate another
student’s words or representations. Representations include mathematical equations,
narrative descriptions, graphs, diagrams, and data tables.
Students who have primarily been exposed to numerical problem solving often struggle with
a QQT question because it requires students to have a more conceptual understanding
of both content and representations. Opportunities to translate between different
representations, including equations, diagrams, graphs, and written descriptions, will help students prepare for the QQT question.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples
below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways
that they approach teaching some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional
Approaches section beginning on p. 139 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Unit Planning Notes
Use the space below to plan your approach to the unit.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 2.1
Changing Representations
Have students consider an accelerating two-object system from everyday life (e.g., person
pushes a shopping cart, car pulls a trailer). Have them draw the forces on one object,
then on the other, and then the external forces acting on the two-object system.
2 2.4
Desktop Experiment Task
Have students measure the coefficient of static friction of their shoe on a wood plank or
metal track. Level 1: Use a spring scale. Level 2: Use a pulley, a spring, a toy bucket, and an electronic balance. Level 3: Use a protractor.
3 2.5
Desktop Experiment Task
Give students a yo-yo, a low mass, low friction pulley, 50 paper clips, and a scale. Have
them find the acceleration of the falling, unrolling yo-yo and then determine the mass of
the paper clips to attach to the free end of the string so that the paper clips stay at rest
even as the yo-yo falls and the string passes over the pulley.
4 2.6
Working Backward
Student A writes a Newton’s second law equation either with symbols or plugged-in numbers
including units. Student B must then describe a situation that the equation applies to, including
the object’s velocity direction and how velocity is changing, a diagram, and a free-body diagram.
5 2.7
Troubleshooting
Students take some force-related problem from the homework or textbook (one that
requires setting up Newton’s second law and maybe more). Students write out a detailed
solution that has exactly one mistake in it (not a calculation error). Post everyone’s
problems/ solutions, and then ask students to identify everyone else’s errors. The last student to have his or her error found wins.

b.	 Some elementary particles are fundamental particles, (e.g., electrons). Protons and neutrons are composed of fundamental particles (i.e., quarks) and might be treated as either systems or objects, depending on the question being addressed.
c.	 The electric charges on neutrons and protons result from their quark compositions.
1.A.5
Systems have properties that are determined by the properties and interactions of their constituent atomic and molecular substructures. In AP Physics, when the properties of the constituent parts are not important in modeling the behavior of the macroscopic system, the system itself may be referred to as an object.

Unit Overview
In Unit 3, students will continue to enhance their understanding of the physical world using
models and representations to create a more complete and complex model of motion,
particularly as it relates to gravitational mass and inertial mass. Again, translation and
connections are essential—students must be able to use content and science practices from
the previous two units and apply them in different ways.
While it’s essential that students are able to calculate numerical answers to questions,
it is more important that they can combine mathematical representations to make new
representations that more accurately describe natural phenomena. For example, students
should be comfortable combining equations for uniform circular motion with gravitational
equations to describe the circular path of a satellite circling a planet.
It is also vital that students are given opportunities to think about and discuss the impact that
changes or modifications have on physical scenarios. For example, students should be able
to use mathematical and graphical representations to determine how doubling the distance
of a satellite from a planet will change the period of orbit and then justify their answer with
evidence and reasoning. Specific preconceptions will be addressed in this unit, such as the
idea of a centrifugal force. Students will also have opportunities to wrestle with the idea of
field models, which will be expanded upon in Unit 8.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Students will be asked to give a paragraph-length response to demonstrate their ability to
communicate their understanding of a physical situation in a reasoned, expository analysis.
For full credit, the response should be a coherent, organized, and sequential description of the
analysis of a situation that draws from evidence, cites physical principles, and clearly presents
the student’s thinking. Full credit may not be earned if the response contains any of the
following: principles not presented in a logical order, lengthy digressions within an argument,
or a lack of linking prose between equations or diagrams.
Students will also be asked to explain phenomena based on evidence produced through
scientific practices while using mathematical routines as evidence for claims. Students who
are weak mathematically will need significant scaffolding to help them develop the conceptual
mathematical understanding necessary to succeed on the AP Physics 1 Exam.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples
below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways
that they approach teaching some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional
Approaches section beginning on p. 139 for more examples of activities and strategies.

Topic
Sample Activity 1 3.3
Desktop Experiment Task
Have students use the “My Solar System” PhET applet to create circular orbits of varying
radii around the central star and record radius, period, and planet mass for various trials.
Next, have them calculate the speed using v = 2πr/T and force using F = mv2/r. Using the
data, students show that gravitational force is directly proportional to mass and inversely proportional to radius.
2 3.6
Construct an Argument
Ask students to consider two identical objects moving in circles (or parts of circles) of different
radii. Ask them to think of a situation where the object with the smaller radius has a greater net
force and another situation where the object with the larger radius has a greater net force.
3 3.7
Changing Representations
Describe something a driver could be doing in a car (e.g., “turning the steering wheel to the
right while pressing the brake”). Have students walk out the motion while holding out one
arm representing the velocity vector and the other arm representing the acceleration vector.
4 3.8
Create a Plan
Find a data table on stopping distance. Have students determine the coefficient of static
friction of the car’s tires from this data and then create a new table of different car speeds and minimum turning radii to not skid.
5 3.8
Predict and Explain
Attach a pendulum of known weight (say, 2 N) to a force sensor and cause the bob to swing
in a 180-degree arc. Ask students, “At the bottom, the bob is neither speeding up nor
slowing down, so what force is registered at the bottom?” Expect students to (incorrectly) answer, “2 N.”

Analyze experimental data describing the motion of an object and express the results of the analysis using narrative, mathematical, and graphical representations. [SP 5.1]
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE e.	 In inertial reference frames, forces are detected by their influence on the motion (specifically the velocity) of an object. So force, like velocity, is a vector quantity.
A force vector has magnitude and direction.
When multiple forces are exerted on an object, the vector sum of these forces, referred to as the net force, causes a change in the motion of the object. The acceleration of the object is proportional to the net force.
f.	 The kinematic equations only apply to constant acceleration situations. Circular motion and projectile motion are both included. Circular motion is further covered in Unit 3. The three kinematic equations describing linear motion with constant acceleration in one and two dimensions are 0 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 1 2 2 ( ) x x x x x x x x v v a t x x v t a t v v a x x = + = + + = + − g.

This also includes situations where there is both a radial and tangential acceleration for an object moving in a circular path.
Relevant Equation:

For uniform circular motion of radius r, v is proportional to omega, ω (for a given r), and proportional to r (for a given omega, ω). Given a radius r and a period of rotation T, students derive and apply v = (2πr)/T.

Unit Overview
In Unit 4, students will be introduced to the idea of conservation as a foundational model
of physics, along with the concept of work as the agent of change for energy. As in earlier
units, students will once again utilize both familiar and new models and representations to
analyze physical situations, now with force or energy as major components. Students will
be encouraged to call upon their knowledge of Units 1–4 to determine the most appropriate
technique and will be challenged to understand the limiting factors of each. Describing,
creating, and using these representations will also help students grapple with common
misconceptions that they may have about energy, such as whether or not a single object
can “have” potential energy. A thorough understanding of these energy models will support
students’ ability to make predications—and ultimately justify claims with evidence—about
physical situations. This is crucial, as the mathematical models and representations used in
Unit 4 will mature throughout the course and appear in subsequent units.
As students’ comprehension of energy (particularly kinetic, potential, and microscopic internal
energy) evolves, they will begin to connect and relate knowledge across scales, concepts, and
representations, as well as across disciplines, particularly physics, chemistry, and biology.
Preparing for the AP Exam
When students work with mathematical representations, it’s crucial that they understand the
connections between the mathematical description, physical phenomena, and the concepts
represented in those mathematical descriptions. On the exam, students need to be able to
justify why using a particular equation to analyze a situation is useful and be aware of the
conditions under which equations/mathematical representations can be used. Familiarity
with symbolic solutions is also necessary, because students will not often encounter a
question that asks them to directly solve for a numerical answer. Finally, students need to
be able to evaluate equations in terms of units and limiting case analysis. The exam asks
students to translate between functional relationships in equations (proportionalities, inverse
proportionalities, etc.) and cause-and-effect relationships in the physical world.

Sample Activity 1 4.2
Concept-Oriented Demonstration
Release a low-friction cart (mass m) from the top of a ramp, have students time (t) how long
it takes to reach the bottom, and measure the release height h and track length L. Have
students calculate velocity using v = L/t, and then calculate mgh and ½mv2. The two energies
are different; explain what incorrect assumptions lead to the difference in energies.

Give each group a spring-loaded ball launcher, scale, and meterstick. Ask them to
determine the spring constant of the spring in the launcher.

Four-Square Problem Solving
First square: Describe an everyday situation (e.g., “a car goes downhill, speeding up even
as the brakes are pressed”) along with a diagram. Second square: Free-body diagram with
an arrow off to the side representing the object’s displacement. Third square: Energy bar
charts (initial and final). Fourth square: For each force on the free-body diagram, state
whether that force performs positive or negative work and what energy transformation that force is responsible for.
4 4.3
Construct an Argument
Ask students to consider a cart that rolls from rest down a ramp and then around a vertical
loop. For the cart to complete the loop without falling out, the cart must be released at a
height higher than the top of the loop. Have students explain why this is the case using energy and circular motion principles.

Working Backward
Student A writes a conservation of energy equation (either symbolically or with numbers
and units plugged in). Student B then describes a situation that the equation could apply to, draws a diagram, and draws energy bar charts.

Preparing for the AP Exam
Physicists often use models and representations to show the design or workings of a system,
an object, or a concept. Representations and models include, but are not limited to, sketching
the physical situation, free-body diagrams, graphs, mathematical equations, and narratives.
Unit 5 focuses on the creation/use and re-representation of models and representations.
Students should be presented with multiple opportunities to create, use, and re-represent
models and representations, including non-traditional representations. For example, while it is
important that students be able to create a force versus time graph and explain that the area
under the curve is equal to the momentum, they also need to feel comfortable with sketching or
analyzing a graph of momentum versus time where the slope of the line is the net external force.
In every situation, students need to be able to think about possible re-representations and how
the new representation would change the model and/or introduce new data for analysis.

Momentum
Unit Overview
Unit 5 introduces students to the relationship between force, time, and momentum via
calculations, data analysis, designing experiments, and making predictions. Students will
learn how to use new models and representations to illustrate the law of the conservation
of momentum of objects and systems while simultaneously building on their knowledge
of previously studied representations. Using the law of the conservation of momentum
to analyze physical situations gives students a more complete picture of forces and leads
them to revisit their misconceptions surrounding Newton’s third law. Students will also
have the opportunity to make connections between the conserved quantities of momentum
and energy to determine under what conditions each quantity is conserved. It’s essential
that students are not only comfortable solving numerical equations (such as the speed
of a system after an inelastic collision) but also confident in their ability to discuss when
momentum is conserved and how the type of collision affects the outcome. Threading such
connections between physical quantities is fundamental to understanding the broader
relationship between this unit and the rest of the course.
Students will have more opportunities to apply conservation laws to make predictions and
justify claims in Unit 7 when they are introduced to rotational quantities.

Topic
Sample Activity 1 5.1
Conflicting Contentions
Ask students to imagine a pitcher throwing a baseball and a catcher catching it. Students
will debate who exerted more force on the ball (no way to know), who applied greater
impulse (same for both), and who did a greater magnitude of net work on the ball (same).
Repeat for a pitcher throwing the baseball and a batter hitting it back at the same speed.
2 5.1
Desktop Experiment Task
Connect a spring-loaded lanyard between a cart and force sensor, with a motion sensor
on the other side of the cart. Have students take force and motion versus time data as the
lanyard contracts and pulls, accelerating the cart. Show that impulse applied to the cart equals the cart’s change in momentum.
3 5.2
Bar Chart/Construct an Argument
Have students use momentum bar charts to explain why a dart bouncing off a cart makes
the cart move faster than if the dart sticks to the cart, passes through the cart, or stops and drops after colliding with the cart.
4 5.2
Predict and Explain/Concept-Oriented Demonstration
Have a cart crash into a force sensor set to its highest setting in three different ways: cart
sticks to sensor, cart bounces off the sensor on its hard side, and cart bounces off the
sensor with its spring side. Have students predict in which case more force is registered, and explain why after each experiment is done.
5 5.4
Desktop Experiment Task
Have two carts with different masses collide in a non-stick collision. Film the carts with
a phone camera from above, with a meterstick next to the track. Have students use
a frame-by-frame review app to determine the cart’s initial/final speeds, whether momentum
was conserved, and whether the collision was elastic.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
5.D.3.1
Predict the velocity of the center of mass of a system when there is no interaction outside of the system but there is an interaction within the system (i.e., the student simply recognizes that interactions within a system do not affect the center-of-mass motion of the system and is able to determine that there is no external force).

The velocity of the center of mass of the system cannot be changed by an interaction within the system. [Physics 1 includes no calculations of centers of mass; the equation is not provided until Physics 2. However, without doing calculations, Physics 1 students are expected to be able to locate the center of mass of highly symmetric mass distributions, such as a uniform rod or cube of uniform density, or two spheres of equal mass.] a.	 The center of mass of a system depends on the masses and positions of the objects in the system. In an isolated system (a system with no external forces), the velocity of the center of mass does not change.
b.	 When objects in a system collide, the velocity of the center of mass of the system will not change unless an external force is exerted on the system.
c.	 Included in Physics 1 is the idea that, where there is both a heavier and lighter mass, the center of mass is closer to the heavier mass. Only a qualitative understanding of this concept is required.

Motion
Unit Overview
In Unit 6, students will continue to use the same tools, techniques, and models that they
have been using throughout this course. However, they will now use them to analyze
a new type of motion: simple harmonic motion. Although simple harmonic motion is unique,
students will learn that even in new situations, the fundamental laws of physics remain the
same. Energy bar charts, as well as free-body diagrams, become increasingly important
as students work toward determining which model is most appropriate for a given physical
situation. Preconceptions—such as the relationship between the amplitude and period of
oscillation—will also be addressed to provide students with a more nuanced awareness of simple harmonic motion.
Students are expected to use the content knowledge they gained in the first five units to
make and defend claims while also making connections in and across the content topics
and big ideas. Because Unit 6 is the first unit in which students possess all the tools of force,
energy, and momentum conservation, it’s important that teachers scaffold lessons to help
them develop a better understanding of each fundamental physics principles as well as its
limitations. Throughout this unit, students will be asked to create force, energy, momentum,
and position versus time graphs for a single scenario and to make predictions based on their
representations. Students will enhance their study of motion when they learn about oscillatory motion in Unit 10.

Have students use a pendulum to measure the acceleration of gravity. Ask them to refine
the experiment from single-trial calculation, to taking an average, to making a graph of linearized data.

Predict and Explain
Make a pendulum bob oscillate with the other end of the string “clamped” between your
fingers. While the bob oscillates, pull the string through your fingers so that the string
length is shortened. Before doing this, ask students what will happen to the period of
the oscillation and the amplitude (measured in degrees), and then explain why the period decreases and the amplitude angle increases.

Construct an Argument
A cart wiggles on a horizontal spring. A blob of clay is dropped on the cart and sticks (could
be when the cart is at the center or at one end). Ask students to explain what happened to
the period, total energy, amplitude of motion, and maximum speed?
5 6.2
Create a Plan
Students choose a song and find its tempo (beats per minute). Students then must build a
pendulum so that it swings back and forth on each beat. Students are then given a spring.
They must find the spring’s constant and then find the amount of mass necessary to make the spring-mass oscillate on each beat.

Preparing for the AP Exam
Students must be familiar with identifying and analyzing functional relationships, especially
with equations that are not found on the equation sheet. It is likely that students will be
asked to explain why a new equation—one that they have never seen before—does or does
not support a claim. They may also have to briefly address functional dependence in
questions. Students will be more prepared for the type of mathematical reasoning required
on the AP Physics 1 Exam if they understand and practice making logical mathematical
derivations while showing their starting principle and annotating their steps.

Torque and Rotational Motion
Unit Overview
Unit 7 completes the study of mechanical physics by introducing students to torque
and rotational motion. Although these topics present more complex scenarios, the tools
of analysis remain the same: The content and models explored in the first six units of AP Physics 1 set the foundation for Unit 7.
During their study of torque and rotational motion, students will be confronted with different
ways of thinking about and modeling forces. As in previous units, it’s critical that students are
given opportunities to create and use representations and models to make predictions and
justify claims. It’s equally important that students are comfortable deriving new expressions
from fundamental principles to help them make predictions in unfamiliar, applied contexts.
Unit 7 also focuses on the mathematical practice of estimating quantities that can describe
natural phenomena. For example, students need to be able to estimate the torque on an
object caused by various forces in comparison to other situations. Although this particular
science practice doesn’t appear often in AP Physics 1, it nonetheless is an important
conceptual skill for students to be able to compare estimated values of physical quantities.
Throughout this unit, students will have opportunities to compare and connect their
understanding of linear and rotational motion, dynamics, energy, and momentum to make
meaning of these concepts as a whole, rather than as distinct and separate units.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples
below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways
that they approach teaching some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional
Approaches section beginning on p. 139 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Unit Planning Notes
Use the space below to plan your approach to the unit.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 7.1
Predict and Explain
Spin a bike wheel (preferably with the tire removed so that it will roll on its metal rims), and
release it from rest on a floor or long table. Have students predict what will happen to the
wheel’s linear velocity (will increase) and its angular velocity (will decrease) as the wheel
“peels out.” Then explain why this happens using a force diagram.
2 7.2
Desktop Experiment Task
Have students release a yo-yo from rest, calculate its acceleration from distance and time
measurements, and then determine the yo-yo’s rotational inertia (requires the yo-yo’s
mass and the radius at which the string connects to the yo-yo). Next, have them roll the
yo-yo down a ramp and use distance and time data to construct a conservation of energy
equation that can be solved for the yo-yo’s rotational inertia.
3 7.3
Concept-Oriented Demonstration
Obtain a ring and a disk of equal mass and radius, and load up a low-friction cart with
weights to make it the same mass. “Race” the three objects from rest down identical
inclines to show students the cart wins, then the disk, and then the ring. Have students explain why, with forces and then with energy.
4 7.3
Ranking
A wheel rolls down an incline from rest and across a flat surface. Case 1: Tracks are rough
enough that there is no slipping. Case 2: Tracks have some friction, but there is slipping.
Case 3: Tracks have negligible friction. Have students rank translational kinetic energies at
the end, rotational kinetic energies at the end, and total mechanical energies of the wheel
at the end as three separate tasks. (KT3 > KT2 > KT1), (KR1 > KR2 > KR3), and (E1 = E3 > E2).

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
3.A.1.1
Express the motion of an object using narrative, mathematical, and graphical representations.
[SP 1.5, 2.1, 2.2]
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE e.	 In inertial reference frames, forces are detected by their influence on the motion (specifically the velocity) of an object. So force, like velocity, is a vector quantity.
A force vector has magnitude and direction.
When multiple forces are exerted on an object, the vector sum of these forces, referred to as the net force, causes a change in the motion of the object. The acceleration of the object is proportional to the net force.
f.	 The kinematic equations only apply to constant acceleration situations. Circular motion and projectile motion are both included. Circular motion is further covered in Unit 3. The three kinematic equations describing linear motion with constant acceleration in one and two dimensions are 0 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 1 2 2 ( ) x x x x x x x x v v a t x x v t a t v v a x x = + = + + = + − g.	 For rotational motion, there are analogous quantities such as angular position, angular velocity, and angular acceleration. The kinematic equations describing angular motion with constant angular acceleration are 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 1 2 2 ( ) x t t t θ θ ω α ω ω α ω ω α θ θ = + + = + = + − h.	 This also includes situations where there is both a radial and tangential acceleration for an object moving in a circular path.
Relevant Equation:
= 2 c v a r
For uniform circular motion of radius r, v is proportional to omega, ω (for a given r), and proportional to r (for a given omega, ω). Given a radius r and a period of rotation T, students derive and apply v = (2πr)/T.

The angular momentum of a system may change due to interactions with other objects or systems.
a.	 The angular momentum of a system with respect to an axis of rotation is the sum of the angular momenta, with respect to that axis, of the objects that make up the system.

The angular momentum of a system is determined by the locations and velocities of the objects that make up the system. The rotational inertia of an object or a system depends on the distribution of mass within the object or system. Changes in the radius of a system or in the distribution of mass within the system result in changes in the system’s rotational inertia, and hence in its angular velocity and linear speed for a given angular momentum. Examples include elliptical orbits in an Earth-satellite system. Mathematical expressions for the moments of inertia will be provided where needed. Students will not be expected to know the parallel axis theorem. Students do not need to know the equation for an object’s rotational inertia, as it will be provided at the exam.

Familiarity with concrete evidence leads to a deeper

increasing student involvement to help enhance inquiry
learning and develop critical thinking and problem solving skills. Typically, the level of investigations in an
AP Physics 1 classroom should focus primarily on the
continuum between guided and open inquiry. However,
depending on students’ familiarity with the topic, a given
laboratory experience might incorporate a sequence
involving all four levels of inquiry (confirmation,
structured inquiry, guided inquiry, and open inquiry).
Lab Manuals and Lab Notebooks
College Board publishes AP Physics 1 and 2
Inquiry-Based Lab Investigations: A Teacher’s Manual
to support the guided inquiry lab requirement for the course. It includes labs that teachers can choose
from to satisfy the guided inquiry lab component for the course. Many publishers and science classroom
material distributors offer affordable lab manuals
with outlined experiments and activities as well as lab
notebooks for recording lab data and observations.
Students can use any type of notebook to fulfill the
lab notebook requirement, even an online document.
Consider the needs of the classroom when deciding what type of lab notebook to use.
Lab Materials
A wide range of equipment may be used in the physics
laboratory, from generic lab items, such as metersticks,
rubber balls, springs, string, metal spheres, calibrated
mass sets, beakers, electronic balances, stopwatches,
clamps, and ring stands, to items more specific to
physics, such as tracks and carts. Successful guided inquiry student work can be accomplished with both simple, inexpensive materials and with more
sophisticated physics equipment, such as air tracks
and force sensors. Remember that the AP lab should
provide experience for students equivalent to that
of a college laboratory, so teachers are encouraged to
make every effort to provide a range of experiences—
from experiments students contrive from string, and
duct tape to experiments in which students gather and
analyze data using calculators or computer-interfaced equipment.
There are avenues that teachers can explore as a
means of getting access to more expensive equipment, such as computers and probes. Probes can often be rented for short periods of time from instrument
suppliers. Alternatively, local colleges or universities
may allow high school students to complete a lab as a
field trip on their campus, or they may allow teachers to
borrow their equipment. They may even donate their old
equipment. Some schools have partnerships with local
businesses that can help with laboratory equipment and
materials. Teachers can also utilize online donation sites such as Donors Choose and Adopt-A-Classroom.
Lab Time
For this AP Physics 1 to be comparable to a college physics course, it is critical that teachers make
laboratory work an important part their curriculum.
An analysis of data from AP Physics examinees, regarding the length of time they spent per week
in the laboratory, shows that increased laboratory
time correlates with higher AP scores. Flexible or modular scheduling must be implemented to meet
the time requirements identified in the course outline.
At minimum, one double period a week is needed.
Furthermore, it is important that the AP Physics 1
laboratory program be adapted to local conditions and
funding as it aims to offer the students a well-rounded experience with experimental physics. Adequate
laboratory facilities should be provided so that each student has a work space where equipment and
materials can be left overnight if necessary. Sufficient
laboratory equipment for the anticipated enrollment and appropriate instruments should be provided.
Students in AP Physics 1 should have access to
computers with software appropriate for processing laboratory data and writing reports.

How to Set Up a Lab Program
Physics is not just a subject. Rather, it is a way of
approaching scientific discovery that requires personal observation and physical experimentation. Being successful in this endeavor requires students to synthesize and use a broad spectrum of knowledge
and skills, including mathematical, computational,
experimental, and practical skills, and to develop
habits of mind that might be characterized as thinking
like a physicist. Student-directed, inquiry-based lab experience supports the AP Physics 1 course and
AP Course Audit curricular requirements. It provides opportunities for students to design experiments, collect data, apply mathematical routines and methods, and refine testable explanations and predictions. Teachers are expected to devote a
minimum of 25 percent of instructional time to lab investigations to support the learning objectives in the course framework.
The AP Physics 1 Exam directly assesses the learning objectives of the course framework, which means
that the inclusion of appropriate experiments aligned
with those learning objectives is important for student success. Teachers should select experiments that provide students with the broadest laboratory experience possible.
We encourage teachers to be creative in designing
their lab program while ensuring that students explore
and develop understandings of these core techniques.
After completion, students should be able to describe
how to construct knowledge, model (create an abstract
representation of a real system), design experiments, analyze visual data, and communicate physics.
Students should also develop an understanding of
how changes in the design of the experiments would
affect the outcome of their results. Many questions on
the AP Exam are written in an experimental context,
so these skills will prove invaluable for both concept comprehension and exam performance.
Getting Students Started
There are no prescriptive “steps” to the iterative process of inquiry-based investigations. However, there are some common characteristics of inquiry that will support students in designing their
investigations. Often, this simply begins with using
the learning objectives to craft a question for students
to investigate. Teachers may choose to give students
a list of materials they are allowed to use in their
design or require that students request the equipment they feel they need to investigate the question.
Working with learning objectives to craft questions
may include:
§§ Selecting learning objectives from the course framework that relate to the subject under study
and that may set forth specific tasks, in the form of “Design an experiment to . . . .”
§§ Rephrasing or refining the learning objectives that
align to the unit of study to create an inquiry-based investigation for students.
Students should be given latitude to make design modifications or ask for additional equipment
appropriate for their design. It is also helpful for individual groups to report to the class their
basic design to elicit feedback on feasibility. Guided student groups can proceed through the experiment
with the teacher allowing them the freedom to make mistakes—as long as those mistakes don’t endanger
students or equipment or lead the groups too far off task. Students should have many opportunities for
post-lab reporting so that groups can understand the
successes and challenges of individual lab designs.

Communication, Group
Collaboration, and the
Laboratory Record
Laboratory work is an excellent means through which students can develop and practice communication
skills. Success in subsequent work in physics depends
heavily on an ability to communicate observations, ideas, and conclusions. Students must learn to recognize that an understanding of physics is
relatively useless unless they can communicate their
knowledge effectively to others. By working together
in a truly collaborative manner to plan and carry out
experiments, students learn oral communication skills and teamwork. Students must be encouraged to take
full individual responsibility for the success, or failure, of the collaboration.
After students are given a question for investigation,
they may present their findings in either a written or
an oral report to the teacher and class for feedback
and critique on their final design and results. Students
should be encouraged to critique and challenge one another’s claims based on the evidence collected during the investigation.
Laboratory Safety
Giving students the responsibility for design of their own laboratory experience involves special responsibilities for teachers. To ensure a safe
working environment, teachers should first provide
the limitations and safety precautions necessary for
potential procedures and equipment students may use
during their investigation. Teachers should also provide
specific guidelines prior to students’ discussion on
investigation designs for each experiment so that those
precautions can be incorporated into final student selected lab designs and included in the background or
design plan in a laboratory record. It may also be helpful
to print the precautions that apply to that specific
lab as Safety Notes to place on the desk or wall near
student workstations. Additionally, a general set of
safety guidelines should be set forth for students at
the beginning of the course. The following is a list of possible general guidelines teachers may post:
§§ Before every lab, make sure you know and record
the potential hazards involved in the investigation,
as well as the precautions you will take to stay safe.
§§ Before using equipment, make sure you know the proper method of use to acquire good data and avoid damage to equipment.
§§ Know where safety equipment is located in the lab,
such as the fire extinguisher, safety goggles, and the first aid kit.
§§ Follow the teacher’s special safety guidelines as set forth prior to each experiment. (Students should
record these as part of their design plan for a lab.) §§ When in doubt about the safety or advisability of a procedure, check with the teacher before proceeding.
Teachers should interact constantly with students as
they work to observe safety practices and anticipate
and discuss with them any problems that may arise.
Walking among student groups, asking questions, and
showing interest in students’ work allows teachers to
keep the pulse of what students are doing and maintain a watchful eye for potential safety issues.

Selecting and Using
Course Materials
Teachers will benefit from a wide array of materials
to help students become proficient with the science practices necessary to develop a conceptual understanding of the relationships, laws, and phenomena studied in AP Physics 1. In addition
to using a college-level textbook that will provide
required course content, students should have regular
opportunities to create and use data, representations,
and models. Rich, experimental investigation is the cornerstone of AP Physics 1, and diverse source
material allows teachers more flexibility in designing
the types of learning activities that will help develop the habits of thinking like a physicist.
Textbooks
While nearly all college-level physics textbooks address
the 10 units of AP Physics 1, it’s important for teachers to identify other types of secondary sources to
supplement the chosen textbook accordingly, ensuring
that each of the 7 topic areas, as well as the science practices, receives adequate attention.
AP Central provides an example textbook list to help
determine whether a text is considered appropriate in meeting the AP Physics 1 Course Audit resource
requirement. Teachers can also select textbooks locally.
AP Physics 1 Student Workbook
The AP Physics 1 Student Workbook is a resource
published by College Board to help students further their understanding of the science practices and
content needed to be successful on the AP Physics 1
Exam. The workbook is scaffolded within each unit and across the course to help students access the material. Students will be challenged to analyze
scenarios that progress in difficulty. Each page is
tagged to specific essential knowledge statements and
science practices that students will use complete the assignment. The workbook also contains resources
for both new and experienced AP teachers on how to prepare for, teach, and assess each page. Common
student misconceptions are outlined in the beginning
of each unit to help teachers understand what students struggle with most.

Guided Inquiry in AP Physics 1
The more active students are in their science
education, the more scientifically literate they will
become. Inquiry into authentic questions generated
from student experiences should be one of the central strategies when teaching AP Physics 1. By posing
questions, planning investigations, and reviewing what
is already known in light of experimental evidence,
students mirror how scientists analyze the natural
world. Inquiry requires identifying assumptions, using
critical and logical thinking, and considering alternative
explanations. Having students probe for answers to
scientific questions will lead to a deeper understanding of scientific concepts.
Science Practice
How to Scaffold Inquiry in the AP Classroom
3.1: The student can pose scientific questions.
The student works with a question developed by the teacher.

Different types of lessons, and therefore different
types of inquiry, are used throughout AP Physics 1.
There is a continuum from more student-centered types of inquiry to more teacher-centered types.
Understanding the different types of inquiry can help
teachers scaffold the types of labs and activities to better meet the needs of their students.
Below are four suggestions to make labs and activities more student-centered and inquiry-based
§§ Start small: Take out the “data” or “results” section
from traditional labs. If the procedure is thorough and simple enough, students can read and design the data and results sections on their own.
§§ Tackle the procedure: Eventually, teachers will want
students to design their own experiments, but they may need some practice first. Remove the step numbers and shuffle the steps. Have the students
work in pairs to put the steps into the correct order.
Next, try having them write a procedure as a pre-lab homework assignment, and then work together as
a class to develop it further, making sure that the question, variables, and safety are addressed.
§§ Try a goal-oriented task: Completely remove the procedure, and prompt students with a question that asks them to achieve something they want
to do. At this point, it’s best to choose a lab that students already understand conceptually and that uses simple, familiar equipment.
§§ Let them do the thinking: Students choose what they will investigate. Facilitate their thought
process without telling them what to do. A pre-lab brainstorming session in small groups is helpful when having students develop a question to
investigate. It is important to provide students with
some guidelines at this step. For example, students need to think about a question, a hypothesis, and materials before beginning an open-ended lab.
Seeing and approving this in the lab groups helps boost students’ confidence.

Instructional Strategies
The AP Physics 1 course framework outlines the concepts and science practices
students must master in order to be successful on the AP Exam. To address those
concepts and science practices effectively, teachers should incorporate a variety of
instructional approaches and best practices into their daily lessons and activities.
Teachers can help students develop the science practices by engaging them in
learning activities that allow them to apply their understanding of course concepts.
Teachers may consider the following strategies as they plan instruction. Please note
they are listed alphabetically and not by order of importance or instruction.
Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Ask the Expert
Students are assigned as “experts” on problems they have mastered;
groups rotate through the expert stations to learn about problems they have not yet mastered.
Provides opportunities for students to share their knowledge and learn from one another.
Assign students “experts” on conservation of linear momentum questions.
Students rotate through stations in groups, working with the station expert to justify a set of claims with corresponding physical laws.
Bar Chart
Bar chart tasks have histograms for one or more quantities. Frequently, histograms are given before and after some physical process with one bar left off. Students are asked to complete the bar chart by supplying the value of the missing quantity. These are a new type of representation, requiring students to translate between whatever other representation they are using and this one. Bar chart tasks are usually quite productive in helping students make meaning.
Bar chart tasks help students make meaning by asking them to translate between before and after some physical process.
This strategy can be used with conservation laws.
Have students define the system and then create bar charts for before and after some event. For example, students create an energy bar chart for a ball rolling down an incline. Students identify the system and then create one set of charts for the top of the incline and a separate set of charts for the bottom of the incline.

Changing
Representations
These tasks require students to translate from one representation (e.g., an electric field diagram) to another (e.g., an equipotential curves or surfaces diagram). Students often learn how to cope with one representation without really learning the role and value of representations and their relationship to problem solving. Getting them to go back and forth between/among different representations for a concept forces them to develop a more robust understanding of each representation.
Among the representations that will be employed at times are mathematical relationships, so this task can serve as a bridge between conceptual understanding and traditional problem solving.
Students create pictures, tables, graphs, lists, equations, models, and/or verbal expressions to interpret text or data.
This helps organize information using multiple ways to present data and answer a question or show a problem’s solution.
As students learn about energy conservation, ask them to move between different representations.
For example, for a given situation involving energy conservation, students should be able to create a sketch of the identified system, a set of conservation of energy equations, sets of energy bar charts and graphs of potential energy, kinetic energy, total energy or combinations of the above representations.
Concept-Oriented
Demonstration
These tasks involve an actual demonstration, but with the students doing as much of the description, prediction, and explanation as possible. Demonstrations should be ones where students feel comfortable making predictions about what will happen, yet will produce results they do not expect.
Involving an actual demonstration, students are asked to predict and explain.
In Unit 7, teachers can demonstrate the soup can race, where different soup cans with identical diameters reach the bottom of an incline at different times because of the contents of the can.
Students will be challenged to explain the outcome of the race in terms of physical laws and theories.
Conflicting
Contentions
Conflicting contentions tasks present students with two or three statements that disagree in some way. The students have to decide which contention they agree with and explain why. These tasks are very useful for contrasting statements of students’ alternate conceptions with physically accepted statements.
This process is facilitated in these tasks because they can be phrased as “which statement do you agree with and why” rather than asking which statement is correct or true.
These tasks complement “What if
Anything Is Wrong?” tasks.
These tasks help contrast statements of students’ alternate conceptions with physically accepted statements.
This strategy is useful for helping students begin to understand how to write a full argument. By providing the arguments and having students identify good claims (and not-so-good claims) and good evidence and reasoning (and not-so-good evidence and reasoning), teachers can help scaffold the instruction of good argumentation for their students.

Example
Construct an
Argument
Students use mathematical reasoning to present assumptions about mathematical situations, support conjectures with mathematically relevant and accurate data, and provide a logical progression of ideals leading to a conclusion that makes sense.
Helps develop the process of evaluating mathematical information, developing reasoning skills, and enhancing communication skills in supporting conjectures and conclusions.
This strategy can be used with word problems that do not lend themselves to immediate application of a formula or mathematical process. Teachers can provide distance and velocity graphs that represent a motorist’s behavior through several towns on a map and ask students to construct a mathematical argument either in defense of or against a police officer’s charge of speeding, given a known speed limit.
Create a Plan
Students analyze the tasks in a problem and create a process for completing the tasks by finding the information needed, interpreting data, choosing how to solve a problem, communicating the results, and verifying accuracy.
Assists in breaking tasks into smaller parts and identifying the steps needed to complete the entire task.
When scaffolding for how to design an experiment, assigning small groups to analyze the tasks necessary to design the experiment is a good first step. Students identify the steps needed to answer the question by collecting and analyzing data. Included in this discussion is a plan for what to do with the collected data.
Debriefing
Students discuss the understanding of a concept to lead to a consensus on its meaning.
Helps clarify misconceptions and deepen understanding of context.
In order to discern the difference between average velocity and instantaneous velocity, have students roll a ball down a simple ramp and measure the distance the ball travels over time every second for 5 seconds.
Plotting position versus time and sketching a curve of best fit, students discuss how they might determine the average velocity of the ball over the 5 seconds and then the instantaneous velocity of the ball at several points. A discussion in which students address the distinction between the ball’s average velocity between two points and its velocity at a single point helps in clarifying the concept and mathematical process.

Desktop
Experiments
Tasks
These tasks involve students performing a demonstration at their desks (either in class or at home) using a predict-and-explain format but adding the step of doing it. This “doing it” step is followed by the reformulating step, where students reconsider their previous explanations in light of what happened. DETs are narrow in scope, usually qualitative in nature, and typically use simple equipment.
Students are presented with a small desktop experiment and asked to use the apparatus provided to answer a given question.
Direct Measurement
Videos make excellent “desktop” experiments that students can work with either in class or as homework. DETs can include small experiments with toy cars, balances, or cell phone cameras.
Discussion
Groups
Students work in groups to discuss content, create problem solutions, and explain and justify a solution.
Aids in understanding through the sharing of ideas, interpretation of concepts, and analysis of problem scenarios.
Once students learn all methods of problem solving and can select which is the most appropriate given a particular situation, have them discuss in small groups (no writing) why a specific method should be used over another.
Friends Without
Pens
Students are given a free-response problem, quiz, or challenging problem.
This task takes place in two rounds:
The first round is the “friends without pens” round, where students are grouped together and can discuss the question but are not allowed to write down anything. This round is timed. At the end of the time, students return to their desks for the “pens without friends” round, where they tackle the assignment in the traditional, independent sense.
This can be a scaffolding tool if students are being introduced to a new type of assignment or a particularly difficult or challenging
AP-level question.
After scaffolding argumentation, where students have been working on identifying good (and not-so-good) claims, evidence, and reasoning, assigning a friends without pens task will help scaffold one more step. Students will identify good claims, evidence, and reasoning with their peers, and then they must return to their desk, having discussed the ideas, to create the full argument.

Four-Square
Problem Solving
Students are given some sort of situation, perhaps one that came from a traditional, plug-and-chug problem. Have them divide a sheet of paper into four quadrants. In each quadrant, the students are to put some representation of what is going on in the problem. Possible representations include motion maps or graphs, any other kinds of graphs, free-body diagrams, energy bar graphs, momentum bar graphs, mathematical models (equations with symbols), well-labeled diagrams, or written responses (two to three strong, clear sentences).
Re-expressing or re-representing data is a key skill for student success in AP Physics 1.
Asking students to come up with four representations scaffolds the practice needed for them to get into the habit of creating and using representations to make claims and answer questions.
In unit 4, students can regularly and repeatedly do four-square problem solving with work and energy questions. They can sketch graphs or free-body diagrams, write paragraphs, and solve numerical and/or symbolic problems.
Graph and Switch
Students generate a graph (or a sketch of a graph) to model a certain function and then switch calculators (or papers) to review each other’s solutions.
Allows students to practice creating different representations of functions as well as both giving and receiving feedback on each other’s work.
As students learn about momentum diagrams, have them graph momentum versus time and force versus time and create a momentum diagram to diagram a single situation.
Students individually graph and explain how their representations support claims. They then share their steps with a partner and receive feedback on their graphs, claims, evidence, and reasoning.

Graphic
Organizer
Students arrange information into charts and diagrams.
Builds comprehension and facilitates discussion by representing information in visual form.
To organize the representations for three kinds of collisions (bounce, stick, and pass-through) have students create a graphic organizer to collect the representations (momentum versus time graph, force versus time graph, momentum diagram, free-body diagram, energy bar chart, and mathematical relationships) for each collision. Students can then write short paragraphs about the differences and similarities between the three types.
Identify Subtasks
Students break a problem into smaller pieces whose outcomes lead to a solution.
Helps organize the pieces of a complex problem and reach a complete solution.
Another scaffolding
technique: When first exposing students to AP-level questions that involve several steps of reasoning and logic, additional questions can be added to help guide students to the final claim, evidence, and reasoning.
For example, have students sketch a free-body diagram, discuss the system, and/or draw energy bar charts.
After the first few units, students should be able to identify (first in groups and then individually) what the subtasks would be (free-body diagram, etc.) to start thinking about the claim, evidence, and reasoning.

Marking the Text
Students highlight, underline, and/ or annotate text to focus on key information to help understand the text or solve the problem.
Helps the student identify important information in the text and make notes in the text about the concepts and interpretations of tasks required to reach a solution.
This strategy can be used with AP-level problems as well as problems from the text and sample laboratory procedures. Have students read through the question, experimental design, or another student’s experimental design and underline the pronouns, equipment, and key information (i.e., the car begins at rest) to identify important information and be able to ask clarifying questions.
Meaningful,
Meaningless
Calculations
These tasks present the students with an unreduced expression for a calculation for a physical quantity for a physical situation. They must decide whether the calculation is meaningful (i.e., it gives a value that tells us something legitimate about the physical situation) or is meaningless (i.e., the expression is a totally inappropriate use of a relation). These calculations should not be what we might call trivially meaningless, such as substituting a wrong numerical value into the expression. These items are best when the quantity calculated fits with students’ alternative conceptions.
Students are presented with an unreduced calculation for a physical calculation that involves a mathematical relationship, and students are asked if the calculation makes any sense.
These calculations can take many forms, but the most useful are those where the “meaningless” calculations illustrate common student misconceptions. Students could be asked to write an expression for the energy of a system. Students then have to decide which of the following expressions are meaningful (MgD, Mg/D,
MD/g and 1/MgD).
Students could also be asked about a situation where a cart with a fan is released from rest and moves across a flat tabletop 1 m long with negligible friction. Have students find the final speed of the cart by measuring the time it took to travel 1 m and dividing the displacement of the cart (1 m) by the time the cart took to travel the 1 m. Ask students if this a meaningful calculation for this situation.

Model Questions
Students answer items from released
AP Physics Exams.
Provides rigorous practices and assesses students’ ability to apply multiple physical practices on content in either a multiple choice or a free response question.
Model questions can be
AP-released or AP-level questions. They can be given as is, or scaffolded for students earlier in the year to provide them with support.
Note Taking
Students create a record of information while reading a text or listening to a speaker.
Helps in organizing ideas and processing information.
Have students write down verbal descriptions of the steps needed to solve a problem so that a record of the processes can be referred to at a later point in time.
Predict and Explain
Predict and explain tasks describe a physical situation that is set up at a point where some event is about to occur. Students predict what will happen in the situation and explain why they think that will occur. These tasks must involve situations with which the students are familiar or have sufficient background information to enable them to understand the situation.
This is important because otherwise they usually do not feel comfortable enough to attempt to answer.
Stimulates thinking by asking students to make, check, and correct predictions based on evidence from the outcome.
When a ballistic pendulum is set up, ask students what will happen to the maximum swing height when the mass of the dart is increased or decreased? What would happen if the dart were to bounce instead of stick into the block? What if the dart passed through the block?
Qualitative
Reasoning
These tasks can take a variety of forms, with their common denominator being qualitative analysis. Frequently, students are presented with an initial and a final situation and asked how some quantity, or aspect, will change.
Qualitative comparisons (e.g., the quantity increases, decreases, or stays the same) are often the appropriate answer. Qualitative reasoning tasks can frequently contain elements found in some of the other task formats (e.g., different qualitative representations and a prediction or an explanation).
Students are presented with a physical situation and asked to apply a principle to qualitatively reason what will happen.
These questions are commonly found in other multiple-choice question subtypes.
Ask students what would happen to the angular momentum of an object in orbit around the Earth if the radius of orbit were increased, if the speed of orbit were decreased, or if the mass of the Earth were changed. Additional questions could include, “What happens to the energy of the system as the physical properties above are changed?” continued on next page

Quickwrite
Students write for a short, specific amount of time about a designated topic.
Helps generate ideas in a short amount of time.
To help synthesize concepts after having learned about the conservation of mechanical energy, have students list as many ways as possible to change the total mechanical energy of a system and how each change affects the total mechanical energy.
Ranking
Ranking tasks present students with a set of variations, sometimes three or four but usually six to eight, on a basic physical situation. The variations differ in the values (numeric or symbolic) for the variables involved but also frequently include variables that are not important to the task.
The students’ task is to rank the variations on the basis of a specified physical quantity. Student must also explain the reasoning for their ranking scheme and rate their confidence in their ranking.
These tasks require students to engage in a comparison reasoning process that they seldom have opportunities to do in traditional problem solving.
Given six different arrows launched from the ground with different speeds at different angles, have students rank the arrows on the basis of the highest acceleration at the top, the longest time in the air, and the largest velocity at the top.
Sharing and Responding
Students communicate with another person or a small group of peers who respond to a proposed problem solution.

Troubleshooting
Troubleshooting tasks are variations on the “What if Anything Is Wrong?” tasks. Students are explicitly told that there is an error in the given situation.
Their job is to determine what the error is and explain how to correct it. These tasks can often produce interesting insights into students’ thinking, because they will, at times, identify some correct aspect of the situation as erroneous. This helps develop additional items.
Allows students to troubleshoot errors and misconceptions by focusing on problems that may arise when they do the same procedures themselves.
Give students a derivation or problem solution and ask them to find the incorrect step(s). Have them identify and explain the mistake or misunderstanding that led to the error. This can also be done with bar charts, diagrams, and other representations.
“What if
Anything Is
Wrong?”
Requires students to analyze a statement or diagrammed situation to determine if it is correct or not.
If everything is correct, the student is asked to explain the situation/ statement on and why it works as described. If something is incorrect, the student has to identify the error and explain how to correct it. These are open-ended exercises, so they provide insights into students’ ideas, since they will often have interesting reasons for accepting incorrect situations and for rejecting legitimate situations. Often, students’ responses provide ideas for other items.
Allows students to troubleshoot errors and focus on problems that may arise when they do the same procedures themselves.
Give students a free-body diagram or a force diagram that may or may not have incorrect forces drawn. This technique can also be used in derivations and problem solving, where students are given the “complete” solution and are asked to verify that it was done correctly.
Write and Switch
Like graph and switch, with writing.
Students make observations or collect data or make a claim and then switch papers.
Allows students to practice writing and both give and receive feedback on each other’s work.
As students learn about creating an argument, they can draft an initial argument themselves; share their claim, evidence, and reasoning with a partner;
and receive feedback on their argument.

Working
Backward
This task reverses the order of the problem steps. For example, the given information could be an equation with specific values for all, or all but one, of the variables. The students then have to construct a physical situation for which the given equation would apply. Such working backward tasks require students to take numerical values, including units, and translate them into physical variables. Working backward problems also require students to reason about these situations in an unusual way and often allow for more than one solution.
Provides another way to check possible answers for accuracy.
Students are given an equation such as = − 2 4 6 9 m m m s s and are asked to create another representation from this equation, such as a written scenario that this equation could represent, a position versus time graph, a velocity versus time graph, a motion map, etc.

Developing the
Science Practices
Throughout the course, students will develop science practices that are
fundamental to the discipline of physics. Since these practices represent the
complex skills that adept physicists demonstrate, students will benefit from multiple
opportunities to develop them in a scaffolded manner. Through the use of guided
questioning, discussion techniques, and other instructional strategies, teachers
can help their students practice applying these science practices in new contexts,
providing an important foundation for their college and career readiness.
Science Practice 1: Modeling
The student can use representations and models to communicate scientific phenomena and solve scientific problems.
The real world is extremely complex. When physicists
describe and explain phenomena, they try to simplify real objects, systems, and processes to make the analysis manageable. These simplifications or models are used to predict how new phenomena
will occur. A simple model may treat a system as an
object, neglecting the system’s internal structure and behavior. More complex models are models of
a system of objects, such as a fireworks display or
planets orbiting the sun. A process can be simplified,
too. Models can be both conceptual and mathematical.
Ohm’s law is an example of a mathematical model, while the model of a current as a steady flow of charged particles is a conceptual model. To make a good model, one needs to identify a set of the most important characteristics of a phenomenon
or system that may simplify analysis. Inherent in the
construction of models that physicists invent is the
use of representations. Examples of representations used to model introductory physics are pictures, force diagrams, graphs, energy bar charts, ray
diagrams, and circuit diagrams. Representations help in analyzing phenomena and making predictions and communicating ideas. AP Physics 1 requires
students to use, analyze, and/or re-express models and representations of natural or man-made systems.
The following table provides examples of questions and
instructional strategies for implementing representation and modeling resources into the course:

Science Practice 2: Mathematical Routines
The student can use mathematics appropriately.
Physicists commonly use mathematical
representations to describe and explain phenomena,
as well as to solve problems. When students work with these representations, we want them to understand the connections between the mathematical
description, the physical phenomena, and the concepts
represented in the mathematical descriptions. When using equations or mathematical representations, students need to be able to justify why using a
particular equation to analyze a particular situation is
useful and to be aware of the conditions under which the equations/mathematical representations can be
used. Students tend to rely too much on mathematical representations. When solving a problem, they need to be able to describe the problem situation
in multiple ways, including pictorial representations,
force diagrams etc., and then choose an appropriate
mathematical representation, instead of first choosing
a formula whose variables seem to match the givens in the problem. Students should also be able to
work with the algebraic form of the equation before substituting values. Students should be able to
evaluate the equation(s) and the answer in terms of
units and limiting case analysis. Students should be
able to translate between functional relationships in
equations (proportionalities, inverse proportionalities,
etc.) and cause-and-effect relationships in the physical
world. Students should be able to evaluate a numerical
result in terms of whether it makes sense. In many
physical situations, simple mathematical routines may
be needed to arrive at a result even though they are not the focus of a learning objective.
The following table provides examples of questions and
instructional strategies for implementing mathematical routines into the course:

§§ What quantities are given?
§§ What quantity is needed to answer the question?
§§ What relationship(s) link the needed quantities with the given quantities?
Have students work backward from a given mathematical routine to a physical situation.
For example, students can be given an equation such as = − 2 4 6 9 m m m s s and then be asked to create another representation from this equation, such as a written scenario that this equation could represent, a position versus time graph, a velocity versus time graph, a motion map, etc.

Strategies 2.2 The student can apply mathematical routines to quantities that describe natural phenomena.
§§ What laws, definitions, or mathematical relationships exist that relate to the given problem?
§§ What are the rules, assumptions, or limitations surrounding the use of the chosen law, definition, or relationship?
§§ Did the calculation begin with an equation or a fundamental physics relationship, law, or definition?
§§ Are the steps clearly written out and annotated?
§§ Are any steps skipped?
§§ Is the unknown quantity clearly labeled as the final answer, complete with units?
Have students perform a task where the calculations (plugging and chugging) are already done—a task that will force the students to focus on making important distinctions that physicists consider critical. For example, have students determine whether a specified calculation is meaningful or meaningless— this is entirely different from plugging numerical values into an equation and turning the crank.
Meaningful, meaningless calculation tasks are another tool to get students to process information about a concept or principle in a different way.

Science Practice 3: Scientific Questioning
The student can engage in scientific questioning to
extend thinking or to guide investigations within the context of the AP course.
Research scientists pose and answer meaningful
questions. Students may easily miss this point since,
depending on how a science class is taught, it may seem that science is about compiling and passing
down a large body of known facts (e.g., the acceleration
of a free-falling object is 9.8 m/s2). Helping students
learn how to pose, refine, and evaluate scientific
questions is an important but difficult instructional
and cognitive goal. Students need to be guided away from asking “fuzzy” questions about queries that
are measurable and testable. A first step in refining
questions might be to guide students to consider all the
ways one might measure relevant physical quantities,
leading to further discussions about how one would evaluate questions by designing and carrying out
experiments and then evaluating data and findings.
The following table provides examples of questions
and instructional strategies for implementing scientific questioning into the course:
Science Practice
Key Questions
Instructional Notes or Sample Activities

Strategies 3.1 The student can pose scientific questions.

§§ Desktop
Experiment Tasks §§ Write and Switch 3.2 The student can refine scientific questions.
§§ How can scientific questions be modified to make them testable?
§§ How can a scientific question be refined concerning a proposed incorrect relationship between variables?
Have students practice engaging in scientific questioning. For example, have students start by asking questions about the relationships between linear momentum and kinetic energy before and after a collision. As a first step, students might consider in what ways one can measure physical quantities relevant to the collision, leading to a discussion of mass, velocity, momentum, and kinetic energy. Follow-up discussions can lead to how one goes about evaluating questions such as, “Does the conservation of momentum and/or kinetic energy depend on the type of collision?” by designing and carrying out experiments and then evaluating data and findings.

Science Practice 4: Experimental Methods
The student can plan and implement data collection strategies in relation to a particular scientific question.
Scientific questions can range in scope, from broad
to narrow, as well as in specificity, from determining influencing factors and/or causes to determining mechanisms. The question posed will determine the
type of data to be collected and will influence the plan for collecting data. Designing and improving
experimental designs and/or data-collection strategies
is a learned skill. Class discussion can reveal issues of measurement uncertainty and assumptions in data collection. Students need to understand that
the results of collecting and using data to determine
a numerical answer to a question are best thought of
as an interval, not a single number. This interval, the
experimental uncertainty, is due to a combination of
uncertainty in the instruments used and the process
of taking the measurement. Although detailed error
analysis is not necessary to convey this pivotal idea, it is
important that students make some reasoned estimate
of the interval within which they know the value of a
measured data point and can express their results in a way that makes this clear.
The following table provides examples of questions and
instructional strategies for implementing data-collection resources into the course:
Science Practice

Instructional
Strategies 4.1 The student can justify the selection of the kind of data needed to answer a particular scientific question.
§§ What data is necessary to answer the scientific question?
§§ What physical law, equation, or relationship links the scientific question with the collected data?
Have students practice justifying the selection of the kind of data needed to answer a particular scientific question.
For example, have students design an experiment and analyze data to determine the relationship between the change in angular momentum of a system and the product of the average torque applied to the system and the time interval during which the torque is exerted.

§§ What will be done with the data (data analysis) to answer the scientific question?
Have students practice designing plans for collecting data to answer scientific questions. Laboratory design procedures do not always have to be carried out.
For example, have students design an experiment and analyze graphical data where the area under a velocity versus time graph is needed to determine the displacement of an object.

Science Practice 5: Data Analysis
The student can perform data analysis and evaluation of evidence.
Students often think that to make a graph, they need
to connect the data points, or that the best-fit function
is always linear. Thus, it is important that they can
construct a best-fit curve even for data that do not
fit a linear relationship. Students should be able to
represent data points as intervals whose size depends
on the experimental uncertainty. After students find a
pattern in the data, they need to ask why this pattern
is present and try to explain it using the knowledge
that they have. When dealing with a new phenomenon,
they should be able to devise a testable explanation
of the pattern, if possible. It is important that students understand that instruments do not produce exact measurements and learn what steps they can take
to decrease uncertainty. Students should be able to design a second experiment to determine the same
quantity and then check for consistency across the
two measurements, comparing two results by writing
them both as intervals and not as single, absolute
numbers. Finally, students should be able to revise
their reasoning based on the new data, which for some
may appear anomalous. The analysis, interpretation,
and application of quantitative information are vital
skills for students in AP Physics 1. Analysis skills can
be taught using any type of data, but students will be
more invested in the data analysis if it is data they have
collected through their own investigations. Teachers
are encouraged to provide opportunities for students
to analyze data, draw conclusions, and apply their
knowledge to the enduring understandings and learning objectives in the course.
The following table provides examples of questions and
instructional strategies for implementing data analysis resources into the course:

§§ How should the data be graphed so that the best-fit curve shows a relationship?
§§ How can data intervals be used to show experimental uncertainty?
§§ What do the data or graph show?
§§ What trends and patterns can you identify from the data?
§§ Why is the pattern present in the data? What does the pattern show about the relationship between quantities?
Have students practice analyzing data to find patterns and relationships. For example, have students analyze data (or a visual representation) describing the motion of an object and express the results of the analysis using narrative, mathematical, and graphical representations.

§§ How can a second experiment be designed to answer the same scientific question?
§§ What steps can be taken to decrease the uncertainty in the measurements and data?
Have students practice refining observations and measurements. For example, have students perform data analysis, evaluate evidence compared to the prediction, explain any discrepancy, and, if necessary, revise the relationship among variables responsible for the period of a pendulum.

Science Practice 6: Argumentation
The student can work with scientific explanations and theories.
A scientific explanation, accounting for an observed phenomenon, needs to be experimentally testable.
One should be able to use it to make predictions about new phenomena. A theory uses a unified approach to account for a large set of phenomena and gives
accounts that are consistent with multiple experimental
outcomes within the range of applicability of the theory.
Examples of theories in physics include the kinetic
molecular theory, quantum theory, and atomic theory.
Students should understand the difference between explanations and theories.
Students should be prepared to offer evidence, construct reasoned arguments for their claim from the evidence, and use the claim or explanation to
make predictions. A prediction states the expected outcome of a particular experimental design based
on an explanation or a claim under scrutiny. Physicists examine data and evidence to develop claims about
physical phenomena. As they articulate their claims, physicists use reasoning processes that rely on
their awareness of different types of relationships,
connections, and patterns within the data and evidence.
They then formulate a claim and develop an argument that explains how the claim is supported by the
available evidence. AP Physics 1 teachers should help
students learn how to create persuasive and meaningful
arguments by improving their proficiency with each of these practices.
The following table provides examples of strategies for
implementing argumentation resources into the course:

Strategies 6.1 The student can justify claims with evidence.
§§ What is evidence, and how does it differ from reasoning?
Have students identify and explain the evidence that supports their claim, with an emphasis on how the evidence supports the claim.

Students should analyze possibilities and the evidence for and against each position.
Have students choose a position and write a defensible claim or thesis that reflects their reasoning and evidence.
§§ Conflicting

Science Practice 7: Making Connections
The student is able to connect and relate knowledge across various scales, concepts, and representations in and across domains.
Students should have the opportunity to transfer their
learning across disciplinary boundaries so that they are
able to link, synthesize, and apply the ideas they learn
across the sciences and mathematics. Research on how
people learn indicates that providing multiple contexts
in which major ideas apply facilitates transfer; this allows
students to bundle knowledge and memory together with
the multiple contexts to which it applies. Students should
also be able to recognize seemingly appropriate contexts to which major concepts and ideas do not apply.
The following table provides examples of questions

§§ What important features of the models and/or representations connect the phenomena across spatial and temporal scales?
Have students practice connecting phenomena across spatial and temporal scales. Problem solving in isolation of one unit will not prepare students for the
AP Physics 1 Exam.
Have students connect representations between topics and big ideas.
For example, students should be able to articulate situations when the gravitational force is the dominant force and when the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces can be ignored.

Section II: Free-Response Questions
The following are examples of the kinds of free-response questions found on the exam.
Note that on the actual AP Exam, there will be one experimental design question, one
quantitative/qualitative translation question, one paragraph argument short answer
question, and two additional short answer questions.
FREE-RESPONSE QUESTION: QUANTITATIVE/QUALITATIVE
TRANSLATION 1.
A small sphere of mass M is suspended by a string of length L. The sphere is
made to move in a horizontal circle of radius R at a constant speed, as shown
above. The center of the circle is labeled point C, and the string makes an 0  with the vertical.
(A)	 Two students are discussing the motion of the sphere and make the following statements.
Student 1: None of the forces exerted on the sphere are in the direction of
point C, the center of the circular path. Therefore, I don’t see how there can
be a centripetal force exerted on the sphere to make it move in a circle.
Student 2: I see another problem. The tension force exerted by the string
is at an angle from the vertical. Therefore, its vertical component must
be less than the weight Mg of the sphere. That means the net force on the
sphere has a downward vertical component, and the sphere should move downward as well as moving around in a circle.
i.	 What is one aspect of Student 1’s reasoning that is incorrect?
ii.	 What is one aspect of Student 2’s reasoning that is incorrect?
(B)
i.	 Derive an equation for the magnitude of the net force exerted on
the sphere. Express your answer in terms of M, theta, and physical constants, as appropriate.
ii.	 Describe one aspect or step in your derivation of part (b)(i) that can be
correctly linked to your answer to either part (a)(i) or part (a)(ii).

(E)
Briefly state why the torque is in the direction you indicated.
One point for indicating that the torque is clockwise (claim) with acceptable reasoning that connects the
claim with evidence. (Note: If the incorrect selection is made, the response is not graded.)
Examples of acceptable reasoning:
1.	 At the sphere’s maximum rightward displacement, the sphere’s rotation is changing from
counterclockwise (swinging to the right) to clockwise (swinging to the left). So the torque must be clockwise.
2.	 At the sphere’s maximum rightward displacement, the gravitational force (taken to act at the
center of the sphere) exerts a clockwise torque about the point of attachment to the string.
Examples of acceptable evidence:
•	 The sphere is rotating counterclockwise when moving to the right, toward its maximum rightward displacement.
•	 The sphere is rotating clockwise when moving to the left, away from its maximum rightward displacement.
•	 The gravitational force is in the downward direction. Treated as acting at the center of the sphere, this
force is exerted at a location (the sphere’s center) that is to the right of the point of attachment.

(A)
Draw and label the forces (not components) exerted on the block.
Accept the following:
FG
FH
FS
One point for including all three labelled forces exerted on the block:
•	 the upward spring force, •	 the downward gravitational force,
•	 and the downward force of the hand holding the block.
1 point 1.1
One point for including at least one of the three forces exerted on the block, with no extraneous forces.
1 point 1.1
Total for part (A) 2 points
(B)
In a clear, coherent paragraph-length response that may also contain diagrams and/or equations,
indicate why the total mechanical energy is increasing, decreasing, or constant for each of the systems listed below.
•	 System 1: The block
•	 System 2: The block and the spring
•	 System 3: The block, the spring, and Earth
One point for a response with no incorrect claims about which forms of energy are present in each system.
•	 Note: Responses that do not explicitly refer to the forms of energy in one or more of the systems can still earn this point.
1 point 6.4
The correct forms of energy in each system are the following:
•	 System 1: Kinetic energy Kblock of the block (There is no potential energy for system 1.)
•	 System 2: Kblock and the potential energy Uspring of the spring
•	 System 3: Kblock, Uspring, and the gravitational potential energy Ugrav of the block-Earth system
One point for correctly providing an indication that total mechanical energy is increasing for the block.
Examples of acceptable statements:
•	 The block is accelerating upward with increasing speed.
•	 The net force on the block is upward, in the direction of the block’s velocity, so the block’s kinetic energy is increasing.

AP Physics 1: Algebra-Based Course and Exam Description
One point for correct statement of why the total mechanical energy is decreasing for the block-spring system.
Examples of acceptable reasoning statements:
•
The only external forces exerted on the block-spring system (system 2) are the gravitational force
on the block and the force holding the top end of the spring in place. The gravitational force is in
the opposite direction of the block’s motion and so does negative work on system 2. The point of
application of the force on the top end of the spring does not move, so this force does zero work on the
system. Overall, negative work is being done on system 2, so E2 must be decreasing.
•
System 2 has total mechanical energy:
E
K
U 2 block spring = + , which equals E
U 3 grav − .
E3 is the total mechanical energy of System 3. E3 is constant, while Ugrav is increasing because the block is moving upward. So E
E
U 2 3 grav = − must be decreasing.
1 point 2.1
One point for correct statement that the total mechanical energy is constant for a closed system such as the block-spring-Earth system.
Examples of acceptable claim statements:
•
System 3 is closed, so its total mechanical energy remains constant.
•
No external forces act on system 3, so its total mechanical energy remains constant.
Note: It is not necessary to state that energy is neither dissipated or added by converting other forms of
energy into mechanical energy, since there is no mention of potential causes for these processes (e.g.,
friction to dissipate mechanical energy, or an explosion to add mechanical energy).
1 point 6.4
One point for a logical, relevant, and internally consistent argument that addresses the required argument, explanation or question asked.
Example of an acceptable response:
•
For system 1 of just the block: When the force holding the block is removed, the block’s acceleration
and the net force on the block are upward since the spring force is greater than the gravitational
force. The net force is in the direction of the block’s motion, so its speed and kinetic energy
are both increasing. The total mechanical energy is the kinetic energy for a single-object system, so E1 is increasing.
System 3 can be considered a closed system with no external forces exerted on it, so E3 is constant.
Note that:
= + + ′ 3 block spring grav
E
K
U
U
where Kblockis the block’s kinetic energy, Uspring is the spring’s potential energy, and Ugrav is the
gravitational potential energy of the block-Earth system.
System 2 has total mechanical energy:
E
K
U 2 block spring = + , which equals E
U 3 grav − .
E3 is constant, while Ugrav is increasing because the block is moving upward. So E
E
U 2 3 grav = − must be decreasing.

Total for part (B) 5 points
Total for question 2 7 points
