## Learning the Pattern of Pacing and Leading

The processes of pacing and leading are simultaneously simple and complex. They can be learned from this book, but one must study, practice, test, and reflect upon them in order to have the patterns become internalized. For this reason we have organized the information in several ways. First, we have just offered a brief definition of pacing and leading. Second, we offer a more detailed account of the structures and skills of pacing, then leading. Next, we explore theories about the changes in body chemistry during pacing and leading, along with responses of the autonomic nervous system that the coach can observe and use to guide the interaction. We explore more about leading after that, and finally we describe a set of principles of intervention.
