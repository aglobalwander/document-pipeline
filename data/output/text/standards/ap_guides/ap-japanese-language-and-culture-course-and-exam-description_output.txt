For further information, visit collegeboard.org.
AP Equity and Access Policy
College Board strongly encourages educators to make equitable access a guiding
principle for their AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared
students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination
of barriers that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and
socioeconomic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented. Schools
should make every effort to ensure their AP classes reflect the diversity of their
student population. College Board also believes that all students should have
access to academically challenging course work before they enroll in AP classes,
which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to
equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.

About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students to
pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to
earn college credit, advanced placement, or both—while
still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects,
each culminating in a challenging exam, students learn
to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see
many sides of an issue—skills that prepare them for
college and beyond. Taking AP courses demonstrates
to college admission officers that students have sought
the most challenging curriculum available to them, and
research indicates that students who score a 3 or higher
on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic
success in college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s
syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some
of the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and AP
Exams are developed and scored by college faculty and
experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges and
universities in the United States grant credit, advanced
placement, or both on the basis of successful AP Exam
scores—more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams
emphasize challenging, research-based curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the content
and skills that are the focus of the corresponding
college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also
organizes the content and skills into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many AP teachers have
told us they follow in order to focus their instruction.
The intention of this publication is to respect teachers’
time and expertise by providing a roadmap that they
can modify and adapt to their local priorities and
preferences. Moreover, by organizing the AP course
content and skills into units, the AP Program is able
to provide teachers and students with free formative assessments—Personal Progress Checks—that
teachers can assign throughout the year to measure
student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students: Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their AP
programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We
encourage the elimination of barriers that restrict access
to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic
groups that have been traditionally underserved. College
Board also believes that all students should have access
to academically challenging coursework before they
enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP
success. It is only through a commitment to equitable
preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses: The AP
Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP courses
must participate in the AP Course Audit, a process through which AP teachers’ course materials are
reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit was
created to provide teachers and administrators with
clear guidelines on curricular and resource requirements
for AP courses and to help colleges and universities
validate courses marked “AP” on students’ transcripts.
This process ensures that AP teachers’ courses meet
or exceed the curricular and resource expectations that
college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.

=== Page 9 ===
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the AP teacher
and the school principal (or designated administrator) to
confirm awareness and understanding of the curricular
and resource requirements. A syllabus or course outline,
detailing how course requirements are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The AP
Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor; all
AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision, piloting,
and analysis to ensure that questions are accurate, fair,
and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development, College
Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher education
institutions. This feedback is carefully considered to
ensure that AP courses and exams are able to provide
students with a college-level learning experience and
the opportunity to demonstrate their qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam development process, relies on the expertise of both AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course
performance assessments, as applicable, are scored by
thousands of college faculty and expert AP teachers.
Most are scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small
portion is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly
trained, and their work is monitored throughout the
Reading for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves
as Chief Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP
Readers in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy
of the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a curve.
Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which means that
every student who meets the criteria for an AP score of
2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no matter how many
students that is. The criteria for the number of points
students must earn on the AP Exam to receive scores
of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently
validates for credit and placement purposes—include:
§Bullet The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
Bullet The number of points researchers have found to
be predictive that an AP student will succeed when
placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
§Bullet Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP
scores as follows:
AP Score

While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for
scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and universities.
To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/placement
policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/ creditpolicies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for
seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score
the free-response sections of the AP Exams. Ninety eight percent of surveyed educators who took part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an AP
Reader, including opportunities to:
Bullet Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
Bullet Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP
scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure to the quality and depth of the responses from the
entire pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
§Bullet Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
§Bullet Score from home: AP Readers have online distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects. Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
§Bullet Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs): AP
Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all assessed
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide scaffolds
skill instruction across units and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course themes and skills, create
customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
§Bullet Teachers and students sign in to, or create, their College Board accounts.
§Bullet Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
§Bullet Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
§Bullet Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP coordinator.
§Bullet Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and
AP coordinators to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following
additional benefits:
§Bullet Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
§Bullet Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
§Bullet Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student pack.
The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
Bullet Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

About the AP Japanese
Language and Culture Course
The AP Japanese Language and Culture course emphasizes communication (understanding and being
understood by others) by applying the interpersonal,
interpretive, and presentational modes of communication
in real-life situations. This includes vocabulary usage,
language control, communication strategies, and cultural awareness. The AP Japanese Language and Culture course strives not to overemphasize grammatical accuracy at the expense of communication. To best
facilitate the study of language and culture, the course is taught almost exclusively in Japanese.
The course engages students in an exploration of culture
in both contemporary and historical contexts. The course
develops students’ awareness and appreciation of social,
political, and educational issues (e.g., the role of religion
in society, traditional versus modern gender roles),
as well as more traditional topics (e.g., arts, customs,
festivals, geography, and history). Throughout the
course, students develop interpersonal skills that enable
them to request and confirm the receipt of information,
ask for and provide directions, and issue and respond
to invitations. They also develop more cognitively
challenging functional language skills, including the
ability to compare phenomena, express opinions and
preferences, and discuss life experiences. Additionally,
students develop a command of a significant number of the most prevalent kanji characters used in Japanese writing.
College Course Equivalent
The AP Japanese Language and Culture course is
designed to be comparable to fourth semester (or the
equivalent) college/university courses in Japanese language and culture.
Prerequisites
There are no prerequisite courses; however, students
are typically in their fourth year of high school–level
Japanese language study. In the case of native or
heritage speakers, there may be a different pathway of study leading to this course.

Introduction
In today’s global community, competence in more than one language is
an essential part of communication and cultural understanding. Study of
another language not only provides individuals with the ability to express
thoughts and ideas for their own purposes but also gives them access to
perspectives and knowledge that are only available through the language
and culture. Advanced language learning offers social, cultural, academic,
and workplace benefits that will serve students throughout their lives. The
proficiencies acquired through the study of languages and literatures endow
language learners with cognitive, analytical, and communication skills that
carry over into many other areas of their academic studies.
The three modes of communication—interpersonal, interpretive, and presentational—defined in the
World Readiness Standards for Learning Languages are foundational to the AP Japanese Language and Culture course. The AP course provides students
with opportunities to demonstrate their proficiency in each of the three modes in the Intermediate to Pre-Advanced range as described in the ACTFL
Performance Descriptors for Language Learners. Its
aim is to provide students with ongoing and varied
opportunities to further develop their proficiencies
across the full range of language skills within a cultural frame of reference reflective of the richness of Japanese language and culture.
The AP Japanese Language and Culture course takes a holistic approach to language proficiency and recognizes the complex interrelatedness of comprehension and comprehensibility, vocabulary
usage, language control, communication strategies, and cultural awareness. Students should learn language structures in context and use them to convey meaning. In standards-based world language
classrooms, the instructional focus is on function
and not the examination of irregularity and complex grammatical paradigms about the target language.
Language structures should be addressed inasmuch as they serve the communicative task and not as an end goal unto themselves. The AP Japanese
Language and Culture course strives to promote both fluency and accuracy in language use and avoid overemphasis on grammatical accuracy at the
expense of communication. In order to best facilitate
the study of language and culture, the course is taught in the target language.

Course Skills
The following table lays out the basic language and communication skills that students are expected to develop in
the course. As shown later, each skill is further broken out into concrete learning objectives, which are described below in the section on Unit Guides on page 17.
The course framework includes the following essential components:
1   SKILLS
At the core of the AP Japanese Language and Culture course are course skills identifying what students
should know and be able to do to succeed in the course. Students should develop and apply the
described skills on a regular basis over the span of the course.
2   THEMES
The course is based on six suggested course themes that help teachers integrate language, content,
and culture into a series of lessons and activities. Within each theme are recommended contexts and
overarching essential questions that engage students, guide their classroom investigations, and promote the use of language in a variety of contexts.
3 
Foundational to the course are the three modes of communication: interpretive, interpersonal, and
presentational, as defined in ACTFL’s World Readiness Standards for Learning Languages. Throughout
the course, students demonstrate their abilities in the interpretive mode by engaging with written, print,
visual, audiovisual, and audio texts; in the interpersonal mode by speaking with and writing for others; and
in the presentational mode by speaking to and writing for an audience.
4 
Each unit in the course features several of the task models that students will encounter on the exam,
which build in difficulty and complexity over time to the level that matches the exam’s expectations. These
task models include sixteen different types of activities (stimuli with questions) that address interpretive
communication and four free-response tasks that address the interpersonal and presentational modes.

Course Themes
To provide context and content for students to develop their skills in the modes of communication, the course
takes a thematic approach. There are six suggested course themes: Families and Communities, Personal and
Public Identities, Beauty and Aesthetics, Science and Technology, Contemporary Life, and Global Challenges.
Families and Communities
Science and Technology
Contemporary
Life
Global
Challenges
Beauty and Aesthetics
Personal and Public Identities
Within each of these themes, there are five to seven recommended contexts, shown below. The course is organized
thematically into six units. Each unit targets a primary theme but also connects to additional recommended
contexts for those themes. Teaching to multiple themes in every unit ensures a rich curriculum that will spiral, as the
themes are revisited through a variety of lenses throughout the course. This allows students to experience the study
of language and culture in a variety of authentic and engaging ways and provides teachers with the opportunity to
consider the interests and needs of their students when designing instruction. While teachers may organize the
course thematically in any way they choose, adhering to the recommended course design provided by the unit
guides that follow ensures that all the required courses themes are addressed multiple times in a scaffolded manner.

ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS
Related to the themes are essential questions designed to spark curiosity and encourage students to investigate
and express different views on real-world issues, make connections to other disciplines, and compare aspects of
the target culture(s) to their own. Essential questions also lend themselves well to interdisciplinary inquiry, asking
students to apply skills and perspectives across content areas while working with content from language, literature, and cultures of the Japanese-speaking world.
Course Modes
As students work with course themes and consider essential questions, they do so while engaging in the three modes
of communication—interpretive, interpersonal, and presentational. The development of skills in each of these modes
forms the core of the units, as students build skills in listening, reading, speaking, and writing tasks of increasing levels
of complexity as they work through the course. Students are expected to build skills in the following areas:
§Bullet Spoken Interpersonal Communication §Bullet Written Interpersonal Communication
§Bullet Audio, Visual, and Audiovisual Interpretive
Communication
§Bullet Written and Print Interpretive Communication §Bullet Spoken Presentational Communication §Bullet
Course Task Models
As students work with the modes of communication listed above, they practice various task models that
familiarize them with what will be on the exam while helping them build linguistic skills and cultural competencies.

Introduction
This course is organized into six units that are based on the recommended
themes. This creates an interesting, meaningful context in which to
explore a variety of language and cultural concepts in the interpretive,
interpersonal, and presentational modes. The themes in each unit help
teachers integrate language, content, and culture into an interrelated
series of lessons and activities that promote the use of the language in a variety of contexts.
This unit structure respects new AP teachers' time by providing one
possible sequence they can adopt or modify rather than having to build
from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units enable the AP
Program to provide interested teachers with formative assessments—the
Personal Progress Checks—that they can assign their students at the end
of each unit to gauge progress toward success on the AP exam. However,
experienced AP teachers who are satisfied with their current course
organization and exam results should feel no pressure to adopt these
units, which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

Skill Categories and Learning Objectives
At the core of the AP Japanese Language and Culture course are learning
objectives that identify what students should know and be able to do
across the three modes of communication. The interpretive mode is
divided into four skill categories with underlying learning objectives. There
are two skill categories associated with the interpersonal mode and two with the presentational mode.
The table that follows on pages 19–21 shows all eight skills categories
with their associated skills and the learning objectives that will help students develop those skills.

Building Course Skills describes specific skills that are appropriate to focus on in that unit.
Preparing for the AP Exam provides helpful tips and common
student challenges identified from prior exam data and chief reader reports.
UNIT 1
Families in Different Societies
Building Course Skills
Students build skills in interpreting audio and written texts by
working on various listening and reading tasks. The listening
task models addressed in this unit include voice messages,
radio cultural documentaries, school debates, instructions,
and radio news broadcasts. Reading task models include
letters, step-by-step instructions, and short stories. In performing these tasks, students learn to
§ identify main ideas, details, audience, purpose, point of view, theme, and sequence of events or process.
§ determine the meaning of unfamiliar words and infer implied meanings through context.
§ analyze and determine the meaning of a text using
provided cultural and interdisciplinary information.
Practice in the interpretive mode prepares students to
engage in the interpersonal and presentational modes as they
§ participate in oral and written exchanges of information,
opinions, and ideas on aspects of family life in a
Japanese-speaking culture and another culture.
§ write formal and informal correspondence using
appropriate register and the three writing systems.
§ provide suggestions or opinions with supporting details or examples on familiar topics.
§ use reasons, details, and examples to explain their
perspectives or preferences on relevant topics covered in this unit.
Preparing for the AP Exam
In this unit, students encounter multiple-choice questions
presented in the format in which they appear on the AP Exam.
Consistent exposure to the exam’s format in all units helps
students prepare for the exam. As the units progress, the
level of complexity of selected materials and expectations for student performance increase.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE: MULTIPLE CHOICE
In a school debate, students may find it difficult to
understand different viewpoints of each side. To address these challenges
§ teachers can offer strategies for taking notes while
listening to the school debate and encourage students to identify tone or attitude and supporting details.
§ teachers can initially provide a graphic organizer with
questions that help students identify tone and supporting
details such as: Is the speaker confident about the
position that he or she is taking? Or, how is the viewpoint
supported? As students’ skills increase, teachers can
remove the graphic organizer and have students list
questions that will need to be answered by the debate so that they are able to identify main ideas and supporting details.
§ students can listen to the source multiple times, with
the teacher pausing occasionally to check for students’
understanding. Teachers can reduce the number of times
the recording is played as students’ skills increase.
In short stories, students may struggle to identify the
theme, moral, or main idea. They may also find it challenging
to make inferences about the message of the story. To address these challenges
§ in early course units, teachers can select brief stories that
have a simple storyline and ask students to identify the
theme and main idea. The short stories can increase in complexity in later units.
§ teachers can ask students to predict what may happen
next or how the story may finish during group reading of
short stories. This practice enhances students’ ability to make inferences.
In this unit, students will encounter four free-response
questions that align with the format and instructions students
will see on the AP Exam. In this unit and in those that follow,
students practice a free-response question with a text chat,
compare and contrast article, conversation, and cultural
perspective presentation, with gradually increasing levels of complexity.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE: FREE RESPONSE
Students have difficulty converting to kanji from hiragana correctly.
§ Teachers should remind students to hit the space bar
after they finish typing a complete word or phrase.
Because word(s)/phrases typed will display multiple kanji
options on the screen, students must identify and then
select the correct one(s) instead of choosing the one(s) that are displayed first in the sequence.
§ To reduce mistakes in kanji selection or phonetic
misspellings, teachers can assign daily typing practice
in hiragana, katakana, and kanji. With practice, students become comfortable switching between hiragana and
katakana, and converting to kanji correctly as needed.
In text chat, students sometimes find it difficult to elaborate
their ideas in response to the incoming text messages
and may therefore provide a limited response. To address this challenge
§ teachers can provide sample text messages and have
students work in pairs to identify the purpose of the
message, what is being requested, and other pertinent details before responding.

Developing Understanding
Unit 1 explores themes related to families in Japanese-speaking communities that provide
a meaningful context for students to acquire and develop a variety of language and cultural
concepts. While the primary focus will be on the theme of Families and Communities,
teachers should interweave the themes of Personal and Public Identifies, Contemporary Life,
and Global Challenges with recommended contexts suggested below. Through exploring these relevant themes, students could
§ discuss how families shape values and traditions as well as personal beliefs and personal interests.
§ examine challenges faced by families, such as access to education and jobs.
§ express their own understanding of the evolving concept and role of families in contemporary societies.
Using a thematic approach helps teachers to integrate language, content, and culture into
lessons that build skills in the three modes of communication—interpretive, interpersonal,
and presentational. The development of skills in each of these modes forms the core of this and all subsequent units.

§Bullet teachers can provide students with a checklist of
grammar and mechanical errors to look for and address
when reviewing their own or peer-reviewing others’ work.
§Bullet student pairs can then exchange their email responses for peer review. These peer reviews can provide
feedback on the accuracy of the response, grammar or
mechanical errors, and even provide suggestions for extending the response.

provide an organized article with a beginning, middle, and end.
To address this challenge, teachers can
§Bullet provide examples of compare and contrast articles outlining the beginning, middle, and end.
Bullet ask students to brainstorm vocabulary and explanations.
At the start of the school year, teachers can create a vocabulary bank that includes words, terms, and expressions. As the year progresses, teachers and students can add to the class vocabulary bank.
§Bullet ask students for ideas about ways to respond to each
question in the prompt. Teachers can then suggest some transitional expressions to link their ideas.
In a conversation, students may not fully understand the
interlocutor. Some students struggle to provide detailed and
well-elaborated responses. To address these challenges, teachers can
§Bullet provide conversations for students to listen to. During
the conversations, teachers can pause the recording and formatively assess students’ understanding.
§Bullet ask individual students to practice conversations in
class and then ask others to provide more details after each response.
In cultural perspective presentations, students often fail
to address all aspects of the prompt and may lack sufficient
cultural information or provide an off-task response. To address this challenge, teachers can

ESSENTIAL
QUESTIONS §Bullet How does one’s identity evolve over time?

§Bullet How does language shape our cultural identity?

§Bullet How does technology influence the development of personal and public identity? How does the art of community reflect its public identify?

Developing Understanding
Unit 2 looks at how language and culture influence identity in Japanese-speaking societies.
This relevant and engaging theme provides a meaningful context for students to acquire and
develop a variety of more nuanced linguistic and cultural concepts as well as vocabulary.
While the primary focus will be on the theme of Personal and Public Identities, teachers are
encouraged to interweave the themes of Beauty and Aesthetics, Contemporary Life, and
Science and Technology. For example, students could
§Bullet explore how developments in science and technology impact language and the ways we
communicate and, ultimately, how we see ourselves.
§Bullet examine how social media impacts personal image and identity.
§Bullet consider the role of advertising in shaping personal and public identity.
§Bullet explore how a community’s identity is reflected in its art.

UNIT 2 46

The Influence of Language and Culture on Identity
Building Course Skills
In this unit, students build skills in interpreting audio and written
texts by engaging with various listening and reading tasks.
The listening task models addressed in this unit are radio
broadcasts, cultural presentations, public announcements,
and uncontextualized dialogues. Reading task models include
travel brochures, journalistic articles, step-by-step instructions,
and email inbox. Building on skills developed in Unit 1, students
§Bullet identify purpose, audience, perspectives, tone or attitude, main ideas, and supporting ideas.
§Bullet summarize content and sequence information.
§Bullet deduce the meaning of unfamiliar words and explain idiomatic and culturally authentic expressions.
§Bullet use provided cultural and/or interdisciplinary information to determine the meaning of a text.
Practice in the interpretive mode prepares students to engage
in the interpersonal and presentational modes as they
§Bullet initiate, sustain, and close oral conversations and written
communications using simple and compound sentences
and a varied vocabulary that includes idiomatic and culturally appropriate expressions.
§Bullet provide and obtain information on the theme of this unit
using strategies such as circumlocution, clarification, and
paraphrasing to maintain oral or written exchanges.
§Bullet identify and explain cultural differences through
comparing Japanese cultural products, practices, and perspectives with those of their own culture.
§Bullet use a variety of vocabulary, sentence structures, and
transitional phrases to create an organized short article,
in which students identify, compare, and explain two
opposing sides of a specific topic addressed in this unit and state their preferences.
Preparing for the AP Exam
AREAS OF CHALLENGE: MULTIPLE CHOICE
In uncontextualized dialogue, students find inferring implied
meanings challenging. Teachers can help by exposing
students to dialogues on a variety of topics throughout the course with a gradual increase in complexity:
§Bullet Before students listen, teachers can present background
information on the audio text. As students listen, teachers
can pause a recording at several key points to ask
students to identify specific details and inferences.
§Bullet Early in the course, teachers should consider topics
related to Families and Communities and Personal and
Public Identities. Later, they can increase the complexity
of the dialogues by selecting topics related to more challenging or less familiar course themes.
§Bullet As students listen to these dialogues, teachers can
discuss the main idea and the implied meaning. Helping
students make the distinction between the main idea and
the implied meanings early in the course will prepare them for success on the AP Exam.
In public announcements, students struggle to deduce the
meaning of unfamiliar words, phrases, and idioms. To address this challenge
§Bullet teachers can provide authentic public announcements
on familiar topics. Students can work in pairs to identify
relevant details, define unfamiliar vocabulary, and add those explanations to the class vocabulary bank.
§Bullet as the course progresses, teachers can introduce more
complexity by providing public announcements on less
familiar topics that are tied to the course themes. Students
can work to use the context of the announcement to
help define unfamiliar words, phrases, and idioms. When
encountering unknown information, students can make educated guesses using cues from the sources.
In journalistic articles, students often have difficulty making
connections among cultural and interdisciplinary information provided. To address this challenge
§Bullet teachers can prepare a word bank taken from the text for
students to predict and analyze the possible content of the text before reading.
§Bullet teachers and students can continue to add challenging words and phrases to the course word bank.
§Bullet teachers can encourage students to work more independently as they become more proficient. By
using their understanding of the vocabulary, students
can predict and analyze the possible content of the text before reading.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE: FREE RESPONSE
As mentioned in Unit 1, in the text chat, students find it
difficult to elaborate their ideas in response to the incoming
text. In addition to this challenge, students also struggle
to apply a variety of vocabulary, idioms, and complex
sentence structures to address each question as fully and
appropriately as possible. To address these challenges
§Bullet students should build vocabulary and sentence
structures in contexts related to course themes. Instead
of relying on isolated vocabulary lists and grammar points,
teachers should help students acquire contextualized
vocabulary and grammatical structure through authentic and pedagogical sources.
§Bullet teachers can also design communicative tasks that
require students to use new vocabulary and sentence
structures to solve problems or provide solutions in the target language.

Influences of Beauty and Art
Building Course Skills
In this unit, the listening task models include voice messages,
radio cultural documentaries, radio news broadcasts, school
debates, instructions, and cultural presentations. Reading
task models include letters and short stories. Students build
and refine skills in interpreting audio and written texts by
engaging with texts of increasing complexity as they
§Bullet identify and explain the theme or moral in short stories.
§Bullet use context to deduce meaning of unfamiliar words and idiomatic and culturally authentic expressions.
§Bullet identify main idea, details, audience, point of view, perspectives, tone, purpose, and theme.
Practice in the interpretive mode prepares students to
engage in the interpersonal and presentational modes.
Building on skills developed in Unit 2, they
§Bullet build academic vocabulary needed for carrying out speaking and writing tasks.
§Bullet exchange information, ideas, and opinions on this unit’s themes using a variety of vocabulary and sentence structures.
§Bullet use standard conventions in emails and letters and
apply the appropriate register in both speaking and writing tasks.
§Bullet create and deliver presentations on the topics addressed
in this unit by including perspectives and concrete examples with an introduction, development of the discussed topic, and conclusion.
Preparing for the AP Exam
As the primary theme for this unit is Beauty and Aesthetics,
students begin to move away from talking about topics
with which they have direct personal experience, such as
Families and Communities and Personal and Public Identities,
to talking about topics with which they may be less familiar.
These more complex topics require students to acquire more
information about their external world—introducing them to
unfamiliar and challenging vocabulary and requiring students
to make cultural and interdisciplinary connections. Teachers
can help students with this transition by providing exposure
to more varied content within more complex themes.
responses. Some examples of strategies for increasing
complexity and empowering students to identify and address challenges are shared below.
In addition to moving toward more complex themes, teachers
should also work with students to develop strategies that
help them address challenging content with less teacher
assistance. This gradual release of control allows students
to continue to work through course challenges, even when
they make an error or are not completely certain of their
AREAS OF CHALLENGE: MULTIPLE CHOICE
In the radio culture documentary, students sometimes
struggle to determine or infer the meaning of a text using
cultural and interdisciplinary information provided in the
documentary. To address this challenge, teachers can
Bullet	 help students become familiar with various cultural topics
by exposing them to authentic visual, audio, audiovisual, and written sources throughout all units.
§Bullet illustrate content and connections among cultural and interdisciplinary topics.
§Bullet anticipate which cultural and interdisciplinary information
or vocabulary would be challenging to students and provide explanations prior to listening.
§Bullet explain how the information provided in the documentary
relates to the target culture or interdisciplinary phenomena.
In the voice message, the speaker’s speed of delivery
and presentational style may interfere with students’
understanding. The content of the message may also be
challenging if the topic is unfamiliar to students. To address these challenges
§Bullet as students develop their skills, they can listen to
the source multiple times, with the teacher pausing
occasionally to check for students’ understanding. As
students improve their skills, teachers can decrease the number of times that a source is played.
§Bullet students can become comfortable listening to the native
speakers’ speech by listening to various authentic audio
or audiovisual teacher-provided sources throughout the course.
§Bullet prior to listening to the messages, students can
develop a graphic organizer that lists guided questions
such as, Who is the speaker? What is the purpose of the message?
In multiple-choice questions for instructions, students
sometimes find it difficult to identify the purpose and details
presented in this type of audio text. To address this challenge
§Bullet teachers should provide opportunities for students to identify and explain unknown information based on
the context of the source, adding cultural background as appropriate.
§Bullet teachers can provide instructions written in Japanese.
Students can then explain the details that are included in the instructions.

AREAS OF CHALLENGE: FREE RESPONSE
As mentioned earlier, in the compare and contrast article,
students struggle to provide an organized article with a
beginning, middle, and end. Students may also neglect to
state their own preferences/opinions and support their
viewpoints with proper reasoning, or they are unable to
compare the two opposing viewpoints from the same topic
or compare two different topics. They may also fail to read
the prompt carefully. In general, students often struggle to
write a well-organized discourse of paragraph length using
cohesive devices and transitional expressions. To address these challenges
§Bullet teachers can remind students to read the prompt carefully,
model how to address all aspects of the prompt, and guide students step by step through practice prompts.
§Bullet teachers can provide a sample compare and contrast
article task from AP Central and model how to identify each question asked in the stimulus. Teachers can
ask students to brainstorm possible responses to the
questions and then lead the class in constructing a fully
detailed response that has an organized progression and expresses a viewpoint.
§Bullet in the classroom, teachers can give students a compare
and contrast article and have them identify what is
being compared and the author’s viewpoint. Students
can provide a summary of the viewpoint using their own words.
§Bullet as students’ skills progress, before asking them to respond to the compare and contrast article, teachers can have students work in pairs or small groups to discuss possible responses with explanations. Teachers can then provide feedback on ways students might improve their responses.
§Bullet teachers should work with students to develop a robust
variety of transitional expressions and cohesive devices that go beyond the commonly used “first,” ”and,”
”but,” and “because.” Students can build a list of these
expressions throughout the course, and teachers can check for their use in student work.
With the compare and contrast article, students also
struggle to use standard conventions (e.g. punctuation) and
appropriate register, word choice, and sentence structures.
To address this challenge, teachers can:
§Bullet provide a checklist of items for students to review after they have written their response.
§Bullet remove the checklist once students have had sufficient
practice and their stills have improved, reminding students to independently review their own work.
§Bullet encourage students to develop the habit of monitoring
language production, recognizing errors, and self correcting as they revise their work. Teachers should
also encourage students to use the vocabulary, idioms, and sentence structures they are familiar with to answer questions.
As the course progresses and students independently
write longer, organized, and more complex responses,
students should be reminded to continue to practice
accurate character selection or phonetic spellings.

ESSENTIAL
QUESTIONS
Bullet What factors drive innovation and discovery in the fields of science and technology?
Bullet What role do ethics play in scientific advancement?
Bullet What are the social consequences of scientific or technological advancements?
Developing Understanding
Unit 4 explores the effect of science and technology on people’s lives in Japanese-speaking
communities. This theme encourages students to work with more complex and academic
vocabulary and content as they continue to develop linguistic and cultural concepts from
previous units. Students continue to interact with more complex topics as they broaden their
vocabulary and communication skills by learning more about science and technology in the
target culture. While Science and Technology is the primary thematic focus of the unit, it is
possible to integrate the additional themes of Global Challenges, Contemporary Life, and
Personal and Public Identities. For example, students could
Bullet explore how developments in science can both create and resolve challenges in contemporary society.
Bullet investigate how technology creates new ways for us to connect with others and how it
impacts and shapes our personal and public identities.
Bullet consider ways access to technology affects society and the quality of life.
Bullet examine how science and technology affect the values and ethics of a community.

UNIT 4
How Science and Technology Affect Our Lives
Building Course Skills
In this unit, students continue working in the interpretive mode with audio and written sources of increasing
complexity. The listening task models for the unit include
pre-recorded messages, radio broadcasts, uncontextualized
dialogues, cultural presentations, and public announcements.
Reading task models include travel brochures, email inbox,
and journalistic articles. Building on skills developed in Unit 3, students continue to use context to
Bullet deduce meaning of unfamiliar words and infer the implied meanings of a text.
Bullet identify and describe features of sources, including
intended audience, purpose, point of view, tone or attitude, main idea, and details.
Bullet determine the meaning of a text using provided interdisciplinary or cultural information.
Practice in the interpretive mode prepares students to engage
in the interpersonal and presentational modes. Students
Bullet select resources and use a planning process for preparing
a short cultural perspective presentation on the topics
addressed in this unit, including viewpoints, supporting evidence, and elaboration.
Bullet provide and obtain information about the impact of the
development of science and technology on people’s lives in written and spoken exchanges.
Bullet use strategies such as requesting clarification, asking for
repetition, and circumlocution to initiate, maintain, and close spoken and written exchanges.
Bullet research and gather information needed to compare and
explain two opposing sides of a specified topic addressed
in this unit by taking a position and then providing supported reasoning.
Preparing for the AP Exam
As students prepare for the AP Exam, teachers should
encourage students to work more independently and develop
strategies to address content they find challenging.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE: MULTIPLE CHOICE
In radio news broadcasts, students may struggle to identify
relevant details and point(s) of view. To address this challenge
Bullet if students still need extra help, teachers can anticipate
which interdisciplinary or cultural information and
vocabulary may be challenging to students and provide
explanations. This vocabulary can be added to the class vocabulary bank.
Bullet to help with comprehension, teachers can also provide
some context on the topic by providing information.
Bullet as students start preparing for the AP Exam, ask them to
predict relevant vocabulary related to the theme of this
unit that may be used in the radio broadcast. Then ask
students to decode the vocabulary as best they can using
tools as needed, the context, and any prior knowledge about the content to identify relevant details.
In cultural presentations, students have difficulty
determining or identifying features of the text. To address this challenge
Bullet teachers should provide students with authentic cultural
presentations from Japanese magazines and articles.
With a partner, students can identify and discuss the main
point of the article and relevant cultural elements.
Bullet students can develop true or false questions about the article and ask their partner to respond.
Bullet students can research cultural information on topics that
are of interest to them such as anime, Japanese food,
celebrations, or religions. Student can then share what they have learned with their classmates.
In response to email inbox questions, students may have
difficulty identifying the purpose. To address this challenge:
Bullet before reading, teachers can provide essential vocabulary
related to the messages in the email inbox and add these terms to the class vocabulary bank.
Bullet students can distinguish the different purpose or main idea among the messages by summarizing or paraphrasing each message after reading.
Bullet teachers can provide a matching activity with several sample
emails and responses. Students can identify what response matches the content of each email message.
In this unit, students continue to practice the four free-response
questions. Through engaging in a conversation, students are
required to address all aspects of each question presented in
the conversation with elaboration and explanations.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE: CONVERSATION
In the conversation free-response question, the challenge
of not fully understanding the interlocutor was shared earlier.
An additional struggle occurs with speech delivery. Excessive
hesitation, vague pronunciation, and inconsistent pace and
intonation all affect comprehensibility in the conversation.
To address these challenges
Bullet students can listen to various authentic audio sources
including conversations to get exposure to the flow of conversations.

UNIT 4
AP Japanese Language and Culture Course and Exam Description
Course Framework V.1 | 85
Bullet students can record and compare their own recorded speeches with exemplar samples available
on the AP Central website so as to identify and become
aware of aspects of their pronunciation, pace, and
intonation that need to be improved, so they can monitor their language use.
Bullet students can also practice pronunciation and speed
of delivery with classmates, a teacher, or native speakers if available.
An additional struggle with conversation free-response
question is that students sometimes provide irrelevant or
off-topic answers due to misinterpretation of questions.
To address this challenge
Bullet teachers should encourage students to listen and
carefully read and follow the directions in English.
Bullet teachers can have students repeat or rephrase questions during classroom practice to build understanding.
Bullet teachers can ask students to work on speaking activities
that require them to provide answers with examples or
justifications such as role-playing or holding a debate.
Bullet teachers can invite native speakers from the local
community to visit the classroom, so that students can engage in spontaneous conversations.
Bullet students should practice continuing the conversation even if they miss a turn in the conversation.

UNIT 5 102
Building Course Skills
In this unit, students continue working in the interpretive
mode with audio and written sources and complete multiple choice questions related to radio cultural documentaries,
instructions, cultural presentations, school debates, radio
news broadcasts, letters, and short stories. Sources should
be equivalent in complexity to what students can expect to see on the AP Exam in this unit.
Students develop their ability to comprehend and interpret
information through audio and written sources of increasing complexity as they
Bullet acquire a variety of vocabulary from authentic sources
related to the topics and themes addressed in this unit.
Bullet identify or describe the main ideas, details, perspectives,
tones, purpose, and connections among cultural and interdisciplinary topics.
Bullet use cultural or interdisciplinary information to infer the
meanings of a text and deduce meaning of unfamiliar words through context.
Bullet identity the moral, theme, or cultural perspectives of short stories and other texts.
Building on skills developed in previous units and practicing
in the interpretive mode addressed in this unit, students
further engage in the interpersonal and presentational modes as they
Bullet apply analytic skills, vocabulary, and sentence structures
gained from listening, reading, and deconstructing
authentic sources to discuss and explain a specific topic with examples, elaboration, and supporting ideas.
Bullet converse on the topics addressed in this unit and attempt
self-correction using a variety of vocabulary, sentence structures, and communication strategies.
Bullet use cultural information acquired from sources in Unit 5
to prepare and deliver an organized cultural perspective presentation related to this unit’s theme.
Bullet use appropriate writing systems (a mixture of kanji, hiragana, and katakana) in writing tasks.
Preparing for the AP Exam
AREAS OF CHALLENGE: MULTIPLE-CHOICE
In radio news broadcasts, students may struggle to identify
the distinguishing features of the text such as the viewpoint,
purpose and/or intended audience. Teachers can address this challenge by
Bullet guiding students to discover these features by actively
deconstructing the text—stating the viewpoint, purpose, intended audience, and cultural connections.
Bullet asking students to develop discussion questions
based on the viewpoint, purpose, audience, and cultural connections identified.
Bullet asking students to work in pairs using the radio news
broadcast to answer the student-developed questions.
In the pen pal letter, students have difficulty with
comprehension and interpreting various elements such as
personal experience and feelings, events, or proposed plans provided in the letter. To address this challenge
Bullet students who need more practice can chunk the text into
small segments and work in small groups discussing and summarizing their portion of text.
Bullet students can identify and explain challenging vocabulary, adding it to the class vocabulary bank.
Bullet students can also create questions and ask other
small groups to respond. These groups can review the responses together.
Bullet as students’ skills improve, ask them to discuss,
summarize, and respond to larger portions of the text,
working their way up to responding to the full letter.
The cultural perspective presentation free-response question
requires students to give an oral presentation in which they
demonstrate cultural knowledge and linguistic accuracy as
they explain their perspectives on a specified topic and discuss
different aspects of the topic with examples and details.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE: CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE
PRESENTATION
The cultural perspective presentation is one of the more
challenging questions on the AP Exam. Successful students
generally have had significant classroom practice and have
received targeted and directed feedback from teachers.
Consider providing several opportunities for students to
practice this task with scaffolded instruction that increases
the complexity of the task and provides feedback for
students to improve in their presentation skills. Some
strategies teachers can implement to help students build their presentation skills include
Bullet breaking skills down incrementally.
Bullet providing practice over time to develop each skill.
Bullet providing timely and focused feedback. Teachers can let
students know where they have done well and where they
need to improve, watching for improvement in individual
students’ skills and providing encouragement as students practice and improve.
Bullet providing opportunities for students to practice
with a partner and receive feedback to improve their
delivery. Practice with a partner improves a student’s presentation, and it can also help the student,

providing feedback to reflect on areas where their own presentation skills can improve.
Bullet ensuring that students understand the scoring
guidelines. As discussed below, the scoring samples on AP Central can provide a wealth of knowledge for students on how the question is scored and,
therefore, how students can organize and present their cultural presentation.
One frequent challenge on the cultural perspective
presentation is that students fail to address their own
perspective on a topic that requires them to use their
acquired knowledge of Japanese culture. To help improve student performance on this task, teachers can
Bullet provide guided practice in addressing individual
perspectives and organizing a speech before asking students to work on the task.
Bullet give students targeted vocabulary and grammatical
structures to help them discuss these topics in Japanese.
Bullet provide sample student responses from AP Central
and the scoring guidelines for this task to familiarize
students with expectations for performance on this task.
Discuss low-, mid-, and high-level performances and
have students identify aspects of each one using the scoring guidelines.
Bullet provide many opportunities for students to discuss
Japanese cultural products, practices, perspectives
with guiding questions that ask students to provide their perspectives.
Bullet encourage students to express their own viewpoints by
comparing cultural aspects from their target culture with similar aspects of their own culture.
An additional challenge with the cultural perspective
presentation is that students do not always manage their time well when presenting. To address this challenge
Bullet teachers can use a previous year’s cultural presentation
prompt from AP Central and have students brainstorm on
how to respond and how to organize the presentation by
writing down key words or ideas in the order they want to
include in their presentation. Students can then complete
this same activity individually using another prompt.
Bullet students can listen critically to a wide variety of
audio presentations throughout the year, noting the organization of those presentations.
Bullet students can practice ways to use presentation
preparation time effectively. Instead of writing full
statements, encourage students to write a list of key
ideas that they want to address in the order in which they plan to include them in their presentation.

ESSENTIAL
QUESTIONS §Bullet How do environmental, political, and societal challenges positively and negatively impact communities?
§Bullet What are possible solutions to those challenges?
§Bullet What role do individuals play in addressing complex societal issues?
Developing Understanding
This final unit explores themes related to how complex issues and phenomena affect
people’s lives in Japanese-speaking communities. Engaging with the primary theme of
Global Challenges encourages students to use more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence
structure as they continue to refine their knowledge of linguistic and cultural concepts. This
unit presents one of the most challenging and abstract themes in that the content requires
students to understand information about economic, environmental, population, and
demographic issues in the target language. These topics require sophisticated vocabulary
and linguistic concepts. The unit also connects to the themes of Contemporary Life, Science
and Technology, and Families and Communities. For example, students could
§Bullet investigate how economic developments and environmental challenges often
impact society and politics on a larger scale, which in turn affects individual families and communities.
§Bullet explore how individuals can positively or negatively influence the world around them.
§Bullet develop possible solutions that address contemporary global challenges.

UNIT 6
Environmental, Political, and Societal Challenges
Building Course Skills
In this final unit, students will practice multiple-choice
questions related to the following task models: pre-recorded
messages, radio broadcasts, cultural presentations,
uncontextualized dialogues, public announcements, travel
brochures, email inbox, and step-by-step instructions.
Students develop their abilities to comprehend and interpret
information at the same level of complexity they can expect to see on the AP Exam as they
§Bullet describe the factual meaning of the text and identify its features.
§Bullet discuss and compare environmental, political, and
societal challenges between the target community and their own community.
§Bullet describe and explain cultural practices and perspectives related to the unit’s theme.
Building on skills developed in previous units and practicing in
the interpretive mode in this unit, students continue engaging
in the interpersonal and presentational modes as they
§Bullet exchange possible solutions with supporting details to
environmental, political, and societal challenges in spoken and written communications.
§Bullet explain different aspects of a selected topic, compare the
similarities and dissimilarities between the two topics or
options, and state a position with sufficient reasoning.
§Bullet use cultural information acquired from sources in Unit 6 to
prepare a cultural perspective presentation by providing
viewpoints on the relevant topics covered in this unit with explanations and justification.
Preparing for the AP Exam
In this final unit, students continue to apply their growing
knowledge and competencies in a variety of contexts and
real-world scenarios. Listening and reading examples are
equal in complexity and difficulty to what students will
experience on the exam and should be performed under exam conditions.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE: MULTIPLE CHOICE
In a pre-recorded message, students may struggle to capture details. To address this challenge
§Bullet in earlier units, teachers can offer guided questions
and explanations of key words prior to listening to the
conversation to help students target details as they listen.
Students can respond to these guided questions to capture details during and after listening.
§Bullet as students are coming to the end of the course and
preparing for the AP Exam, teachers can ask them to
listen to the message and identify challenging vocabulary.
Teachers can then ask students to decode the vocabulary
as best as they can and use the context and any prior
knowledge about the content to identify relevant details.
In the travel brochure, students struggle to interpret the text
if they are unfamiliar with the cultural and interdisciplinary
information in the brochure. To address this challenge
§Bullet teachers can introduce a variety of cultural topics across
disciplines with discussion questions throughout the
course to help students learn more relevant content related to the topics.
Bullet as students’ skills progress, they can research cultural
topics and develop questions while reading the content.
Students can then provide the text to their classmates and have them answer the questions.
In step-by-step instructions, students may not fully understand the various details that appear in the instructions. To address this challenge:
§Bullet teachers can have students circle key words such as
verbs and objectives presented on the instructions,
determine the meanings of key words using contextual
clues, and then try to describe the literal meaning of the
instructions using all available information, including cultural and/or interdisciplinary information and reading questions.
§Bullet students may also summarize the main point of each step
and eliminate inappropriate answers that are not related to the topic and content of the instructions.
§Bullet students can write step-by-step instructions on a topic
they are interested in or are very familiar with. They can
then put the instructions in random order and ask a classmate to correctly sequence the instructions.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE: FREE RESPONSE
Students have been practicing the writing tasks for the free response questions throughout the year. As they prepare
for the AP Exam, on both writing tasks, the text chat, and the compare and contrast article, students should
§Bullet create an outline to organize their ideas before writing.
◆
Bullet determine what information needs to be included based on the information in the prompt.
Bullet determine what information should come at the beginning, middle, and end of their response.
◆
Bullet determine transitional and cohesive devices that will communicate the organization of their response.

Environmental, Political, and Societal Challenges
§Bullet use standard conventions for written language and appropriately use hiragana, katakana, and kanji.
§Bullet leave time to review and revise after they have written
their response. Teachers can have students create a checklist for review.
For both speaking tasks, the conversation and cultural perspective presentation, students should
§Bullet monitor their language production and try to self-correct
when they make a mistake, as they are not penalized for doing so on the exam.
§Bullet continue with the conversation even if they realize they
misunderstood one of the turns in the conversation, and
listen carefully to the next prompt from the interlocutor to get back on track.
§Bullet
For both writing and speaking tasks, students need to
use communication strategies such as circumlocution and paraphrasing to maintain spoken exchanges and presentations.
§Bullet pay attention to register and try to avoid shifting register during their responses.
§Bullet continue to focus on completing each task by addressing all aspects of each prompt.
By this point, students should be very familiar with the
instructions, formats, and expectations for each of the
free-response questions and know how to follow directions
on the exam. Successful students generally provide their
own viewpoints, supporting evidence, elaboration, and significant details in organized responses.

Selecting and Using Course Materials
As the course develops real-world communicative and
cultural competencies, it is critical to integrate a variety
of authentic materials into instruction and assessment.
Authentic materials are texts or resources designed for
native speakers of the language and not created for the
language classroom. Such authentic materials include, but are not limited to,
Bullet websites
Bullet newspapers, magazines, and other printed sources
Bullet short stories
Bullet blogs and other social media
Bullet podcasts
Bullet music
Bullet videos: films, advertisements, news programs,
TV shows
Bullet radio broadcasts
There are several textbooks designed for AP Japanese
Language and Culture. Some provide ways to organize
the course, as well as instructional and assessment strategies, whereas others specifically focus on
preparing students for the AP Exam. Textbooks should be considered as resources to guide and support
instruction. As textbooks that use a variety of authentic
materials are limited, it is recommended that teachers assemble a package of materials selected from
different texts or resources with modified pedagogical
materials that broaden or deepen each theme and are
appropriate to their students’ cognitive level and needs.
Bullet Teachers can find information on learning materials,
Japanese-language courses, and tools to examine teaching, learning, and assessment at The Japan
Foundation: Japanese Language Education
Overseas.
Bullet Teachers can find an online Japanese Dictionary
Service at Jim Breen’s WWWJDIC, and information on kanji, radicals, and stroke order at WWWJDIC
Japanese Dictionary Server User Guide.
Bullet Students can learn and practice hiragana and katakana at realkana.com.
The American Council on the Teaching of Foreign
Languages (ACTFL) is the largest organization of world
language educators in the USA. ACTFL’s standards and
approach for instruction, performance, and assessment are foundational to AP world language and culture courses and exams. See actfl.org.
ACTFL offers many documents that inform instruction and assessment.
Bullet World Readiness Standards for Learning
Languages: This document “creates a roadmap to guide learners to develop competence to communicate effectively and interact with
cultural competence to participate in multilingual communities at home and around the world.”

AP Japanese Language and Culture Course and Exam Description
Developing Course Skills
Throughout the AP Japanese Language and Culture course, students develop skills that are fundamental to the
learning of a language and culture and to communicating effectively across the three modes of communication.
Since these disciplinary practices represent the complex language and communication skills that adept language
learners need to develop, students will benefit from multiple opportunities to develop and practice these skills in a scaffolded manner.
Skill Category 1: Comprehend Written, Audio, Audiovisual, and Visual Text
The comprehension of texts is essential to learning
Comprehending texts requires students to be skilled at
decoding unfamiliar language, understand vocabulary
in context, and use contextual clues when dealing with
challenging text. Teachers can encourage students to
persevere and practice, and they can address issues by
the careful selection of texts and by designing carefully scaffolded instruction.
a language and culture because it represents foundational input that is necessary to produce
language.  Much of the course content is delivered
through print, written, visual, audiovisual, and audio texts;
therefore, students must be able to engage with and
comprehend information conveyed in a wide variety of interdisciplinary texts.
Below are some suggested strategies for instruction.

Skill Category 2: Make Cultural and Interdisciplinary Connections
One of the “5Cs” (Communication, Culture,
Connections, Comparisons, and Communities) that is foundational to ACTFL’s standards for language
learning is “connections,” i.e., making connections
among interdisciplinary and/or cultural topics. In AP world language classrooms, the content is
interdisciplinary and culturally oriented by nature and
what is studied is related to other disciplines that go well beyond the language classroom.
Teachers can work with students to develop their
ability to make cultural connections by helping them to recognize and understand cultural references
in texts. When working with interdisciplinary texts
teachers can provide opportunities for students to
make connections with prior learning. They can help
students understand the context of a text and teach
strategies for students to use context to understand
the text. Teachers can also keep students’ interests in
mind as they choose texts and materials to work with,
as students are more likely to persevere with a text that engages them.
It’s a good idea to actively encourage students to make
cross-disciplinary and cultural connections by using
activating strategies, such as advance organizers or
anticipatory sets of questions. Consistent exposure to
interdisciplinary and cultural topics will build confidence and competence in the skill of making connections during the course.
Below are some suggested strategies for instruction.

Skill Category 4: Make Meanings from Words or Expressions
Making meaning from unfamiliar words or expressions is essential to demonstrate comprehension of any text. While students do not
have to understand every word to understand a text, they need to become adept at decoding unfamiliar vocabulary by using context clues that appear.
Students need encouragement to persist and take risks when engaging with a source. This may mean
withholding correction as students make a few errors
when they encounter unfamiliar words or expressions.
Teachers can encourage students’ growth in making meanings from words and expressions through
consistent practice with texts that contain unknown
vocabulary and have rich examples of idiomatic and
cultural expressions. Teachers can guide students to
decode words by looking at prefixes, suffixes, word
stems, and radicals; as well as looking for context clues, word derivations and cultural concepts.
Below are some suggested strategies for instruction.

Skill Category 6: Communicate Interpersonally by Writing to Others
Being able to communicate with others through writing
constitutes another main reason why students enroll
in language and culture courses. Written interpersonal
communication is an important real-life skill to develop within the language classroom.  Therefore, it is
critical to provide students with multiple and ongoing
opportunities to write to others in both the formal and informal registers.
The more students practice writing texts, notes, emails,
and letters, the more likely they will produce written
language that is comprehensible to native speakers of the target language.
In order to communicate successfully in writing in the interpersonal mode, students need to practice § building their vocabulary § typing accurate phonetic spellings, recognizing and identifying the correct characters from a list of available characters displayed on the computer screen § communicating their message using accurate grammatical and syntactic structures § working to comprehend the incoming message § consistently using the appropriate register § providing sufficient information, elaboration, and details § developing an organized, cohesive message
Teachers can help students by actively teaching all
aspects of successful interpersonal writing, breaking
down the writing task into a step-by-step process, and
providing timely and directed feedback that encourages students to continue to practice for improvement.

Skill Category 7: Communicate Through Spoken Presentations
Presenting information orally is an important way that students demonstrate their ability to communicate effectively in the language. Spoken
presentations can be challenging to students, as they need to communicate ideas related to a variety of
interdisciplinary and cultural topics in an organized and
engaging manner. Many students find speaking in front
of a group to be challenging and stressful. They are
apprehensive about making mistakes and effectively
communicating their message. The ability to carefully
plan and outline key ideas and main points is critical so
that students will present information without relying on
memorizing or reading their presentations. Therefore,
teachers should give students multiple and ongoing opportunities to give oral presentations.
In order to be successful in their oral presentations,
students need to:
Bullet employ vocabulary and grammatical and syntactical structures to effectively convey their thoughts.
Bullet organize their information to deliver an effective presentation
Bullet use strong transitional expressions and cohesive devices that guide the listener’s understanding.
Students should also be encouraged to take risks,
as they will likely make errors in their presentations.
By practicing this skill regularly, students will become more comfortable and confident in presenting
orally. Students should receive feedback that helps them improve not only the content and accuracy of
their presentation, but also their confidence in their
presentational skills.  As the year progresses, they will
acquire more interdisciplinary vocabulary and more complex language structures to support longer and more sophisticated oral presentations.

Skill Category 8: Communicate Through Written Presentations
Presenting information in writing is an important way
that students demonstrate their ability to communicate
effectively in the language. Presentational writing
can be challenging to students, as students are often
required to effectively express and explain complex
ideas and support them with evidence from sources.
The ability to conduct research, evaluate sources,
and then extract relevant information from sources
is an important part of creating effective written
presentations.  Therefore, it is critical to provide
students with multiple and ongoing opportunities to present their ideas in written form.
In order to be successful in their written presentations, students need to Bullet employ academic vocabulary
Bullet Type accurate phonetic spellings, and recognize and identify the correct characters from a list of available characters displayed on the computer screen
Bullet use effective grammatical and syntactical structures
Bullet develop organizational skills
Bullet use effective transitional expressions and cohesive devices to guide the reader’s understanding
Bullet include relevant evidence from sources.
Teachers can address these struggles by actively teaching a writing process. Teach students how
to create a step-by-step plan to produce a written
presentation to help them create well-organized written
work that has a logical flow. Make sure that students
know the importance of taking time to proofread their
work to correct errors in structures and mechanics.
Teachers can provide targeted feedback on grammatical and syntactical errors to improve the
comprehensibility of students’ work. The more students
practice these skills, the more likely it is that they will become effective in communicating their ideas in
writing. With practice and feedback, they will acquire
the academic vocabulary, organizational skills, and
appropriate conventions of written language to create effective written presentations.

Kanji List
For the AP Japanese Language and Culture course and exam, students are expected to be able
to interpret and produce texts using the kanji on this list. It is based on a survey of commonly used
textbooks and represents expectations typical of college courses that represent the point at which
students complete approximately 300 hours of college-level classroom instruction. This list is organized
by JIS code, but, of course, the kanji need not be presented in this particular order. Kanji should be
presented according to students’ communicative needs, as characterized by the topic, purpose, and other aspects of their reading and writing.
