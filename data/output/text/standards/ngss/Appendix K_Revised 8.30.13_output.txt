Reaching the Potential:
Mapping out Model Courses for the Next Generation Science Standards

A Framework for K-12 Science Education casts a bold vision for science education, and the resulting
Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) have taken a huge leap toward putting this vision into
practice, but there is still work to be done as states contemplate adoption and move toward
implementation.  This appendix focuses on one aspect of this work – organizing the grade banded performance expectations into courses.
The NGSS are organized by grade level for kindergarten through grade five, but as grade banded
expectations at the middle school (6–8) and high school (9–12) levels.  This arrangement is due to the
fact that standards at these levels are handled very differently in different states and because there is not
conclusive research that identifies the ideal sequence for student learning.
As states and districts consider implementation of NGSS, it will be important to thoughtfully consider
how to organize these grade banded standards into courses that best prepare students for post-secondary
success in college and career.  Decisions about this organization are handled differently in different
states. Sometimes a decision is prescribed by the state education agency, sometimes by a regional office
or a local school district, and other times it falls to the lone grade 6–12 science teacher – who may not
only move between two buildings and teach seven different preparations each day, but is also active in
school sponsored extracurricular activities – to determine what science gets taught at what level.
Recognizing the many ways that decisions about what to teach when are made, this appendix is provided
as a tool for guiding this decision-making process.  To realize the vision of the Framework and NGSS,
courses need to be thoughtfully scaffolded at levels of complexity that are developmentally appropriate
for students to build knowledge both within courses and over the sequence of courses.  It is also
important to note that these are merely the first of several models that will be developed.  There are also
plans in the works to develop accelerated models to propel students toward Advanced Placement courses
earlier in their high school careers as well as models that integrate the NGSS and career technical
education pathways such as engineering and medicine.

Foundational Understandings for NGSS Model Course Maps:
To use these model course maps effectively, it is absolutely essential to understand the thought processes
that were involved in building them.  This section outlines the foundational decisions that were made in
the development of all the model course maps, and it attempts to clarify the intent for use of the course
maps.  Each of these six foundational understandings will be more fully explained below; they serve as
the basis for effective use of these model course maps.
1.
Model Course Maps are starting points, not finished products.
2.
Model course map organization is built on the structure of the Framework.
3.
All Standards, All Students.
4.
Model course maps are not curriculum.
5.
All Scientific and Engineering Practices and all Crosscutting Concepts in all courses.
6.
Engineering for all.

1. Model Course Maps are starting points, not finished products.
States and districts/local education agencies are not expected to adopt these models; rather, they are
encouraged to use them as a starting point for developing their own course descriptions and sequences.
The model course maps described here are both models of process for planning courses and sequences
and models of potential end products. Every attempt has been made to describe the intent and
assumptions underlying each model and the process of model development so that states and districts can
utilize similar processes to organize the standards in a useful way.  These models illustrate possible
approaches to organizing the content of the NGSS into coherent and rigorous courses that lead to college
and career readiness. The word “model” is used here as it is in the Framework – as a tool for understanding, not necessarily as an ideal state.
2. Model course map organization is built on the structure of the Framework.
The Framework is organized into four major domains: the physical sciences, the life sciences, the earth
and space sciences, and engineering, technology and applications of science. Within each domain, the
Framework describes how a small set of disciplinary core ideas was developed using a set of specific
criteria (NRC 2012, p. 31).  Each core idea is broken into three or four component ideas which provide
more organizational development of the core idea.  Figure 1: Physical Science Core Idea (PS1) and
Component Ideas below provides an example how one core idea, Matter and Its Interactions (PS1),
includes three component ideas: PS1.A: Structure and Properties of Matter, PS1.B: Chemical Reactions,
and PS1.C: Nuclear Processes.

Page 4 of 40
Figure 1: Physical Science Core Idea (PS1) and Component Ideas
This in an example from the Framework organization to demonstrate the relationship between “domains,” “disciplinary core ideas,” and “component ideas.”

Though the disciplinary core ideas were used as a starting point for building these model course maps, it
will be important for coordinated learning that the other dimensions of the Framework – Scientific and
Engineering Practices and Crosscutting Concepts – be woven together in instruction (see #5 below).
Curriculum designers should consult the Framework and the NGSS appendices for progressions of
learning for Scientific and Engineering Practices and Crosscutting Concepts.

3. “All Standards, All Students.”
All the standards are expected of all students.  Though this is a foundational commitment of the
Framework and is discussed at length in Appendix D of NGSS, it bears repeating here due to its
implications for course design.  This approach is much more than just a way to refute the common notion
that learning physics is only for students in advanced math, or that taking Earth and Space Science is only
for students who are not on the college track.  All standards, all students.
For the 6–8 grade band, this clearly indicates that all of the grade banded standards should be addressed
within the three-year span, and the flexibility of the high school science course sequence with required
courses and elective courses provides a challenge to ensure that all students are prepared to demonstrate
all of the performance expectations.  The model course maps for the 9–12 grade band are all organized
into three courses.  This decision was made by balancing the “All Standards, All Students” vision with
the reality of the finite amount of time in a school year.  It would certainly be recommended that students,
especially those considering careers in a STEM-related field, would go beyond these courses to take
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics courses that would enhance their preparation.  It
should be noted here, however, that an extensive review of the NGSS by college professors of first year
science courses determined that the content in the NGSS would adequately prepare students to be
college- and career-ready in science (see Appendix C).

Furthermore, it should also be noted that there is no set amount of time assigned to these courses.
Although traditionally these would be considered year-long courses, there is nothing in these models that
requires that a course fit into a set amount of time – they could be spread over a longer time than three
years, extended to meet student needs, or accelerated. Some modes and settings of instruction-- such as
proficiency or mastery-based learning, online learning, or alternative learning centers--may even find that
structures other than courses are better fits for their situation.  Even in these situations, the model course
maps and the processes used in their development can help guide curriculum development.
4. Model Course Maps are NOT curriculum.
The Next Generation Science Standards are student outcomes and are explicitly NOT curriculum.  Even
though within each NGSS performance expectation Scientific and Engineering Practices (SEP) are
partnered with a particular Disciplinary Core Idea (DCI) and Crosscutting Concept (CC), these
intersections do not predetermine how the three are linked in the curriculum, units, lessons, or
instruction; they simply clarify the expectations of what students will know and be able to do by the end
of the grade or grade band. Though considering where Performance Expectations (PEs) will be addressed
within courses is an important step in curriculum development, additional work will be needed to create
coherent instructional programs that help students achieve these standards.
5. All Scientific and Engineering Practices and all Crosscutting Concepts in all courses.
It is the expectation of all the model course maps that all Scientific and Engineering Practices and
Crosscutting Concepts will be blended into instruction with aspects of the Disciplinary Core Ideas in
every course in the sequence and not just the ones that are outlined in the performance expectations.  The
goal is not to teach the PEs, but rather to prepare students to be able to perform them by the end of the
grade band course sequence. The PEs are written as grade band endpoints.  Even though a particular
performance expectation is placed “in a course,” it may not be possible to address the depth of the
expectation in its entirety within that course.  It may, for example, take repeated exposure to a particular
SEP over several courses before a student can achieve the proficiency expected in a given performance
expectation, but by the end of the grade band, the student should be prepared to demonstrate each performance expectation as written.
6. Engineering for all.
As is more carefully detailed in Appendix I, NGSS represent a commitment to integrate engineering
design into the structure of science education by raising engineering design to the same level as scientific
inquiry when teaching science disciplines at all levels, from kindergarten to grade 12. Engineering
standards have been integrated throughout the science domains of physical science, life science, and earth
and space science.  NGSS also includes PEs that focus explicitly on engineering design without a science
domain context. Within the range affected by these model course maps, there are four engineering design
PEs in the 6–8 grade band and four in the 9–12 grade band.  All of the model course maps place the

=== Page 6 ===

stand-alone engineering PEs with all courses as they help to organize and drive the instruction of the integrated engineering PEs within each course.
Model Course Maps:
Three model course maps are included as concrete examples to begin conversations about realizing the
vision of the Framework and NGSS. If you skipped to this section without reading the section titled
Foundational Understandings for NGSS Model Course Maps, please go back and read that section as it informs everything that follows.
Including the three options presented in this section does not preclude other organizational sequences.
As states, districts, and teachers engage in conversations about the strengths and weaknesses of the model
course maps that are presented here, it is expected that a wider variety of course maps will be
collaboratively developed and shared. For example, a curricular and instructional program could be built
around the National Academy of Engineering’s 21st Century Grand Engineering Challenges; around a
community-based theme that runs through all the courses and connects the performance expectations to
science, engineering and technology used in everyday life; or around a focus on the Framework’s
Crosscutting Concepts or Scientific and Engineering Practices instead of the Disciplinary Core Ideas.
Furthermore, as was mentioned above, even the term “courses” may be an unnecessarily limiting
definition that privileges a time-based system.  Some teachers, schools, districts and states are moving
toward a proficiency-based system, but even in such a situation these model course maps can help guide
conversations about the connections between performance expectations and how to begin moving from
standards to instruction focused on NGSS student performance/outcomes.
After the following list, details about each model course map, how it was developed, and ideas for next steps will be shared.
1. Conceptual Progressions Model (grades 6–8 and 9–12)  –  The grade banded PEs are organized
so that student understanding of concepts is built progressively throughout the course sequence.
This model maps PEs into courses based on what concepts are needed for support without focusing on keeping disciplines separate.
2. Science Domains Model (grades 6–8 and 9–12)  –  The grade banded PEs are organized into
content-specific courses that match the three science domains of the Framework: Physical
Science, Life Science, and Earth and Space Science.  Since the Engineering domain is mostly
integrated into the other three disciplines in the NGSS, it was integrated in these course models
rather than presented as a separate course in this sequence.  (The four stand-alone engineering PEs
in each of the grade bands are connected to all three courses at both levels.)
3. Modified Science Domains Model (grades 9–12)  –  The 9–12 grade band performance
expectations are organized into content-specific courses that match a common high school course
sequence of biology, chemistry, and physics.  To ensure all students have access to all standards,
the PEs connected to the Earth and Space Science domain of the Framework are divided among
these courses. It was included as a model for comparison because it is currently a common
sequence in high schools across the United States.

Course Map 1 – Conceptual Understanding Model (grades 6–8 and 9–12)
Process and Assumptions: Where did this course map come from?
This model course map arranges PEs so that the component ideas of the Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs)
progressively build with each course upon the skills and knowledge described in preceding courses.  The
fifth of the six Fundamental Understandings for Using Model Course Maps (pg 2) includes the idea that
although all three dimensions described in the Framework are specifically integrated within the grade
band endpoints, curriculum and instruction will provide students with opportunities to learn the
components of the dimensions in a variety of ways to prepare them to perform these endpoints.  Students
should have multiple opportunities to engage all of the Scientific and Engineering Practices and
Crosscutting Concepts in each course. The premise of this Model Course Map 1, however, is that the
DCIs do contain content that can be logically sequenced. Creating a logical sequence for the DCI portion
of the performance expectations for this model course map was a multi-stage effort that relied heavily on the Framework.
To develop a thorough understanding of scientific explanations of the world, students need
sustained opportunities to work with and develop the underlying ideas and to appreciate
those ideas’ interconnections over a period of years rather than weeks or months. This
sense of development has been conceptualized in the idea of learning progressions. If
mastery of a core idea in a science discipline is the ultimate educational destination, then
well-designed learning progressions provide a map of the routes that can be taken to reach that destination.

Such progressions describe both how students’ understanding of the idea matures over
time and the instructional supports and experiences that are needed for them to make
progress. Learning progressions may extend all the way from preschool to 12th grade and
beyond – indeed, people can continue learning about scientific core ideas their entire
lives. Because learning progressions extend over multiple years, they can prompt
educators to consider how topics are presented at each grade level so that they build on
prior understanding and can support increasingly sophisticated learning. Hence, core
ideas and their related learning progressions are key organizing principles for the design of the framework (NRC 2012, p. 26).

The first step in this process was separating the core ideas based on their reliance on other core ideas.
For example, it is clear just from the titles of the core ideas that to learn about LS1: From Molecules To
Organisms: Structures And Processes, a student would benefit from an understanding of core idea PS1:
Matter and its Interactions.  Knowing about atoms, molecules, and how they interact should enhance the
student’s understanding of how molecules operate in living organisms.   This would put core idea PS1 in
a course before core idea LS1. Just looking at the titles of the core ideas, however, is not enough to
understand the full scope of what content is included in a core idea.  Ordering core ideas for this model
course map was done by thoroughly comparing the descriptions for each core idea in the Framework.
Any core ideas that did not have significant reliance upon the content in other core ideas were placed in

=== Page 8 ===

NGSS Release
Page 8 of 40
the first course.  Core ideas that required support from those in the first course were placed in the second
course, and core ideas that required support from core ideas in the second course were placed in the third
course. The resulting skeletal sequence based on disciplinary core ideas is shown in Figure 2.  As was
discussed in the sixth foundational understanding for all model course maps, there are four PEs in each
grade band that focus exclusively on engineering design.  Though these PEs are not represented in the
chart below, the stand-alone engineering PEs are included in all three courses, as they should help
organize and drive the instruction of the integrated engineering PEs in all three courses and they will appear in subsequent tables.
Figure 2: Organization of Disciplinary Core Ideas for Course Map 1
The figure below outlines the first step of organizing the NGSS into courses based on a conceptual progression of the science content
outlined in the Disciplinary Core Ideas of the Framework.

Sorting core ideas is a step in the direction of course mapping, but it is at far too big of a grain size to be
useful for curriculum development. To get closer to a usable grain size, the core ideas were reanalyzed by
splitting each one into its component ideas (identified in the Framework) and again sorting them into
courses to refine their positioning. Essentially, the process used for sorting the DCIs was repeated, but the
component ideas disconnected from the core idea and, when appropriate, moved to a different course in
the map based on the grade band endpoint descriptions in the Framework. For example, although PS1:
Matter and Its Interactions was originally placed in the first course, its component idea PS1.C: Nuclear
Processes requires content in both courses one and two, so it was shifted to course three.  PS1.A:
Structures and Properties of Matter and PS1.B: Chemical Reactions remained in course one because they
do not require content from other component ideas.   Figure 3 shows the end result of reassigning
component ideas to courses. Since this organization is based on the Framework, it works for both the 6–8 and 9–12 grade bands.

The diagram below outlines the second step of mapping the NGSS into courses – refining the arrangement seen in Figure 2 by evaluating the
Disciplinary Core Ideas at the finer grain size of the component ideas that they are made of. The arrows illustrate the connections that were
used to sort the component ideas into courses, not to determine an order for curriculum.

The final step in the process of building Model Course Map 1 was to reevaluate the organization at the
level of the performance expectations themselves.  The tables below outline the first step in this process –
connecting the component ideas with their PEs. These tables were built using the information in the
NGSS foundation boxes which documents the connections between the PEs and each component idea.
Due to the overlapping nature of the content in the component ideas, some PEs are linked to more than
one component idea. In these cases, PEs are only listed once in the top section of the table.  PE repeats –
PEs that are connected to more than one component idea within a course, or between courses – and
secondary connections are identified in the bottom section of each table.

Next Steps for Course Map 1
It should be clear at this point that this course map will need revision as curricula are developed, but this
arrangement should give a good starting point for conversations about what is taught when and why.  To
help guide these conversations, here are several recommendations and steps that states or districts should
consider as they work from this starting point toward developing curricula and instructional unit plans:
1. Revisit the suggested arrangements of DCIs and DCI component ideas to ensure that they
progress from course to course in a logical fashion.  In this process, make sure to read the
descriptions of the core ideas and the component ideas in the Framework, rather than only relying
on past experiences with those concepts or topics. This may mean that you end up with a different
arrangement than what is presented here, but collaboratively engaging a broad group of teachers
and administrators in this process results in courses that work for schools, teachers, and students and offers greater buy-in for implementation.

2. As performance expectations are bundled into curriculum units and lesson plans, it is important to
balance this structured arrangement of PEs with creating courses and units that flow well and
engage students in learning. Use the final PE arrangement that you develop (or the one provided
by Model Course Map 1) as a starting point for building instructional units.  As you bundle the
student outcomes described in the performance expectations into meaningful units to build the
flow within and between courses, PEs may well be pulled from different courses in the map to
make this happen. The course map is there to make sure that when you move PEs from one course
to another, you adjust instruction accordingly; it is not meant to be a prescriptive, static document.
For example, you may decide to connect HS-ESS2-3 (“Develop a model based on evidence of
Earth’s interior to describe the cycling of matter by thermal convection.”) and HS-PS3-2
(“Develop and use models to illustrate that energy at the macroscopic scale can be accounted for
as either motions of particles or energy stored in fields.”) from Course 1 with HS-PS3-3 from
Course 2 (“Design, build, and refine a device that works within given constraints to convert one
form of energy into another form of energy.*) in an instructional unit that has students engaging in
argumentation about sources of energy (gas, electric, geothermal, solar, etc.) for heating and cooling homes as a part of Course 1.

3. As PEs are bundled into instructional units and these units are tied together into courses, units
may need to be moved from one course to another to make sure that courses are balanced.  This
doesn’t necessarily mean that the courses have the same number of PEs. Curriculum units with
fewer PEs may take longer than those with more PEs depending on how those PEs are addressed
in the lesson plans.  It is recommended to pay particular attention to the repeat PEs listed in the
tables in this process. PEs that are connected to more than one component idea may bundle better
with PEs in just one course rather than being represented in two courses.

* The performance expectations marked with an asterisk integrate traditional science content with engineering through a Practice or Disciplinary Core Idea.

4. While rearranging PEs and building instructional units, remember that the performance
expectations are grade banded student outcomes and map out student course expectations
appropriately. It may be that, though a PE is placed in a course, a student may not be ready to
perform all aspects of that PE by the end of the course. For example, a PE may be placed in the
first course because the DCI dimension is determined to be foundational to a PE in the second
course, but the depth of the Scientific and Engineering Practice described in the PE may not be
reached until the third year. The curriculum will need to be designed in a way that accounts for
this reality.  In other words, though the expectation is that all Scientific and Engineering Practices
will be in all courses, it would make sense for students in sixth grade to engage differently from
those in eighth grade; one needs to deliberately build complexity of practices over the middle
school sequence. Model Course Map 1 attempts to organize PEs in a way that scaffolds the
content from course to course, but as these are rearranged for curriculum development, it may be
that some core ideas in performance expectations may need scaffolding within a course to prepare students to learn the content.

5. The math and English Language Arts NGSS connections boxes and their supporting appendices
(Math – Appendix L; ELA – Appendix M) should be consulted to make sure that courses are not
expecting math or ELA content or practices before they are expected in the science sequence. At
the high school level, the Common Core also has grade banded expectations, so this discussion
will need to occur at the state, district, and building level to make sure that the course map for
science does not demand math and ELA performances before they are expected in those curricula.
At the middle school level, there are two performance expectations (MS-PS3-1 and MS-PS4-1)
that are presented in the course map before they are expected in the Common Core. This issue is
addressed at length in the Middle School Revision below.

6. It also may be determined that getting all students prepared for all PEs requires more than three
courses at the high school level. Organizing the standards into four science courses would simply
mean repeating the process as described above, but sorting into four courses instead of three.  In
order for this to still align with the vision of the Framework of all of the PEs being for all
students, all four courses would need to be required for all students. Alternatively, some education
systems – especially those heading toward a proficiency-based system – could  address some of
the PEs in other course structures such as Career and Technical Education, agriculture education,
elective science courses, integrated mathematics or STEM courses, alternative education or online modules.

Next Steps Example: Middle School Revision
With work left to do on these models, it might seem overwhelming and difficult to move forward, so this
section provides an example of the types of decisions that might be made to move a revision forward.  In
this case, the focus is on revising the Conceptual Progressions Course Map described in Table 1. This
revision pulls from several of the suggested next steps described above to provide an example of a result of this revision process.
Unsure about whether or not the Conceptual Progressions Model Course Map would work in their
middle school, John, Deb, and Carmen – the only 6th, 7th, and 8th grade science teachers for
Randolph Middle School – decide to dig into the middle school course map and see how it looks
after they do a bit of re-arranging. In a local option state that has recently adopted NGSS, the
decision for what will happen with the grade-banded middle and high school standards ends up at
the district level and John, Deb, and Carmen are the district’s middle school teachers. They had
been teaching middle school science courses that were discipline specific as John likes biology,
Carmen likes physical science, and Deb has always enjoyed Earth and Space Science. But
following a recent K–12 district science meeting in which they took a stab at sorting the
disciplinary core ideas into courses, both the middle and high school teachers walked out
seriously considering using Model Course Map 1. At their next in-service day, John, Deb, and
Carmen were able to schedule a half-day to work on what their courses might look like next year.
Not sure where to start, Deb suggests starting with the next steps section for Model Course Map 1
to see if any of the suggestions can get them started. After reading through the steps, the group
decides that they still don’t have a good sense of what this course map might look like in the
classroom, so their starting point is to look for related component ideas that could be bundled
together for coordinated instruction. Maybe by looking for related performance expectations and
organizing them into units of instruction, they’ll get a better sense of what it would mean to teach
more interdisciplinary courses. In performing this analysis, they noticed that several component
ideas only had a few PEs and they didn’t seem to relate too closely to the other component ideas
in that course. Whenever they found what they started calling “orphan PEs,” the component idea
and attached PEs were moved to a course that had related ideas, as long as this repositioning did
not alter the concept flow. For example, John noticed that LS2.B Cycles of Energy and Matter
Transfer in Ecosystems in Course 2 had only one PE directly linked to it (see Table 1). Though
there were other life science PEs in Course 2, Carmen suggested that they move LS2.B and its
orphan PE to Course 1 because it would bundle nicely with LS2.A Interdependent Relationships
in Ecosystems. John was initially unsure about moving the component idea to another course
since it also had some connection to component ideas in course two until Deb pointed out that
LS2.A (and its two PEs) was the only life science PE in Course 1 and adding another life science
PE not only found a home for the orphan PE, but also made course 1 more coherent. They quickly
reviewed the math and ELA connections and didn’t discover a reason not to move this component
idea to Course 1 at the middle school level.  A similar line of logic led the group to move ESS2.D

=== Page 16 ===

August 2013
NGSS Release
Page 16 of 40
Weather and Climate from Course 2 to Course 1– there was only one PE connected to the
component idea and a closer examination of the PEs revealed that it bundled well with ESS1.A
Universe and its Stars and ESS2.C The Roles of Water in Earth Surface Processes.
As they were more closely examining the PEs (their previous work was with the Framework) they
had some concerns that some PEs were not in the right course based on the cognitive complexity
they demanded.  Sometimes the aspect of the component idea emphasized in a PE at the middle
school level seemed different than what they remembered from conversations with their high
school colleagues at the K–12 district meeting. For example, at the middle school level, ESS1.A
Universe and its Stars focuses on the motions of the solar system.  Deb suggested that they move
this component idea to Course 1 because it fits well with component idea ESS1.B Earth and its
Solar System.  (At the high school level, ESS1.A includes ideas about the Big Bang theory – a
better fit with PS4.B Electromagnetic Radiation in Course 2). By comparing Table 1 and Table
2, John picked up on another difference between middle school and high school – several
component ideas do not have PEs at the middle school level, so they eliminated the following
component ideas from their middle school course map: PS1.C Nuclear Processes, LS2.D Social
Interaction and Group Behavior, ESS2.E Biogeology, and PS2.C Stability and Instability in
Physical Systems – all of which were placed in Course 3 in the original component idea organization.
Having moved several component ideas from Course 2 to Course 1 and having just eliminated a
number of component ideas from Course 3, the group had a growing concern about courses
becoming unbalanced, so they changed their approach and each of them looked at their content
area specialties for component ideas that might be a good fit to move. Deb nominated PS3.B
Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer as a good candidate to move from Course 1 to
Course 2. She explained that there was only one PE unique to this component idea and it had
good connections with other chemistry PEs in the second course--PS3.B was moved to the second
course.  John suggested moving LS3.A Inheritance of Traits and LS3.B Variation of Traits to
Course 3 – both PEs tie in well with the LS4 component ideas that focus on natural selection and
evolution – and Carmen proposed moving ESS3.A Natural Resources to Course 3 as well because
it fits together well with the PEs from ESS3.A Natural Hazards and ESS1.C History of Planet
Earth.
Feeling like they were getting close to something that might work, the group turned their thoughts
to what they could make work in their building. They realized that, with the room arrangement at
the school and the differences in schedule between 6th and 7th grade, it simply wouldn’t work to
have PS1.B Chemical Reactions at the 6th grade level. They just didn’t have the chemistry lab
space, safety equipment and supplies available to make it happen. They decided that advocating
for any big changes in room arrangements or schedules wasn’t where they wanted to spend their
energy, and they moved PS1.B to Course 2. In looking closely at PS1.B, Carmen also noticed that
there a couple PEs that were connected to both PS1.A (still in Course 1) and PS1.B (now in
Course 2). Rather than having these PEs listed in both courses, the group decided that they would

=== Page 17 ===

August 2013
NGSS Release
Page 17 of 40
evaluate MS-PS1-2 and MS-PS1-3 to determine which course was better for them to bundle with
other PEs.  After comparing the PEs, they decided to list MS-PS1-2 with PS1.B in Course 2 and MS-PS1-3 with PS1.A in Course 1.
Feeling now like they had arranged the science in a conceptual progression that could work for
their school, the group decided to do a double check to make sure that the model course map they
had just developed wasn’t requiring mathematics before students were expected to be prepared to
learn them in their math courses. By examining the NGSS mathematics connections boxes and
Appendix L: Connections to CCSS-Mathematics, it became apparent that a couple PEs needed to
be reconsidered.  MS-PS3-1 – Construct and interpret graphical displays of data to describe the
relationships of kinetic energy to the mass of an object and to the speed of an object – was of
concern because the concept of squares (as would be found in the graphical analysis of kinetic
energy) and the graphical analysis of lines are not expected until the eighth grade in the Common
Core State Standards. In their current arrangement (and the one listed above in Table 1), this PE
(which is connected to component idea PS3.A Definitions of Energy) was placed in Course 1.
Rather than moving this isolated PE to the third course, the group decided to move the entire
component idea to course 3 (where it is in Figure 4), but they were a little concerned how it
would fit in this course. They decided they wanted to talk with their math teachers about maybe
developing a cross-disciplinary unit.  If the math teachers were willing, they would leave the
concept of kinetic energy in Course 1 where it bundles well with related PEs, but then
collaboratively develop a unit for 8th grade where the math teachers would build on this
conceptual foundation by using the science concept of kinetic energy as a context for teaching
about squares and graphical analysis. Then when these students reached the 8th grade, the science
teachers would loan some equipment (and a bit of science knowledge) to the math teachers so that
they could actually collect data in their math class and use the analysis of this data to teach the
mathematics components of the PE – preparing the students to be able to perform the PE by the
end of the grade band.  MS-PS4-1 – Use mathematical representations to describe a simple model
for waves that includes how the amplitude of a wave is related to the energy in a wave – requires
math that wouldn’t be expected until the seventh grade and this PE was also housed in Course 1.
In this case, it was decided to move the PE to the second course. There it bundles nicely with the
component ideas PS4.B Electromagnetic Radiation and PS4.C Information Technologies &
Instrumentation.
John, Deb, and Carmen’s revisions described here are by no means exhaustive – more could be done
along these same lines to truly adapt this model course map to local realities and the decisions that they
have made may not fit another’s reality – but continuing to engage in similar processes and collaborating
on course map development within and between schools, districts, and states along with continued
research on the relative effectiveness of the implementation of different course maps will better inform the next round of standards revision.
The revised middle school course map showing all of these changes can be found below in Figure 4, a component idea concept map, and also in Table 3.

Next Steps Example: Middle School Revision 2, State Specific Model
As mentioned in the introductory section, the middle school and high school standards are grade banded
due to the fact that standards at these levels are handled differently in different states.  As states move
forward toward adoption these models should be referenced for guidance on how to arrange the
performance expectations.  States are encouraged to edit the sample models and turn them into state
specific models to reflect an organization that works best for the state.  There are many unique factors
that may influence a state’s decision to arrange the performance expectations in a particular way.
The following is an example of a state revision where the focus is on revising the Conceptual
Progressions Course Map described in Table 1. This revision was developed by California’s Science
Expert Panel (SEP), a group comprised of kindergarten through grade twelve teachers, scientists,
educators, business industry representatives, and informal science educators.
The SEP used the following criteria to arrange the performance expectations for middle school grades six, seven, and eight:
1. Performance expectations (PEs) were placed at each grade level so that they support content
articulation across grade levels (from fifth through eighth grade) and provide the opportunity for content integration within each grade level.
2. Performance expectations were aligned with the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) in
English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics so that science learning would not be dependent upon math skills not yet acquired.
3. The final arrangement of performance expectations reflected a balance both in content complexity
and number at each grade level with human impact and engineering performance expectations appropriately integrated.
In addition to these criteria, the SEP worked to ensure that the performance expectations could be
bundled together in various ways to facilitate curriculum development.

Course Map 2 – Science Domains Model (grades 6–8 and 9–12)
Process and Assumptions: Where did this model come from?
This model course map was built by placing the NGSS performance expectations (PEs) into a course
structure defined by the science domains outlined in the Framework: one course is assigned to each
science domain of the Framework – Life Science, Physical Science, and Earth and Space Science.  A
fourth course is not included for the fourth domain of the Framework, Engineering, as most of the NGSS
performance expectations connected to engineering are integrated into the science domains through the
Scientific and Engineering Practices and Crosscutting Concepts. The NGSS does include four PEs in
both the middle and high school grade bands that focus exclusively on core idea ETS1: Engineering
Design. As noted in the sixth foundational understanding (pg 3), these stand-alone engineering PEs are
included with all three courses as they help to organize and drive the instruction of the integrated engineering PEs.
This model does not assume a particular order for these three courses. There is not conclusive research at
this point to recommend one sequence over another and there are a variety of factors that may affect the
order determined for these courses if this model course map is selected as a starting point.  Ideas for
guiding this conversation are included in the next steps section following the presentation of the model.
This model course map is significantly less complicated in development relative to the Conceptual
Progressions Model Course Map.  The organization was essentially taken straight from the organization
of the Framework. All component ideas from a given domain and all of the performance expectations
connected to each of those component ideas (as noted in the NGSS foundation boxes) were compiled to
define each course. Tables 4 and 5 below display the resulting organization of courses based on the domains model.

Next Steps for Model Course Map 2
Since the courses were effectively designed based on the parameters of the domains of science defined in
the Framework, any significant shuffling of PEs between courses would, in some sense, void the initial
premise of this model, but getting to this point was mainly about taking a first step toward curriculum so
there are several things to be considered in refining this model. As was mentioned in the next steps
section for Model Course Map 1, it is important to balance this structured arrangement of PEs with
creating courses and units that flow well and engage students in learning. This model course map is
another potential starting point for building instructional units. When bundling together student outcomes
into meaningful units to build the flow for courses, PEs may still be pulled from different courses in the map to make this work.
1. The order these courses would be offered was not predetermined by the course map, so
sequencing the courses will be a decision that will need to be made before proceeding with
curriculum development. It is important to not sequence courses based only on what your current
courses are, but to look in detail at the performance expectations mapped to each course
(including what is required for math and ELA to accomplish the performance expectations) and
sequence courses to best benefit student learning.  Figure 3 and Table 1 and Table 2 from Model
Course Map 1 provide insight about the interconnected nature of the component ideas and how
they support each other in a progression of content. A close examination of these resources and
the next steps suggested for the first model course map are very relevant to this decision-making
process.  Additionally, the math and English Language Arts connections boxes and their
supporting appendices (math – Appendix L; ELA – Appendix M) should be consulted to make
sure that courses are not expecting math or ELA content or practices before they are expected in the science sequence.

2. Regardless of the final sequence of courses, it is likely that some component ideas from other
domains will need to be brought into each course. For example, if the life science course is taught
before the physical science course, some content from the physical sciences will need to be
included in the life course as prerequisite understandings for biological process. As performance
expectations are bundled into curriculum units and lesson plans it is important to balance this
structured arrangement of PEs with creating courses and units that flow well and engage students
in learning. The model course map can be used as a starting point for building instructional units.
When bundling together these student outcomes into meaningful units to build the flow for
courses, PEs may be pulled from different courses in the map to make this work. The course map
is not meant to be a prescriptive, static document, but is meant to provide structure for decision making

3. While rearranging PEs and building instructional units, it’s important to remember that the
performance expectations are grade banded student outcomes and map out student course
expectations appropriately. It may be, though a PE is placed in a course, that the student may not

=== Page 26 ===

August 2013
NGSS Release
Page 26 of 40
be ready to perform all aspects of the PE by the end of the course. For example, it could be that a
PE is placed in the first course because the DCI dimension is determined to be foundational to a
PE in the second course, but the depth of the Scientific and Engineering Practice described in the
PE may not be reached until the third year. The curriculum will need to be designed in a way that
accounts for this reality. In other words, though the expectation is that all Scientific and
Engineering Practices will be in all courses, it would be make sense for students in sixth grade to
engage in these differently than those in eighth grade – deliberately building complexity of
practices over the middle school sequence is needed.

4. If, during the implementation process, restricting the 9–12 grade band to three courses does not
meet local needs, a fourth course could be developed. If all four courses are required, a course
map variation like this could still meet the vision of NGSS and the Framework. Since the three
domains fit fairly well into courses, there is not an obvious way to siphon PEs into a fourth
course, but an examination of Course Map Model 1 could provide direction to this process. Since
the third course in that sequence contains PEs that are most dependent on content from other PEs,
this would be a good starting point in determining which PEs should be considered for being a part of a fourth course.

Course Map 3 – Modified Science Domains Model (grades 9–12)
Process and Assumptions: Where did this model come from?
The model course maps presented here attempt to organize the 9–12 grade band performance
expectations based on the frequently taught courses of Biology, Chemistry and Physics. These courses
represent a very common course distribution across many states – either through legislation, regulation,
or tradition – so these examples are presented as tools for evaluating how this commonly used course
sequence overlays with the expectations of the Next Generation Science Standards. The challenge of this
model course map was to also address Earth and Space Science since it is a domain outlined in the
Framework, but does not have a course of its own in this organization. A fundamental understanding of
the NGSS and all of the Model Course Maps is that all PEs are for all students. Since few states currently
require four high school science courses, this model examined how the Earth and Space Science PEs
could be distributed between the three courses already described.
Most of the NGSS engineering performance expectations are integrated into the other domains; however,
in the final draft of the NGSS there are four PEs in each grade band that focus exclusively on engineering
design. These stand-alone engineering PEs are included in all three courses as they should help organize
and drive the instruction of the integrated engineering PEs in all three courses.
The first step in mapping performance expectations to courses was to examine the component idea level
of the Disciplinary Core Ideas and decide with which course the component ideas best aligned, along
with the associated performance expectations (as noted in the foundation boxes of the NGSS).  These
decisions were made through a careful reading for the text describing the grade band endpoints for each
component idea in the Framework. This was easiest for the Life Science component ideas as they all
ended up in Biology. It was a more difficult step for the Physical Science component ideas as they had to be split between Chemistry and Physics courses.
The most challenging domain to organize into these three courses was Earth and Space Science as these
performance expectations did not have a course of their own. Since a fundamental assumption of all of
the model course maps is that all the performance expectations of the NGSS are for all students and many
states do not require four courses of science, the decision was made to attempt to distribute the Earth and
Space Science in a logical fashion across the Biology, Chemistry, and Physics Courses. This was done in
a two-step process: first the twelve Earth and Space Science DCI component ideas were assigned to a
course based on their best conceptual fit, then the individual earth science PEs were sorted by their
alignment to those component ideas. This was done using the alignment of PEs to component ideas in the
DCI Foundation Boxes of the NGSS.
As with Model Course Map 2, no course sequence has been assumed in this model.

The assignment of the life science DCIs to Biology is self-evident based on conventional course
descriptions, as is the assignment of the earth science DCI component idea ESS2.E Biogeology. The
component idea of ESS3.B Natural Hazards is placed in Biology because it offers an opportunity to
examine the impact of earth systems on organisms. Conversely, ESS3.C Human Impacts is attached to
Biology so students can examine the impact of the human organism on other organisms and earth
systems. ESS1.C History of the Earth is included because of the interdependent nature of the co-evolution of the earth system and living organisms.
The DCI component idea ESS3.A Natural Resources is included in Chemistry because of the important
role of many natural resources in chemical reactions that are crucial to modern human society. ESS3.A
Global Climate Change is connected to Chemistry because many earth-based and atmospheric chemical
processes drive systems that affect climate. Addressing ESS2.D Weather and Climate is then a logical
progression once students better understand its driving mechanisms. ESS2.C Water in Earth’s Surface
Processes is included because many of the geological effects of water are a result of its molecular structure and chemical properties.
Forces, interactions, waves and electromagnetic radiation, and energy are historically all components of a
Physics course. The DCI component ideas ESS1.A The Universe and Stars, and ESS1.B The Earth and
the Solar System find their home in Physics because of the understanding of motion and forces needed to
explain their interactions. Similarly, understanding energy flow and the interactions of forces helps
explain the mechanisms described in ESS2.A Earth Materials and Systems,” and also in ESS2.B Plate
Tectonics.
Next Steps for Course Map 3
Course Map 3 lies in between Course Maps 1 and 2 in terms of the needed refinement. The courses in
this map were primarily driven by the domains of science defined in the Framework, but they are
designed within the constraint of having the courses Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, with the Earth and
Space Science PEs split among courses. As was mentioned in the next steps sections for the previous two
model course maps, it is important to balance this structured arrangement of PEs with creating courses
and instructional units that flow well and engage students in learning. This PE arrangement can be used
as a starting point for building instructional units. While bundling together student outcomes into
meaningful units to build the flow for courses, PEs may be pulled from different courses in the map to make this work.
There are several other considerations when revising this model:
1. Much like Model Course Map 2, the sequence of courses is not predetermined, so deciding on an
order would be one of the first decisions to make. It is important to not sequence courses based
only on what your current courses are, but to look in detail at the performance expectations
mapped to each course (including what is required for math and ELA to accomplish the
performance expectations) and sequence courses to best benefit student learning.  Figure 3 and

=== Page 30 ===

August 2013
NGSS Release
Page 30 of 40
Table 1 and Table 2 from Model Course Map 1 provide insight about the interconnected nature
of the component ideas and how they support each other in a progression of content.  A close
examination of these resources and the next steps suggested for the first model course map will
support this decision-making process.  Additionally, the math and English Language Arts
connections boxes and their supporting appendices (math – Appendix L; ELA – Appendix M)
should be consulted to make sure that courses are not expecting math or ELA content or practices
before the grade level indicated in the Common Core.

2. The split of Earth and Space Science PEs also needs close examination to make sure that the PEs
have been effectively arranged and that they fit the expectations of the state or local courses.  The
sequence of courses may have a significant impact on which Earth and Space Science PEs are placed in which course.

3. A quick glance at Table 6, which outlines how the performance expectations are organized in this
model course map, makes it clear that this map has an imbalance of PEs in each course. This
deserves examination as PEs are bundled into instructional units to determine if any PEs (or even
entire component ideas) should shift courses. The Earth and Space Science PEs would be ready
candidates for this move, but it might also be that a component idea, like LS1.C Organization for
Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms, might be moved from Biology (which has the most PEs)
to the Chemistry (which has the least). This move would also make sense because the content of
LS1.C ties in nicely with some of the chemistry concepts. It should be noted here that simply
counting the number of PEs in a course does not necessarily give a good sense of the time it will
take to prepare students to be able to perform what is expected – this is better determined by the
length of time needed for the instructional units that are developed.

4. While rearranging PEs and building instructional units remember that the performance
expectations are grade banded student outcomes and map out student course expectations
appropriately. It may be that, though a PE is placed in a course, the student may not be ready to
perform all aspects of the PE by the end of the course. For example, it could be that a PE is placed
in the first course because the DCI dimension is determined to be foundational to a PE in the
second course, but the depth of the Scientific and Engineering Practices described in the PE may
not be reached until the third year. The curriculum will need to be designed in a way that accounts
for this reality.  In other words, though the expectation is that all Scientific and Engineering
Practices will be in all courses, it would make sense for students in sixth grade to engage in these
differently than those in eighth grade – deliberately building complexity of practices over the middle school sequence is needed.

5. Another solution to mesh NGSS with an existing course sequence that includes physics,
chemistry, and biology courses, would be to add a fourth course – Earth and Space Science – to
the sequence.  If all four courses are required, this variation would still meet the vision of the

=== Page 31 ===

August 2013
NGSS Release
Page 31 of 40
Framework that all PEs are expected for all students.  A reminder that these “courses” do not
have a defined length of time – four courses does not necessarily mean four years.
Next Steps Example: Revising the Modified Science Domains Model--Four Courses
The following vignette describes an experience that a high school may have in deciding to use the
Science Domains model, but with revisions to make it a four course model.
In this scenario, a school district decides that the Modified Science Domains model will be the
easiest to implement because it aligns with the teacher licensure situation in the state/district and
there is inflexibility in modifying qualified admissions criteria within the state university system.
In this state, teacher licensure is restricted to particular content areas (there is no general
science endorsement area) and it is particularly difficult to add areas of endorsement.  The
admissions criteria for state universities specifically require successful completion of a course
called “Biology.” The organization that regulates these admissions criteria has been historically
resistant to make any changes to these criteria. The district is compelled by the vision of the
Framework and NGSS and has decided to move forward quickly with implementation for the
betterment of its students, but it sees these barriers as insurmountable in the short term and or
beyond their control. The K-12 science team has decided that the Modified Science Domains
model will be their starting point and that they will re-evaluate this decision in five years based
on its effectiveness, any new research that evaluates the course maps at a larger scale, and any
changes that are made to licensure and admissions criteria – which they perceive as barriers to
using the other model course maps as starting points.
As the K-12 science team evaluates the Modified Science Domains Model they are unable to come
to terms with how the Earth and Space Science PEs are divided between courses. Unable to
propose a different arrangement that they find acceptable, they make a decision to pull out the
Earth and Space Science component ideas into a separate fourth course. To make sure that this
arrangement is robust, the K-12 science team assembles a strategic stakeholder team of local
teachers, professors, science-related business and industry representatives, a local school board
member who has an interest in science education, and the educator for the local science
children’s museum to organize the NGSS into four courses. They know that in order to still meet
the vision of the NGSS of all standards for all students, they will have to change the graduation
criteria for their high school, which currently only requires biology and two other science
electives. There is a strong relationship between the K-12 science team and the local school
board, and especially with the inclusion of a liaison to the board on their team, they are hopeful
that this is possible – they at least perceive this to be within their realm of potential influence.
This local control state has state graduation requirements, but local modifications are allowed if they exceed the state requirements.
Through discussions of this strategic stakeholder team, they decide to keep essentially the same
content distribution of the Life Science and Physical Science PEs as they are in the Modified

=== Page 32 ===

August 2013
NGSS Release
Page 32 of 40
Course Domains model, but pull the Earth and Space Science performance expectations into their
own course.  In addition to separating the PEs into four courses, their revised model course map
also follows the example suggested in the third recommended next step (above) and moves LS1.C
from Biology to Chemistry. The committee agrees that even though this is a Life Science
component idea, the content has a fair amount of crossover with chemistry and this balances the courses a bit better.
After determining the arrangement of performance expectations for their course map (see Table
7,) the stakeholder group decides to outline a four-year tentative implementation plan to highlight
all the necessary changes to curriculum, instruction, professional learning opportunities, and
local graduation requirements.  The K-12 science team, with the endorsement of the strategic
stakeholder group, presents the course sequence and implementation plan to the local school
board as a part of their request to increase the graduation requirements to include all four courses.

Course Maps and Implementation
Choosing a Course Map
These course maps are not end products, rather they are models of processes for mapping performance
expectations onto courses and starting points for continued work.  They are by no means the only
arrangements possible, but are intended to be concrete examples to start conversations about the direction
of science education at the building, district, and state level. This section highlights some of the factors to
consider in making a decision to use one, more than one (at different grade bands), or none of the model course maps presented.
Any course map will have benefits and challenges linked to the underlying assumptions and processes
that were involved in making them and to the local situation where they are to be implemented.  Of
course, “benefits” and “challenges” depend on one’s perspective.  Something identified as a “challenge”
may actually be a primary reason for selecting a model if the challenge is one that is determined to be in
the students’ best interest.  For example, if a state education agency is already planning a re-design of
teacher licensure, then selecting a model course map that doesn’t fit well with their existing teacher
licensure system would not necessarily be a barrier to selecting that course map--it might even be a
reason for selection because it aligns with the direction of the licensure re-design process. Likewise, what
some may consider a “benefit,” others may see as a reason not to select a course map. Some may start
with a particular course map because it contains courses that are very similar to what is currently offered,
but others may see this as more of a drawback as it may result in teachers being less convinced they need
to make and changes – making it difficult to ensure a complete and coherent implementation of the vision
of the Framework. The realities and needs in states and LEAs are quite different; therefore, outlined
below are factors to consider in deciding how to map the grade banded performance expectations onto courses for the NGSS.
Factors for Consideration
1. Are the performance expectations organized in a way to maximize student learning?
Course Map 1, Conceptual Understanding, was the only model that was consciously designed with this
in mind.  DCI component ideas and their related Performance Expectations are deliberately sequenced to
allow students to build their knowledge in a logical progression. This model supports students’
engagement in Scientific and Engineering Practices and applies Crosscutting Concepts to deepen
students’ understanding of physical science, life science and earth and space science core ideas over
multiple years of school (p.8, NRC, 2012). According to the Framework, “[b]y the end of the 12th grade,
students should have gained sufficient knowledge of the practices, crosscutting concepts and core ideas
of science and engineering to engage in public discussions on science-related issues, to be critical
consumers of scientific information related to their everyday lives, and to continue to learn about science throughout their lives” (p.9, NRC, 2012).

This does not mean that, through effective curriculum planning and lesson plan development, the other
models course maps couldn’t be developed in a way that would also maximize student learning, but their
infrastructure was not designed with this as a focus.  With an organizational structure built directly from
the domains of the Framework (Course Map 2), or traditional scientific divisions (Course Map 3) it will
take a concerted effort to ensure that there are opportunities to build conceptual knowledge over time,
especially for concepts that are cross-disciplinary.
2. Are the performance expectations organized in a way that increases efficiency in instruction?
Among the many recommendations for improving the coherence and effectiveness of the K–12
curriculum, Designs for Science Literacy (AAAS, 2001), is a cross-disciplinary organization that
eliminates the unnecessary repetition of topics – the same ideas in the same contexts, often with the same
activities and the same questions. A common student complaint is that the same topics are presented in
successive grades, often in the same way.  Similarly, a common teacher complaint is that the students did
not receive instruction in important topics in prior grades and so these topics now have to be taught in the
present grade thus perpetuating an instructional gap for the following grades (AAAS, 2001).
In Course Map 1, the thoughtful sequence of DCI component ideas and PEs limits unnecessary repetition
while still providing students prerequisite knowledge necessary for success in subsequent science
courses. Course Maps 2 and 3 were not designed with this in mind and though the order that courses are
sequenced within either model could alleviate some of this, there are performance expectations within
every course that expect students to know concepts that are being addressed in other courses. If this is
addressed thoughtfully in curriculum design, it could provide opportunity for cross-disciplinary
connections, but in terms of instruction efficiency, it does mean that there will be times that teachers will
have to allot class time to bring students up to speed on background concepts necessary to get to the
concepts intended to be addressed in any given course.
3. Are the performance expectations organized in a way that represents the interconnectedness of science?
The organization of scientific research has become more complex and has evolved from The Committee
of Ten’s constructs of 1893 which organized K-12 science education around astronomy, meteorology,
botany, zoology, physiology, anatomy, hygiene, chemistry and physics. The cross-disciplinary
organization of Course Map 1 makes natural connections across the science domains of the Framework
more evident to teachers and students and provides for a more flexible, coherent and realistic pathway to
developing deep understandings of science. Course Maps 2 and 3 were not designed with this in mind,
though careful curriculum and lesson plan development could create these connections.

4. How does the course map align with current state guidelines/legislation/policies for course
titles, course sequences, teacher licensure, credits for graduation, and college admissions expectations?
States vary in terms of how these policies are created and the processes that are involved in changing
them, but these are all important factors for consideration in selecting or developing a course map. For
example, some states only require two science credits for graduation, but the NGSS performance
expectations are written for all students and none of the model course maps include fewer than three
courses. “Credit” and “courses” do not describe what students know or are able to do; the system of PEs
in the NGSS, all of which are for all students, detail what is to be achieved.
5. What are the implications for teaching positions?
Any of the course map models (depending on the realities of current teacher preparation and licensure
policies, current course offerings, graduation requirements, course sequences, etc. and any changes that
are proposed) may have a significant impact on the number of teachers prepared to teach courses. This
could also be affected by the proposed sequencing of courses in Course Maps 2 and 3. For example,
switching from a biology-chemistry-physics sequence in a state where biology is the only “required”
science in a sequence of three required for graduation to using Course Map 2 and sequencing courses
physical science-life science-earth science will put different demands on the system to provide teachers
qualified to teach the courses. This would also potentially impact teacher certification/licensure policies,
teacher preparation, and professional learning opportunities.
6. How do these course maps affect the focus of pre-service teacher preparation and professional learning opportunities?
Transitioning from current state science standards to the NGSS provide significant opportunities to
support advancing science instruction regardless of the course map that is utilized. Teachers of science
will need intensive, ongoing and job-embedded professional development in order for their students to
meet the challenges of the performance expectations defined in the NGSS. Teachers will need to wrestle with questions such as:
 What do we want students to learn?
 How will we know what students are learning?
 How will we respond when they do not learn?
The cross-disciplinary approach of Course Map 1 is somewhat different than common current practice in
teacher preparation and professional development. Pre-service teachers are less likely to have
experienced an explicitly cross-disciplinary course in their own courses, which will mean that those
responsible for preparing them to be teachers will have to explicitly incorporate this into teaching and
learning experiences. Many teachers already in the field are very passionate about the particular domain
that they are teaching. They may have accumulated a significant amount of knowledge of practices and

=== Page 37 ===

August 2013
NGSS Release
Page 37 of 40
core ideas within a content area and may have less experience outside of their preferred domain. If
Course Map 1 is used, professional learning opportunities will need to be carefully crafted to value this
expertise and support teachers in making this transition.
Course Map 2 does not require a specific focus for teacher preparation or professional learning other than
those that are called for in transitioning to the NGSS.
Course Map 3 would also require a specific focus in teacher preparation and professional learning
opportunities. The incorporation of the Earth and Space Science performance expectations across the
biology, chemistry, and physics courses may not align with current practice. Teacher preparation and
professional learning opportunities will need to be explicitly designed to support teachers in this transition.
7. Does the course map affect any plans for communicating about science education with stakeholders?
In adopting the NGSS (an assumed step if now choosing a course map of these standards),
communication with key stakeholders – students, parents, teachers, administrators, school boards,
business and industry, etc. – will be important to support effective implementation. The course map
model that is used may require additional specific communication with messaging targeted for
stakeholder groups, in particular if the course map is requiring significant system changes.
8. How is the course map selected impacted by resource availability?
Existing resources, such as textbooks, workbooks, and even online resources, often sort information
based on content in a way that is more similar to Course Maps 2 and 3. For state or districts that focus
their curriculum on a particular textbook, this may affect the decision of how to map out courses, but for
others that pull from a variety of resources and already use their textbook as a support for their
curriculum rather than as the curriculum, this may be irrelevant. As new resources are written and
existing resources are rewritten for the NGSS, they may be more frequently be designed with one course
map or another in mind, but this too may be less of a concern due to the development of more flexible
resources such as open education resources and editable digital textbook formats.
Conclusions
It may seem a forgone conclusion that the course map specifically designed to coherently build student
conceptual understanding over time, maximize efficient use of class time, and prepare students for the
cross-disciplinary reality of science research will be the one that everyone selects, but there may be good
reasons for choosing a different model (including “none of the above”). In fact, engineering an effective
learning program is a complex and challenging task that depends on instructor knowledge of the content
and pedagogy, materials that support good instruction, determination and implementation of learning
progressions, assessments for formative and summative purposes, even school climate – issues much
beyond the goals of this document. Hopefully the factors described above will result in meaningful

=== Page 38 ===

August 2013

Page 38 of 40
conversations in states and districts about their science education systems. Adopting the NGSS will
require systemic changes to implement them with fidelity to the vision of the Framework. It is a great
opportunity for deliberate decision-making about whether or not your system is designed in a way that
gives students the best opportunities possible to realize this vision. Deciding on a course map is just one
of the decisions that is important in this process, but requires careful consideration because of the potential impacts across the system.
This situation of many states and districts utilizing the same standards, but with different course maps
also has significant potential to inform our understanding of students learn science. As was mentioned in
the introduction, the reason why we even have to juggle the idea of multiple course maps is that there is
insufficient research to recommend a particular sequence. With fifty different sets of state standards, it
has been difficult to determine if one sequence is more effective than another, but with many states
considering adoption of these standards, there is fertile ground for historic research to move our understanding forward.
Developing a New Course Map
It might be that none of the course maps presented here meets the needs of your state or LEA. If this is
the case, it would definitely make sense to design a course map model of your own rather than simply
refining what has been provided. The multi-dimensionality of the NGSS would certainly allow for a
course map based on something other than just DCIs – either by one of the other dimensions, or a
combination of the three. These and other reasons for developing alternative course map models are
certainly valid, but hopefully there is enough in the descriptions above to make this process a bit
smoother. Examining the underlying assumptions of these course maps, reviewing the processes that
were used to create the course maps provided, and weighing all this with the factors for consideration just
described provides a framework to jumpstart the development of new course maps that meet the needs of
the students in your local education agency or state.
Refining a Course Map
Selecting one of the provided course maps does not mean the work is done, but it is the first step in a
journey. The course map will need further refinement to meet local needs and then the real work begins
to develop curricula and lessons based on the course map, necessary professional learning opportunities
will need to be accessed or developed to support implementation with fidelity. Additionally, as with all
scientific endeavors, you will want to plan out how you will determine if your efforts are successful.
What types of data will you use to determine whether or not the arrangement “worked?” What processes
will be put in place to refine your course map to increase its effectiveness?  Even once these questions
have been answered, as curriculum units and lesson plans are designed and refined in the classroom, it is
likely that further refinement of the course map will be necessary.
Recommendations for refining each course map is found at the end of each of the model descriptions
above, but more significant revisions may be in order if the underlying assumptions described in the
introduction are not acceptable.  For example, if your state requires four courses in science and there is

=== Page 39 ===

August 2013
NGSS Release
Page 39 of 40
not any intention to change this, then a three course sequence for high school may not be what you need.
This may mean that you refine the models as presented – perhaps simply re-sorting PEs in Course Map
Model 1 into four courses; or using Course Map Model 3 with a separate Earth and Space Science course
rather than splitting the Earth and Space Science PEs across biology, chemistry, and physics – or it may mean starting from scratch.
Additional work will also need to be done locally to consider the mathematics that is expected by the
performance expectations in both grade bands. As local mathematics courses may differ, especially at the
high school level, it will be important to have cross-disciplinary conversations to make sure that students
are receiving complementary instruction across content areas. The connections boxes on the NGSS should also inform this conversation.
