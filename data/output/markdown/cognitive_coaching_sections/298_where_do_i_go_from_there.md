## Where Do I Go from There?

As table 12.3 illustrates, the coach begins the lead with questions that illuminate a particular state of mind. If that seems unproductive, the coach may explore other states of mind. Other mediational strategies include paraphrasing to shift the conceptual level of abstraction and asking questions that illuminate feelings, values, or more details about the goals. The coach might also ask the person to compose self-generated questions or use a series of questions that move from focusing on a third party to themselves. For example:

- What behaviors do you want from the group?
- What knowledge, skills, or attitudes will they need to perform those behaviors?
- What might you do to help them develop these resources?
- What internal resources do you need in order to do that?

Language offers cues to thinking. Language also abides by certain conventions. One thing we want to avoid is detail in which every nuance of thought is expressed. When people talk or write, generalizations, deletions, and distortions are quite common. At times, however, they blur understanding and hide opportunities for choice. Coaches are sensitive to these language forms at all times, but most particularly when leading colleagues to resources. When coaches suspect that one of these forms of language is hiding important information from thinking processes, they may respond in the following ways.
