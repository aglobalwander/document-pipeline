## Chapter 2 The Context

W hen pioneering navigators first sailed from the coasts of Asia, Africa, and Europe, they were guided by their dreams, the stars, and primitive compasses-sailing into territories marked on their fanciful charts as unknown lands and seas of mystery. Undoubtedly many in the ships' crews cast apprehensive glances at familiar receding shores, trusting in the soundness of their vessel and the courage and skills of their leaders. Their affects were legion: some were destructive, decimating indigenous cultures and native ecologies; others were constructive, made possible by the forces of technical change, the same forces that propelled a satellite in a flyby of the dwarf planet Pluto in July 2015.

Their  tools,  by  today's  standards  were primitive: the compass, the sextant, the quadrant  to  measure  the  altitude  and  angle  of celestial  bodies,  and  primitive  maps  of  the world and its seas. Incredibly, the same class of  scientific  thinking,  admittedly  more  sophisticated,  directed  the  twenty-first-century spacecraft passing Pluto, sending images back over  three  billon  miles  from  its  nine-and-ahalf-year  journey.  This  form  of  thinking  has also  governed  approaches  to  school  change for  hundreds  of  years.  It  was  present  in  the early life of kindergartens in 1900, the introduction of 'scientific management' during the period 1900 to 1925, an approach introduced in industry by Francis Taylor. Scientific management  promoted  the  virtues  of  efficiency and time management.

tional Commission on School District Reorganization  proposed  to  eliminate  the  one-room schoolhouses,  thereby  reducing  the  country's 115,000 districts to five thousand.

Taylor's educational followers saw teachers  as  workers  requiring  direct  supervision  to meet predetermined goals. Edward Thorndike, another  researcher  committed  to  efficiency, introduced  standardized  testing,  including  intelligence  testing  adopted  by  the  U.S.  Army beginning in 1900. In 1948 one of these authors graduated eighth grade, the same year the Na-

Efforts  to  study  and  improve  curriculum were launched by twenty men in 1930, eventually leading to the formation of the Association of  Supervision  and  Curriculum  Development, still  a  dominant  force  in  staff  development. Major attempts to reform secondary education occurred during the period 1933 to 1941. According to Tyack and Cuban (1995) this 'Eight Year Study' allowed students to attend courses that crossed departmental boundaries. The first 'In  Service  Workshops'  emerged  during  this era.  The  effects  of  the  Eight  Year  Study  declined as reformers responding to the perceived threats  of  World  War  II  and  the  Cold  War advocated for more authoritarianism in school organizations. Technical thinking drove efforts in innovation throughout the period from 1930 into  the  1950s.  Later,  during  the  1980s  and 1990s the effective schools research led to lists, inventories,  and  an  emphasis  on  behaviorist psychology with rewards and sanctions as the means to school improvement.

The  No  Child  Left  Behind  Act  of  2001 (NCLB)  perpetuated  this  same  line  of  thinking in school reform. Insensitive to schools as systems,  NCLB  spawned  unintended  results; the  vast  majority  of  schools  'increased  time for  reading  and  math  while  decreasing  time for social studies, science, art, music and even recess'  (Goldstein,  2014).  In  many  regions teacher  pay  was  linked  to  student  test  scores, as parent and teacher revolts erupted over excessive  testing. The  debates  on  testing  in  this country were not unusual as Goldstein (2014) accounts in her history of education, concluding that no other profession operates under the same  level  of  political  scrutiny.  Educational change  has  been  a  battlefield  since  the  early 1800s  and,  at  the  present  time,  public  school teaching  has  become  one  of  the  most  controversial  professions  in  America.  Opposing  a business  orientation  to  schools,  Sergiovanni (1994)  famously  said,  'Schools  are  not  fast food chains or armies.' Rather, they are more like families  and  religious  organizations  in respect to culture, mission, and personnel than like corporations. Educators are interdependent groups  regarding  knowledge  as  fluid,  provisional,  and  subject  to  improvement.  Schools are ultimately moral organizations and become increasingly so when they replace talking at or to one another with true conversations.

By  1925  a  human  relations  orientation had  emerged  in  opposition  to  the  scientific movement of the  times. Teachers  and  administrators  were  advised  to  be  more  democratic in their treatment of others. This form of educational  philosophy,  never  completely  absent since then, became measurable in the latter part of  the  twentieth  century.  Researchers  began exploring other ways of understanding school change, leading to efforts that, while having a humanistic bent, were still 'technical' in their implementation  efforts.  The  RAND  changeagent  study  in  the  late  1970s  revealed  three principles of school change that are still sound: (a) the importance of staff efficacy; (b) the related value of participation in decision-making; and  (c)  the  necessity  for  the  simultaneity  of both  bottom-up  and  top-down  change  efforts (McLaughlin, 1990).

This was followed by the meta-analysis of school improvement designs by such authors as Mathew Miles (1984), Richard Elmore (1990), Seymour  Sarason  (1990),  Larry  Cuban,  and Michael  Fullan  that  informed  further  change efforts  as  they  drew  on  knowledge  emerging from  the  field  of  organizational  development. Researchers recruited from Xerox and the universities of Stanford and Berkeley, representing the disciplines of anthropology, computer science,  education,  psychology,  and  linguistics, formed an educational think tank, the Institute for  Research on Learning (IRL) that operated from 1986 to 2000. The IRL contributed to a social  approach  to  learning  expressed  in  the 'Seven Principles' of learning and the idea of communities practice. Their work represented a break from what we are calling technical thinking,  to  understanding  change  through  a  more adaptive lens.

In the late twentienth century and the early twenty-first century, research began to develop around what we will call school energies. These included a focus on trust (Bryk and Schneider, 2002), professional communities learning (Hall and  Hord,  2001),  collaboration  (Little,  1990), teacher efficacy (Bandura, 1977; Goddard

Seven Principles of Learning

- 1. Learning is fundamentally social.
- 2. Knowledge is integrated  in  the  life of communities.
- 3. Learning is an act of membership.
- 4. Knowing  depends  on  engagement in practice.
- 5. Engagement is inseparable from empowerment.
- 6. 'Failure to Learn' is the normal result of exclusion from participation.
- 7. We  already  have  a  society  of  lifelong learners.

and  Hoy,  2000),  systems  oriented  leadership (Hargreaves and Fullan, 2012; Heifetz, Linsky, and Grashow, 2009), neurosciences (Damasio, 1999;  Rizzolatti  and  Sinigaglia,  2008;  Rock, 2008),  systems  seeing  (Quade,  2015),  and coaching teachers (Costa and Garmston, 1994, 2002, 2016).

the world not as a reflection of ourselves, but as images of the many possibilities within the human landscape, and to grasp a more complex understanding of how change occurs.

Today, we enter a new world, personally, in  education  and  in  the  broader  environment. Innovation, new opportunities, and challenges confront us: from fMRI studies of the brain to proposals by Amazon to use drones to get products to customers more speedily. Our personal and  organizational  maps  for  this  new  world are  in  many  ways  incomplete. What we most need to develop are the mental, emotional, and social tools for finding our way in these shifting landscapes. We also need new lenses to see

New  lenses  lead  to  unfamiliar  tools  that help us to see fresh sights, think new thoughts, and do new things. For productive school improvement efforts, many of these new tools are both cognitive and cultural. How we think influences the ways that we work together. How we work together influences the ways that we think about that work. This book explores the previously  unfamiliar  lens  of  adaptivity  as  it relates to improving our schools

Evolutionary forces shaped human brains and  response  systems  to  meet  the  demands of much earlier times. If a saber-toothed tiger were to bound through the door, these systems

## Adaptivity in a Complex System

In the summer of 2015, we witnessed a grey wolf and two grizzly bears maneuvering over an elk carcass, brought down that morning by the wolf. What we learned is that the elk is an adaptive animal, changing its habits according to environmental conditions. Elk move into heavy timber when wolves are around and return to grassy meadow when wolves are absent. The return of the grey wolf to Yellowstone National Park triggered a trophic cascade among animals and plants (Yellowstone Wolf Project, Annual Report 2013).

In 1995 grey wolves were reintroduced to the park after nearly a seventy-year absence. Technical thinking in the 1930s led to the extermination of park wolves, because they were believed to be bad for the survival of elk. Elk are also prey for bears and at that time cougars, but the culprit focused on by park managers was the grey wolf. With wolves gone and less predatory pressure on the elk, herds grew so large as to become unsustainable because of insufficient food; many elk grew sick and died as they over-grazed pastures. The park, like schools, is an ecosystem in which everything affects everything else. Elk populations grew, and without the predatory pressure from wolves, didn't move around much in the winter, instead feeding heavily on aspen, cottonwood plants, and willow. Beavers need willow to survive in the winter. Because the elk felt safe from the wolves, giving them no need to move, willow were over-browsed leading the beaver population's decrease to one colony.

Today,  with  the  grey  wolf  back,  elks  keep  on  the  move,  and  healthier  willow  stands enable nine beaver colonies to thrive in the restored habitat. More beavers mean more dams and ponds, with multiple effects on stream hydrology. The dams even out the seasonal pulses of runoff, store water for recharging the water table, and provide cold, shaded water for fish, while newly robust willow stands provide habitat for songbirds. Scavengers that once relied on winter-killed elk for food now depend on wolf-killed elk. That benefits ravens, eagles, magpies, coyotes, and bears (grizzly and black), especially as the bears emerge hungry from hibernation. Wolf kills also affect beetles, wolverine, lynx, and other species.

would immediately trigger a host of chemical, physical, and emotional reactions. Modern humans still possess automatic routines for Pleistocene-era problems and like frogs in warming water, can't sense the change until it is too late.

The fast reflexes that supported our hunting and gathering ancestors will not help educators develop the forms of schools and schooling that we need in this new era. These demands require new minds and models that are better suited for the challenges of today. Most of all, educators need new sensitivities that can discern what is not readily apparent to the senses and help to craft  new  ways  of  improving  schools  for  the journey ahead.

## Adaptive Leaders

When the task is done, the people will say we did it ourselves.

-Lau Tzu, describing the best leader (Tzu's Tao Te Ching , c. 500 BC)

Traditional, views of leadership are less and less useful given the complexities of our modern world. Never-ending reform efforts, ongoing political challenges to schools, and rapid social and technological  change  strain  systems  organized as hierarchies. At no time has the need for adaptivity  been  so  urgent,  requiring  both  protection and questioning of the status quo, orchestrating conflict to press for richer levels of understanding  and  action,  and  developing  capacities  for provocative  leadership  in  all  members  of  an organization. As  both  stability  and  change  are needed,  the  adaptive  leader  is  both  a  member of a group and an observer of the group and its environment.  Teachers,  school  and  department heads, and students can all lead adaptively.

One of the demands of adaptive leadership is  the  need  to  mobilize people to take on difficult  challenges. Such leadership is grounded in  the  idea  that  prevailing  issues  in  schools are often  addressed  unsuccessfully  because of  insufficient  knowledge,  skills,  and  values

(Zoller,  Lahera,  and  Noremore,  2015). Adaptive leadership activates new perspectives and builds  on  the  past,  helping  people  determine what is worth preserving and what is productive  to  question  (Heifetz  and  Linsky,  2002). 'Who are we?' 'Why are we doing this?' and 'Why are we doing this, this way?' (chapter 1) are potent questions, stimulating adaptivity. As such, successful adaptive changes build on the past rather than ignoring it making successful adaptations both conservative and progressive.

Mobilization  includes  developing  faculties  for  cultures  of  inquiry  and  collaboration. Adaptive leaders patiently cultivate the social skills  of  professional  capital,  by  nurturing  the skills sets for dialogue, discussion, productive conflict,  and  pushing  teachers  to  continually explore  the  relationship  between  curriculum, pedagogy, and student learning. Mobilization, too,  involves  developing  in  faculties  a  sense of system awareness and discernment between technical  and  adaptive  challenges.  Technical problems are head and shoulders issues, adaptive  changes  are  processed  lower  in  the  gut (Linsky and Zoller, 2015).

Adaptive challenges are issues that, in the beginning,  others  do  not  recognize  as  problems. It is the adaptive leader that brings heat to the system, and structures responses in such a way that the people who have the problem do the  work.  These  leaders  sell  the  problem  and not the solution.

Because  adaptive  change  is  disruptive, leaders  also  support  people  in  navigating  the change. Rather than resisting change, according to Heifetz and Linsky, people resist loss. This is congruent with Bridges's (1980) seminal work on transitions in which people inevitably move through  three  psychological  zones  related  to change-endings, where loss is profoundly experienced, a neutral zone of disorientation, and finally new beginnings in which leaders focus people on the process of achieving outcomes, not  the  outcomes  themselves.  Because  these first  two  are  normal  reactions  to  change,  and because, uninformed, many feel there is something  wrong with them when they experience

the  emotions  of  loss  and  disorientation,  the adaptive leader helps normalize the processes and offers tools for making the psychological changes necessary.

We have found these questions useful with groups  experiencing  adaptive  change  (Garmston, 2004).

- · What is over and what is not?
- · What do you value and want to continue? As individuals and as a group, what can we do to support ourselves through changes?
- · What are  some  areas  in  which  we  might need to tap into our creativity?
- · What are  some  areas  in  which  we  might need to manage the chaos of transition?
- · If this phase of life for this school looks like clouds, what might be some silver linings?

Viewing  the  system  and  system  change from the balcony is an essential trait of leadership.  We  have  watched  countless  examples  of skilled quarterbacks, in the middle of the action, appear  seemingly  calm  as  they  scan  the  field looking  for  possible  receivers.  In  the  immediacy, the quarterback is sensitive to burly bodies hurling  his  way  allowing  him  to  step  aside  to avoid them, while the balcony view affords an understanding of the whole play. Every leader, according to Heifetz and Linsky (2002), should routinely climb to the balcony over their organization to survey, study, and to gain perspective on  what  is  going  on  and  determine  needed adjustments.  School  leaders,  too,  operate  from these  multiple  perspectives-participating  in the group, modeling new behaviors, embracing learning  and  risk  taking,  keeping  ears  to  the ground  in  private  conversations,  and  moving to the balcony in meetings and in reflections as they consider progress of their unit as a whole.

Consistent with the values, goals, and tools of Adaptive  Schools,  we  increasingly  witness the  following  adaptive  leadership  practices  in schools, departments, and grade-level teams.

- · Reframing  the  leader's  job  from  that  of problem-solver  to  problem  framers  and developer of problem solvers.
- · Asking  the  important,  tough  questions without having the answers.
- · Knowing how to help people learn, not by telling,  but  by  understanding  the  perceptions,  beliefs,  and  values  that  drive  their action, and helping them to plug into alternative, more agile ways of thinking.
- · Fostering reflection and big-picture thinking,  slowing  down  to  move  the  action forward.
- · Demonstrating  and  modeling  consciousness, efficacy, flexibility, and courage.
- · And,  finally,  seeking  or  being  open  to coaching, a practice consistent with world-renowned  classical  musicians  and professional  dancers  as  well  as  professional  athletes in team  and  individual sports.

It seems the critical question is no longer, 'How to manage change?' rather, the current question  asked  by  Heifetz and  Linsky  (2002) is, 'How to lead adaptive change.'

As  educators,  authors,  and  consultants, we  are  actively  exploring  new  possibilities and  developing  ways  of  thinking  about  adult interactions in schools. Our own thinking is influenced by the emerging sciences of quantum mechanics,  complexity  theory,  fractal  geometry, evolutionary biology, and systems thinking as  they  apply  to  social  organizations.  We  are also  influenced  by  constructivist  psychology, as  it  relates  to  learning  and  leadership:  and our  personal  histories  in  a  variety  of  roles in  education-teacher,  curriculum  consultant, staff  developer,  principal,  superintendent,  and professor; and our current work as consultants with  schools  throughout  North  America,  and schools in Australia, Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and India.

## PART II

## COLLABORATION MATTERS

Developing shared expertise and working with common purpose are vividly present in the schools that are beating the odds and making a difference  for  student  learning  internationally and in North America.

How  teachers  talk  affects  how  students learn. Loaded with practical tools, this section of the book underscores how the will to make a  difference  in  the  lives  of  students  is  more important  than  school  structures,  buildings, textbooks,  or  lab  materials.  When  this  will  is collective,  school  teams  can  overcome  many obstacles to student learning.

Drawing  from  essential  research  findings from  the  1980s  to  the  present  and  the  work on  professional  capital  by  Hargreaves  and Fullan  (2012)  we  emphasize  the  increasing importance  of  developing  strong  professional communities in schools.

we  provide  descriptions  of  the  metacognitive skills  for  being  an  effective  group  member, which cannot be found in other literature as far as we can discern. This role, in our experience, is more crucial to group success than having a skilled facilitator. Here we distinguish the role of the group leader from that of the facilitator. The group leader is the person with knowledge and/or  role  authority  and  in  many  situations should not be facilitating the meeting or work session.  Finally,  we  offer  a  simple  model  for helping participants be clear about their intentions  during  group  conversations.  These Two Ways  of  Talking give  focus  and  structure  to conversations  that  flow  from  dialogue  to  discussion to decisions that stay made.

Part  II  makes  the  case  that  the  Adaptive Schools' models and tools serve two major underpinnings of professional capital: developing human  capital  and  enhancing  social  capital. In  this  section,  we  introduce  ways  to  develop seven norms for collaborative work as expected patterns  of  behavior  in  all  school  communications:  in  groups,  in  hallway  conversations, with  students,  and  with  parents.  Importantly,
