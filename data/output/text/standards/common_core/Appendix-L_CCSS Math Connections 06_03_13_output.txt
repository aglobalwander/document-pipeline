APPENDIX L – Connections to the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics1

Consistency with the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM)

Science is a quantitative discipline, so it is important for educators to ensure that students’
science learning coheres well with their learning in mathematics.2,3 To achieve this alignment,
the NGSS development team worked with the CCSSM writing team to ensure the NGSS do not
outpace or otherwise misalign to the grade-by-grade standards in the CCSSM. Every effort has
been made to ensure consistency.  It is essential that the NGSS always be interpreted, and
implemented, in such a way that the math does not outpace or misalign to the grade-by-grade
standards in the CCSSM (this includes the development of NGSS-aligned instructional materials and assessments).

For convenience, Table 1 shows CCSSM grade placements for key topics relevant to science.
This table can help science educators ensure that students’ work in science does not require them
to meet the indicated CCSSM standards before the grade level in which they appear in CCSSM.

During the middle school and high school years, students develop a number of powerful
quantitative tools, from rates and proportional relationships, to basic algebra and functions, to
basic statistics and probability. Such tools are applicable far beyond the mathematics classroom.
Such tools can also be better understood, and more securely mastered, by applying them in a
variety of contexts. Fortunately, the NRC Framework makes clear in its Science and Engineering
Practices (Analyzing and Interpreting Data, Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking)
that statistics and mathematics have a prominent role in science. NGSS aims to give middle
school and high school science educators a clear road map for how they can prepare their
students for the quantitative demands of college and careers, where students need to apply
quantitative tools in an applied or scientific context.4 For all these reasons, NGSS requires key
tools from Grades 6−8 and High School Common Core to be integrated into middle school and
high school science instructional materials and assessments.

For additional detail, see Table 2 below, as well as the NGSS Condensed Practices (Appendix F),
and the Common Core State Standards Connections boxes that appear throughout the NGSS.

Using Mathematics and Computational
Thinking
Apply concepts of ratio, rate, percent, basic operations, and simple algebra to scientific and engineering questions and problems. (See 6-7.RP, 6-8.NS, and 6 8.EE in the Common Core State
Standards.)
Apply techniques of algebra and functions to represent and solve scientific and engineering problems. (See A and F in the Common Core State Standards.)

Apply key takeaways from grades 6–8 mathematics, such as applying ratios, rates, percentages and unit conversions, e.g., in the context of complicated measurement problems involving quantities with derived or compound units (such as mg/mL, kg/m3, acre-feet, etc.).5

Connections to CCSSM Standards for Mathematical Practice

Some general connections to the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics can be found
among CCSSM’s Standards for Mathematical Practice. The three CCSSM practice standards most directly relevant to science are:

MP.2. Reason abstractly and quantitatively.

MP.4. Model with mathematics.

MP.5. Use appropriate tools strategically.

Mathematical practice standards MP.2 and MP.4 are both about using mathematics in context.
The first of these, MP.2, is about the back-and-forth between (1) manipulating symbols
abstractly and (2) attending to the meaning of those symbols while doing so. For example, a
kindergarten student might connect a symbolic statement like “6 > 4” to the fact that there are
more objects in one given set than in another. A middle school student might rewrite the
equation d = 65t for the motion of a car in the equivalent form d/t = 65, recognizing that the new
equation abstractly expresses the steps in a computation of the car’s speed. A high school student
might connect the 2 in the equation N = 2n to the fact that each dividing cell gives rise to 2 daughter cells.

The second standard, MP.4, is also about applying mathematics, but with more of a focus on
results, and less of a focus on the mental processes involved:

 In grades K–2, modeling with mathematics typically means diagramming a situation
mathematically, and/or solving a one-step addition/subtraction word problem.
 In grades 3–5, modeling with mathematics typically means representing and/or solving a one-step or multi-step word problem.

5 See Table 1 of the High School Publishers’ Criteria for the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics
(rightmost column), available on www.corestandards.org/resources.

=== Page 4 ===

May 2013
NGSS Release
Page 4 of 37
 In grades 6–8, modeling with mathematics typically means representing and/or solving a
one-step or multi-step word problem, possibly one in which certain assumptions
necessary to formulate the problem mathematically are not specified for the student.
 In high school, modeling with mathematics typically includes the kinds of problems seen
in grades 6–8 as well as ‘full models’—that is, problems that include more of the steps of the modeling cycle (see pp. 72, 73 of CCSSM).

Finally, the third standard, MP.5, refers not only to technological tools, but also to such strategies
as drawing diagrams from kindergarten onwards and, in later grades, using well known formulas
and powerful representation schemes like the coordinate plane. These tools, and the skill and
judgment to use them well, are important for quantitative work in science.

About CCSSM practice standard MP.3: None of the connections boxes include a link to CCSSM
practice standard MP.3, which reads, “Make viable arguments and critique the reasoning of
others.” The lack of a connection to MP.3 might appear surprising, given that science too
involves making arguments and critiquing them. However, there is a difference between
mathematical arguments and scientific arguments—a difference so fundamental that it would be
misleading to connect to MP.3 here. The difference is that scientific arguments are always based
on evidence, whereas mathematical arguments never are. It is this difference that renders the
findings of science provisional and the findings of mathematics eternal. As Isaac Asimov wrote,6
“Ptolemy may have developed an erroneous picture of the planetary system, but the system of
trigonometry he worked out to help him with his calculations remains correct forever.” Blurring
the distinction between mathematical and scientific arguments leads to a misunderstanding of
what science is about. For more information about argumentation in science, see the NGSS
Science and Engineering Practice of “Engaging in argument from evidence.”

For more information on the Standards for Mathematical Practice in general, see CCSSM, pp. 6–
8. Also see pp. 72–73 for additional information on modeling in particular.

The remainder of this Appendix collects together the remaining connections from the
Connections Boxes. Illustrative science examples are provided for a number of the connections, along with Alignment Notes in selected cases.

K-PS2 Motion and Stability: Forces and Interactions

As part of this work, teachers should give students opportunities to use direct measurement:

K.MD.A.1. Describe measurable attributes of objects, such as length or weight. Describe several measurable attributes of a single object.

6 Boyer and Merzbach, A History of Mathematics, Second Edition (New York: Wiley and Sons), 1991, pp. vii, viii.

=== Page 5 ===

NGSS Release
Page 5 of 37

K.MD.A.2. Directly compare two objects with a measurable attribute in common, to see
which object has “more of” / “less of” the attribute, and describe the difference. For example,
directly compare the heights of two children and describe one child as taller/shorter.

Science examples: Students make a simple pulley that uses one object to lift a second object. They
describe one of the objects as heavier than the other. They try to predict which will rise and which will
fall.  In consecutive trials that vary the weight of the first object (keeping the second object the same),
students conclude that a heavier object will lift a given target object faster.

Alignment notes: (1) Data displays such as picture graphs and bar graphs are not expected until
Grade 2. (2) Standard length units such as centimeters or inches are not expected until Grade 2.
Informal units (for example, a paperclip used as a length unit) are not expected until Grade 1.

K-PS3 Energy

As part of this work, teachers should give students opportunities to use direct measurement:

K.MD.A.2. Directly compare two objects with a measurable attribute in common, to see
which object has “more of”/”less of” the attribute, and describe the difference. For example,
directly compare the heights of two children and describe one child as taller/shorter. Science
example: Directly compare a stone left in the sun with a stone left in the shade and describe one of the stones as warmer/cooler than the other.

K-LS1 From Molecules to Organisms: Structures and Processes

As part of this work, teachers should give students opportunities to use direct measurement:

K.MD.A.2. Directly compare two objects with a measurable attribute in common, to see
which object has “more of”/”less of” the attribute, and describe the difference. For example,
directly compare the heights of two children and describe one child as taller/shorter. Science
example: Directly compare a sunflower grown in the shade with a sunflower grown in sun. Which flower
is taller? Observe that these plants need light to thrive.

Alignment notes: (1) Data displays such as picture graphs and bar graphs are not expected until
Grade 2. (2) Standard length units such as centimeters or inches are not expected until Grade 2.

K-ESS2 Earth’s Systems

As part of this work, teachers should give students opportunities to use numbers, counting, direct measurement, and classification:

K.CC.A.7 Know number names and the count sequence. Science example: Students write the
number of sunny or rainy days in the previous month.

K.MD.A.1. Describe measurable attributes of objects, such as length or weight. Describe
several measurable attributes of a single object. Science example: Describe a beaker of water as being heavy and cold.

K.MD.B.3. Classify objects into given categories; count the number of objects in each
category and sort the categories by count. Science example: Build up a tally chart showing the
number of rainy or sunny days as the month progresses. Count the number of sunny or rainy days in the
previous month (see K.CC.B). Were there more rainy days or sunny days (see K.CC.C)?

Alignment notes: (1) Data displays such as picture graphs and bar graphs are not expected until
Grade 2. (2) Standard length units such as centimeters or inches are not expected until Grade 2.

K-ESS3 Earth and Human Activity

As part of this work, teachers should give students opportunities to count and compare
numbers (see K.CC). Science examples: (1) Count the number of trees in each of two photographs; in
which photograph are there more trees? In which place might you find more squirrels? (2) Keep a tally of the
number of severe weather days (forecast and actual). Count the number of severe weather days at the end of the year.

1-PS4 Waves and their Applications in Technologies for Information Transfer

As part of this work, teachers should give students opportunities to measure with non-standard
units:

1.MD.A.1. Order three objects by length; compare the lengths of two objects indirectly by
using a third object. Science example: The class makes string phones. Maria’s string is longer than
Sue’s…Sue’s string is longer than Tia’s…so without measuring directly we know that Maria’s string is longer than Tia’s.

1.MD.A.2. Express the length of an object as a whole number of length units, by layering
multiple copies of a shorter object (the length unit) end to end; understand that the length
measurement of an object is the number of same-size length units that span it with no gaps or
overlaps. Limit to contexts where the object being measured is spanned by a whole number of
length units with no gaps or overlaps. Science example: Using a shoe as the length unit, the string for Sue’s string phone is 11 units long.

Alignment notes: Standard length units such as centimeters or inches are not expected until
Grade 2.

1-LS1 From Molecules to Organisms: Structures and Processes

As part of this work, teachers should give students opportunities to work with two-digit
numbers:

1.NBT.B.3. Compare two two-digit numbers based on the meanings of the tens and one
digits, recording the results of comparisons with the symbols , , and .

1.NBT.C.4. Add within 100, including adding a two-digit number and a one-digit number,
and adding a two-digit number and a multiple of 10, using concrete models or drawings and
strategies based on place value, properties of operations, and/or the relationship between
addition and subtraction; relate the strategy to a written method and explain the reasoning
uses. Understand that in adding two-digit numbers, one adds tens and tens, ones and ones;
and sometimes it is necessary to compose a ten.

1.NBT.C.5. Given a two-digit number, mentally find 10 more or 10 less than the number,
without having to count; explain the reasoning used.

1.NBT.C.6. Subtract multiples of 10 in the range 10-90 from multiples of 10 in the range 10 90 (positive or zero differences), using concrete models or drawings and strategies based on
place value, properties of operations, and/or the relationship between addition and
subtraction; relate the strategy to a written method and explain the reasoning used.

Science examples: (1) A mother wolf spider is carrying
40 baby spiders on her back. There were 50 eggs in the
egg sac. How many of the hatchlings is the spider not
caring for? (2) During the breeding season, a female
cottontail rabbit has litters of 5, 6, 5, and 4 bunnies. How
many bunnies did the rabbit have during this time?

1-LS3 Heredity: Inheritance and Variation of Traits

As part of this work, teachers should give students opportunities to measure with non-standard units and use indirect measurement:

1.MD.A.1. Order three objects by length; compare the lengths of two objects indirectly by
using a third object. Science example: Every sunflower is taller than the ruler…every daisy is shorter
than the ruler…so without measuring directly we know that every sunflower is taller than every daisy.
The sunflowers and daisies are not exactly like the plants from which they grew, but they resemble the
plants from which they grew in being generally tall or generally short.

Alignment note: Standard length units such as centimeters or inches are not expected until grade 2.

1-ESS1 Earth’s Place in the Universe

As part of this work, teachers should give students opportunities to practice addition and subtraction and represent and interpret data:

1.OA.A.1. Use addition and subtraction within 20 to solve word problems involving
situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with
unknowns in all positions, e.g., by using objects, drawings, and equations to represent the
problem. Science example: There were 16 hours of daylight yesterday. On December 21, there were only
8 hours of daylight. How many more hours of daylight were there yesterday?

1.MD.C.4. Organize, represent, and interpret data with up to three categories; ask and answer
questions about the total number of data points, how many in each category, and how many
more or less are in one category than in another. Science example: Based on the data we have
collected so far on the bulletin board, which day has been the longest of the year so far? Which day has been the shortest of the year so far?

2-ESS1 Earth’s Place in the Universe

As part of this work, teachers should give students opportunities to work with numbers to 1000:

2.NBT.A.11 Understand place value. Science example: As part of comprehending media to identify
the varying timescales on which Earth events can occur, students understand that a period of thousands
of years is much longer than a period of hundreds of years, which is in turn much longer than a period of tens of years.

Alignment note: Rounding is not expected until grade 3.

2-ESS2 Earth’s Systems

As part of this work, teachers should give students opportunities to work with numbers to 1000,
use standard units for length, and relate addition and subtraction to length:

2.NBT.A.3. Read and write numbers to 1000 using base-ten numerals, number names, and
expanded form. Science example: Students write about a lake that is 550 feet deep, a river that is 687
miles long, a forest that began growing about 200 years ago, and so on.

2.MD.B.5. Use addition and subtraction within 100 to solve word problems involving lengths
that are given in the same units, e.g., by using drawings (such as drawings of rulers) and
equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem. Science example: A
gulley is 17 inches deep before a rainstorm and 42 inches deep after a rainstorm. How much deeper did it get during the rainstorm?

Alignment note: Students in this grade are expected to be fluent in mentally adding and
subtracting within 20, knowing single-digit sums from memory by end of Grade 2; also to be
fluent in adding and subtracting within 100 using strategies based on place value, properties of
operations, and/or the relationship between addition and subtraction.

3-PS2 Motion and Stability: Forces and Interactions

As part of this work, teachers should give students opportunities to work with continuous
quantities:

3.MD.A.2. Measure and estimate liquid volumes and masses of objects using standard units
of grams (g), kilograms (kg), and liters (l).13 Add, subtract, multiply, or divide to solve one step word problems involving masses or volumes that are given in the same units, e.g., by
using drawings (such as a beaker with a measurement scale) to represent the problem.14
Science example: Estimate, then measure, the masses of two objects being used in an investigation of the
effect of forces; observe that the change of motion due to an unbalanced force is larger for the smaller
mass (students need not explain or quantify this observation in terms of Newton’s laws of motion).

3-LS1 From Molecules to Organisms: Structures and Processes

As part of this work, teachers should give students opportunities to be quantitative in giving
descriptions:

3.NF. Number and Operations—Fractions

3.NBT. Number and Operations in Base Ten

Science example: Be quantitative when describing the life cycles of organisms, such as their varying
lifespans (e.g., ranging from a fraction of a year up to thousands of years) and their varying reproduction
(e.g., ranging from a handful of offspring to thousands).

3-LS2 Ecosystems: Interactions, Energy, and Dynamics

As part of this work, teachers should give students opportunities to be quantitative in giving
descriptions:

12 See CCSSM, Glossary, Table 1.

group behaviors of animals (e.g., describe groups ranging in size from a handful up to thousands of animals).

3-LS3 Heredity: Inheritance and Variation of Traits

As part of this work, teachers should give students opportunities to represent and interpret
data:

3.MD.B.4. Generate measurement data by measuring lengths using rulers marked with halves
and fourths of an inch. Show the data by making a line plot, where the horizontal scale is
marked off in appropriate units—whole numbers, halves, or quarters. Science examples: (1)
Make a line plot to show the height of each of a number of plants grown from a single parent. Observe
that not all of the offspring are the same size. Compare the sizes of the offspring to the size of the parent.
(2) Make a similar plot for plants grown with insufficient water.

3-LS4 Biological Evolution: Unity and Diversity

As part of this work, teachers should give students opportunities to represent and interpret
data:

3.MD.B.3. Draw a scaled picture graph and a scaled bar graph to represent a data set with
several categories. Solve one- and two-step “how many more” and “how many less”
problems using information presented in scaled bar graphs. For example, draw a bar graph
in which each square in the bar graph might represent 5 pets. Science examples: (1) Given a bar
graph showing the number of flower species that were found in several different habitats, determine how
many more flower species were found in grassy meadow than were found in dense forest. Would flower
species be affected if a forest were to spread into its habitat? (2) Make a scaled bar graph to show the
number of surviving individuals with and without an advantageous trait. How many more of the individuals with the advantageous trait survived?

3.MD.B.4. Generate measurement data by measuring lengths using rulers marked with halves
and fourths of an inch. Show the data by making a line plot, where the horizontal scale is
marked off in appropriate units—whole numbers, halves, or quarters. Science example: Make a
line plot to show the length of each fossil that is visible in a piece of shale. Do any of the fossils resemble modern organisms except for their size?

using drawings (such as a beaker with a measurement scale) to represent the problem.16
Science examples: (1) Estimate the mass of a large hailstone that damaged a car on a used-car lot. (2)
Measure the volume of water in liters collected during a rainstorm.

3.MD.B.3. Draw a scaled picture graph and a scaled bar graph to represent a data set with
several categories. Solve one- and two-step “how many more” and “how many less”
problems using information presented in bar graphs. Science example: Make a picture graph or
bar graph to show the number of days with high temperature below freezing in December, January,
February, and March. How many days were below freezing this winter?

Alignment notes: (1) Students are not expected to understand statistical ideas such as average,
mean, median, etc., until Grade 6. (2) Graphing in the coordinate plane is not expected until
Grade 5.

3-ESS3 Earth and Human Activity

As part of this work, teachers should give students opportunities to work with continuous quantities including area:

3.MD.A.2. Measure and estimate liquid volumes and masses of objects using standard units
of grams (g), kilograms (kg), and liters (l).17 Add, subtract, multiply, or divide to solve one step word problems involving masses or volumes that are given in the same units, e.g., by
using drawings (such as a beaker with a measurement scale) to represent the problem.18

3.MD.C.5. Recognize area as an attribute of plane figures and understand concepts of area measurement.

a. A square with side length 1 unit, called “a unit square,” is said to have “one square

unit” of area, and can be used to measure area.

b. A plane figure which can be covered without gaps or overlaps by n unit squares is said

to have an area of n square units.

3.MD.C.6. Measure areas by counting unit squares (square cm, square m, square in, square ft, and improvised units).

As part of this work, teachers should give students opportunities to use the four operations with whole numbers to solve problems:

4.OA.A.3. Solve multistep word problems posed with whole numbers and having whole number answers using the four operations, including problems in which remainders must be
interpreted. Represent these problems using equations with a letter standing for the unknown
quantity. Assess the reasonableness of answers using mental computation and estimation
strategies including rounding. Science example: The class has 144 rubber bands with which to make
rubber-band cars. If each car uses six rubber bands, how many cars can be made? If there are 28
students, at most how many rubber bands can each car have (if every car has the same number of rubber bands)?

Alignment notes: Grade 4 students are expected to fluently add and subtract multi-digit whole
numbers; multiply a number of up to four digits by a one-digit whole number; multiply two two digit numbers; and find whole-number quotients and remainders with up to four-digit dividends and one-digit divisors.

thereof contribute to the function? (For example, bilateral symmetry is a signal of reproductive fitness in
many animals; the asymmetry in an owl’s face helps it pinpoint the location of prey.)

length of a 4 ft snake as 48 in. Generate a conversion table for feet and inches listing the
number pairs (1, 12), (2, 24), (3, 36). Science example: A limestone layer with many marine fossils is
visible in the Grand Canyon. One reference book lists this layer as being 300 feet thick. Another
reference book lists this layer as being 100 yards thick. Are the two references consistent?

Alignment note: Expressing measurements in a smaller unit in terms of a larger unit within the

the ocean is 1600 meters deep while another map shows the same point as being 1.5 kilometers deep. Are the two maps consistent?

4.MD.A.2. Use the four operations to solve word problems involving distances, intervals of
time, liquid volumes, masses of objects, and money, including problems involving simple
fractions or decimals, and problems that require expressing measurements given in a larger

5-PS1 Matter and Its Interactions

As part of this work, teachers should give students opportunities to relate very large and very
small quantities to place value and division, convert measurement units, and work with
volume:

5.NBT.A.1. Explain patterns in the number of zeros of the product when multiplying a
number by powers of 10, and explain patterns in the placement of the decimal point when a
decimal is multiplied or divided by a power of 10. Use whole-number exponents to denote powers of 10.

5.NF.B.7. Apply and extend previous understandings of division to divide unit fractions by
whole numbers and whole numbers by unit fractions.19

a. Interpret division of a unit fraction by a non-zero whole number, and compute such
quotients. For example, create a story context for (1/3) ÷ 4, and use a visual fraction model
to show the quotient. Use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that (1/3) ÷ 4 = 1/12 because (1/12) × 4 = 13.

b. Interpret division of a whole number by a unit fraction, and compute such quotients.
For example, create a story context for 4 ÷ (1/5), and use a visual fraction model to show the
quotient. Use the relationship between multiplication and division to explain that 4 ÷ (1/5) = 20 because 20 × (1/5) = 4.

c. Solve real world problems involving division of unit fractions by non-zero whole
numbers and division of whole numbers by unit fractions, e.g., by using visual fraction
models and equations to represent the problem. For example, how much chocolate will each
person get if 3 people share ½ lb of chocolate equally? How many 1/3-cup servings are in 2 cups of raisins?

Science examples: (1) If you split a salt grain with weight 1 mg into 10 equal parts, find the weight of each
part. (Answer in mg.) If you next divide each of the parts into 10 equal parts, find the weight of one of the
new parts. (Answer in mg.) How many parts are there in the end? (2) Suppose a salt grain with weight 1
mg is split into 10 equal parts, and each of those parts is split into 10 equal parts, and so on, until there

are 108 parts. What is the weight of one of these tiny parts? Write the number of these tiny parts as a whole number without using exponents.

5.MD.A.1. Convert among different-sized standard measurement units within a given
measurement system (e.g., convert 5 cm to 0.05 m), and use these conversions in solving
multi-step, real-world problems. Science example: When 100 g of sugar is dissolved in 0.5 kg of
water, what is the total weight of the system? Answer in grams, then answer again in kilograms. After the
water evaporates, see how much the sugar residue weighs.

5.MD.C.3. Recognize volume as an attribute of solid figures and understand concepts of volume measurement.
a. A cube with side length 1 unit, called a “unit cube,” is said to have “one cubic unit” of

volume, and can be used to measure volume.
b. A solid figure, which can be packed without gaps or overlaps using n unit cubes, is

said to have a volume of n cubic units.

5.MD.C.4. Measure volumes by counting unit cubes, using cubic cm, cubic in, cubic ft, and improvised units.

Science example: Compress the air in a cylinder to half its volume. (Draw a picture of the volume before
and after, and explain how you know that the new volume is half of the old volume.) Can you compress
the volume by half again? Why is it difficult to do?

5.MD.A.1. Convert among different-sized standard measurement units within a given
measurement system (e.g., convert 5 cm to 0.05 m), and use these conversions in solving
multi-step, real world problems. Science example: In an experiment to rule out soil as a source of
plant food, Sue weighed the soil using units of grams but Katya weighed the plant using units of
kilograms. The soil lost 4 grams, while the plant gained 0.1 kilograms. Did the plant gain much more
than the soil lost? Much less? About the same? (A good way to begin is to express both figures in grams.)

decimal is multiplied or divided by a power of 10. Use whole-number exponents to denote
powers of 10. Science example: The sun is about 1011 meters from Earth. Sirius, another star, is about
1017 meters from Earth. Write these two numbers without exponents; position the numbers one directly
below the other, aligning on the 1. How many times farther away from Earth is Sirius compared to the sun?

5.G.A.2. Represent real world and mathematical problems by graphing points in the first

the day over the course of the year. What pattern is observed when the data are graphed on a coordinate
plane, and how can a model of the sun and Earth explain the pattern? (2) Students are given (x, y)
coordinates for the Earth at six equally spaced times during its orbit around the sun (with the sun at the

example, if the temperature dropped from 24oC to 11oC, then the temperature change was
−13oC. (2) Solve word problems relating to changes in signed physical quantities. For

computation and estimation strategies. For example: If a woman making $25 an hour gets a
10% raise, she will make an additional 1/10 of her salary an hour, or $2.50, for a new salary
of $27.50. If you want to place a towel bar 9 ¾ inches long in the center of a door that is 27
½ inches wide, you will need to place the bar about 9 inches from each edge; this estimate
can be used as a check on the exact computation. Science example: Work with tolerances, cost

conclude that the force on an object in a gravitational field is proportional to its mass, by viewing
the formula F = Gmsourcemobject/r2 as F = (Gmsource/r2) (mobject) and recognizing the same algebraic structure as in y = kx.

mv) in order to highlight a quantity of interest. (2) Write and solve a linear equation to solve a problem involving motion at a constant speed.

examples: (1) Informally fit a quadratic function to the position-time data for a cart that rolls up
an incline (slowing as it climbs, then reversing direction and speeding up as it descends). Use the
algebraic expression for the fitted function to determine the magnitude of the cart’s acceleration
and initial speed. Over several trials, graph various quantities (such as acceleration vs. angle, or
peak displacement vs. initial speed squared), and interpret the results. (2) Calculate and interpret
the average speed of a moving object by using data from a distance-time graph.

than it falls between t = 0s and t = 1s). (2) For an object moving at constant speed, compute the
speed by choosing a point from its distance-time graph.
