## 5. It Promotes Self-Coaching

The planning conversation may ultimately be the most important, as it

relates to a long-range goal of teacher automaticity in instructional thought. The planning map represents a way of thinking about all instruction-in fact, all goal-directed activities. After experiencing a number of planning conversations, teachers adopt this way of thinking about most lessons. They internalize the conversation questions, automatically asking themselves, 'What are my objectives?' 'What are my plans?' 'How will I know students are learning?' They are activating the first step in self-coaching.

Bob discovered this to be true in an evaluation of a Professor's Peer Coaching program at California State University, Sacramento, California (Garmston and Hyerle 1988). Previously, a number of professors lectured until the bell rung, then picked up where they left off for the lecture in the next class period. After several sessions with a Cognitive Coach in which they deliberately identified goals, teaching strategies, and success indicators for their lessons, they reported increases in mental activity, improvements in student learning, and increased satisfaction in teaching.

We have discovered that, as the coach probes and clarifies in an attempt to better understand the teacher's plan, the teacher also becomes clearer about the lesson. The coach engages the teacher in a process of mental rehearsal similar to what athletes do before competition.
