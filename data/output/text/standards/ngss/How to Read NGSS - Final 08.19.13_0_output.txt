How to Read the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)

The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) are distinct from prior science standards in three essential ways.
1) Performance.  Prior standards documents listed what students should “know” or “understand.” These
ideas needed to be translated into performances that could be assessed to determine whether or not
students met the standard. Different interpretations sometimes resulted in assessments that were not
aligned with curriculum and instruction.  The NGSS has avoided this difficulty by developing
performance expectations that state what students should be able to do in order to demonstrate that they
have met the standard, thus providing the same clear and specific targets for curriculum, instruction, and assessment.
2) Foundations.  Each performance expectation incorporates all three dimensions from the Framework—
a science or engineering practice, a core disciplinary idea, and a crosscutting concept.
3) Coherence. Each set of performance expectations lists connections to other ideas within the disciplines
of science and engineering, and with Common Core State Standards in Mathematics and English
Language Arts.
This chapter describes how these three unique characteristics are embodied in the format of the standards, beginning with the “system architecture.”

Performance Expectations
Performance expectations are the assessable statements of what students should know and be able to do.
Some states consider these performance expectations alone to be “the standards,” while other states also
include the content of the three foundation boxes and connections to be included in “the standard.” The
writing team is neutral on that issue. The essential point is that all students should be held accountable for
demonstrating their achievement of all PEs, which are written to allow for multiple means of assessment.
The last sentence in the above paragraph—that all students should be held accountable for demonstrating
their achievement of all performance expectations—deserves special attention because it is a fundamental
departure from prior standards documents, especially at the high school level where it has become
customary for students to take courses in some but not all science disciplines. The NGSS takes the
System Architecture
As shown in the illustration at right, each set of
performance expectations has a title. Below the title is a
box containing the performance expectations. Below that
are three foundation boxes, which list (from left to right) the specific science and engineering practices,
disciplinary core ideas (DCIs), and crosscutting concepts that were combined to produce the performance
expectations (PEs) above.  The bottom section lists
connections to other related DCIs at the same grade level,
to related DCIs for younger and older students, and to related Common State Standards in mathematics and
language arts.  These sections are described in further detail below.

position that a scientifically literate person understands and is able to apply core ideas in each of the
major science disciplines, and that they gain experience in the practices of science and engineering and
crosscutting concepts. In order for this to be feasible the writing team has limited the core ideas included
in the performance expectations to just those listed in the Framework.
The NGSS writers initially attempted to include all of the disciplinary core ideas (DCIs) verbatim from
the Framework in the performance expectations, but found that the resulting statements were bulky and
reduced readers’ comprehension of the standards.  Instead, the performance expectations were written to
communicate a “big idea” that combined content from the three foundation boxes.  In the final phase of
development we further limited the number of performance expectations with input from our state teams,
to ensure that this set of PEs is achievable at some reasonable level of proficiency by the vast majority of students.
Some states have standards that include concepts that are not found in the NGSS.  However, in most cases
not all students in those states are expected to take courses in all three areas of science and engineering.
The NGSS are for all students, and all students are expected to achieve proficiency with respect to all of the performance expectations in the NGSS.

A second essential point is that the NGSS performance expectations should not limit the
curriculum.  Students interested in pursuing science further (through Advanced Placement or other
advanced courses) should have the opportunity to do so. The NGSS performance expectations provide a
foundation for rigorous advanced courses in science or engineering that some students may choose to take.
A third point is that the performance expectations are not a set of instructional or assessment tasks. They
are statements of what students should be able to do after instruction. Decisions on how best to help
students meet these PEs are left to states, districts, and teachers.
In the example below, notice how the performance expectation combines the skills and ideas that students
need to learn, while it suggests ways of assessing whether or not second graders have the capabilities and
understandings specified in the three foundation boxes.

As shown in the example, most of the performance expectations are followed by one or two additional
statements in smaller type. These include clarification statements, which supply examples or additional
clarification to the performance expectations; and assessment boundary statements, which specify the limits to large scale assessment.
Notice that one of the DCIs was “moved from K-2.”  That means the writing team decided that a DCI that
the Framework specified for end of second grade could be more easily assessed if combined with the
other ideas specified for third grade. This was only done in a limited number of cases.
Also, notice that the code for this performance expectation (2-PS1-2) is indicated in each of the three
foundation boxes to illustrate the specific practices, disciplinary core ideas, and crosscutting concepts on
which it is built. Since most of the standards have several PEs, the codes make it easy to see how the
information in the foundation boxes is used to construct each performance expectation.
The codes for the performance expectations were derived from the Framework. As with the titles, the first
digit indicates a grade K-5, or specifies MS (middle school) or HS (high school).  The next alpha-numeric
code specifies the discipline, core idea and sub-idea.  All of these codes are shown in the table below,
derived from the Framework.  Finally, the number at the end of each code indicates the order in which
that statement appeared as a DCI in the Framework.

Foundation Boxes
While the performance expectations can stand alone, a more coherent and complete view of what students
should be able to do comes when the performance expectations are viewed in tandem with the contents of
the foundation boxes that lie just below the performance expectations. These three boxes include the
practices, core disciplinary ideas, and crosscutting concepts, derived from the Framework, that were used
to construct this set of performance expectations.
Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs). The orange box in the middle includes statements that are taken from
the Framework about the most essential ideas in the major science disciplines that all students should
understand during 13 years of school. Including these detailed statements was very helpful to the NGSS
writing team as they analyzed and “unpacked” the disciplinary core ideas and sub-ideas to reach a level
that is helpful in describing what each student should understand about each sub-idea at the end of grades
2, 5, 8, and 12. Although they appear in paragraph form in the Framework, here they are bulleted to be certain that each statement is distinct.
Science and Engineering Practices. The blue box on the left includes just the science and engineering
practices used to construct the performance expectations in the box above.  These statements are derived
from and grouped by the eight categories detailed in the Framework to further explain the science and
engineering practices important to emphasize in each grade band. Most sets of performance expectations
emphasize only a few of the practice categories; however, all practices are emphasized within a grade
band.  Teachers should be encouraged to utilize several practices in any instruction, and need not be
limited by the performance expectation, which is only intended to guide assessment.
Crosscutting Concepts. The green box on the right includes statements derived from the Framework’s
list of crosscutting concepts, which apply to one or more of the performance expectations in the box
above.  Most sets of PEs limit the number of crosscutting concepts so as focus on those that are readily
apparent when considering the DCIs. However all are emphasized within a grade band.  Again, the list is
not exhaustive nor is it intended to limit instruction.  Aspects of the Nature of Science relevant to the
standard are also listed in this box, as are the interdependence of science and engineering, and the
influence of engineering, technology, and science on society and the natural world. Although these are not
crosscutting concepts in the same sense as the others, they are best taught and assessed in the context of
specific science ideas, so they are also listed in this box.
Connection Boxes
Three Connection Boxes, below the Foundation Boxes, are designed to support a coherent vision of the
standards by showing how the performance expectations in each standard connect to other PEs in science,
as well as to common core state standards.  The three boxes include:
Connections to other DCIs in this grade level. This box contains the names of DCIs that have related
disciplinary core ideas at the same grade level. For example, both Physical Science and Life Science
performance expectations contain core ideas related to Photosynthesis, and could be taught in relation to
one another.  Ideas within the same main DCI as the performance expectation (e.g., PS1.C for HS-PS1-1)
are not included in the connection box, nor are ideas within the same topic arrangement as a performance expectation (e.g., HS.ESS2.B for HS-ESS1-6).
Articulation of DCIs across grade levels. This box contains the names of DCIs that either 1) provide a
foundation for student understanding of the core ideas in this performance expectation (usually at prior
grade levels) or 2) build on the foundation provided by the core ideas in this performance expectations (usually at subsequent grade levels).

Connections to the Common Core State Standards. This box contains the coding and names of pre requisite or connected Common Core State Standards in English Language Arts & and Literacy and
Mathematics that align to the performance expectations. For example, performance expectations that
require student use of exponential notation will align to the corresponding CCSS mathematics standards.
An effort has been made to ensure that the mathematical skills that students need for science were taught
in a previous year where possible.  Italicized performance expectation names indicate that the common
core standard is not pre-requisite knowledge, but could be connected to that performance expectation.

Color Coding
Online versions of the standards display color coding of the words within each performance
expectation that represent the three dimensions: blue for Science and Engineering Practices, orange
for Disciplinary Core Ideas, and green for Crosscutting Concepts. Clarification Statements and
Assessment Boundaries are in red.  Because some of the words used in the performance expectation
represented both a crosscutting concept and the disciplinary core idea it was not possible to color code both simultaneously.

Printed and PDF versions of the standards do not have color coding of the three dimensions. In these
cases the connections between individual performance expectations and the statements in the
foundation boxes will be shown by including the relevant codes after each statement in the foundation boxes.

Title.  The organization of the NGSS is based on the core ideas in the major fields of natural science from
A Framework for K-12 Science Education (NRC 2012), plus one set of PEs for engineering. For the
elementary level, from Kindergarten to grade five, sets of performance expectations are assigned to
specific grades.  A numeral at the start of a title indicates the grade level; so the title in the example above
is a third grade standard.  Titles for middle school (grades 6-8) standards begin with “MS” and those for
high school standards (grades 9-12) begin with “HS.”
The titles also reveal the organization of the standards, which is based on the core ideas in the disciplines
from the Framework.  The Framework lists 11 core ideas, four in life science, four in physical science,
and three in Earth and Space Science.  The core ideas are divided into a total of 39 sub-ideas, and each
sub-idea is elaborated in a list of what students should understand about that sub-idea at the end of grades
2, 5, 8, and 12. We have called these grade-specific statements Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs).
At the beginning of the process, the writers examined all of the DCIs in the Framework to eliminate
redundant statements, find natural connections among DCIs, and develop PEs that were appropriate for
the different grade levels.  The result was a topical clustering of DCIs that usually, but did not always
correspond to the core ideas identified in the Framework.  This structure provided the original basis of the
standards and has continued through the process. Below is a list of all clusters of PEs. The list does not
indicate any particular order within each grade level or band, so the following list should not be
considered a scope and sequence document for the purpose of curriculum planning and development.
