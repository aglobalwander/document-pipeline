## CONCLUSION

In personal correspondence from Bill Powell, former director of the American School of Tanganyika in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, he stated the following:

We interviewed internal candidates for the High School VicePrincipal's position. During the course of the interviews, I asked each of them what was the most important learning experience of their lives. Without hesitation, one candidate responded, 'Cognitive Coaching! It changed the way I think about teaching, about learning . . . in fact, it changed the way I think about myself.'

All who wish to continually improve their craft-be they teachers, entrepreneurs, athletes, ballerinas, musicians, auto mechanics, or pottersnever lose the need to be coached. Cognitive Coaching is a model of interaction that helps others take action toward goals that are important to them while simultaneously developing their capacities for selfdirectedness.

Cognitive Coaching is rooted in dispositions, beliefs, and values that honor the human drive for continuous learning and the spirit of collaboration. Cognitive Coaching is not giving advice or solving other people's problems, as with the boy and the butterfly chrysalis. Cognitive Coaching is a nonjudgmental process of mediation applied to those human life encounters, events, and circumstances that can be seized as opportunities to enhance one's own and another's resourcefulness.
