## Closure

Humans have a natural need for closure: to understand the end of a story, to be satisfied that we know how it turns out, to put an end to a dilemma. Two internal questions regarding closure inform the coach's decisions during problem-solving conversations: What are my intentions? How will I know when my work is finished?

In the problem-resolving conversation, the coach's intention is to help a colleague illuminate and accept tensions, clarify goals, and locate the internal resources needed to meet whatever challenge the coachee is addressing. This is different from helping the colleague to identify a solution and devise a plan. The latter is a legitimate consulting goal, but most often it is attainable only when the teacher already has the confidence and emotional resources for that level of thinking. Thus, in the problemresolving conversation, the coach sets aside his or her own natural interest in knowing 'the end of the story' or what specific action the teacher will take. Instead, the coach looks for the involuntary nonverbal cues that signify the colleague has accessed the necessary resources to proceed. Internal resources may include knowledge, skills, and states of mind.
