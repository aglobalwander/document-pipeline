## Self-Actualization

Those who believe in self-actualization regard the ideal school as child centered. They believe the teacher's role is to liberate each human's inherent capacities for learning. They believe that the purpose of teaching is to bring out the unique qualities, potentials, and creativity in each child. They support multisensory instruction, with many opportunities for auditory, visual, and kinesthetic learning. They value student choice, whether for classroom topics, the nature of assignments, or classroom activities. They value self-directed learning and individualized instruction and support schools of choice and magnet schools so as to better meet the unique interests of each learner.

To provide for students' unique and multiple needs, interests, and developmental tasks, those who believe in self-actualization use learning centers focused around themes. They value student autonomy and look for increases in self-directedness as a central measure of teacher effectiveness. They are drawn to such humanists as Abraham Maslow, Arthur Combs, Carl Rogers, and Sidney Simon, along with George Leonard, Gerald Jampolsky, Deepak Chopra, Parker Palmer, Steven Covey, and Ekhart Tolle.

The self-actualizer's vocabulary includes words referring to the

affective domain and concepts such as the whole child, nurturing, peak experiences, choice, democracy, holism, self-esteem, continuous progress, creativity, empathy, and caring. Their metaphoric model of education is grounded in a vision of children's potentials.
