## 1. Encouraging Self-Directedness

Autonomy empowers the pursuit of connection making among ideas

and concepts. When participants raise issues and frame questions and then analyze and answer them themselves, they take responsibility for their own learning, become problem solvers and problem finders. In the pursuit of new understandings, they are led by their own ideas and informed by the ideas of others.

As such, constructivist environments must be safe, providing freedom to experiment with ideas, explore issues, and encounter new information. When learners anticipate that their thoughts will be judged, their thinking mode shifts from open to closed. Nonjudgmental feedback encourages others to pursue their ideas more deeply and less defensively, and develops the capacity for evaluating the worth of their own and others' ideas. Listening to, paraphrasing, and clarifying ideas indicates that their brains have the power to produce meaning.
