## Appendix A Facilitation  Strategies and  Moves

## Introduction

Readers of this section will find two sets  of protocols for leading groups.  One set we will call "Facilitation Moves"  and they  are labeled as:

The 35  moves are distinguished from strategies in that they are often, once learned, used intuitively to support a group, and usually have not more than two parts in contrast to the several steps necessary in most strategies.

Another  set  we  are  labeling  Facilitation  Strategies  and  includes 125 entries in the following categories:

Clear  intentions,  the  ability  to  read  groups,  and  flexibility  are  keys  to  selecting  processes  to facilitate  groups.  This compilation of  160 protocols  is a resource for varied and flexible approaches to  situations encountered by  groups:  bonding, information processing, marking transitions, giving directions, dialoguing about data, converting negative energy, making decisions, surfacing assump­ tions,  problem  solving,  starting  sessions,  and  much  more.  An  ultimate  goal  for  facilitators  is  to invent  their  own  strategies,  and  familiarity  and  application  of  processes  in  this  collection  should help build this capacity.

## A Word about Moves

Facilitators  make a number of subtle  "moves,"  perhaps not noticeable  unless  one is  looking for them, that increase or deflect group energy, direct attention, affect information flow, promote memory, communicate respect, and create psychological safety.  These are largely nonverbal. We classify them as moves in contrast to a strategy when they  are unplanned, executed spontaneously and  have  no  more  than  one  or  two  parts  to  them.  "Choose  Voice,"  "Visual  Paragraph,"  "Finger Minutes,"  and "Most Important Twenty  Seconds"  are examples  in this appendix.  These, and the majority  of  nonverbal  ideas  in  this  collection  emanate  from  the  work  of  our  friend  and  mentor Michael Grinder (Grinder, 2007).

## What-Why-How

The fundamental format for offering directions is to use the syntactical pattern of 'What,' 'Why,' 'How.' The 'What' is the name of the strategy, structure, or pattern you are proposing for engaging the group. The 'Why' is the intention or purpose of that choice. The 'How' includes the details and procedures involved in the process. These directions are offered visually whenever possible.

The 'Why' is the most essential element for enlisting group member respect for the process and commitment to following the assigned pattern with integrity. 'Why' statements offer principles of practice such as: 'This strategy presents opportunities for hearing and considering multiple viewpoints without judgment or comment.' Or, 'This paired interaction allows partners to engage with the text and each other's perspectives in a time-efficient manner.'

Notice that this last 'Why' statement also embeds a subtle pacing for those participants who value time efficiency and may not always value their colleagues' contributions. For those participants who enjoy collaborative interactions, the embedded message for them is that the strategy will be time bound so they should respect the protocol and time frames and not get lost in any meandering conversations during the process.

'Why' statements have both immediate and longer-term intentions. The immediate impact is framing the purpose for the task at hand. The longer-term intention is where facilitation overlaps with group development goals. For groups to be ready to engage with increasing cognitive and relational challenges, the skilled facilitator paces both the strategy choice and the 'Why's' at the first meeting, stretching the learning capacities of group members. For novice groups, the 'Why's' will be mostly about the intention of the strategy to help those groups develop basic habits of following directions and working successfully with colleagues. For emerging groups, give the 'Why's' to offer opportunities to stretch collaborative skills so that the group can engage confidently with cognitively and emotionally challenging content.

Finally,  all  highly  evolved  processes  reoccur  in  simpler,  repeating  processes.  It  is  better  to know a few processes well than attempt many poorly.

## Strategies

Strategies provide structures for conversations that might otherwise meander, cost unnecessary time, and are less productive. Effective strategies provide four functions: focus, efficiency, development of social skills, and psychological safety. Participants need a certain sense of safety to risk putting one's ideas on the table, to acknowledge when they do not know, and to participate. Safety is different from comfort. Members should occasionally be uncomfortable in work conversations; if they are not, they are probably not talking about the right issues. Discomfort is the expression of disequilibrium experienced when current knowledge and conceptions give way to new perceptions and solutions. It is a doorway to learning. Yet conversations must be safe enough to learn, contribute, decide, and plan.

To cognitively engage with others, especially in hierarchical groups, requires psychological safety. For some this means an opportunity to talk and not be overridden by others. It means having a sense that one's contributions are recognized. It means being free of losing face, embarrassment, and feelings of inequality. Very importantly, it also means freedom from having to be certain. To speak always with certainty is one of the greatest barriers to deeply understanding situations and generating informed theories of causation and solution. These four attributes and the simple pattern of turn-taking are characteristic of high-performing groups.

## Selecting a Strategy

Two considerations  are  important  in  selecting  strategies.  First  is  the  degree  of  tightness  or looseness.  Facilitators  develop  a  repertoire  of  tight  to  loose  structures. When  hard-to-talk-about topics are on the table, the facilitator tightens the degree of structure to provide greater emotional safety and more focused thought. Cognitive complexity, high emotion, or new content may call for tight structures. 'First Turn/Last Turn' in this appendix is an example of a tight structure. It gives shape to the conversation by providing a focus for talking, naming processes to be used, indicating the cognitive skills required, and setting boundaries for behavior and topic.

When the topic is easier to discuss, less restrictive strategies are used. 'Tell the person next to you one of your experiences with this idea.' This is a very loose structure, in which the only musts are the topic and with whom to talk.

Group size also influences safety. In general, pairs are safer than trios, which are safer than quartets and so on. The least safe is the full group conversation.

## Task, Relationship, or Process

A second consideration is the degree of focus on task, relationship, or process. Wellman and Lipton (2004) offer a metaphor of a street entertainer spinning plates. In selecting processes facilitators may choose to give more support to one of three 'plates': task, process, or relationship. As in a vaudeville act, all plates do not require constant attention. The facilitator notices which plate is wobbling and gives that one a little more spin, noting the spin by saying something like, 'This interaction has been structured so that you can appreciate the views of others at your table. Notice how others at the table give you ideas you did not have on your own.'

## Acknowledgments

We are grateful to the many people who have contributed to our understandings about protocols for working groups. We especially want to thank Michael Dolcemascolo, former co-director of Thinking Collaborative, who not only pioneered many of these protocols but gave himself to the arduous task of editing this section. Any errors that appear, however, are ours. What appear in this collection are contributions from the sources below and inventions of our own. We have made every effort to locate citations for specific strategies, and in many cases could not locate an original source. Where we have found a source we have noted it in the list of all strategies with classification codes.

## Focus First Moves

Outcome: Members attend to speaker

Michael Grinder was the first to formulate the focus attention moves . He called this concept attention first. The concept is supported by the following moves: stance, freeze gesture, credible voice, and then break and breathe described below. The first three occur simultaneously.  While it is common sense to wait for a group to attend, other considerations sometimes improperly override this function. Facilitator fatigue, feeling pressed for time, or having a number of subgroups conversing all at once will sometimes lead to poor practice.

## Break and Breathe ✓

## PROCESS

- · When over 90 percent of the group is attending, momentarily break eye contact, perhaps by looking down, then step to one side, engage eye contact again and say 'Thank you' in a credible voice.

## Choose voice ✓

## PROCESS

- · Use a credible voice. This is congruent with messages that give information and increases the 'authority' of what is said.

## NOTES

- · A credible voice has a limited range of modulation and tends to drop at the end of a phrase or sentence. This voice communicates information. An alternative voice is the approachable voice with a higher range of modulation. The approachable voice is somewhat melodic and tends to rise at the end of sentences. This voice is used to elicit responses rather than for gaining attention.

## Stance ✓

## PROCESS

- · Assume a credible stance, with an erect posture, arms to the side and straight legs-knees slightly bent--in alignment with shoulders.
- · Freeze Gesture ✓

## PROCESS

- · Hold one gesture still as and after making a call for attention. A gesture might be one or two hands pointing to self, accompanied with the words, 'Look this direction, please,' (or words of the faciliator's choice) delivered in a credible voice.
- · Other gestures could include pointing to a chart while maintaining the frozen body. The only principle for selecting a gesture is that the gesture should be above elbow level.

## Manage Attention

Outcome: Members maintain focus on topic or process

## Above, Pause, Whisper

## OUTCOME

Members return attention to facilitator

## PROCESS

- · 'Above' in this context means the faciliator's voice briefly starts above the volume level in the room.
- · Listen to the collective voice volume in a group rise and fall.
- · As the volume begins to drop from its loudest point, speak a partial phrase in a voice just louder than what you are hearing. Examples are: 'As you stop…' or 'This next stage…'
- · Pause as a momentary hush fills the room, than in a whisper finish your statement. For example, 'As you stop….and look this way, the next step will be to locate a new partner and share what you are learning.'

## TIPS

- · The volume of voices in a group cycle every 8 to 10 seconds from high to low. Listen until you can identity these ranges. Timing is essential to achieve the desired effect. The pause in this sequence provides a break in pattern, which brains are hardwired to detect, causing the momentary silence into which you interject directions.

## Applause

## OUTCOME

Break rapport in subgroups, bring focus to full group

## PROCESS

- · At the close of small group work, ask participants to give themselves a hand.
- · Model by clapping your hands.

## TIPS

- · Collective  applause  generates  electro-chemical  energy  in  the  brain  that  contributes  to  a  resourceful learning state.

## Cape

## OUTCOME

Member returns to topic under discussion

## PROCESS

- · Should a member offer an idea unrelated to the topic being discussed, the facilitator records the idea on a chart and says, 'That's an important idea.  Let's come back to it when we can give it full attention.'

## VARIATIONS

- · Facilitator directs the recorder to record.
- · Some may know this strategy by the name 'Parking Lot'.
- · Encourage self-directed recording.

## TIPS

- · It is important to return to this item in some way. Options include: at the end of the meeting, in a subgroup after the meeting, or on the next agenda.

## Eye Hand Coordination

## OUTCOME

Members' eyes go to where facilitator points

## PROCESS

- · Presenter looks in the direction (s)he points.

## TIPS

- · Member's eyes look in the direction in which the facilitator looks. Facilitators err when they look at the group while pointing to a chart. This becomes especially important when a facilitator/recorder team is at work.  Recorders avoid eye contact with the group so as not to split the group's attention between the facilitator and recorder.

## Finger Minutes

## OUTCOMES

- 1. Subgroup awareness they are part of the full group
- 2. Facilitator has data with which to announce additional time to be allotted the activity

## PROCESS

- · During an activity, ask the group to pause.
- · Participants in a group decide how many minutes they need to finish and designate one person to raise his/her hand indicating how many minutes the group needs to finish the activity. Set a limit by indicating a fist (0) to the maximum number of minutes you want to allow (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).
- · Name the finger numbers you see so the large group is aware of variation.
- · Estimate an average time that you think will allow most groups to finish without frustrating those groups already done.
- · Report the remaining time to the group.

## VARIATIONS

- · Without giving a time range, ask groups how much more time they need.

## OUTCOME

Members return attention to facilitator

## PROCESS

- · With frozen body and a frozen gesture, and with eyes downcast, the facilitator raises one hand at right angle to the body and waits until the room is quiet.
- · Members raise their hands, finish their current thought, then silently attend to the facilitator.
- · The facilitator breaks and breathes, says 'Thank you' and makes a transition statement to the next order of business.

## TIPS

- · Explain this is the most respectful signal you know, as it allows adults to finish their thought before attending to full group business.
- · Using the same spot to do this will begin to anchor the space as a signal to fall quiet and attend.
- · Visually oriented members are first to notice the hand signal, begin to quiet, and then the more auditorily oriented members notice the decrease in volume, and also fall quiet.

## Relevancy Check

## OUTCOME

Member adjusts behavior to match topic

## PROCESS

- · A group member says something unrelated to the group's topic.
- · The facilitator, with an approachable voice, says, 'Name, help us understand how your comment relates to the topic being explored?'
- · Speakers will either explain the relevance, in which case the conversation proceeds, or takes it off the table.

## VARIATIONS

- · The facilitator  records  the  item  on  chart  paper  announcing  the  group  will  return  to  it  at  an appropriate time.
- · See the strategy Cape elsewhere on this list.

## TIPS

- · A topic delayed must be returned to at some stage. Options include: subgroup after the meeting, added to this or next meeting agenda, or a subgroup drafts a statement about the topic to be talked about at the next meeting.

## Hand Signal

## Stand and Share

## OUTCOME

Members self-organize group reporting: Rather than depend on the facilitator to choose who speaks next, members look to who else might be standing and adjust reporting sequences accordingly

## PROCESS

- · The facilitator explains that when members hear the direction 'Stand and Share,' the group manages the order in which members report.
- · When a member stands, if no one else is standing, the member shares. If others are standing, by verbal or non-verbal communication they arrange the order of reporting.

## TIPS

- · Any move that releases member dependency on a facilitator contributes to self-directed learning and the reality that it is the 'group's group'. Facilitators reinforce this by assuming members will read page numbers on slides and not need to hear the facilitator's voice.

## Show, Don't Say

## OUTCOMES

- 1. Attend to facilitator's instructions or
- 2. separate facilitator from data

## PROCESS

- · The facilitator holds two fingers in the air and says, 'You have this many minutes.'
- · Hold the posture and gesture until members have visually acknowledged the signal and have gone back to work.

## VARIATIONS

- · Stand to the side of a chart (or whatever the visual focus is to be) so that you, the chart, and the group form a triangle. Swing your shoulders and arm into a pointing gesture toward the chart. Keep your eyes on the chart. Be silent.
- · Use in a conference when presenting difficult to accept data (e.g., with a parent to document student's late assignments).

## TIPS

- · Use the variation when you want to direct energy away from you or toward important information the group can read by itself. Look at the data, not at the group. The group's eyes will go where yours are focused; you want them to be examining the data toward which you are pointing.

## Visual Paragraph ✓

## OUTCOME

Increased understanding as members unconsciously match content with space

## PROCESS

- · Stand in one space and speak.
- · Without speaking, break eye contact, move to a new space, pause and resume speaking.

## VARIATIONS

- · If seated, change position in chair by leaning forward, to one side or backward.

## Yes, Start

## OUTCOME

Members confirm they are ready to start

## PROCESS

- · After giving directions for an activity, the facilitator remains standing, motionless, and visually scans the group for about 20 seconds.

## TIPS

- · When the facilitator remains motionless after giving directions, members get the message that they are to start the activity. Should members glance at a facilitator who is moving during the first 20 seconds, the message is that it is not necessary to start yet. Michael Grinder discovered this and named it The Most Important 20 Twenty Seconds .

## Airplane Stacking

## OUTCOMES

- 1. Reduce or eliminate member anxiety when facilitator calls on speakers
- 2. Members hear ideas of others because they're not worried about their place in a queue

## PROCESS

- · Explain metaphor related to control tower at airport directing the order in which planes are to land.
- · Assign numbers to those with raised hands. Advise them to remember their number.
- · Call on #1, then #2 and so on.
- · Do not comment on participant responses. If a question is posed, list on a flip chart for later attention.
- · When more hands are raised, add these to this list or start another list.

## Choreograph an Opening (Kendall Zoller)

## OUTCOMES

- 1. Acknowledge resistance
- 2. Members achieve states of neutrality or acceptance

## PROCESS

- · 'Thank you for coming.' High eye contact with group. Use credible and approachable voice. Open, palms up gesture.
- · 'On the agenda are four topics.' Credible voice, look at agenda, pause after reading each topic. Turn to the group, freeze body, and count internally 3,2,1.
- · 'Before we start.' Walk a few feet from the flip chart (presentation space).
- · 'I imagine some of you would rather be in classrooms today. And for good reason. Rooms need to be set up, final touches done for opening day and materials need to be organized.' Gesture outside, toward classrooms. Pause periodically. Use credible voice, pause, and internally count 3,2,1. Then move halfway back to the flip chart.
- · 'At the same time, given your passion for serving students in the most complete ways possible, you may be wondering what can happen here that can make this worth your while.' Approachable voice. Palms up gesturing to group. Inclusive language.
- · 'The first topic today is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.' Walk back toward flip chart. Look at and point to flip chart. Credible voice.

## VARIATIONS

- · Language choices: some of you, all of you, a few of you, many of you.

## TIPS

- · Language for reasons for being in classrooms and passion for students needs to be artfully vague. If it is too specific, you will lose some listeners, as they say to themselves, 'That is not me.'

## Closing the Window

## OUTCOMES

- 1. Alert group time is ending
- 2. Members know time for process is ending

## PROCESS

The facilitator says, 'You have this much time left on this topic,' while moving hands closer together starting at shoulder width apart.

## TIPS

- · Move hands slowly together while scanning the group for any signals someone wants to speak.
- · This strategy may stimulate contributions from people who have been sitting on an idea but have not yet said it.

## Decontaminate Problem Space

## OUTCOMES

- 1. Regain positive energy
- 2. Members regain resourcefulness, often evidenced by posture, facial expressions, etc.

## PROCESS

- · Locations evoke memory. When a negative or counterproductive statement has been made, the location from which it was made evokes emotional recall.
- · Step away from any location in which a statement distressing to the group was made by anyone.

## VARIATIONS

- · If the person introducing you is disliked by the group, or says something that causes distress, begin your work in any space other than the space occupied by the introducer.
- · If you say something clumsy or offensive, step out of the space in which it was said, point back to the space and say, 'Did he say that?' Or 'That was wrong, I apologize for that.'
- · Rooms also evoke memories. If required to work in a room in which participants have negative reactions, redesign the workspace and change furniture arrangements.

## TIPS

- · The stronger the emotional message, the greater the decontamination effort. Move to the back of the room to decontaminate the effect of intense negative messages.

## Foreshadow

## OUTCOMES

- 1. Signal a transition
- 2. Members anticipate next events

## PROCESS

- · Before a break, name the next topic or activity to occur.

## VARIATIONS

- · Build suspense by not naming the topic but suggesting that the information will be surprising.

## TIPS

- · Anticipation serves the function of an advance organizer.

## PAG/PAU (Process as Given, Process as Understood) (Doyle and Strauss)

## OUTCOMES

- 1. Check for understanding
- 2. Members are clear about the next process(es)

## PROCESS

- · With a credible voice, the facilitator gives directions for the next activity.
- · Next, the facilitator pauses, breaks eye contact, silently moves to a new space and in an approachable voice says, 'Just to be sure that I stated that clearly, what are you about to do?'

## VARIATIONS

- · Ask specific questions such as 'What will you do first, next, etc.?'
- · Invite pairs or table groups to clarify directions.

## TIPS

- · This strategy respectfully places any failure of communication with the facilitator.
- · The effectiveness of the message is enhanced because it is communicated in space, voice and language.

## Satisfy, Satisfy, Delay (Michael Grinder)

## OUTCOMES

- 1. Recover positive energy
- 2. Members attention are diverted from distressing member

## PROCESS

- · The facilitator notices that when one particular group member speaks, the group appears annoyed. The signals might be eye rolling, deep sighs, or facial expressions.
- · Noticing this is a pattern, at the third time this member asks to be recognized, the facilitator does NOT call on the member, but calls on another, or closes the conversation.
- · Later, make an attempt to rehabilitate this member's status in the group by calling positive attention to a later contribution.

## VARIATIONS

- · Move to another part of the room and ask if anyone from that area would like to add something.
- · Direct pairs to talk on a related topic.

## TIPS

- · The facilitator's relationship is with the group, not an individual.

## Signal Role Change

## OUTCOMES

- 1. Role clarity
- 2. Members know the person facilitating has left that role

## PROCESS

- · When facilitating a meeting and wanting to contribute content, ask, 'May I add something?' The group usually will concur.
- · Move off to the side of the group. From this space, make a contribution in a credible voice.
- · Without speaking, return to the facilitation space. In an approachable voice ask. 'OK. Let's move on,' or 'How does that add to your thinking?'

## VARIATIONS

- · Instead of moving off to the side of the group, ask a participant to stand in your place while you occupy that seat and make your contribution.
- · If seated, signal the change by broad changes in posture, e.g., leaning back, removing glasses, briefly standing.

## TIPS

- · Physical signals are essential. Without them, some will not realize you are temporarily stepping out of the role and feel the processes are less than honest.

## Stop. Redirect

## OUTCOMES

- 1. Maintain one topic at a time
- 2. Member off topic will save comment for more appropriate time

## PROCESS

- · In a credible voice say, 'Name, please hold on to that idea. We will return to it in a moment'.
- · Accompany words with slight move toward the participant with arms hugging opposing arms as in 'holding on'.

## VARIATIONS

- · See Caping and Relevancy Check.
- · Vary language and non-verbal expressions to match the culture of the group.

## TIPS

- · Use when a group member has violated the one topic at a time standard.
- · You have permission to use this only when the group is clear about the topic and the one topic at a time standard.

## Third Point

## OUTCOME

## Direct attention

## PROCESS

- · Get the group to look at a screen or flip chart by using a frozen hand gesture pointed toward the screen and directing your own eyes at the screen.
- · Walk away without making eye contact with the group. The group will continue to look at the screen.

## VARIATIONS

- · Direct attention to a section of text for members to interact with.

## TIPS

- · The group's eyes go where the facilitator's eyes are directed. When the facilitator maintains eye contact, this is two-point communication.
- · Three-point communication separates the message from the messenger.
- · When two-point communication is used related to hard-to-talk-about  data,  the  facilitator  is considered to be connected to the problem

## TAG/TAU (Topic as Given/Topic as Understood) (Doyle and Strauss)

## OUTCOMES

- 1. Check for understanding
- 2. Members are clear about the next topic

## PROCESS

- · With a credible voice, the facilitator names the next topic or task, with the information clearly displayed on a chart.
- · The presenter defines key words.
- · Next, the facilitator pauses, breaks eye contact, silently moves to a new space and in an approachable voice says, 'Just to be sure that I stated that clearly, what is the next topic (or task)?'

## VARIATIONS

- · Ask pairs or table groups to restate the topic and report to the group.

## TIPS

- · Like PAG/PAU, the effectiveness of the message is enhanced because it is communicated in space, voice and language.

## Volunteer Stand

## OUTCOMES

- 1. Redirect energy
- 2. Surprise and laughter

## PROCESS

- · Announce the need for a spokesperson for each group.
- · Ask a volunteer from each group to stand.
- · Ask for applause for the standing members' willingness to serve.
- · Instruct standing members to raise their right hand, move in a circle above their heads, and allow the hand to drop on the shoulder of the person who will be spokesperson for the group.

## VARIATIONS

- · Add anything that will add to the suspense and light atmosphere of the instructions.

## TIPS

- · It is not necessary for members to remain standing.
- · You may have to coax volunteers from some groups.

## Yellow Light

## OUTCOMES

- · Signal transition
- · Members mentally prepare for transition

## PROCESS

- · Stop the group and gain attention.
- · Indicate how many minutes are left in the activity.

## VARIATIONS

- · Use Show, Don't Say in this appendix instead of verbally announcing the remaining time.
- · Indicate that if groups have not started on \_\_\_\_ task they should do so now, as only \_\_\_\_\_ minutes remain.
- · When groups are deep at work in lengthy tasks, move to groups silently and show a large sign showing the remaining minutes.

## TIPS

- · Use this to prepare members for transitions.

## Grouping To Regroup and Energize

## COMMENTS

- · When  seating  is  modified,  members  extend  their  conceptual  horizons  by  interacting  with people  with  differing  experiences,  perspectives  and  roles.  Regrouping  participants  has  the additional advantage of adding energy when members have been engaged in an activity for a length of time. Four principles apply in regrouping:
- ∘ First alert members that a partner change is ahead. The Pack and Stack signal described below accomplishes this.
- ∘ Choice is the second principle. Repeated choice supports perspectives of self-directedness and efficacy.
- ∘ The third principle is diversity. Over the course of a meeting provide opportunities for members to meet with others least likely to encounter in the flow of their work.
- ∘ Fourth and finally is an immediate prompt. Assigning people a topic can be used to either summarize what just occurred or activate and engage members on the topic to enter. A prompt also preserves meeting time by directing immediate attention to the next task.
- · If energy is needed, create pairs through use of learning partners, eye contact partners, shoe partners or any device that will get people to move about the room.
- · First, give instructions on the structure of the task, then name the partner with whom they will be working.
- · Participants need to stack, pack and move their possessions.

## Card Games

## OUTCOME

- · Energize and randomly regroup

## PROCESSES

- · Distribute playing cards in a specific fashion. For example, place sets of three similar cards (e.g., Aces) randomly throughout the room, or sets of two distributed in a similar manner.
- · Instruct members to locate a card partner, sit and respond to a prompt.

## High Fives

## OUTCOME

Energize and randomly regroup

## PROCESSES

- · Demonstrate three persons grasping hands above their heads for a 'high five.'
- · Instruct members to stand with one hand in the air. Locate and grasp a hand of two other persons. This is the group for the next task.
- · Sit and respond to a prompt.

## Learning Partners

## OUTCOME

Members choose four partners for future paired work

## PROCESSES

- · Provide a page displaying four partner choices. These might be seasons, places on a clock, sports teams or other symbols meaningful to the group.
- · Instruct members to make appointments with four people. If using a clock, for example, members would choose a partner for 3, 6, 9, and 12 o'clock and record the appointments on the provided page.
- · Check to see that each has a partner for each partner space. Form partnerships from those indicating they are missing the same partner slot.
- · Indicate a space to which members can move if they cannot locate their partner. If no one is available to pair with, advise them to join the brightest group.

## Mix-Freeze-Pair

## OUTCOME

Energize and regroup

## PROCESS

- · Instruct members to stand and move around the room.
- · At a signal, freeze and pair with the nearest person.
- · Sit together and respond to a prompt.

## Pairs Squared

## OUTCOME

Create quartet-working groups

## PROCESS

- · Instruct current pairs to join another pair, sit together and respond to a prompt.

## Stack and Pack

## OUTCOMES

Alert members that a transition is coming in which they will be moving their materials to work in a seat different from the one in which they are now seated.

## PROCESS

- · Display a stack and pack slide.
- · Initially, explain that this slide indicates a transition is about to occur in which members will bundle their materials in readiness to sit with new partners.

## Facilitator Strategies

Purposes and intentions are shown for each strategy. These are the rationale a facilitator would have for using the strategy.

## Analogy Prompts

Activate Ideas Corresponding to a Challenge

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Access and transfer concepts to a current situation.

## PROCESS

- · Pose prompts as analogies such as:
- ∘ How do runners manage to have a speed-up kick left for the finish?
- ∘ How did the stagecoaches of the American West manage to race across great distances in just a few days?
- ∘ How do the answers to the above relate to a challenge faced by the group?

## EXAMPLE

- · Making the observation that stagecoaches changed horses frequently, might lead to the idea of rotating and delegating school improvement tasks.

## Banned Words

Inclusion

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Evoke humor, playfulness, and efficacy in reluctant or discouraged group.

## PROCESS

- · Table groups identify a few words they would like banned from this session.
- · One or two words are heard from each group and charted.
- · The group agrees to collectively groan whenever one of these words are heard.
- · The group practices the groan.

## TIPS

- · Explain that sometimes words are overworked in organizations. This will give participants an opportunity to be free from them during this session.
- · Periodically use one of the banned words to playfully stimulate a response.

## VARIATIONS

- · Select phrasing that might most accurately describe the group. All of us (you), some of, parts of, a few of…

## TIPS

- · Prepare by listing what you surmise about the group. What do you believe are the emotions they are feeling, the reasons for the emotions and what the group values.

## Diversity Rounds

Inclusion

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Seek and identify likenesses in others, understand sameness and differences within group, and relate personal experience to topic.

## PROCESS

- · Indicate directions will be purposively vague so members can decide which subgroup they will report to.
- · The  facilitator  chooses  categories  that  fit  the  group's  purpose  going  from  lesser  to  greater levels of sensitivity. Examples: birth order, decade of birth, gender, cognitive style, time in the organization, ethnicity.
- · As each category is named stand and search for three or four people that fit criteria.
- · How has this identity criteria shaped or influenced you as a professional?
- · Eight to ten minutes.
- · Hear reports from group.
- · The facilitator names a new category and the pattern is repeated three or four times.
- · Next, members write responses to prompts such as: 'What I am noticing about myself, the group, and the effect of being in various subgroups'; 'How I feel about the various subgroups that I selected; and what might we do to maximize the attributes of the various subgroups.'
- · Responses are shared in heterogeneous groups.
- · Each group develops a summary paraphrase of their findings and recommendations.

## ALTERNATIVES

- · Instead of journal entries, small groups might converse about their responses to the prompts.

## TIPS

- · Best for a group of at least twenty people. If group becomes too large, divide into smaller subgroups.

## First Job

Inclusion

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Level the social perceptions of group members to similar youth-related experiences.

## PROCESS

- · In round-robin style, each person reveals his or her first paid job. Responses might include jobs like babysitting, shucking corn, and picking fruit.

## Four Box Synectics

Activate and Engage

## PURPOSES AND INTENTIONS

Evoke energy, creativity, and humor related to new topic.

## PROCESS

- · On chart paper, draw a 2 × 2 box. Post.
- · A recorder at each table group draws a similar box to collect table group's thinking.
- · Elicit recommendations for an object or concept to place in each of the boxes. Suggest each time that the next recommendation be as different as possible from the previous recommendation (Ex: lamppost, sailboat, hammer, daisy or shopping, sailing, cleaning, fishing).
- · Instruct  table  groups  to  brainstorm  three  or  four  responses  for  each  box  to  the  prompt  you provide. (Ex: 'Professional communities are like a lamppost because\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.' 'Professional communities are like a sailboat because\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.')
- · Give groups two minutes to select their best items and a spokesperson.
- · Elicit responses from table groups using the full phrase: 'A professional community is like a lamppost because\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.'

## VARIATIONS

- · People synectics. Provide each table group with three to five postcards that have images of famous persons. Ensure that postcards represent diversity.
- · Direct table groups to talk about what they know about each person on the cards.
- · Have table groups select one card and complete the phrase: (name the person) is like (the topic you are working on) because\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
- · Complete  the  phrase:  (name  the  person)  is  NOT  like  (the  topic  you  are  working  on)  be-cause\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
- · Synectic questions can be posed. 'What game are you playing in this organization?' Responses carry insights and humor, as, 'We are playing badminton in a hurricane.'

## TIPS

- · Explain that 'Synectics' is derived from two Greek roots: syn (bringing together) and ectics (diverse  elements). This  activity  draws  from  the  metaphoric  brain  which  holds  information holistically.

## Give One to Get One

Activate and Engage

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Generate  energy,  community  building  by  interacting  with  others,  and  generate  information about the new topic.

## PROCESS

- · Individuals write data on 3 × 5 card. (Ex: name, role, agency, time I spend doing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, a trick of the trade about \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, a technique that works for me during \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.)
- · Members  move  about  room  and  share  the  information  on  their  card  with  another  person. Members paraphrase and inquire so they can, in a moment, share their partner's card and information with another person.
- · At signal, members trade cards.
- · Members then locate a new partner and share the new card and information they just acquired with their new partner.
- · At a signal, return to table groups. Share what you learned.
- · As a group, identify what patterns or themes you detected.

## VARIATIONS

• Go a third round.

• Provide a template for the sharing of patterns. 'There were three themes here, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_,

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

• Use to activate concepts such as, 'A belief I have about adult learners is. . . .'

## Greeting Circle

Inclusion

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Access affective states and establish a sense of group and self within group.

## PROCESS

- · Form a circle.
- · The facilitator (or designated person) moves inside the circle and greets the person to his or her left.
- · They continue inside the circle greeting each person in turn.
- · Those who have been greeted follow the person who greeted them inside the circle.
- · When the facilitator returns to his or her original location, those inside the circle continue to greet them, a second time.
- · This time, the person inside the circle is the greeter, not the greeted. This balances the circle.
- · When the greeting is complete, ask two questions. (1) How do you feel about the activity? (2) What did you learn from it that will make you successful?

## VARIATIONS

- · Moving right around the circle.

## TIPS

- · No ritual is older, and none more anxiety-ridden, than that of greeting each other. The natural tendency is to seek out those one is comfortable with, those who are like them.

- · The greeting circle allows the anxiety and apprehension of the individuals to be encountered. It releases energy into the room in the sound of high voices, and laughter.
- · The emotional material must be expressed first to allow learning to take place. It grounds the person in the moment and allows people to be real.
- · Useful as a grounding for sessions on conflict, hard-to-talk about topics and, or when, two or more groups are brought together for difficult conversations.

## Group Groan

Inclusion

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Through humor, induce ownership and responsibility for personal reactions in the session.

## PROCESS

- · Table groups list what are the best and worst things that can happen in this session.
- · Hear a few and record them on flip charts.
- · Make an agreement that should any of the worst things occur, all will participate in a group groan.
- · Practice the groan once.

## VARIATIONS

- · Give think time before receiving items.
- · With groups of twelve or less, elicit both best and worst from the full group. Record in two columns.

## Grounding

Inclusion

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Activate internal resources for addressing sensitive topics with respect and skill.

## PROCESS

- · Form groups of four, six, or eight.
- · Explain that the purpose for this activity is to set a norm for respectful listening, to get everyone's voice in the room in a manner that is nonconfrontational, to allow people to connect with one another, to allow for the expressions of hopes and apprehensions, to value thinking and feeling, and to surface agendas that might not otherwise be heard.
- · Explain the procedure:
- ∘ Members take turns talking.
- ∘ When one member talks, all others are silent.
- ∘ Full non-verbal attention is given to the speaker.
- ∘ After everyone has talked, the first speaker will summarize what was said.
- ∘ When the members indicate that they understand the process, the facilitator names the first speaker. Alert in advance.

- · Post on a flip chart what members are to talk about:
- ∘ My name is . . .
- ∘ My relationship to this topic is . . .
- ∘ My expectations are . . .
- ∘ How I feel about being here is . . .
- · When all groups are finished, the facilitator calls on the first person in each group to give a summary statement to the full assembly.

## VARIATIONS

- · Another prompt might be: What is the commitment that brought you into this room?
- · With twelve members, the grounding can be done with the full group.

## TIPS

- · Since this activity's primary purpose is to provide participants' with an opportunity to be heard, this activity operates on earth time, not clock time.
- · Use when a meeting is going to address hard-to-talk-about topics. The harder the topic is to talk about, the more valuable the full group grounding is.
- · With a group size of forty to fifty people, this activity might take as much as forty-five minutes.

## Hopes and Fears

Inclusion

## PURPOSE AND INTENTION

Establish common ground and normalize member's reaction to setting or topic.

## PROCESS

- · Briefly write your fears and hopes about this session or topic.
- · Pairs share their greatest fear and greatest hope.
- · Quartets meet (pairs squared) and identify themes in fears and hopes.
- · Report themes to full group.
- · Facilitator makes comments to normalize fears and identify common hopes.

## VARIATIONS

- · Pairs report all fears and hopes.
- · Conduct process as full group with facilitator eliciting and charting.

## TIPS

- · With either alternative, start with private reflection.

## I'm In

Inclusion

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Facilitate  mental  and  emotional  transition  from  outside  the  meeting  to  being  present  in  the meeting.

## PROCESS

- · Members go around the circle briefly naming anything on their mind. (Examples: 'I'm concerned about my eighth grader. She says she doesn't have any friends. I know she is just down and does have friends. I'm figuring out how to handle this. OK. I'm in.' or 'I've never had a third grade class so excited about creative writing. Their enthusiasm lifts me up every day. OK. I'm in.')
- · Stress that there is no side talk.
- · At the end, make a summary paraphrase.

## VARIATIONS

- · Be the first speaker to model brevity.

## TIPS

- · Stop anyone who interrupts a speaker.
- · Should someone ask to pass, that is OK, though we suggest not offering that as an option as you set up the activity.

## Knots (Bob Chadwick)

Inclusion

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Leaving the familiarity of words, kinesthetically forming a working group. Evoke humor and energy.

## PROCESS

- · Form groups of eight. Form a circle.
- · Everyone places left hand in circle and grasps the hand of ONE other person whose hand is in the circle.
- · Now place right hands in circle and grasp the hand of ONE other person whose hand is in the circle.
- · Everyone now should be holding the hands of two other people.
- · Without letting go of the grips, untangle the human knot.

## VARIATIONS

- · Place the right hand in first.

## TIPS

- · Groups of six to eight are ideal. Ten are possible. Twelve are too many.

## Know, Think You Know, Want to Know

Activate and Engage

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Engage constructivist-learning experience working with a fresh topic.

## PROCESS

- · Label chart paper with three columns: Know; Think You Know, Want to Know.
- · Give topic to groups and have them complete the charts.
- · Post charts and have group look for patterns and themes.

## VARIATIONS

- · Facilitator responds to the Want to Know columns by providing responses to the large group.

## TIPS

- · If groups disagree on the 'Know' column, encourage them to place content in the 'Think You Know' column.

## Like Me

Inclusion

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Recognize sense of self within community.

## PROCESS

- · Participants move chairs back from tables so it will be easy to stand if appropriate.
- · Name categories like 'my work is done at the elementary level, high school, middle school central office,' or ' I have been in this district five or more years, ten, twenty, thirty, more,' or ' I am a teacher, principal, consultant, etc.' or I am typically up before 6:00 a.m.'
- · As people stand, remind them to look around and see who else is also in that group.
- · Finally ask the question 'other' regarding roles. In other words if your role has not been called, please stand. The facilitator asks standing members to state their roles.

## VARIATIONS

- · For parent groups change the prompts. My first child in this school, I attended this school, I speak a language other than English, etc.

## TIPS

- · Because this strategy is done as an inclusion activity when you do not yet have relationship with the group, it is important to state the multiple purposes of inclusion activities like this: They include setting norms of participation, focusing mental energy inside the room, answering the question who am I in relation to others in the room and beginning the journey from an aggregate of individuals to a group.
- · The category 'other' is essential. People feel left out if their role is not acknowledged.
- · DO NOT ask participants to say 'like me' when they stand. Perhaps appropriate for elementary children, it is embarrassing for adults.

## Line-ups

## OUTCOMES

Energize, regroup participants, and sometimes learn about each other.

## PROCESSES

- · Announce that the purpose is to regroup and energize.
- · Designate a space in the room for members with low responses to stand and members with high responses to stand. Others will form a line representing their response in relationship to those two points.
- · Provide a topic [e.g., how hot people like their salsa, birthdates (not year), alphabetically by desired profession or other topics.]
- · Sample responses from different parts of the line-up.
- · Cluster people into working groups by counting off, or moving along the line by threes, fours, or whatever group size desired.

## VARIATIONS

- · Have one-half of the line step forward. They walk toward the other half forming a double line with people facing each other. Facing members become partners for the next activity.

## TIPS

- · Structure line-ups around the perimeter of the room for the best use of space.
- · Choose topic based on group's knowledge of each other; intact groups might be more interested in alternative professions than groups who do not know each other.

## My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean

Activate and Engage

## PURPOSE AND INTENTNIONS

Recover energy as it begins to wane.

## PROCESS

- · Describe the purpose of this activity is to promote energy for the next portion of the meeting.
- · Lead the group in singing 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean.' When the letter 'B' is used in the song stand if you have been seated, and sit if you have been standing.

## TIPS

- · Advise members to take care of any physical needs during the activity. Protect knees, back.

## Pair-Share

Activate and Engage

## PURPOSE AND INTENTION

Quickly energize a group to stimulate engagement on a topic. Facilitators use this to energize, activate, and engage or to give self-recovery time when stumped.

## PROCESS

- · Assign pairs.
- · Direct them to 'Talk with the person next to you for three minutes about\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.'

## VARIATIONS

- · Have members work with the 'person behind them' for novelty and added energy.
- · Use trios.

## Paired Verbal Fluency (see also Generate Ideas)

Activate and Engage

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Recall prior knowledge.

## PROCESS

- · Form pairs.
- · Describe the process:
- ∘ A and B will take turns responding to a prompt.
- ∘ At a signal one will speak and one will listen.
- ∘ At a signal the other will speak while the first speaker listens.
- ∘ Each time, no one is allowed to repeat anything that was said by the other.
- ∘ Check for clarification.
- · Repeat the cycle two or three times. For activating prior knowledge:
- ∘ First round twenty seconds each.
- ∘ Second round forty seconds each.
- ∘ Third round sixty seconds each.
- · For organizing and integrating:
- ∘ First round sixty seconds each.
- ∘ Second round forty seconds each.
- ∘ Third round twenty seconds each.

## VARIATIONS

- · Gauge the time allotted for the second and third round by the level of participant engagement. The purpose for the declining amounts of time is to focus thinking. The purpose of the increasing amounts of time is to broaden thinking.

## TIPS

- · Announce the time allotted for rounds only after the exercise is completed so participants can apply this strategy elsewhere without knowing the structure until experiencing it.

## People, Places, Things Cards (PPT Cards)

Activate and Engage

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Provide a variation of an A/E activity through attention to third point objects.

## PROCESS

- · Place cards on each table. These may be postcards of famous people, pictures of places or things cut out from magazines.

- · Ask table groups to engage in a question regarding the cards. (See variations below.)
- · Share with large group.

## VARIATIONS

- · Put enough People, Thing, or Place Cards on a table so that each person can chose one. Ask a processing question (e.g., 'Which picture best describes where you are in your journey right now?'). Ask each person to share their response with their table.
- · Put one Person Card on each table and ask table to fill in the blanks with a stem. (E.g., \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is  like  a  facilitator  because:  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  ;  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  is  not  like  a  facilitator  because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.) Each table shares with large group.
- · Use Thing Cards for a Visual Synectics.

## TIPS

- · Be sure People Cards represent diversity.

## People Search

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Information Processing: Activating and Engaging/Organizing and Integrating.

## PROCESS

- · Construct a handout listing content information being learned (e.g., can name seven norms of collaboration) or ways in which participants might have applied content (e.g., used a norm in a meeting) or interesting information about participants (e.g., drives a sports car). Provide a space by each item for a name to be recorded.
- · Ask participants to stand and find one person who can respond positively to an item on the page. The participant places the person's name beside the item, thanks the person, and then finds another person who can respond to another item.
- · Continue until time is called, filling blanks with different names.

## VARIATIONS

- · Provide a prompt with each item so that participants engage in a brief conversation about the effect of that item.

## TIPS

- · Be sure participants understand that they must ask each other questions; they cannot just hand their sheet to a person and ask them to sign one of the lines.
- · Use information about participants to help people get to know each other.
- · Use content information to connect people to their learning.

## Propose Working Agreements

Activate and Engage

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

For one-time, short, or initial meetings agree to selected working agreements.

## PROCESS

- Display and describe posted Working Agreements as shown below.
- Describe  Sufficient  Consensus and its  benefits  as  shown  in this appendix.
- Ask if  members can agree to these during this meeting.

## ALTERNATIVES

- Eliminate sufficient consensus.
- Have the group develop meeting Working Agreements.
- Once a group has agreed to these Working Agreements, print them on each succeeding agenda.

## TIPS

- Working agreements are not always needed or  wise as they might signal negative presupposi­ tions about a group's working capacity.
- When time is short and the meeting routine,  this  process  can respectfully set agreements.
- Group-developed agreements may be useful when little working experience or trust exists.

## Process Text and Information

## Meeting Working Agreements

Demonstrate Mutual Respect (Respect people and ideas - such respect does not represent agreement)

Employ Skillful Listening (seek first to understand, then to be understood) Sufficient  Consensus (each person has equal voice, the group works to understand all views, distinguish between dialogue and discussion and 75% agreement of those present constitute consensus)

Strategies  in this  section  are  conversation containers.  They  support  learning  in that learning takes  place  only  when processed by learners.  They are  valuable because they  provide  structures for talking about information making it more likely that conversations are efficient,  focused, and safely  allow  full  participation.  They  are  designed  to  draw  meaning  from  text  or  other  sources, analyze, infer, develop hypotheses, extend ideas, relate content to selves, entertain questions, or reconsider and tentatively refine new ways of understanding.  Because members come to a group with  multiple  cognitive  styles  and  various  levels  of  social  skills  and  interests,  strategies  that name specific  ways  of  talking  and  the  cognitive  processes  to  be  used  bring  these  diverse  styles of  individuals to  common  working focus.

Strategies in the previous section (Activate and Engage) are used either as inclusion activities or to trigger member's knowledge before participating in new learning. The current collection provides the two final phases in Lipton and Wellman's (1998) learning model in that learners process the  data  in  a  variety  of  ways  to  make  it  their  own. These  strategies  accommodate  two  types  of learning: explore and discover, and organize and integrate.

'Explore and Discover' is used when new content is introduced and must be processed by learners. Content may be provided in a variety of ways-paired reading activities, lecturette, case study, demonstration, inventories, and more. For learners to explore the new content-related to what they have previously activated-they must use skills of cognitive processing. How much and what kind of processing leads to a perennial facilitator dilemma in which time, outcomes, group energy, and group skills are criteria for decisions. Learning with the 'Key Concepts/Key Ideas' strategy, for example, requires each partner to identity and reflect upon the most important parts of a text they have both read. This strategy is relatively brief, loosely structured, and uses cognitive skills well within the range of each participant.

Finally, in the third phase of the Lipton and Wellman model, participants organize and integrate their learning to make it uniquely their own. Developing personal organizational schemas to show the relationships of concepts is the work of the group member. Members catalogue and index new understandings; develop frameworks and models; or synthesize and represent learning. Synthesis and evaluative thought are called for. It is this stage, in fact, in which members crystallize meaning for themselves.

Skilled facilitators use several criteria to select strategies with tight structures. Either emotion about the topic is high, the group is unskilled in group processes, the topic is complex or the group's composition includes a range of roles and the voices of the less senior need to be protected. Available time and group size are other considerations. Facilitators working with intact groups support groups in becoming familiar with a few of these strategies before adding more.

## 3-2-1 Plus 1

## Explore and Discover

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Recall and explain previous learning or what occurred at a recent event.

## PROCESS

- · Members draw a right-hand margin on a piece of paper. Label the margin 'Plus 1.'
- · Individuals in groups of three or four write three key ideas they remember from the last meeting, two things they want to explore, and one point to ponder.
- · Next, round-robin sharing of one idea from each category. As members share, listeners may record personal notes in the right-hand margin.
- · Plus 1 refers to notes members take as they listen to others.

## VARIATIONS

- · Start the sharing at the second item (Two things to explore) as more value probably comes from the second two categories.
- · Process the activity with the full group.

## 5-3-1 Organize and Integrate

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Interdependently synthesize information.

## PROCESSES

- · Members identify five words that represent today's learning.
- · Share the ideas, one at a time, in round-robin fashion. Explore the ideas as they emerge.
- · Select three central ideas.
- · If these three ideas were to go into a container with a label, what would that label be?

## ALTERNATIVES

- · Use for what you want to remember from today's meeting or accomplishments.
- · See 'Most Important Point,' 'Scrambled Sentences,' or 'Three Balloons' in this collection.

## TIPS

- · Foreshadow several steps, but do not tell name of strategy.
- · Use as follow-up to instruction.
- · Vary the prompts.

## TIPS

- · Assign time, perhaps twelve minutes, so the group stays focused and brief.

## A B Each Teach

Explore and Discover

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Explain content from text or other input.

## PROCESS

- · Pairs designate one partner as 'A' and one as 'B.'
- · Person 'A' reads one section of text.
- · Person 'B' reads another section of text.
- · When both are ready, they 'teach' their section to their partner.

## VARIATIONS

- · Pairs conclude by developing a summary of the text essence.
- · Pairs join another pair and develop a summary.

## TIPS

- · If energy is needed, create pairs through use of learning partners, eye contact partners, shoe partners, or any device that will get people to move about the room.

## Expert Jigsaw

Explore and Discover

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Interdependently acquire, summarize, and communicate information.

## PROCESS

- · Cluster members into home groups of five (if five topics are to be studied) and number off one to five. Each number is assigned a reading.
- · Have all the number ones, two, threes, etc., move into expert groups of like numbers.
- · Provide questions to expert groups to help them process information.
- · In the expert groups, members read the material, report on the questions, then converse about its meaning.
- · Members determine what ideas they will share and how they will share the ideas in their home groups.
- · Return to home groups and share what has been learned in the expert groups.

## VARIATIONS

- · Expert groups develop an image or perform a skit to convey information.

## TIPS

- · While there is value in member choice, assigning topics takes less time than allowing members to choose their own topics.

## Key Concepts/Key Ideas

Explore and Discover

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Select and interpret information and relate to member's experience.

## PROCESS

- · Organize members into pairs.
- · Assign a reading.
- · Individuals read text, marking key concepts and ideas.
- · When both have finished reading, take turns sharing and exploring concepts/ideas marked by each partner.

## VARIATIONS

- · Assign the reading in sections. After each section, share concepts and ideas.
- · See the 'Say Something Strategy.'

## TIPS

- · As with all text-based learning, remind members that a key value of this strategy is the different experiences and perspectives each member brings to the topic.

## Modified Jigsaw

Explore and Discover

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

A high-energy and time-saving alternative to 'Expert Jigsaw' that also requires members to acquire, summarize, and communicate information.

## PROCESS

- · Form a team.
- · Apportion a reading to members of the team.
- · Each member reads an assigned section and plans how to teach it to the team.

## Partners Report

Explore and Discover

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Synthesize constructed meaning.

## PROCESS

- · Partners engage in conversation knowing they may be asked to report their partner's ideas.
- · Provide two minutes for each to be sure they can paraphrase their partner correctly.
- · Ask for a volunteer to share.
- · Repeat the pattern as time permits.

## VARIATIONS

- · To increase energy, partner people from different locations and have them stand throughout this exercise.

## TIPS

- · It is not necessary for both partners to share. One speaker does not obligate the other.
- · When possible, sequentially call on persons from different quarters of the room because this causes listeners to adjust body positions to hear, thus maintaining energy.

## Read and Example

Explore and Discover

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Summarize, interpret, and construct examples.

## PROCESS

- · Letter off A and B.
- · Each partner reads the first paragraph.

- · Pairs generate examples of this idea in action.
- · A summarizes.
- · Repeat the pattern, alternating the summarizing role.

## VARIATIONS

- · Structure as a trio with each person reading the paragraph, A and B giving examples and C paraphrasing and summarizing. Rotate roles.

TIPS

- · Producing examples may be challenging for some individuals so always have at least a pair generating examples.

## Say Something (Jerome Harste)

Explore and Discover

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Select and interpret information and relate to member's experience.

## PROCESS

- · Choose a partner.
- · Read silently and simultaneously to designated stopping points.
- · When each partner is ready, stop and 'say something.'
- ∘ The something might be a question, a brief summary, a key point, an interesting idea, or personal connection.
- · Continue the process until you have completed the selection.

## VARIATIONS

- · See the 'Key Concepts/Key Ideas' strategy for a more holistic approach to the construction of meaning.

## TIPS

- · Stop and share at the end of each paragraph for an incremental approach to the social construction of meaning.
- · Do not use with readings longer than four to five paragraphs.

- · Others tour the displays and search for new ideas.
- · Members return to home base and exchange information.

## VARIATIONS

- · Other topics:
- ∘ Knowledge about any topic the group is about to address.
- ∘ Recollections and insights about any topic the group has already addressed.
- ∘ Considerations that should drive a decision. Then identify and explore values the considerations illuminate.
- · After a museum tour, tables identify and report themes in the data.
- · Eliminate the museum tour.

## TIPS

- · Levels the playing field in mixed groups.
- · Stress  rationale  for  the  activity  to  include  honoring  member  expertise,  leveling  the  playing field, equalizing member status, and getting a lot of information in a short period of time.

## Strategy Harvest

Organize and Integrate

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Recall, clarify, and construct.

## PROCESS

- · With a partner, review and clarify a list of strategies so you can explain them.
- · Select two to three strategies and develop applications for your work.

## VARIATIONS

- · Assign task to an affinity group members that work together.

## TIPS

- · When triple-track presenting is used, strategies will be recorded on flip charts as they are used.
- · Few learners apply without specific tasks like this, which invite application thinking.

## Text Rendering

Explore and Discover

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Select, interpret, explain, and synthesize.

## PROCESS

- · Members review a document and highlight a sentence, a phrase, and a word that are meaningful.
- · Provide strips of paper of varying lengths to accommodate a sentence, phrase, or word.
- · Each member, in round-robin fashion, posts and explains his or her strips.
- · Once all the strips are posted and explained, the group agrees on one sentence, one phrase, and one word that are most meaningful.

## ALTERNATIVES

- · Instead of sentence strips, have a facilitator guide a conversation as first a sentence is shared by each, then a phrase and a word. Record the phrase and word on chart paper. The group shares insights about the document.
- · In either alternative use summarizing insights or selection of final sentence, phrase, and word.

## TIPS

- · When working with a large group, divide into clusters of about six, allowing the small groups to share results.

## Triad Inquiry

Explore and Discover

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Select, interpret, paraphrase, and analyze/categorize.

## PROCESS

- · Trios read and highlight first section of text.
- · Person A says, 'A key point for me is\_\_\_.'
- · Person B pauses and then paraphrases.
- · Person C pauses and then asks, 'What are some things that make that important to you?'
- · Rotate roles and continue process with remaining sections.

## VARIATIONS

- · Person C scripts the paraphrase for later analysis.

## TIPS

- · Connect the two purposes-conversations about data and skills practice.

## Trios PPPI (Pause, Paraphrase, Pause, Inquire)

Organize and Integrate

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Recognize, interpret, and construct skills practice (paraphrasing).

## PROCESS

- · Letter off A and B and C.
- · Each reads a section of text.

- · A reads the text selection aloud.
- · B pauses and paraphrases.
- · C pauses and inquires.
- · Repeat the pattern alternating roles.

## VARIATIONS

A can share a key idea, B can pause and paraphrase, C can pause and inquire.

## TIPS

- · Encourage A to choose one of the productive areas for inquiry such as: personal meaning, values, goals, consequences, examples, counter-examples, applications.

## Two Sides of the Coin

Self-management

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Manage one's inner states during discourse.

## PROCESS

- · Direct members to write one word on a 3 × 5 card indicating how they want to feel at the end of this meeting.
- · Next, on the other side of the card, members write a short phrase or 'self-talk' that they will use to guide their choices and attain their outcomes.
- · In small groups and in round-robin fashion (one speaker at a time with no responses or comments from others) members share side one of their cards.
- · Next, in round-robin fashion (one speaker at a time with no responses or comments from others) members share side two of their cards.

## TIPS

- · After  about  an  hour,  invite  members  to  examine  their  cards  and  in  small  groups,  report  in round-robin fashion (one speaker at a time with no responses or comments from others) their goal, strategy and current progress.
- · At the end of the day, members may, in small groups, reflect on their strategies, outcomes, and transferable learning.

## Vocabulary Review

Organize and Integrate

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Recall.

## PROCESS

- · Ask individuals to brainstorm and list words they've learned in the work so far. The words can be new or have new meanings as a result of their learning. The more words the better. Participants should try to think of words others might not remember.

- · After a few minutes instruct participants to stand up, take their list and a pencil with them, and share their list with one other person.
- · For every word that one person has on their list that the other does not, a point gets tallied. After sharing lists with one person, participants continue sharing until time is called.
- · At the end of ten to fifteen minutes, participants sit down and tally their points.
- · Share at the table and determine who at the table collected the most points. (Do not ask for a table total.)
- · Survey the room by asking each table to identify the person with the most points.
- · Acknowledge the highest point person and ask them to identify the words on their list that received the most points.

## VARIATIONS

- · Provide a small prize to the winner.

## TIPS

- · If more than one person in the room has close to the same number of points, acknowledge all of them.
- · Be sure to emphasize that the brainstorm includes both new words and words that have new meanings.

## What Comes Up

Organize and Integrate

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Investigate, compare, and apply instructional concepts to student work.

## PROCESS

- · Arrange six to twenty people seated in a circle with two or three pieces of recent student work.
- · Presenter offers first piece of student work (read or posted or copies distributed). Participants review.
- · Presenter asks, 'What comes up for you when you examine this piece of work?' Provide a few moments think time.
- · Each responds to the question in turn. No repeats.
- · Open conversation in which members compare observations, relate elements of student work to local standards, hypothesize about student thinking, and generate teaching ideas.
- · The process is repeated with a second piece of student work and perhaps a third.
- · Close the conversation with a summary of new understandings or learnings.

## TIPS

- · Allow about thirty to forty-five minutes.

1-2-6 Generate Ideas in Large Groups

<!-- image -->

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

In large groups of sixty to two hundred, engage each member in generating ideas for decision making.

## PROCESS

- · Give a written task to individuals such as, name one area we could work on this year (two minutes).
- · Pairs meet, share, and agree to one statement (six minutes).
- · Each pair meets with two other pairs, shares and agrees to one statement (twelve minutes).
- · Each group of six records their one idea on a sentence strip (eight to twelve words) and posts in the front of the room.
- · The facilitator leads an inquiry session, in which members can ask questions for clarification. Authors of the item being questioned respond.
- · Next the facilitator leads an advocacy session in which members advocate for items they feel are most important.
- · Rank ideas by using the rule of one-third (see in this appendix) to determine the few items of greatest interest to the group.
- · Name a subcommittee to gather data on these items and bring back information or recommendations on which should be persued.

## VARIATIONS

- · Have pairs converse before either inquiry or advocacy.

## TIPS

- · Individuals, not groups, should inquire, advocate, and rank.
- · See the 'Focusing Four Strategy' for details of this structure with smaller groups.

## Around the Room and Back Again

Generate Ideas with Physical Activity

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Use novelty and physical activity to energize idea generation.

## PROCESS

- · Write one response only to a prompt.
- · Next, without taking notes, move about the room and share your response, mentally cataloguing the responses of others.
- · When your head is full, or when signaled, return to your seat and list the responses you heard from others.
- · Next, table groups pool responses.

## TIPS

- · Connect the prompt to something being studied (e.g., things that go wrong in meetings) and refer back to the pooled list during the presentation.

## Brainstorm

Safely Generate Ideas

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Collective creativity without debate.

## PROCESS

- · Members call out ideas while a recorder charts them.

## VARIATIONS

- · Post topics or questions on charts.
- · Cluster members into groups of three to five and have each group stand before a chart with a marker color that is different from other groups.
- · Each group calls out ideas that are recorded on the charts.
- · Each group moves clockwise to the next chart, reviews what the previous group(s) has written, and adds ideas with the color pen with which they first recorded.
- · Members take a gallery walk to read all posted ideas.

## HISTORY AND WARNING

- · Brainstorming was invented in 1984 by Alex Osborne who theorized that a squad could generate more ideas than individuals by 'storming' the objective without criticism of others' ideas. More recent studies have found that free association activities without dissent lead to mostly predictable ideas and that imagination can be stimulated by conflict. A 2003 study by Nemeth at the University of California at Berkley found that teams encouraged to debate brainstormed ideas generated 20 percent more ideas than those that withheld criticism. This does not mean that traditional brainstorming processes should not be used. On the contrary, most people are more creative when working in teams. Familiar brainstorming processes provide voice, they

start  projects  from  members'  concerns  and  information,  therefore  representing  a  vital  stage in collaborative work. See 'Brainstorm and Critique' for a brainstorming format that safely includes criticism.

## TIPS

- · Stress that brainstorming means that there is no talking about the items, but rather the groups are to just list items. Even mature groups tend to forget this.

## Brainstorm Modalities

Safely Generate Ideas

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Collective creativity on a topic using modalities as a lens.

## PROCESS

- · Define the subject.
- · Give everyone a minute or two to think.
- · Invite members to call out ideas.
- · A member records ideas on flip chart.
- · Code the first ten ideas as either visual, auditory, or kinesthetic.
- · Compute a ratio for each modality.
- · Brainstorm again, focusing on the least represented modality.

## VARIATIONS

- · Use paired conversations for think time.
- · Have pairs or small groups brainstorm; code and brainstorm again instead of working as a full group.

## TIPS

- · Explain that considering the topic from the least used perspective will bring fresh ideas to the surface.

## Brainstorm Questions

Safely Generate Ideas for Inquiry

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Develop lenses for inquiry.

## PROCESS

- · Define the subject.
- · Give everyone a minute or two to think.
- · Invite members to call out questions.
- · A member records questions on flip chart.
- · Categorize the questions and determine what information is needed and how it might be gathered.

## VARIATIONS

- · Use paired conversations for think time.
- · Have the work done in pairs or small groups.
- · Precede the activity with dialogue.

## TIPS

- · Explain that generating questions can illuminate the group's work.

## Brainstorm and Critique

Generate Ideas

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Enrich idea generation with psychologically safe critiques.

## PROCESS

- · Instruct the group of brainstorming research (see chapter 6 and 'History and Warnings' under the brainstorm strategy). Brainstorming as commonly practiced has been found to be only partially effective, asserts Paulus (2000). Researchers find that idea generation and idea quality increases when after traditional brainstorming, members individually study the list thinking of downsides or alternatives.
- · Define the subject.
- · Give everyone a minute or two to think.
- · Brainstorm in which members call out ideas without commenting or questioning other items on the list.
- · Provide time in which members silently critique items, and then share and discuss.

## ALTERNATIVES

- · Instruct trios to offer critiques, downsides or counter arguments for as many ideas as possible within a time frame (twelve to fifteen minutes), report, and process by full groups.
- · Arrange the recording sheets in such a way that small groups can move to the sheets and record their ideas.
- · Use the rule of one-third to identify the top few ideas. Critique these.

## Carousel Interview

Generate Information About a Group

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Survey and explore a group's concerns or interests.

## PROCESS

- · Prepare interview-recording sheets, one for each question.
- · Groups of six, each person with one question.
- · Round 1-write a response to your own question in the top space.

- · Round 2-1 and 2 interview each other; 3 and 4 interview each other, 5 and 6 interview each other.
- · Round 3-1 and 3; 2 and 5; 4 and 6.
- · Round 4-1 and 4; 2 and 6; 3 and 5.
- · Round 5-1 and 5; 2 and 4; 3 and 6.
- · Round 6-1 and 6; 2 and 3, 4 and 5.
- · Join others with the same question. Share the responses and create a synthesizing statement. Be prepared to share your statement with the large group.

## VARIATIONS

- · Groups of four, each person with own question.
- · Have groups create a graphic to share with the large group, rather than a statement.

## TIPS

- · Provide recording page for each question, six spaces on each page.
- · Make sure questions are open-ended and varied.

## In and Out of the Frame

Generate Information Key to Planning or Problem Solving

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Identify and explore frames of reference other groups and members of this group may be holding.

## PROCESS

- · Form groups of four to six persons.
- · Stand before charts showing large rectangle.
- · Group members brainstorm associations with the topic. Use only one pen color.
- · Stop. Categorize the brainstormed items. Record categories in the top portion of chart.
- · Assign each group another frame of reference as a lens, based on other perspectives that might need to be considered such as parents, students, community members, etc.
- · With a new pen color, circle the ideas in the frame that this new group might have named had they been present.
- · Below the frame add ideas this new group might have added.
- · Reflect. Ask, 'How might knowledge of these other perspectives influence planning and action on the topic under consideration?'

## TIPS

- · Use to plan new initiatives.
- · Think about this framing map as a way of anticipating different perceptions and using knowledge of those perceptions in communicating, planning, and action.

## Paired Verbal Fluency (see also under Activate and Engage)

Generate Ideas

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Primes the pump for full group conversation.

## PROCESS

- · Form pairs.
- · Describe the process:
- ∘ A and B will take turns responding to a prompt asking for ideas on a topic.
- ∘ At a signal, one will speak and one will listen.
- ∘ At a signal, the other will speak while the first speaker listens.
- ∘ Each time, no one is allowed to repeat anything that was said by the other.
- ∘ Check for clarification.
- · Repeat the cycle two or three times:
- ∘ First round sixty seconds each.
- ∘ Second round forty seconds each.
- ∘ Third round twenty seconds each.

## VARIATIONS

- · Prompts might ask for solutions, concerns, assumptions.

## Pyramid

Find Common Elements in Member Thinking

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Give individual input to develop group thinking.

## PROCESS

- · Give a written task to individuals.
- · Pairs meet and share common elements.
- · Quartets meet and share common elements.
- · Octets meet and share common elements with large group.
- · The work of the octets can be charted for large group processing.

## TIPS

- · It is difficult for groups larger than eight to find common elements. If there is lack of consensus when charts are shared with the large group, time for dialogue should be scheduled.

## Sensing Interviews

Generate Information Key to Planning or Problem Solving

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Learn about the culture of a work group: its pride, perceived problems, and recommendations.

## PROCESS

- · Arrange for thirty-minute confidential interviews with affected individuals.
- · Advise that sources of information will remain confidential, but if the same idea is heard from three or more people it will be shared with the full group without identifying authors.
- · Ask: 'What are you feeling good about here? What problems exist? What recommendations do you have?'
- · Organize the data and 'publish' it with the full group. Display ideas on flip charts.
- · Ask if you got the information right in order to start conversation about the data.
- · Paraphrase and inquire as members offer 'corrections' to the data. If appropriate, change the text on the flip charts.

## VARIATIONS

- · Publish the data in text for pairs to read and explore before full group conversation.
- · Share the data with the leader; the leader shares the data and his or her analysis with the group.
- · Facilitator might engage in 'Public Coaching' with the leader.

## TIPS

- · Have small groups talk about the data if comments are not easily forthcoming; then engage the full group in conversation.
- · Use when entering a new group as a leader or when problems exist within a group, but information is not being shared about it.

## Stem Completion

Explore and Discover

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Generate and report a group's perceptions of itself.

## PROCESS

- · Members complete a thought from a prompt. For example: 'I believe my culture affects my coworkers by . . .' or 'In order to be more inclusive we should . . .'
- · Pairs or small groups share and explore meanings from responses to the prompts.
- · Small groups summarize and report.

## VARIATIONS

- · Change groups and share again.

## TIPS

- · Select stems that would be psychologically safe for members to talk about.

## Stir the Classroom

Recover Ideas and Concepts

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Recall, discern, integrate, and report information.

## PROCESS

- · Arrange group members around the perimeter of the room in groups of four.
- · Number off one to four in each cluster.
- · Clusters respond to prompt.
- · At a signal, one member moves to the next cluster to bring information from the home group and learn information from the new group.
- · Repeat the pattern with new prompts for the new group.

## VARIATIONS

- · Conduct the strategy with clusters seated at tables instead of standing.
- · Can also be used to review learned material-prompts would include recall, apply, and assess questions.

## TIPS

- · Draw from a deck of playing cards to randomly select the next person in each group to move.
- · Benefits wane after three or four rounds.

## Dialogue Discuss ~Decide

The term discourse with origins in Middle English (denoting the process of reasoning) encompasses both dialogue and discussion. While the outcome of discussion is decision; the processes of discussing and deciding are distinct. For example; in discussing one may compare features of a program; is deciding, one chooses one over the other in part from what was learned in the comparisons. We have clustered the three functions of 'dialogue; discuss and decide under the broad category of discourse.

## Discourse

Activate and Engage

Process Text and Information

Generate Ideas

Dialogue

Discuss

Decide

Plan

Summarize

Ask for Sabotage Ideas

Test Commitments

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Achieve realistic commitments.

## PROCESS

- · State the agreement the group has made.
- · Say, 'I know none of you would ever deliberately sabotage this agreement, but if you were to, under what conditions might you make that choice?'

## VARIATIONS

- · Ask pairs or small groups to talk about this question.

## TIPS

- · Brings to the surface hidden reservations or unconsciously held conditions under which members would not keep an agreement.
- · This  data  provides  an  opportunity  to  clarify  misunderstandings,  develop  ideas  to  overcome perceived obstacles, or reshape the decision.

## Assumptions Inquiry

Test Ideas for Workability

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Push beyond first easy and simple solutions.

## PROCESS

- · Participants set aside two to four 'good ideas' from a generated list.
- · Each idea is explored for conditions in which the idea would be productive and conditions in which it would be counterproductive.
- · Discuss how good ideas are rarely rules, but instead represent principles.

## VARIATIONS

- · Use the process above to select ideas that address the needs of the group.

## TIPS

- · Especially when the group has generated the idea list, stress that this is not a right or wrong conversation.

## Assumptions Wall

Locate Assumptions Sources

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Understand own and others' assumptions on a topic.

## PROCESS

- · Individuals list assumptions about a topic.
- · Have participants choose one that most informs their behavior.
- · Participants write their choice on sentence strip in eight to twelve words.
- · Post assumptions on wall.

- · Facilitator models inquiry (approachable voice, plurals, invitational stems, and positive presuppositions) and inquiry categories (importance, under what conditions, source, data, beliefs, values). For example: 'I'm curious about that assumption. Whose is it? Help me understand what may be some reasons you value that highly.'
- · Individuals inquire about posted assumptions in round-robin fashion.

## VARITIONS

- · The group lists assumptions related to a topic. One to three assumptions are selected. The group makes inquiries about these assumptions. The group then identifies implications of the selected assumptions.

## TIPS

- · Use groups of four to six.
- · Caution the group not to beat to death the first assumption explored.
- · Model approachable voice.
- · Intervene and correct whenever the inquiry begins to sound like interrogation and disbelief.

## Card Stack and Shuffle

Clarify and Understand Members' Thinking

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Identify implications of assumptions.

## PROCESS

- · Participants complete two stems, such as 'Good student writers . . .' and 'Good teachers of writing . . .'
- · Each response is written on a separate 3 × 5 card.
- · Table groups, stack cards, and shuffle them. Pass them to the table on your right.
- · Person 'A' selects a card and reads it to the group.
- · Members identify possible assumptions related to the response on the card.
- · Group members then explore the implications of those assumptions.
- · Repeat the pattern with 'B,' 'C,' and 'D' drawing cards in turn.

## VARIATIONS

- · Use only one stem.
- · Preface this activity with instruction about assumptions and implications.

## TIPS

- · Demonstrate drawing a card and eliciting assumptions.
- · Demonstrate exploring implications of one of those assumptions.
- · Encourage paraphrasing and inquiring.
- · This can be a scaffold for dialogue.

## Causal Loop Diagram

Recognize that the Way a Problem Is Defined Can Be the Source of the Problem

## PURPOSES AND INTENTIONS

Examine underlying values, beliefs, and goals when repeated attempts at resolution are unsuccessful.

## PROCESS

- · Advise members that:
- ∘ In single-loop learning groups modify their actions according to the difference between expected and obtained outcomes.
- ∘ In double\_loop learning groups question the values, assumptions, and policies that led to the actions in the first place.
- · Identify and list the intended and unintended results of an action.
- · Identify and list the mismatches between intentions and outcome.
- · Through dialogue, question ways in which the framing of the problem, assumptions, values, and policies might have affected the outcome.

## TIPS

- · This can be an appropriate time to talk about other language forms such as using 'and' instead of 'but' when responding to a previous speaker. 'But' conveys the message that the previous speaker was wrong.

<!-- image -->

## Corners

Reveal Preferences

## PURPOSES AND INTENTIONS

Identify, make public, and process members' preferences.

## PROCESS

- · Post labels in corners of room.
- · Participants move to corner of greatest interest.
- · Form clusters of two or three. Ask participants to explore and share their reasoning for selecting this topic.

## VARIATIONS

- · Can also use three or five 'corners/locations' instead of four.
- · After a period of time, instruct people to move to the corner of their second choice and repeat the sharing in clusters of two or three.
- · Ask people to stand in the corner that represents their position on an issue.

## TIPS

- · Learning is enhanced when participants identify interests within a topic.

## ALTERNATIVES

- · Use corners to represent different levels of agreement with a proposal.

## Delve and Dialogue

Text-based Learning

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Deepen understanding of concepts and others through a structured dialogue.

## PROCESS

- · Read a selection of text and make connections to some aspect of your work.
- · In groups, share some of your connections.
- · Honor the spirit of inquiry with pausing, paraphrasing, and posing questions.

## VARIATIONS

- · Assign this to trios instead of a group.

## TIPS

- · Review principles of dialogue prior to starting this process.
- · Because speaking, not listening, is a common default pattern, you may want to periodically stop the action and ask people to notice what is happening in the conversation, or engage them in the Round Robin Reflection described in this appendix.

## Energy Sources Team Survey

Self-assessment

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Self-monitor and self-modify five group energy sources.

## PROCESS

- · Team members individually respond to questions about their team.
- · Tabulate scores for each Energy Source for each person.
- · Use the data to dialogue about its meaning.

## VARIATIONS

- · Use either an electronic version or paper version.
- · It may be useful to calculate a mean, median, and mode.
- · Use the instrument in a prescriptive manner to determine what actions might be taken to increase certain Energy Sources in the group.

## TIPS

- · Emphasize the data is non-evaluative and serves as baseline impressions.
- · Use the data to dialogue about its meaning.
- · Consider the strengths of the group as well as discrepancies.
- · It is particularly useful to do item analysis.
- · When items are considered, they become sources of understanding for goal setting.
- · Copies and scoring can be purchased at www.thinkingcollaborative.com.

## First Turn/Last Turn

Dialogue Scaffold

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

This scaffold for dialogue enlists many cognitive and affective skills necessary for dialogue. This activity  requires  cognitive,  emotional,  and  social  skills  including  turn-taking,  self-management, comprehension, interpretation, application, relating, integrating, metacognition, and appreciation of others.

## PROCESS

- · Form groups of four to eight.
- · Silently and simultaneously, members read a section of text and highlight three to four items that have particular meaning for them.
- · Facilitator names a person to start in each group.
- · In turn, members share one of their items but do not comment on it. They simply name it.
- · In round-robin fashion, group members comment about the identified item WITH NO CROSS TALK.
- · The initial  person  who  named  the  item  now  shares  his  or  her  thinking  about  the  item,  and therefore, gets the 'last turn.'
- · Repeat the pattern around the table.

## VARIATIONS

- · When possible, have members read the text before coming to the meeting. When they have read prior to the meeting, allow three to four minutes for them to 'review' what they marked. This can save face for those who forgot to read.
- · Reading sources can include journal articles, policy statements, mission statements, a sample of student work, or original writing by members on a common topic.

## TIPS

- · Select the first speaker geographically (e.g., the person sitting with their back most directly against that wall). Selection that is both structured and random can interrupt problematic patterns that occur in group dynamics, such as having one person always be the first responder.
- · Stress that there is no cross talk. Explain that when cross talk occurs, it takes the focus off the speaker, changes the topic, diminishes the speaker's influence, and interferes with listening.
- · Explain that structured dialogue allows members to develop the emotional skills and values needed for high-quality dialogue. This experiential learning will serve as a scaffold as participants learn to dialogue.
- · Monitor and intervene when cross talk occurs as groups begin.
- · Groups of six are ideal, sometimes four as a first experience.

## Here's What, So What, Now What

Data Analysis

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Move beyond data to implications.

## PROCESS

- · Distribute a three-column worksheet.
- · Explain the purpose of each column: Here's What Is for specific data the group is working with; So What Is for an interpretation or meaning of the data; Now What can be a predication, implication or question for further study.

## VARIATIONS

- · Structure the task to provide skills practice in paraphrasing and posing questions.

## TIPS

- · Provide an example and elaborate a response for each column.
- · Provide specific Here's What data such as '60 percent of female students scored X while 40 percent of male students scored Y,' or have groups generate their own data for this column.
- · In pairs or in small groups, members complete the Now What and So What columns.
- · Conduct a full group dialogue.

## Inside Outside Circle (Spenser Kagan)

Explore and Extend Ideas

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

In the spirit of dialogue, small groups augment concepts.

## PROCESS

- · Form inner circle facing outward and outer circle facing inward with one-to-one correspondence.

- · Provide a prompt such as 'Students in grade six should be able to . . .' or 'We could enhance student's sense of belonging by . . .'
- · Inner circle persons generate a response.
- · Outer circle persons paraphrase and extend the idea.
- · Outer circle people rotate clockwise three or four persons.
- · Outer circle people respond to the same prompt, while the inner circle paraphrases and extends.
- · Repeat the pattern with another prompt, if desired.
- · Have members be seated and respond to the prompt 'We are learning . . .'

## VARIATIONS

- · If space does not permit one large set of circles, run activity in more than one circle.
- · Use to review or refine other skills such as pausing or posing questions to specify thinking.
- · Use as a preface to extended dialogue.

## TIPS

- · Demonstrate the double circle configuration with eight participants.

## Left-Hand Column (Chris Argyris)

Self-assessment

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Increase awareness of personal assumptions, thoughts, and feelings that govern one's thinking and contribute to blocking hearing others.

## PROCESS

- · During dialogue, members maintain a split-sheet format for recording items in either a right- or left-hand column.
- · Record in the right-hand column data or ideas one wants to remember.
- · Record in the left-hand column what one notices about self-talk and reactions to the conversation.
- · Examples include, what I need to set aside in my listening in order to stay present; what are my intentions; what are my judgments; what am I feeling in the moment, and is the feeling evoked by a correct interpretation of the interaction, or am I responding to 'noise in my head' or personal history in some way; what are my assumptions; what can I learn about me from my reactions.

## ALTERNATIVES

- · Provide members with two-column recording sheets with prompts in the left-hand column like assumptions, feelings, judgments, and supportive data.

## TIPS

- · Invite members to keep right-hand column, then reflect together on what they learned about themselves and dialogue.

## Round-Robin Reflection

Self-assessment and Self-modification

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Discover thoughts, feelings, and internal talk influencing participation.

## PROCESS

- · At a stopping point or at the end of the meeting the facilitator asks, 'What were some of the decisions you made about when and how to participate, and what were some of the effects of those decisions on you and the group?'
- · Members reflect privately.
- · In round-robin fashion, each member shares one decision and the effects of the decision.

## VARIATIONS

- · During the round-robin the facilitator paraphrases and inquires: 'How did the effects of your decision compare to what you intended?' 'How might this be a pattern for you?' 'What might be some ways you can apply this learning to future meetings?'
- · Pairs share instead of full group.
- · Journal writing only.

## TIPS

- · Be clear that the prompt refers to decisions about participation, not the meeting content.
- · Members  self-direct  performance  improvements  through  this  process  faster  and  more  permanently  than  having  process  observers  report  participant  behaviors.  Teams  become  more accomplished.

## Success Analysis

Reflection on Practice

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Gain insights into improving practice.

## PROCESS

- · In advance of the meeting, participants develop notes describing an area where they are finding success or making progress.
- · In the meeting, participants share their 'case studies' of successful work with a student or with a group of students.
- · In round-robin fashion, members share while colleagues take notes.
- · Next, colleagues paraphrase, then ask questions of clarification seeking specificity related to the presenter's language such as, 'When you said 'those students,' to which ones were you referring?'
- · Next, colleagues paraphrase then ask questions seeking elaboration such as, 'How did you know to move on at that point?' or 'What is your sense of the most catalytic decision you made?' or 'What are some learnings you are taking from this situation?'
- · Next, colleagues offer thoughts and ideas while presenter takes notes without responding.

- · Finally, the presenter initiates conversation with colleagues inquiring more deeply about their thoughts.
- · After the last round, the group summarizes what was learned and what can be applied from this session.

## VARIATIONS

- · Use this process for events that were not successful.
- · Use with trios.

## TIPS

- · A total round for one person should take about thirty minutes.
- · Use small groups of three to six members.
- · Expressed  judgments,  positive  or  negative,  are  more  threatening  than  data  or  open-ended, nonjudgmental questions.

## Discourse

## Discuss

To discuss is to talk about something with a group. Synonyms include converse, confer, exchange views, and deliberate. Its Latin root is discussus for struck asunder, or shaken. In organizations, discussions lead to decisions and are properly preceded by dialogues in which the purpose is to build understanding.

## Appoint a Devil's Advocate (Doyle and Straus)

Hear Differing Views

## PURPOSE AND INTENTION

Break 'Group Think.'

Many people will not speak out at meetings for fear of retribution, low group trust, or just the fear of looking stupid. As a result 'group think' becomes the norm and poor decisions result. By appointing a devil's advocate, you give official permission for raising differing views.

## PROCESS

- · For each issue discussed, appoint the role of 'devil's advocate' with the function of offering differing views.
- · Rotate this role. Change for each topic or meeting.
- · At the end of the meeting explore the effects this role had on group thinking and make revisions if necessary, for the next time the role is used.

## Close the Discussion

Clarify and Flexibility

## PURPOSE AND INTENTION

Members are clear about when a discussion is to be closed.

## PROCESS

- · Person in charge displays decision options:
- ∘ Participants can vote on whether to keep discussion going or not.
- ∘ Person in charge decides whether to end the discussion or extend it.
- ∘ Everyone gets one more chance to make a point.
- ∘ Continue the discussion, but limit it to a specific topic.
- ∘ Close the discussion if someone calls for closure and two others agree.
- ∘ Delegate the decision making to a subgroup.
- ∘ Talk until a predetermined time limit has been reached. Person in charge makes an executive decision if group hasn't decided by then.
- · Members explore advantages and drawbacks of each option.
- · Group selects an option to use on a regular basis.

## VARIATIONS

- · Group selects a few options for consideration when approaching a decision.

TIPS

- · The goal is efficiency, consistency, clarity, and flexibility.

## Criteria Matrix

Group Decision

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Decisions based on identified values.

## PROCESS

- · Identify a decision you wish to make and the alternatives you are considering.
- · Identify the criteria you consider important.
- · Assign each criterion an importance score.
- · Determine the extent to which each alternative poses each criterion.
- · Express as High, Medium, or Low.
- · Assign number values such as High = 3, Medium = 2, and Low = 1.
- · Record on criteria matrix and analyze scores to see which alternative has the highest total points.
- · Based on your reaction to the selected alternative, determine next steps.

## ALTERNATIVES

- · Assign point value to each criterion if some are more important than others.

## TIPS

- · Group needs only rough agreement on High, Medium, and Low ratings.
- · Should two alternatives appear to be equally desirable, add other criteria.

| Criterion                                           | Alt. A   | Alt. B   | Alt. C   |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Available resources                                 | H        | H        | H        |
| Could serve as stimulus to an- other desired change | H        | M        | M        |
| Staff readiness                                     | M        | L        | L        |
| Congruence with Prog. X                             | M        | L        | M        |
| Numerical Values                                    | 10       | 7        | 8        |

## Decision Options

Clarify Decision Authority and Strategy

## PROCESS

- · Executive decision:
- ∘ Clarify whether the group's function is to inform or to recommend.
- ∘ Announce when decision will be made and the manner in which it will be communicated to the group.
- · Fallback position:
- ∘ Limit group decision making time.
- ∘ Define a decision process if group cannot decide within allotted time.
- · Subgroup decision:
- ∘ Clarify whether subgroup will be bringing back a decision or a recommendation.
- ∘ Provide decision parameters.

## VARIATIONS

- · Specify the decision-making strategy to be used. (See 'Criteria Matrix' in this appendix.)

TIPS

- · Select an option before discussion begins.

## Disagreement Grid

Disagree Agreeably

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Members can disagree respectfully.

## PROCESS

- · Ask participants  to  participate  in  the  next  activity  as  a  warm-up  to  conversations  in  which diverse opinions are held.
- · Draw a four-by-four grid on a chart. Ask participants to assume that each square is equal in dimension to the other squares.
- · Ask participants how many squares they see.
- · As each number is offered, write it on the chart margin without comment.
- · After  several  numbers  are  recorded,  stop.  Ask,  'Who  saw  (one  of  the  higher  numbers  of squares)? Would you please explain to the group where you see these squares?'
- · Mark on the grid as a member explains what they see.
- · Ask: 'Was the person who said sixteen wrong? Seventeen? Twenty-four?'
- · Addressing the whole group, say, 'As we move into the conversation that follows, let me suggest that when you have a difference of opinion you say, 'I see it a different way.''

## TIPS

- · This can be an appropriate time to talk about other language forms that can be used when disagreement occurs. Suggest participants use the word 'and' which implies addition, instead of 'but' which implies the first speaker is wrong.

## Focusing Four

Achieve Agreement

(See Garmston, Dolcemascolo (2009) The Focusing Four: A Consensus Seeking Activity For Prioritizing: DVD Viewers Guide. www.thinkingcollaborative.)

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Each member feels heard, understood, and contributes to decision.

## PROCESS

- · Explain task, topic and process.
- · Check for understanding.
- · Brainstorm ideas and record on chart paper.
- · Push for between twelve and eighteen ideas.
- · Next, members ask questions of clarification. The 'author' responds.
- · Next members advocate for items.
- · Finally, use the rule of one-third to determine which items are of greatest interest to the group. Use a hand count. (See p. 261 for details)
- · Conclude by determining a process to narrow the choices down to one or two if necessary. See 'Close the Discussion' options in this appendix.

## VARIATIONS

- · Occasionally have partners confer before a new step in the process begins.

## TIPS

- · Each step in the process must be kept separate.
- · Statements of advocacy must be stated in the positive, as in, 'I advocate for this because . . .' and never 'I don't like this because . . .'
- · Tell group they will be guided, not bound by the numbers. For example, in a group of fifteen members, item A gets nine counts and item B gets eleven; that may not be a sufficient enough difference to select B. In cases like this, the facilitator will ask the group how it wants to handle the situation.
- · See a detailed description of this process in the 'Adaptive Schools Syllabus,' useful for instructing groups.

## Gatekeeping

Invite Participation

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Open opportunities for quiet members to speak

## PROCESS

- · A member notices that a colleague has not talked.
- · The member says, 'Booker, I'm aware you have not talked for a while. Is there anything you would like to add?'

## VARIATIONS

- · 'Monica, I know you served on a committee addressing this. Do you have anything you'd like to say?' or 'What might you like to add?'
- · 'Ken, from where I'm sitting, your eyebrows look furrowed. What comments might you like to add?'

## TIPS

- · Phrase the questions so that the colleague can gracefully decline to speak.

## Issues Agenda

Identify Issues

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Illuminating issues

## PROCESS

- · Brainstorm issues related to a project.
- · Dialogue on degrees of importance, desirable attention sequences, and connections.
- · Develop and agree to a timeline.

## ALTERNATIVES

- · After brainstorming, develop a criteria matrix (appendix A) to analyze importance and attention sequences.
- · An issues agenda can be conducted informally focused only on topics to be addressed during the current meeting.

## TIPS

- · Remind  members  of  brainstorming  guidelines.  Even  experienced  groups  may  forget  these without a reminder.

## Jigsaw Carousel

Information Processing: Exploring and Discovering

## PROCESS

- · Form groups, one for each concept (ex: If working with four concepts, will need four groups).
- · Each group describes a concept in its own words.
- · Give behavioral examples: what they would see and hear as indicators of this concept.
- · Have table groups identify and describe situations in school, life, or work in which it would be important to draw on this concept.
- · Pose questions intended to help others become aware of this concept in their life or work.
- · Have table groups create a logo or simile as a reminder for this concept (e.g., 'Complete the simile: This concept is like a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ because\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_').
- · Compose a brief statement or slogan that summarizes the concept.
- · Report work to full assembly.

## TIPS

- · Provide an advance organizer for the entire process.
- · Have each member be responsible for learning one concept and then teaching it to others.

## Lasso (Doyle and Straus)

Language Specificity

## PURPOSE AND INTENTION

Members gain clarity on terms.

## PROCESS

- · Circle or lasso words on flip chart that lack specificity.
- · Invite members to define the words within the context of the group's work.
- · Ex. 'How to solve drug use at schools.' Ask what do you mean by drugs, which ones, which schools,  what  age  levels,  and  even  what  do  you  mean  by  solve:  reduce,  eliminate  entirely, prevent, etc.

## ALTERNATIVES

- · Ask pairs or small groups to define the words and report out for group reinforcement or adoption.
- · Record the definitions on chart paper.

## TIPS

- · Classes of language most useful to question for specificity: vague nouns or pronouns; vague verbs  or  action  words;  universal  quantifiers  like  all,  everyone,  never;  modal  operators  like must, have to, can't; and comparators like better, worse, greater.

- · As a general rule, clarify vague nouns and pronouns first.
- · If there is an 'and' in the definition, make sure you are not trying to solve two problems at once.

## Naïve Question-(also a group member strategy)

Direct Topic or Process Back on Track

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Members influence group's fidelity to meeting standards (one process at time, one topic at a time, clarity about decision making, etc.). (See chapter 4.)

## PROCESS

- · A group member asks a naïve question to which the group responds. Examples are: Who is making this decision? How much detail do we need to move this item? What parts of this issue live in our area of responsibility? Who will do what by when? And is there something we are not talking about?

## VARIATIONS

- · The facilitator says to the group: 'Given what you know about meeting standards, what seems to be going on right now?'

## TIPS

- · A naïve question is one asked with innocence, a desire to know, and in a melodic approachable voice. This is a powerful way for group members to offer corrections to group work.

## Set and Test Working Agreements

Generate and Adhere to Agreements

## PURPOSE AND INTENTION

Members influence group process.

## PROCESS

- · A group member says, 'I notice that our meetings are not starting on time. Could we make an agreement to start on time? (Set agreement.)
- · The facilitator leads a conversation in which the group develops an agreement.
- · In a later meeting a group member says, 'I'd like to talk about the agreement we made to start our meetings on time. I notice we are not doing it. What needs to happen to keep our agreement?' (Test agreement.)
- · The facilitator leads a conversation in which the group develops an agreement.

## VARIATIONS

- · A group member requests this topic be placed on the agenda.

## TIPS

- · This relates to the group member capability-know when to self-assert and when to integrate.

## Setting Group Working Agreements

Establish Ground Rules

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Member ownership of working agreements.

## PROCESS

- · Sometimes, when a group is beginning a long-term relationship, invite the group to develop their own working agreements.
- · Brainstorm and record possible agreements.
- · Clarify brainstormed items.
- · Select the five to seven most important to group success.
- · Post these at each meeting or place on each printed agenda.
- · Later, should members stray from an agreement, the facilitator or a member intervenes.

## ALTERNATIVES

- · For mature groups this might convey negative attitudes about the group's capacity. When this is so, or when a group is working well, do not use this.
- · For ad hoc groups suggest a set of predetermined working agreements such as demonstrate mutual success, employ skillful listening, develop sufficient consensus, and ask if the group is willing to adopt them. Define each set of terms.

## Thumbs-Up

Poll the Group

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Dip-stick group sentiment.

## PROCESS

- · The facilitator or any member can call for a thumbs-up to determine the degree of agreement the group has on an item.
- · Thumbs up means yes, thumbs down means no, thumbs held sideways means not sure or it doesn't matter.
- · Call for a show of thumbs.
- · Announce the result.

## VARIATIONS

- · Use as a poll to learn what direction/thinking the group is favoring prior to further conversation.
- · Use as a mechanism for sufficient consensus.

## TIPS

- · Ask members with thumbs held sideways to explain their reasoning.
- · Ask members with thumbs held down what would need to be modified in the proposal for them give it thumbs-up.

## Discourse

Discussions often culminate in decisions. This set of strategies is used when the leader desires that a group be involved in either recommending a decision, making a decision, or having subgroups decide and bring a decision back to the full group for approval. Decisions by vote are perceived as the least useful, and often counterproductive in that issues are often not fully explored and votes produce both winners and losers. Those who did not vote on an item typically have low commitment and motivation to follow through. Sufficient consensus is the most practical participative approach to decision making in school settings. Rarely would a group have the time to reach full or 100 percent consensus on an item, so reaching a level in which 80 percent agree is considered sufficient to move along. Critically important in this approach is that the voices of those who do not agree are heard, and they know others understand their reservations. Sufficient consensus, or full consensus for that matter, is not designed to make people happy but rather to reach a decision that represents the best feasible course of action.

This form of decision making involves everyone clearly understanding the situation at hand, analyzing  the  relevant  facts  together,  and  then  jointly  developing  solutions  that  represent  the group's best thinking about an optimal decision. Dialogue, a lot of listening, and the understanding of divergent opinions precede it. Sufficient consensus generates a decision about which everyone says, 'I can live with it.'

Participative decision-making takes longer than decisions made independently from a leader, but requires very little time in gaining acceptance by a group. Participant decision-making is used in situations in which choices affect behaviors of members; complex decisions are under consideration affecting several groups of people; and when understanding, commitment, and motivation to implement are desired.

## 100% Consensus (Bob Chadwick)

Full Consensus on Guiding Documents such as Mission Statements or Values

## PURPOSES AND INTENTIONS

Commitment of each member to adoption of a document.

## PROCESS

- · In a group of six or less, invite someone to volunteer to be a facilitator and someone to be a scribe.
- · Define the facilitator's role as calling on people and keeping the process intact. The scribe's role is to chart exactly what each person says, then make the exact corrections requested by subsequent group members.
- · The facilitator poses a question such as, What should be the role of the project leader?' or 'How shall we define completion?'
- · In round-robin fashion, members are called on to contribute one sentence which is recorded word-for-word by the scribe.

- · Before the process is complete, both the facilitator and scribe can have someone briefly take their roles while they contribute a sentence.
- · When all sentences are charted, the facilitator asks, 'Is there anyone who cannot live with this as stated?'
- · Members may raise their hand, and offer different wording for parts of the sentence. Without consultation, the scribe scratches out the original and adds the new.
- · The facilitator asks again, 'Is there anyone who cannot live with the first sentence?' The process continues until no more changes are suggested for the first sentence.
- · The facilitator repeats the process for the second sentence.
- · The process is repeated for all the remaining sentences.

## ALTERNATIVES

- · For larger groups, have subgroups work on the same task-report results to the full group, then have the scribes draft a statement containing all the words of the several versions.
- · Develop a full paragraph before editing.

## TIPS

- · Schedule a couple of hours for this strategy.
- · Don't wordsmith. Request corrections only if the corrections refine the meaning.
- · Do not 'go along' with something you are uncomfortable with.
- · This will go slow at first. About midway through it will pick up speed.

## Combine Opposites

Decisions

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Subgroups resolve impasse without audience.

## PROCESS

- · Use when the group is stuck. Ask if two sets of persons with divergent views would be willing to step outside and bring a recommendation back to the group.
- · Ask the group if this recommendation is agreeable.
- · Determine a time for the subgroup to converse. Their choices are: now, outside the meeting room, or later at a break. The only limitation is that the recommendation must be made today.
- · Clarify the subgroup's decision-making authority with the full group. Determine whether the subgroup will be making a decision by which the group will abide or bring a recommendation for group consideration.

## TIPS

- · Request or suggest that certain members serve on the committee. Asking the most impassioned voice to serve increases the likelihood of group acceptance.
- · Set a time limit for the subgroup.

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Reduce decision complexity

## PROCESS

- · Assuming members have clarified items on a list, ask, 'Are there any items you would be okay removing?'
- · When a member names an item, ask if anyone objects. If not, remove the item.
- · If there is an objection, do not remove the item. No discussion required.
- · When this process is complete, move to the next step in the decision-making process.

## TIPS

- · Explain that this process saves the group the time of talking about items in which the group has limited interest.

## Existing State-Desired State Map

Decisions

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Focus on outcomes

## PROCESS

- · Display a desired state map, as shown below.
- · Explain that defining the desired state establishes a goal and is more important than exploring why the problem exists.
- · The group names a desired state in broad terms.
- · Next develop a behavioral description. What would one see and hear when the desired state is achieved?
- · Next identify the resources needed to achieve the desired state. Consider skills, knowledge, and behavior.
- · Select the most catalytic of resources and develop a plan for developing them.

## VARIATIONS

- · Generate a description of the existing state, and then describe the desired state as a direct contrast to existing state elements.

## TIPS

- · The facilitator should preview the stages and sequence of thinking required in this approach.
- · When members do not have the same information about an issue, it is useful to describe the existing state from the various perspectives. Otherwise, public display of the existing state is rarely of great value unless using the direct contrast approach described as an alternative.

## Forced Choice Stickers I

Decisions

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Provide interactive decision-making protocol

## PROCESS

- · List options on flip chart.
- · Distribute an equal amount of stickers to each member.
- · Instruct members to spend all their stickers.
- · Members place stickers near preferred options.
- · The stickers represent a vote and are binding. See variations.

## Forced Choice Stickers II

Decisions

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Provide advocacy and interactive decision-making protocol

## PROCESS

- · Chart and post various options from which to select.
- · Invite members to stand by the chart of their first choice. Ask members to talk about why they value this option. Have each group select a spokesperson.
- · Each spokesperson gives a brief advocacy statement.
- · Entertain questions of clarification.
- · Provide each member with an equal amount of stickers.
- · Stickers are spent.

## VARIATIONS

- · The group examines sticker distribution and decides which few options should receive further consideration and conversation.
- · Post options on several flip charts. Subgroups stand by options representing their choices and tell group rationale for their choice.
- · After advocating and inquiring about members' choices, fresh stickers are distributed and spent.

## TIPS

- · Some members will want to know if they can spend all their stickers on one option. Discourage this.
- · It is acceptable to place more than one of one's stickers on an item.
- · Prior dialogue is valuable.

## Freeing Stuck Groups

Decisions

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Facilitate decision-making

## PROCESS

- · The facilitator asks, 'What's stopping us from making a decision?' or 'Who would be willing to meet with (name) and (name) and develop a proposal for the next meeting?' or 'Are you willing to give the subcommittee the authority to make that decision?' or 'Would it be agreeable to the group if we asked (name) to bring us more information before we proceed?' or 'I think this is a decision for (name). Shall we ask her to make it?'

## VARIATIONS

- · Group members can also pose these questions.
- · See 'Naïve Questions' in this appendix.
- · See 'Close the Discussion' options in this appendix.

## TIPS

- · Identify, when possible, the time available in the meeting to reach closure.

## Is/Is Not (Doyle and Straus)

Decisions

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Identify most relevant data

## PROCESS

- · In one column write the facts that are known about a problem, where it is, what its effects are, when it occurs, and so on. For example, the boys scored higher than the girls in four of the five test batteries.
- · In a second column write facts that are known to not be part of the problem. For example, boys and girls are doing equally well in daily assignments.

## VARIATIONS

- · Small groups generate is and is nots. Report and agree on the most significant examples.
- · Follow this with data gathering based on the is/is not analysis.

## TIPS

- · Provide categories for 'is': where, when, to what extent, and with whom does the problem occur?
- · Provide categories for 'is not': where, when, to what extent, and with whom does this not occur? Therefore, what might explain the pattern of occurrence and nonoccurrence?

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Eliminate decision obstacles

## PROCESS

- · The group is polarized on two options.
- · Ask if anyone can suggest a third option (C) that might contain what seems to be attractive about the first two (A and B).

## VARIATIONS

- · List desirable features of A.
- · List desirable features of B.
- · Have small groups generate options that contain the positive aspects of A and B while minimizing the negative aspects of each.

## TIPS

- · If the group remains stuck, use a criteria matrix shown in the appendix.

## Paired Weighting

Decisions

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Rank larger groups of items.

## PROCESS

- · Individuals compare each item with every other item according to importance.
- · Example: Which is more important, A as compared to B, A as compared to C, A as compared to D, etc. Then B as compared to A, B as compared to C, B as compared to D, etc.
- · Participants go through the items, comparing each pair, circling their preferences. They count up all the As, the Bs, the Cs.
- · When counting up their responses, participants count across the A line: From then on they count down and then across, starting with B in the top line and then down (counting only the circled letters); then C down and across, then D down and across, etc.

## VARIATIONS

- · You can also compare the items in reference to performance: How are we performing? Which are we performing better? A or B, A or C, A or D, etc. Then B or C, B or D, etc.-You can do either or both processes.
- · Numbered cards are thrown on the table and members scramble for their question of choice.
- · Add other summary checks for groups larger than four. Some examples might be:
- ∘ Who needs to know what happened in this meeting?
- ∘ By when are the next steps due?
- ∘ What should be highlighted in the minutes of the meeting?

## Not A or B, but C

Decisions

B =

C D E F G

D D D

## TIPS

• These processes are complicated and require a lot of time.

The recording page for participants looks something like the following:

## Rule of One-Third (Doyle and Straus)

Identify the Most Important Ideas

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Achieve agreement

## PROCESS

- · Alert the group that after sufficient items have been identified, members will be asked to pick about a third of the items they feel are most important. Explain that this will identify the items most important to the group for further analysis.
- · Use the formula one-third plus one in this way: For a list of twelve items each member would choose five. For a list of twenty items, each member would choose 8.
- · For each item on the list, the facilitator asks for a show of hands and records the number of hands on the chart, circled, in a color not yet used.
- · After counting is completed, ask the group to identify the top few items-mark these in some fashion.
- · When about a third have been identified, or at the point in which a large gap appears between two numbers as in 20, 18,16, 12 , the group will be asked if they want to include the last number (in this example 12).

## NEXT STEPS

- · Depending on the purpose for identifying high priority items, a number of options exist including: (1) accept all as in a staff development menu, (2) have a subcommittee study and return with recommendations when only one choice is to be made, (3) address the high priority items with other tools of discernment, such as pros and cons or measuring items against a list of criteria.

## TIPS

- · Explain that numbers will not make the decisions; group members will be able to advocate for an item not selected and if the group agrees, add it to the list.
- · See the video 'Focusing Four: A Consensus Seeking Activity for Prioritizing,' Robert Garmston  and  Michael  Dolcemascolo,  Denver,  Colorado  (www.thinkingcollaborative.com,  2009) for a demonstration of the entire process.

## Six-Position Straw Poll

Decisions

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Diplay proposition preferences

## PROCESS

- · Members give poll page to designated person who records the tallies on a wall chart.

## TIPS

- · If you have a lot of 5s and 6s, you should think carefully before implementing it.

## Slip Method

Decisions

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Develop 'trustworthy' data on member preferences

## PROCESS

- · Distribute a large quantity of 3 × 5 cards to each member.

- · State a problem in 'how to' language such as 'How to increase student attendance,' or 'How to support the lower quartile kids in mathematics.'
- · Members write only one idea per card.
- · Collect and categorize the cards. Discard duplicate, ambiguous, or illegible items.
- · Present and study categories and ideas.

## ALTERNATIVES

- · Use slips to prioritize items. On each slip, members record a letter for the item (A, B, C, and so on) and a number representing the priority weight they assign to it. Assuming they have twleve items, 12 would be highest weight, 11 the next highest, and 1 the lowest.
- · Slips are turned in and stacked alphabetically. The numbers for each letter are tabulated and presented to the group.

## TIPS

- · Fifteen participants should be able to generate 150 ideas.
- · Because it so mechanical and free from influence, this form of prioritizing is useful when there is low trust in the group.

## Spend a Buck

Decisions

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Reveal individual or collective choices

## PROCESS

- · Members have one hundred imaginary pennies they can distribute across a few options.
- · Explain the options.
- · Individuals decide how many pennies they will spend on each option.
- · Gather and present the data to the group.

## VARIATIONS

- · Use for individual choices rather than a collective expression of priorities.

## TIPS

- · Provide think time before members assign pennies.

## Sufficient Consensus

Decisions

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Achieve agreement

## PROCESS

- · Determine a figure-like 80 percent-that will represent sufficient consensus.
- · Keep to one process at a time.
- · Members clarify and advocate for items.
- · Members may inquire as to the reasoning of another member's choice.

- · Minority view voices must be encouraged to speak.
- · Member views can be paraphrased.
- · Call for a show of hands.
- · Announce the result.

## VARIATIONS

- · Determine what percentage will qualify as sufficient consensus in general.
- · In any meeting, an item can be singled out for even a 100 percent consensus. This should be very rare.

## TIPS

- · No member has the right to block a group.
- · Employ a guideline for members not budging from a position. Ask if this is a matter of principle or preference. If a principle, encourage dialogue; if a preference, after others understand the preference, set it aside.

## Thumbs-Up

Decisions

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Members and facilitator understand tentative degrees of agreement.

## PROCESS

- · The facilitator or any member can call for a thumbs-up to determine the degree of agreement the group has on an item.
- · Thumbs up means yes, thumbs down means no, thumbs held sideways means not sure or it doesn't matter.
- · Call for a show of hands.
- · Announce the result.

## VARIATIONS

- · Use as a poll to learn what direction/thinking the group is favoring prior to further conversation.
- · Use as a mechanism for sufficient consensus.

## TIPS

- · Ask members with thumbs held sideways to explain their reasoning.
- · Ask members with thumbs held down what would need to be modified in the proposal for them give it thumbs up.

Value Voting

Assess preferences

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Display member preferences

## PROCESS

- · Ask the group to express their response to a statement visually.
- · Show five fingers for strongly agree, four for agree, three for neutral, two for disagree, one for strongly disagree.
- · Ask each person to respond to this question on a Post-It note: 'What would it take to get me reenergized?'
- · Phrase the statements as 'I'm satisfied with the direction the group is taking,' or 'We should move forward on this initiative now.'
- · Say the number of fingers you see as you scan the group, as 3, 3, 2, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 3, 2.
- · Interpret what you see as, 'Seems to be an average of about four,' or ' I notice responses on both ends of the scale. Can members voting low share some reasons for their response and members voting high do the same thing?'

## VARIATIONS

- · Ask members to look around the room and compare what they see with the number of fingers they are displaying.

## TIPS

- · The benefit of value voting is that the responses are public, giving the group a sense of the whole.
- · Use this as a straw poll only, not a final decision-unless you see unanimous display of five fingers.

## Set and Test Working Agreements

Generate and Adhere to Agreements

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Members influence group practice.

## PROCESS

- · A group member says, 'I notice that our meetings are not starting on time Could we make an agreement to start on time?' (Set agreement.)
- · The facilitator leads a conversation in which the group develops an agreement.
- · In a later meeting a group member says, 'I'd like to talk about the agreement we made to start our meetings on time. I notice we are not doing it. What needs to happen to keep our agreement?' ( Test agreement. )
- · The facilitator leads a conversation in which the group develops an agreement.

## VARIATIONS

- · A group member requests this topic be placed on the agenda.
- · When working agreements have previously been made by the group, either the facilitator or member can call attention to agreement fidelity.

## TIPS

- · This relates to the group member capability-know when to self-assert and when to integrate.

To plan is to envision the steps necessary to reach a goal; who should be involved in what ways, and determining what time frames and materials are necessary. This collection of strategies support groups in understanding the contexts and issues about which are planning, ways of involving others and ways to assess progress they

## Accordion Planning

Receive Full Group Input in Planning

## PURPOSES AND INTENTIONS

Allow planning teams to work deeply while informing and getting feedback from the larger group at various planning stages.

## PROCESS

- · Planning team adopts a template such as define the problem, analyze causes, identity possible solutions, and implement and test solutions.
- · After each stage, planning team members work with others in the organization, informing of the team's work and seeking reaction and guidance.
- · The planning team takes into account responses from the larger group, refines that stage of their work, then repeats the process for the remaining stages up to implementation.

## VARIATIONS

- · Select different planning templates.
- · Have each team member report to a group in which they hold membership like a grade level or department.

## TIPS

- · Team members must be clear they are to think for themselves, rather than represent and only speak for the thinking of a group they are a member of.
- · Accordion planning takes longer than using a process in which a planning team does the full work, then reports to the larger group. The benefit of this form of planning that makes it worth the extra time is the degree of ownership held by other members of the organization.

## Denominalize

Render Concepts Amenable to Problem Solving

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Be  proactive  in  response  to  statements  like  'We  have  a  problem  with  communication,'  or 'There is limited trust in our group.'

## PROCESS

- · Inform a group that when verbs or adjectives have been converted into nouns, they become nominalizations. It is not possible to solve nominalizations, so for planning to start they must be denominalized.
- · Invite the group to denominalize by phrasing challenges as 'What will we see and hear ourselves doing when we are communicating more effectively? This way of stating the problem reveals the desired state about which a group can plan.

## Done-Yet to Do-Questions

Name Action Steps

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Identify and agree on what yet needs to be done.

## PROCESS

- · Regarding a group project, individual members record a list of tasks that are done, tasks that are yet to be done, and questions about getting the work done.
- · In table groups, share the information.
- · Get agreement on the next most important things to be done.

## VARIATIONS

- · Identify tasks that should be discarded if not done.
- · Run the process as a facilitated full-group activity.

## TIPS

- · Members are often so deep in the complexity of work that it is hard to see where they are and generate focus and energy for the next tasks.

## Fishbone Diagram

Planning for Technical Change

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Discover cause and effect relationships.

## PROCESS

- · Draw a fishbone diagram on chart paper as shown below.
- · Code sections of the chart that may be related to an existing condition of an issue. For tardiness, for example, getting to school, school responses to tardiness, school staff, and home might be listed.
- · Brainstorm factors that might be affecting the existing condition and record on the diagram.
- · Explore pros and cons of various combinations of solution approaches.

## ALTERNATIVES

- · Have subgroups brainstorm each of the categories and record them on a separate chart.
- · Next, report and explore the various charts. Allow additions.

## TIPS

- · Protect the group from delving into too much minutia.

## Force Field Analysis

Technical Change Planning

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Select opposing forces to weaken and favorable forces to strengthen.

## PROCESS

- · Post a T-bar chart with a topic or goal at top. In the left side, write 'forces for' and in the right side, write 'forces against.'
- · Members list forces that fall into either category.
- · Members may paraphrase or question for clarity.
- · Limit each list to about six items. Once the list is deemed complete, mark the three strongest forces on either side.
- · Explore how the forces against might be made weaker and the forces for, strengthened. This phase may take the form of dialogue.
- · Rate the forces and how feasible it would be to modify them.
- · Select one or more on which to work.

## VARIATIONS

- · Assign the first three tasks above to small work groups, then chart and post group results.
- · As a full group, entertain questions of clarification
- · Continue with the process as a full group.

## TIPS

- · Some forces may legitimately appear on either side of the chart.
- · It is usually easier to weaken the forces restraining change than it is to strengthen the helping forces.

- · Topics such as decreasing dropout rates, increasing attendance, or increasing student motivation to write might prove challenging, as their complexity exceeds this simple analysis.

## Futures Wheel

Identifying Possible Consequences

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Reveal factors to consider in planning.

## PROCESS

- · Display a futures wheel on chart paper.
- · Write the name of the innovation or idea that the group will be working with in the center of the wheel.
- · Work outward from the center to the first layer of circles.
- · Identify  two  positive  consequences  and  two  negative  consequences.  Have  the  positive  and negative be as different as possible.
- · Continue in this manner to the second layer, then the third, or fourth.
- · Dialogue about the findings. How might this information influence the perceptions and decisions of a planning team?

## VARIATIONS

- · Through this process, a need for more information may surface. Determine what is needed and how to gather it.
- · Two small groups could work on the same decision, then share results to gain greater perspective.

## TIPS

- · These are not predictions. They are possible consequences.
- · An analysis of the data may lead a group to abandon the idea.
- · An analysis of the data may inform a group of ways of implementing the idea that would avoid some negatives.
- · Use the information to learn what needs to be communicated to whom and in what ways.

## Histomap (Suzanne Bailey)

Learn from Group History

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Release emotional barriers to working toward a desired state.

## PROCESS

- · Hang chart paper on wall like a timeline.
- · Mark eras in the group's history-the year the bond issue passed, the year the new principal arrived, the loss of a federal program, etc.
- · Use icons to illustrate the different events that occurred within each of the eras.
- · Next, groups of people add words and icons to the timeline and share their memories.

## VARIATIONS

- · Organize groups randomly or as intact working groups.

## TIPS

- · When people hear about the same event from different perspectives, a more complex history is understood.
- · What is expressed and understood can be released and need not dominate the working space of the group.

## Outcome Mapping

Resolve Persistent Performance Problems

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Discover and strengthen internal resources to improve performance.

## PROCESS

- · Reveal purpose and process to group.
- · Display six columns with these headings:
- ∘ Presenting problem
- ∘ Tentative outcome
- ∘ Desired behavior of selected others
- ∘ Internal resources required to achieve desired behaviors
- ∘ Change agent strategies to build resources
- ∘ Internal resources required for change agent to perform strategies.
- · Elicit responses from group; paraphrase and record responses.
- · If  there is disagreement regarding what group members say, dialogue may be scheduled for another meeting.

## VARIATIONS

- · Facilitate the use of this map with a change agent desiring change from another group or individual.

- · Use as a group facilitation tool.
- · Direct the focus to others or to self as a group.
- · Use to explore potential strategies to promote growth for an individual.

## TIPS

- · This is task analysis work and must be followed in sequence. Intuitive leaps and leaps to solution should be set aside. We can't prescribe solutions until the exact behaviors and required resources are known.
- · Presenting problem . Don't need specific descriptors. (Ex. Don't function as a team.)
- · Tentative outcome . Don't need specific descriptors. (Ex. Uses team work.)
- · Desired behavior . State behaviorally: What, by when, how much.
- ∘ Behaviors must be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant to the larger outcome, and tactical. Tactical means the positive byproduct of the existing state can be maintained.
- ∘ Select a few behaviors, most amenable to change in the near future, for the analysis that follows.
- · Internal resources . Answers the question: 'What knowledge, skills, attitudes, or states of mind would be necessary to perform these behaviors?' The assumption is that if they were present, the behaviors would be present.
- · Change agent's  strategies .  Answers  the  question:  'What  strategies  might  the  change  agent perform in order to have the group access the required resources?'
- · Internal resources for change agent . Answers the question: 'What knowledge, skills, attitudes, or states of mind would the change agent need to have to perform identified strategies?'

## Polarity Mapping

Identify and Manage Paradoxes

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Engage members with polarized positions to look beyond one view and forge a workable way to manage the situation.

## PROCESS

- · Identify an ongoing chronic issue.
- · Identify a key polarity.
- · Agree on value neutral names for each of the poles.
- · Draw map below on chart paper.
- · Write the pole names on the map.
- · Brainstorm content for each quadrant.
- · Agree on a name for the highest purpose and deepest fear.
- · Facilitate a conversation so members can view and explore the dilemma as a whole and from various perspectives.
- · Develop strategies  for  realizing  the  upsides  of  both  poles  while  avoiding  the  downsides  of each pole.

## VARIATIONS

- · See an expanded description of Polarity Mapping in Appendix J of this book or at www.thinkingcollaborative.com.
- · See the polarity web site http://www.polaritymanagement.com/.

## TIPS

- · Naming purpose and fear integrates oppositional views and provides a reason to manage the tension between the two views.
- · Some examples of polarities are work and home, individual and team, stability and change, and independence and interdependence.
- · Empathically paraphrase participants, for all need to know they are being understood for the process to proceed.

Polarity Map

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Insure follow-up accountability

## PROCESS

- · List all major responsibilities on the left side of a chart. List the names of team members and other persons related to the responsibilities along the top.
- · Review all responsibilities and code 'R' to mean responsible for the task, 'A' to indicate who must authorize decisions, 'S' to indicate members providing support and 'I' for those who must stay informed.

## VARIATIONS

- · Do this work with a subcommittee to reduce full group meeting time on this task.

## TIPS

- · This can become cumbersome to complete with a full group.

## Spot Analysis

Strategic Planning

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Develop a plan.

## PROCESS

- · Hang chart paper on the wall divided into quadrants.
- · Label the four sections strengths, problems, opportunities, and threats (SPOT).
- · List strengths, then problems.
- · Rank the strengths and problems if you have time.
- · Brainstorm opportunities. Invite members to see potential opportunities within problems.
- · List threats. Explore which ones could invalidate the work of the group.
- · Review the chart for insights and action ideas.

## VARIATIONS

- · Next, categorize elements of an issue to be addressed such as curriculum, assessment, and staff development.
- · List concerns or goals within each category.
- · Identify connections across categories.
- · Consider intervening at various starting places.

## TIPS

- · Assign the alternative ideas to a subgroup.

## Responsibility Charting

Decisions

## Structure Conversations About Data

Data-Driven Planning

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Utilize data to achieve outcomes.

## PROCESS

- · Select type of outcome, demographic, or process data.
- · Select most useful organization of data.
- · Determine type of analysis.

See chapter 11, Facilitating Data Teams.

## Wicked Problems Map

Preparing Action Plans

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Reveal systems for adaptive planning

## PROCESS

- · Draw a large circle on chart paper and a smaller circle in the center.
- · The smaller circle describes the project/initiative the group is working on. It might be implementing rigorous content standards.
- · In the outer circle list the systems and practices that would be affected. For implementing standards these might include curriculum alignment, parent expectations, data collection, special education, teacher evaluation, district culture, professional development, reporting practices, and so on.
- · Identify complexities and factors that would need to be taken into consideration in developing an action plan.

## VARIATIONS

- · Generate list of affected systems and practices in small group conversations prior to developing the problem map.

## TIPS

- · Apply to 'wicked problems' for which no known solution processes are available. Often these require new mental models or are dynamical, producing emergent phenomena within systems and subsystems.

To summarize is to restate fewer words, to abstract the essence of information or to make a communication more concise, Groups often use a summarizing strategy to closure and understanding to discourse or to concisely evaluate a the value or effectiveness of a meeting: using bring

## 7-11 Conversations

## Organize and Integrate

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Recall, clarify, and correct misunderstandings regarding what happened in a meeting.

## PROCESS

- · Members prepare comments they would make to a friend summarizing this meeting.
- · After composing-either mentally or on paper-members mill about the room sharing their comments with others.
- · After a few minutes, the facilitator redirects members to report to the full group some of their summaries.
- · The facilitator and group edit for consistency and accuracy.

## ALTERNATIVES

- · Summaries can be written and passed around a table for editing.

## TIPS

- · Frame this as a conversation in a convenience store needing to be brief, informal, and without academic language.
- · People often report different versions of what happens in meetings. This corrects this tendency.

## Content Check

Summarize

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Clarify the what, why, and how of next steps.

## PROCESS

- · Randomly distribute cards numbered one through four.
- · Display a chart with the following ideas:
- 1. Walk out knowing what to do.
- 2. Why are we doing it?

- 3. What are we expecting to see?
- 4. What are our next steps?
- · The numbers members received determine which meeting summary statement they make.

## VARIATIONS

- · Members draw a playing card.
- · Numbered cards are thrown on the table and members scramble for their questions of choice.
- · Add other summary checks for groups larger than four. Some examples might be:
- ∘ Who needs to know what happened in this meeting?
- ∘ By when are the next steps due?
- ∘ What should be highlighted in the minutes of the meeting?

## TIPS

- · Make the process routine for greatest results or alternate with 'Process Check' in this appendix.

## Gots and Wants

Meeting Assessment

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Adjust ways of working with group based on group feedback.

## PROCESS

- · Individuals compose 'gots' on sticky notes, one idea per sticky note. A 'got' might be an idea received, something learned, or a positive response to working with colleagues.
- · Individuals compose 'wants' on sticky notes, one idea per sticky note. A 'want' might be a comment about process (go faster or slower), a request for information, or a comment about materials.
- · As the group adjourns, members place their sticky notes on charts labeled as GOTS or WANTS.

## VARIATIONS

- · See 'Plusses and Wishes' in this appendix.

## TIPS

- · After the event, categorize and label the gots and wants. Use this information to adjust your practices at the next session.
- · Communicate to the group your response to their needs as you open the next session.

## Matchbook Summary

Summarize

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Reveal the essence of a topic.

## PROCESS

- · Following the introduction of a topic, groups craft a 'matchbook' definition.
- · Like a matchbook, very few words can be used (eight to twelve).
- · Groups have five minutes to craft and post the definition.

## VARIATIONS

- · Use this strategy to check understandings by summarizing conclusions from a discussion or dialogue.

## TIPS

- · Set wordsmithing aside. Save it for a different task.
- · Keep the definitions posted for later reference.
- · Use half sheets of chart paper to encourage short definitions.

## Most Important Point (MIP)

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Energize members as they distinguish and report personally relevant information.

## PROCESS

- · Invite the group to reflect on something learned or a conversation held.
- · Stand, locate a partner, and share your most important point.

## VARIATIONS

- · Add 'Partners Report' to this activity. Members will report to the full assembly the Most Important Point of their partner. The reporting need not be reciprocal and reporting is best done while members are still standing.
- · Instead of locating another partner, share MIPs at tables and agree on a table MIP.

## TIPS

- · Learning partners, eye contact partners, or any configuration of partnerships can be used. See 'Learning Partner' in this listing of strategies and moves.
- · When partners report, because they are reporting their partner's ideas, they will be briefer.

## One-Word Summary

Summarize

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Synthesize a conversation or information from a text.

## PROCESS

- · Write one word that summarizes the central idea from this conversation or text.
- · Share with a neighbor or table group.

## ALTERNATIVES

- · See  'Most  Important  Point,'  'Scrambled  Sentences,'  'Three  Balloons,'  or  '5-3-1'  in  this appendix.

## TIPS

- · Allow 'open text' in which members might review notes or text before arriving at a one-word summary.

## Pluses and Wishes

Meeting Assessment

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Adjust ways of working with group based on group feedback.

## PROCESS

- · Inform the group you will be requesting members to name pluses (things they appreciated or things that supported their learning) and wishes (things they wish the group had done more of, less of, or differently).
- · Use two to four flip charts depending on size of group. Each chart is displayed as a T-Bar with plusses at the top left and wishes at the top right
- · Recruit recorders.
- · Request pluses first. As each plus is named, paraphrase and direct it to recorders in turn.
- · Ask for wishes and repeat the patterns.
- · Members orally report pluses-what they valued about content or processes-while a recorder charts the ideas.
- · Next, report wishes-what they wish had been done more, less, differently, or wishes for the next session.

## VARIATIONS

- · 'Gots and Wants' (elsewhere in this list) is another strategy that serves this purpose.
- · With a small group, up to ten or so people, you can serve as both facilitator and recorder.

## ALTERNATIVES

- · Use multiple recorders to speed the charting process.

## TIPS

- · After initial contributions always ask 'What else?' rather than 'Is there anything else?' to elicit further comments.
- · State as 'What are some pluses . . .,' not 'Are there any plusses?'
- · After the session, organize each category into sub-topics and report to the group at the next session how their ideas have informed this next session.
- · Keep your facial and verbal responses neutral.

## Recipe

Review and Condense

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Engage both sides of brain in review.

## PROCESS

• Provide  format:  'Recipe  For\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_;  Name  of  Dish\_\_\_\_;  From  the  Kitchen  of\_\_\_\_; Serves\_\_\_\_; Ingredients\_\_\_\_.'

• Table groups develop and post recipes on chart paper.

- · Spokesperson from each table makes a brief presentation to the group.

## VARIATIONS

- · Provide ingredients with which the recipe will be made.
- · Use a 'Gallery Walk' to share recipes.

## TIPS

- · Give a time estimate, usually about fifteen minutes.

## Scrambled Sentences

Review

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Energy and collective review.

## PROCESS

- · Each person writes one word on a card or sticky note illustrative of the individual's learning.
- · The group constructs a sentence using all the words while adding as few words as possible.
- · Group spokespersons read the sentences to the full group.

## VARIATIONS

- · Write words for a common experience.
- · After creating one sentence, have participants take their word and form another group, creating another sentence.

## TIPS

- · Give a signal for the group work to begin.

## Song Writing

Review

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Engage right and left brain in summarizing important points.

## PROCESS

- · Have individuals write the name of a song from their childhood on a sticky note.
- · Next have them write the name of a song from their high school years.
- · Next they write a song they associate with celebrations.
- · Using these songs as activators, direct table groups to develop a song that expresses something about the full group in which they are participating, and prepare to perform it.
- · Ask which group wants to go first, second, etc. Perform and appreciate.

## VARIATIONS

- · Use this to celebrate accomplishments or transitions in the life of the group.

## TIPS

- · Use this only when table groups have five or more members. This provides enough musical repertoire and style variance for a group to be successful.

## Sound and Motion Symphony

Full-bodied Review

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Energy, creativity, and group cohesion.

## PROCESS

- · Table groups select a collective sound and a motion to represent their learning.
- · Stand and rehearse.
- · When groups are ready to perform, facilitator assumes role of symphony conductor.
- · After each section of 'instruments' is rehearsed, the facilitator conducts the group bringing different sections in and out as appropriate.

## VARIATIONS

- · The facilitator might stand on a riser or table for greater visibility.

## TIPS

- · Emphasize rationale. Explain that of the many ways humans organize and integrate knowledge, body movements bring a special opportunity for the kinesthetic learner. This activity focuses more on the affective domains of learning than the cognitive.
- · Prerequisites for this activity are safe learning environment and trusting relationship with facilitator. Rarely would this occur on the first day of a group's work.

## Three Balloons

Summarize

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Quick individual and collective review.

## PROCESS

- · Imagine each member had three balloons on which there was space to write one word or phrase capturing an important idea from today's work.

- · Members record their ideas.
- · Members report out to the full group.

## VARIATIONS

- · Do not report out.

## TIPS

- · Reporting is useful when the goal is to reinforce certain ideas, stimulate recognition of others, and contribute to a sense of 'we' rather than 'me.'

## Tweet

## Summarize

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Reveal the essence of a topic.

## PROCESS

- · Following the introduction of a topic, groups craft a 'tweet.'
- · The summary can be no longer than 140 characters.
- · Groups have five minutes to craft and post the definition.

## Walk About

Review

## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS

Reflection on what has been important, personally and as a group.

## PROCESS

- · Establish groups of four to six participants.
- · Distribute walk about form. (See below.)
- · Members write what they know in left margin (five minutes).
- · Demonstrate talking with person from different table. Each provides one idea to the other.
- · Each records in one of the cells the idea and the person's name so others can be referred to that person for more information.
- · After ten to twelve minutes, have people seated, sharing the data they gathered.
- · Group members analyze data they have collected looking for themes or patterns.

## VARIATIONS

- · Reduce the number of cells to four to save time.
- · Select prompts such as recall-insights-applications or know-want to know-think you know.

## TIPS

- · Ensure that people write their original barter material outside instead of inside one of the cells.
