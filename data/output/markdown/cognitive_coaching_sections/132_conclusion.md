## CONCLUSION

The concepts in this chapter invite a shift from the present paradigms. For many educators, a dominant sense of satisfaction has come from their expertise as problem solvers. The shift to a mediational identity creates a feeling of being rewarded by facilitating others to solve their own problems. The shift is from teaching others to helping others learn from situations; from holding power to empowering others; from telling to inquiring; and from finding strength in holding on to finding strength in letting go. Changing one's identity requires patience, stamina, and courage. Coaches therefore are committed to and believe:

- I have faith that deep within each person lie the solutions to their own problems. I give attention to my intentions as a coach to help my colleagues find the keys to unlocking the doors to where those solutions reside within them.
- My effectiveness as a coach is not measured in how much advice I give and is taken and applied nor is it in providing solutions to others' problems. Rather, my effectiveness is measured by the degree to which others become more autonomous, efficacious problem solvers themselves.
- My coaching toolbox is always with me in my mediative oral and nonverbal language.
- I am constantly alert to opportunities to mediate others.
- As a continuous learner, I, too, seek coaching in an effort to become more efficacious, more flexible, more conscious, more craftsmanlike, and more interdependent.
- I am optimistic about the potential for all individuals to achieve higher-order mental processes.
