What AP® Stands For
Thousands of Advanced Placement teachers have contributed to the principles
articulated here. These principles are not new; they are, rather, a reminder of how AP
already works in classrooms nationwide. The following principles are designed to ensure
that teachers’ expertise is respected, required course content is understood, and that
students are academically challenged and free to make up their own minds.
1. AP stands for clarity and transparency. Teachers and students deserve clear
expectations. The Advanced Placement Program makes public its course
frameworks and sample assessments. Confusion about what is permitted in the
classroom disrupts teachers and students as they navigate demanding work.
2. AP is an unflinching encounter with evidence. AP courses enable students to
develop as independent thinkers and to draw their own conclusions. Evidence and
the scientific method are the starting place for conversations in AP courses.
3. AP opposes censorship. AP is animated by a deep respect for the intellectual
freedom of teachers and students alike. If a school bans required topics from their
AP courses, the AP Program removes the AP designation from that course and
its inclusion in the AP Course Ledger provided to colleges and universities. For
example, the concepts of evolution are at the heart of college biology, and a course
that neglects such concepts does not pass muster as AP Biology.
4. AP opposes indoctrination. AP students are expected to analyze different
perspectives from their own, and no points on an AP Exam are awarded for
agreement with a specific viewpoint. AP students are not required to feel certain
ways about themselves or the course content. AP courses instead develop
students’ abilities to assess the credibility of sources, draw conclusions, and make up their own minds.

As the AP English Literature course description states: “AP students are not
expected or asked to subscribe to any one specific set of cultural or political values,
but are expected to have the maturity to analyze perspectives different from their
own and to question the meaning, purpose, or effect of such content within the literary work as a whole.”
5. AP courses foster an open-minded approach to the histories and cultures of
different peoples. The study of different nationalities, cultures, religions, races, and
ethnicities is essential within a variety of academic disciplines. AP courses ground
such studies in primary sources so that students can evaluate experiences and evidence for themselves.
6. Every AP student who engages with evidence is listened to and respected.
Students are encouraged to evaluate arguments but not one another. AP
classrooms respect diversity in backgrounds, experiences, and viewpoints. The
perspectives and contributions of the full range of AP students are sought and
considered. Respectful debate of ideas is cultivated and protected; personal attacks have no place in AP.
7. AP is a choice for parents and students. Parents and students freely choose to
enroll in AP courses. Course descriptions are available online for parents and
students to inform their choice. Parents do not define which college-level topics
are suitable within AP courses; AP course and exam materials are crafted by
committees of professors and other expert educators in each field. AP courses and
exams are then further validated by the American Council on Education and studies
that confirm the use of AP scores for college credits by thousands of colleges and universities nationwide.
The AP Program encourages educators to review these principles with parents and
students so they know what to expect in an AP course. Advanced Placement is always
a choice, and it should be an informed one. AP teachers should be given the confidence
and clarity that once parents have enrolled their child in an AP course, they have agreed
to a classroom experience that embodies these principles.

About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking
AP courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and
AP Exams are developed and scored by college faculty
and experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges
and universities in the United States grant credit,
advanced placement, or both on the basis of successful
AP Exam scores; more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their own curriculum for AP courses and selecting appropriate college-level readings, assignments, and resources. This course and exam description
presents the content and skills that are the focus of
the corresponding college course and that appear on
the AP Exam. It also organizes the content and skills
into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many
AP teachers have told us they follow in order to focus
their instruction. The intention of this publication is to
respect teachers’ time and expertise by providing a
roadmap that they can modify and adapt to their local
priorities and preferences. Moreover, by organizing the
AP course content and skills into units, the AP Program
is able to provide teachers and students with formative assessments—Personal Progress Checks—that
teachers can assign throughout the year to measure
students’ progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students:
Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically
challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to equitable preparation and
access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses:
The AP Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP courses
must participate in the AP Course Audit, a process through which AP teachers’ course materials are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.

﻿ V.1 | 1
AP U.S. History Course and Exam Description

=== Page 9 ===
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the
AP teacher and the school principal (or designated
administrator) to confirm awareness and understanding
of the curricular and resource requirements. A syllabus
or course outline, detailing how course requirements
are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The
AP Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor;
all AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision,
piloting, and analysis to ensure that questions are
accurate, fair, and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development,
College Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher
education institutions. This feedback is carefully
considered to ensure that AP courses and exams are
able to provide students with a college-level learning
experience and the opportunity to demonstrate their
qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam
development process, relies on the expertise of both
AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice
questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course performance
assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands
of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are
scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion
is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained,
and their work is monitored throughout the Reading
for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief
Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers
in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of
the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a curve.
Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which means that
every student who meets the criteria for an AP score of
2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no matter how many
students that is. The criteria for the number of points
students must earn on the AP Exam to receive scores
of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently
validates for credit and placement purposes—include:
§ The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
§ The number of points researchers have found to be predictive that an AP student will succeed when placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
§ Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP scores as follows:
AP Score
Credit
Recommendation
College Grade
Equivalent 5
Extremely well qualified
A 4

A-, B+, B 3

B-, C+, C 2
Possibly qualified n/a 1

AP U.S. History Course and Exam Description

=== Page 10 ===
While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and
universities. To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/ placement policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/creditpolicies
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score the free-response sections of the AP Exams.
Ninety-eight percent of surveyed educators who took
part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an
AP Reader, including opportunities to:
§ Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
§ Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure
to the quality and depth of the responses from the
entire pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
§ Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
§ Score from home: AP Readers have online
distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects.
Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
§ Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs):
AP Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.
How to Apply

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide suggests
a sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds skill instruction across units, and organizes content into topics.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course topics and skills, create
customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.
*To report misuses, please call, 877-274-6474 (International: +1-212-632-1781).

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
§ Teachers and students sign in to, or create, their College Board accounts.
§ Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
§ Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
§ Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP Coordinator.
§ Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and
AP Coordinators to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following
additional benefits:
§ Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
§ Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
§ Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student
pack. The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
§ Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

Instructional
Model
Integrating AP resources throughout the course can help students develop the historical
thinking skills and conceptual understandings. The instructional model outlined below shows
possible ways to incorporate AP resources into the classroom.
Plan
Teachers may consider the following approaches as they plan their instruction before teaching each unit.
§ Use the Unit at a Glance table to identify related topics that build toward a common
understanding, and then plan appropriate pacing for students.
§ Identify useful strategies in the Instructional Approaches section to help teach the concepts and skills.
Teach
When teaching, supporting resources could be used to build students’ conceptual understanding and their mastery of skills.
§ Use the topic pages in the unit guides to identify the required content.
§ Integrate the content with a skill, considering any appropriate scaffolding.
§ Employ any of the instructional strategies previously identified.
§ Use the available resources on the topic pages to bring a variety of assets into the classroom.
Assess
Teachers can measure student understanding of the content and skills covered in the unit and provide actionable feedback to students.
§ At the end of each unit, use AP Classroom to assign students the online Personal
Progress Checks, as homework or as an in-class task.
§ Provide question-level feedback to students through answer rationales; provide unit- and
skill-level feedback using the progress dashboard.
§ Create additional practice opportunities using the AP Question Bank and assign them through AP Classroom.

About the
AP U.S. History Course
In AP U.S. History, students investigate significant events, individuals, developments, and
processes in nine historical periods from approximately 1491 to the present. Students
develop and use the same skills and methods employed by historians: analyzing primary
and secondary sources; developing historical arguments; making historical connections;
and utilizing reasoning about comparison, causation, and continuity and change. The course
also provides eight themes that students explore throughout the course in order to make
connections among historical developments in different times and places: American and
national identity; work, exchange, and technology; geography and the environment; migration
and settlement; politics and power; America in the world; American and regional culture; and social structures.
College Course Equivalent
AP U.S. History is equivalent to a two-semester introductory college course in U.S. history.
Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites for AP U.S. History. Students should be able to read a college-level
textbook and write grammatically correct, complete sentences.

Introduction
The AP U.S. History Course and Exam Description
defines what representative colleges and universities typically expect students to know and be able to do in order to earn college credit or placement.
Students practice the thinking skills used by historians by studying primary and secondary
source evidence, analyzing a wide array of historical
evidence and perspectives, and expressing historical arguments in writing.
Although the course framework is designed to provide
a clear and detailed description of the course content
and skills, it is not a curriculum. Teachers create their
own curricula to meet the needs of their students and any state or local requirements.
The Inclusion of Names and Specific Historical Examples
As has been the case for all prior versions of the
AP U.S. History course, this AP U.S. History course framework includes a minimal number of individual
names: the founders, several presidents and party leaders, and other individuals who are almost
universally taught in college-level U.S. history courses.
As history teachers know well, the material in this
framework cannot be taught without careful attention
to the individuals, events, and documents of American
history; however, to ensure teachers have flexibility
to teach specific content that is valued locally and
individually, the course avoids prescribing details that would require all teachers to teach the same
historical examples. Each teacher is responsible for
selecting specific individuals, events, and documents for student investigation of the material in the course framework.
The Founding Documents
In the context of American history, the in-depth
examination of the ideas and debates in the founding
documents (e.g., the Declaration of Independence, the
Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Federalist Papers)
helps students better understand pivotal moments in
America’s history. Through close reading and careful
analysis of these documents, students gain insights
into the remarkable people, ideas, and events that
shaped the nation. Ultimately, students with command
of the founding documents and a capacity to trace their
influence will find opportunities throughout the course to draw on and apply this knowledge.
Throughout the course, students closely read and analyze foundational documents and other primary and secondary sources in order to gain historical understanding. Teachers may use these documents
to help students trace ideas and themes throughout
American history. On the AP U.S. History Exam, students will be expected to read and analyze primary and
secondary sources, draw upon evidence from them, and
connect them to the students’ own historical knowledge
and understanding. For these reasons, teachers may
elect to teach the founding documents and the ideas they express in depth during the course.

Course Framework
Components
Overview
This course framework provides a description of what students should know and be
able to do to qualify for college credit or placement.
The course framework includes two essential components:
1   HISTORICAL THINKING SKILLS AND
REASONING PROCESSES
The historical thinking skills and reasoning processes are central to the
study and practice of U.S. history. Students should practice and develop
these skills and processes on a regular basis over the span of the course.
2   COURSE CONTENT
The course content is organized into commonly taught units of study that
provide a suggested sequence for the course. These units comprise the
content and conceptual understandings that colleges and universities
typically expect students to master to qualify for college credit and/or
placement. This content is grounded in themes, which are cross-cutting
concepts that build conceptual understanding and spiral throughout the course.

Historical
Thinking Skills and Reasoning
Processes
This section presents the historical thinking skills and reasoning processes that
students should develop during the AP history courses and that form the basis of the tasks on the AP history exams.
Historical Thinking Skills
The AP historical thinking skills describe what students should be able to do while
exploring course concepts. The table that follows presents these skills, which
students should develop during the AP U.S. History course.
The unit guides later in this publication embed and spiral these skills throughout
the course, providing teachers with one way to integrate the skills into the course
content with sufficient repetition to prepare students to transfer those skills when taking the AP Exam.
More detailed information about teaching the historical thinking skills can be found
in the Instructional Approaches section of this publication.

Reasoning Processes
Reasoning processes describe the cognitive operations that students will be required to apply when engaging with the
historical thinking skills on the AP Exam. The reasoning processes ultimately represent the way practitioners think in the

AP U.S. HISTORY
Course
Content
Influenced by the Understanding by Design® (Wiggins and McTighe) model,
this course framework provides a description of the course requirements necessary for student success.
The course content is organized into commonly taught units. The units have
been arranged in a logical sequence frequently found in many college courses and textbooks.
The nine units in AP U.S. History, and their approximate weighting on the AP Exam, are listed on the following page.
Pacing recommendations at the unit level and in the Course at a Glance provide
suggestions for how to teach the required course content and administer the
Personal Progress Checks. The suggested class periods are based on a schedule
in which the class meets five days a week for 45 minutes each day. While these
recommendations have been made to aid planning, teachers should of course
adjust the pacing based on the needs of their students, alternate schedules (e.g.,
block scheduling), or their school’s academic calendar.
A NOTE ABOUT PERIODIZATION
Following the example of many subfields within U.S. history, as well as the
approach adopted by most U.S. history textbooks, the course framework reflects
an acknowledgment that historians differ in how they apply boundaries between
distinct historical eras. Several of the periods show some degree of overlap,
depending on the thematic focus of the topics in that period. For example, Period 4,
which begins in 1800, emphasizes antebellum reform and social change (with 1848
as an ending point because of the Seneca Falls Convention). Period 5 focuses on
how expansion led to debates over slavery, thus beginning with Manifest Destiny
and the election of James K. Polk in 1844; it spans the Civil War and Reconstruction
and ends with the Compromise of 1877. The emphasis in Period 6 on economic
development logically begins with the end of the Civil War in 1865 and ends on the
eve of the Spanish–American War in 1898. Period 7 uses 1890 as the appropriate
starting date for America’s rise to global power—a major conceptual focus of the period.

TOPICS
Each unit is broken down into teachable segments
called topics. The topic pages (starting on page 37)
contain all required content for each topic. Although
most topics can be taught in one or two class periods,
teachers are again encouraged to pace the course to suit the needs of their students and school.
In order for students to develop an understanding of
these topics, teachers select specific historical figures, groups, and events—and the primary and secondary source documents through which they can be
examined—that enable students to investigate them. In
this way, AP teachers create their own local curricula for AP U.S. History.

THEME 1: AMERICAN AND NATIONAL IDENTITY (NAT)
This theme focuses on how and why definitions of American and national
identity and values have developed among the diverse and changing
population of North America as well as on related topics, such as citizenship,
constitutionalism, foreign policy, assimilation, and American exceptionalism.
THEME 2: WORK, EXCHANGE, AND TECHNOLOGY (WXT)
This theme focuses on the factors behind the development of systems of
economic exchange, particularly the role of technology, economic markets, and government.
THEME 3: GEOGRAPHY AND THE ENVIRONMENT (GEO)
This theme focuses on the role of geography and both the natural and
human-made environments in the social and political developments in what would become the United States.
THEME 4: MIGRATION AND SETTLEMENT (MIG)
This theme focuses on why and how the various people who moved to and
within the United States both adapted to and transformed their new social and physical environments.
THEME 5: POLITICS AND POWER (PCE)
This theme focuses on how different social and political groups have
influenced society and government in the United States as well as how
political beliefs and institutions have changed over time.
THEME 6: AMERICA IN THE WORLD (WOR)
This theme focuses on the interactions between nations that affected
North American history in the colonial period and on the influence of the
United States on world affairs.
THEME 7: AMERICAN AND REGIONAL CULTURE (ARC)
This theme focuses on the how and why national, regional, and group
cultures developed and changed as well as how culture has shaped government policy and the economy.
THEME 8: SOCIAL STRUCTURES (SOC)
This theme focuses on how and why systems of social organization
develop and change as well as the impact that these systems have on the broader society.
Themes
The themes serve as the connective tissue of the course and enable students to
create meaningful connections across units. They are often broader ideas that
become threads that run throughout the course. Revisiting them and applying
them in a variety of contexts helps students to develop deeper conceptual
understanding. Below are the themes of the course and a brief description of each.

Guides
Introduction
The structure of the unit guides respects new AP teachers’ time by
providing one possible sequence they can adopt or modify rather than
having to build from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units
enable the AP Program to provide interested teachers with formative
assessments—the Personal Progress Checks—that they can assign their
students at the end of each unit to gauge progress toward success on the
AP Exam. However, experienced AP teachers who are satisfied with their
current course organization and exam results should feel no pressure to
adopt these units, which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

The Unit at a Glance table shows the topics, related thematic
focus, suggested skills, and reasoning processes for each topic.
The Class Periods column has been left blank so that teachers can customize the time they spend on each topic.
The suggested skill for each topic shows one way teachers
can link the content in that topic to a specific AP historical
thinking skill. The individual skill has been thoughtfully chosen
in a way that helps spiral those skills throughout the course. The
questions on the Personal Progress Checks are based on this
pairing. However, AP Exam questions may pair the content with any of the skills.

PREVIEW: UNIT 1 KEY CONCEPTS
KC-1.1
As native populations migrated and settled across the vast expanse of North America over time, they developed distinct and increasingly complex societies by adapting to and transforming their diverse environments.
KC-1.1.I
Different native societies adapted to and transformed their environments through innovations in agriculture, resource use, and social structure.
Spend a class period helping students understand some contexts for this unit. Considering
this unit’s key concepts (previewed below), select one or two for which your students will most need context.
To understand context, your students could examine:
§ Change from and/or continuity with preceding historical developments.
§ Similarities and/or differences with contemporaneous historical developments in different regions or geographical areas.
Whenever possible, draw upon students’ relevant prior knowledge, and anchor this
contextualization lesson in historical source material of varying formats such as visuals,
data, or written texts, or conduct an activity that engages students in exploring context.

Americas from 1491 to 1607.
PREVIEW: UNIT 1 KEY CONCEPTS
KC-1.1
As native populations migrated and settled across the vast expanse of North America over time, they developed distinct and increasingly complex societies by adapting to and transforming their diverse environments.
KC-1.1.I
Different native societies adapted to and transformed their environments through innovations in agriculture, resource use, and social structure.
Spend a class period helping students understand some contexts for this unit. Considering
this unit’s key concepts (previewed below), select one or two for which your students will most need context.
To understand context, your students could examine:
§ Change from and/or continuity with preceding historical developments.
§ Similarities and/or differences with contemporaneous historical developments in different regions or geographical areas.
Whenever possible, draw upon students’ relevant prior knowledge, and anchor this
contextualization lesson in historical source material of varying formats such as visuals,
data, or written texts, or conduct an activity that engages students in exploring context.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Introducing Historical Context
This activity introduces students to a conceptual understanding of historical context. For
reference, please see the definition of contextualization in the Course and Exam Description.
Duration: ~20 mins
Sequence: Start of lesson 1.
Begin by explaining that context is much like the set of a play or movie. Ask students
to imagine watching their favorite movie with the actors performing the entire script
in front of a plain white background. Note that while it would be possible to follow
the story, it would be more difficult to fully understand. Historical context is similar to
the set or background in a movie in that it provides a broader understanding of the
historical developments under consideration by taking into account other political,
economic, cultural, or social developments that helped shape the period.
2.
Textbooks generally start with an introduction to each unit that “sets the stage” for the
period. Organize students into small groups and ask them to read the introduction to each unit in this period from their textbook.
3.
Ask students to discuss the introductions and summarize the history of the period from
1491 to 1607 in a brief statement. For example they might characterize this period as
an age of discovery or an age of dramatic change. Then ask students to complete the following sentence frame.
§	 This period in history is an age of __________________________________________
because ___________________________________________________________________.
Conclude the activity with a class debrief that concentrates on what is meant by placing
events in historical context. Discuss how the introduction in the textbook “sets the stage” for
the information in the unit by providing background information and a broad overview of the period.

OPTIONAL SOURCES
Teachers have the flexibility to include in their syllabus primary and secondary sources that
align with local standards and priorities. The following optional sources and activity are not
required AP course content, but are instead simply examples of sources appropriate for a
college-level course. None of the AP Exam questions require students to have studied these
specific sources. These sources represent a variety of persons and perspectives relevant to
U.S. history, rather than an endorsement of their ideas or values. AP students are not asked to
affiliate themselves with the cultural or political values in these sources, but instead to analyze
such documents for the historical information they can yield.
Examples and Sources
KC-1.2.III
Divergent worldviews:
§ Doctrine of Discovery: John Winthrop, General Observations, May 1629, Higginson
Copy, Massachusetts Historical Society. As leader of the Massachusetts Bay
Colony, Winthrop asserts that Christians have the right to take land from people they
determined to be “savages.” Suggested excerpt: Objection 5.
§ Matrilineage: Jan V. Noel, “Revisiting Gender in Iroquoia,” in Gender and Sexuality
in Indigenous North America, 1400–1850, ed. Sandra Slater and Fay A. Yarbrough
(Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 2011), pp. 69–70. The conclusion to
Noel’s essay provides a summary of recent scholarship related to the role of women in Haudenosaunee society.
§ Nomadism: Nicolas Denys, The Description and Natural History of the Coasts of North
America (Acadia), ed. and trans. William F. Ganong (Toronto: The Champlain Society,
1908), pp. 405–406, 419–20, 422–24, 426–33. These pages describe nomadic life
among Indigenous hunter-gathers in what is now northern Maine and the Canadian
Maritimes, as told by a French colonist.
§ Gender roles: Reuben Gold Thwaites, ed., The Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents:
Travels and Explorations of the Jesuit Missionaries in New France, 1610–1791, 73 vols.
(Cleveland, 1896–1901), Vol. 59, p. 129. In this account, a Jesuit missionary describes gender roles among the Illinois in New France.
KC-1.2.III.B
Indigenous military resistance:
§ Cupul Uprising: Nancy M. Farriss, Maya Society under Colonial Rule: The Collective
Enterprise of Survival (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984), pp. 22–23. Farriss
compares the reaction of several Indigenous communities to the arrival of the Spanish.
§ Mixton War: “Lienzo de Tlaxcala,” c. 1550. This multi-panel illustration tells the story of
the conquest of Mexico from the perspective of the Tlaxcalans, an enemy of the Aztec.
Lienza 58, “Xochiphilla” depicts Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza and the Tlaxcalans battling
with the Caxcanes in the Mixtón War, providing an Indigenous artist’s depiction of the battle.
§ Taino Rebellion: Olga Jiménez de Wagenheim, Puerto Rico: An Interpretive History
from Pre-Columbian Times to 1900, (Princeton: Markus Wiener Publishers, 1998),
pp. 44–46. Chapter 3 summarizes Taino resistance in the context of the encomienda system and the African slave trade.

KC-1.2.III.C
Debates among Europeans about how non-Europeans should be treated:
§ Bartolomé de las Casas: Bartolomé de las Casas, “A Brief Account of the Destruction
of the Indies” (1542). Bartolomé de las Casas provides an account of the Spanish
treatment Indigenous people. Suggested excerpt: the section titled “The Cruelties of the
Spaniards Committed in America.”.
§ Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda: Juan Ginés de Sepulveda, Second Democrates, or On
the Just Cause of War Against the Indians (1547). The primary Spanish opponent of
de las Casas in the debate over Spanish treatment of Indigenous people, Sepulveda
argued that the Indigenous inhabitants of Spain’s empire were naturally fit for conquest
and enslavement. Suggested excerpt: several websites include short excerpts of this
document that are abridged for classroom use; select one that includes a comparison of the Spanish and Indigenous societies.
§ New Laws of 1542: Henry Stevens (Jr. ), The New Laws of the Indies for the Good
Treatment and Preservation of the Indians (London: Chiswick Press, 1893), pp. xii–xiv.
Partly due to the influence of Catholic figures such as de las Casas and partly out of
a desire to diminish the power and sovereignty of his increasingly wealthy subjects
in the New World, Charles V abolished the enslavement of Indigenous people via the
New Laws of 1542. Suggested excerpt: the pages of this book are numbered in two
sequences of Roman numerals; pages xii–xiv of the second set of Roman numerals.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Identifying Historical Evidence
Students develop a process for analyzing an author’s argument. Provide each student with a
copy of the excerpt from Nancy M. Farriss’s Mayan Society under Colonial Rule on the Cupul
Uprising and complete each of the steps listed below for this source.
Duration: ~30 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
Ask students to read the source and think about what the author is trying to explain.
§	 What do you think the passage is about?
§	 Describe what the passage is about in a few of your own words in the margin next to the passage.
2.
Direct students to look at the source again and consider the author’s claims.
§	 Can you identify where the author has made their points or claims clearly in one place?
§ Underline the place where you see the main points or claims written in the passage.
3.
Ask students to think about the author’s reasoning.
§	 Does the author give any reasons for making the claims?
§	 What reasons does the author include for why they are making their claims or why they think they are right?
§	 Put parentheses around any of the author’s reasons for making their claims.
4.
Ask students to look for evidence in the source.
§	 Does this passage include any evidence that supports the claims? What ‘proof’ does
the author include to show their claims is a strong one?
§	 Circle any evidence that you think supports the author’s claims.
§	 Draw an arrow from each piece of evidence you circled to the claim it supports.
Review the students’ work to confirm that they are able to identify claims, reasoning, and
evidence in the source. Emphasize that their ability to effectively analyze and understand
arguments is important for history class and a wide range of academic and real world situations.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Guided Discussion
Students review historical developments from Period 1 and use this knowledge to develop a claim or thesis statement.
Duration: ~30 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
Display the learning objective for this topic, “Explain the effects of the development
of transatlantic voyages from 1491 to 1607.” Lead a whole class brainstorm by asking
students to look back at their notes and call out effects of the voyages of the Spanish
to the Americas. Record their responses on the left side of the board.
2.
List the eight AP U.S. History Themes across the top of the right side of the board (page
21 of the Course and Exam Description). Ask individual students to come to the board
and move one of the effects from the left to the appropriate theme on the right. Then
ask them to briefly explain why they chose this theme. Continue until all of the effects
are sorted under a theme. As students sort the effects, note that some themes are more relevant than others in this period.
3.
Ask students to write down the five effects that they feel are most important. Ask
several students to share and lead a class discussion. Circle the five effects that most students agreed were important.
4.
Based on the results of step 3, ask students to decide which theme was most impacted
by transatlantic voyages. Now guide students in writing a claim or thesis statement that does the following.
§ Write a sentence that identifies which theme was most impacted by the transatlantic voyages.
§ Write a second sentence that provides a few examples of the impact of this theme.
Ask a few students to share. If they are struggling, provide a model like this. “The transatlantic
voyages of the Europeans most affected the environment of America. For example, the
Columbian Exchange introduced new diseases and animals.” Close by explaining how a clear
thesis statement helps readers understand historical arguments.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Unit 2: Learning Objective A
Explain the context for the colonization of North
America from 1607 to 1754.
PREVIEW: UNIT 2 KEY CONCEPTS
KC-2.1
Europeans developed a variety of colonization and migration patterns, influenced by different imperial goals, cultures, and the varied North
American environments where they settled.
They competed with each other and American
Indians for resources.
KC-2.1.I
Spanish, French, Dutch, and British colonizers had different economic and imperial goals involving land and labor that shaped the social and political development of their colonies as well as their relationships with native populations.
KC-2.1.II
In the 17th century, early British colonies developed along the Atlantic coast, with regional differences that reflected various environmental, economic, cultural, and demographic factors.

PREVIEW: UNIT 2 KEY CONCEPTS
KC-2.1.III
Competition over resources between
European rivals and American Indians encouraged industry and trade and led to conflict in the Americas.
KC-2.2
The British colonies participated in political, social, cultural, and economic exchanges with Great Britain that encouraged both stronger bonds with Britain and resistance to Britain’s control.
KC-2.2.I
Transatlantic commercial, religious, philosophical, and political exchanges led residents of the British colonies to evolve in their political and cultural attitudes as they became increasingly tied to Britain and one another.
KC-2.2.II
Like other European empires in the
Americas that participated in the Atlantic slave trade, the English colonies developed a system of slavery that reflected the specific economic, demographic, and geographic characteristics of those colonies.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Establishing Historical Context
The purpose of this activity is to develop students’ abilities to explain historical context.
Students will select factors of historical influence they have already learned to write an
explanation for the European effort to colonize North America.
Duration: ~20 mins
Sequence: Start of class 1.
Divide students into groups and assign each group one of the following historical
factors of influence for colonization from Period 1: Columbian Exchange, Indigenous negotiation and/or resistance, enslavement.
2.
Ask each student to write a sentence that explains how their assigned historical factor influenced Spanish colonization.
3.
In their groups, ask students to choose the best individual response and write it on the board.
4.
Ask the entire class to brainstorm one specific piece of historical evidence connected to the best responses.
Debrief by emphasizing the idea that while historical context is established through broad
events and processes, context is ultimately explained with specific pieces of evidence.
Though students can use events before, during, or after a historical development they are
studying, early in the year it is helpful to have students use historical examples they have
already learned in class. Reviewing these steps will help students think about broader
historical processes as they begin studying Period 2.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Unit 2: Learning Objective B
Explain how and why various European colonies developed and expanded from 1607 to 1754.
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTS
KC-2.1.I.A
Spanish efforts to extract wealth from the land led them to develop institutions based on subjugating native populations, converting them to Christianity, and incorporating them, along with enslaved and free Africans, into
Spanish colonial society.
KC-2.1.I.B
French and Dutch colonial efforts involved relatively few Europeans and relied on trade alliances and intermarriage with American
Indians to build economic and diplomatic relationships and acquire furs and other products for export to Europe.
KC-2.1.I.C
English colonization efforts attracted a comparatively large number of male and female
British migrants, as well as other European migrants, all of whom sought social mobility, economic prosperity, religious freedom, and improved living conditions. These colonists focused on agriculture and settled on land taken from Native Americans, from whom they lived separately.

Examples and Sources
KC-2.1.I.A
Institutions based on subjugation:
§ Genízaros: Russel Albert Daniels, “The Genízaro Pueblo of Abiquiú,” Magazine of the
Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian (2020). This article gives a
history of Genízaros along with contemporary photographs of Genízaro historic sites in New Mexico.
§ Repartimiento: Francisco Vasquez Coronado, Petitions for Jobs and Money: Governor
Francisco Vasquez De Coronado, in Historical Documents Relating to New Mexico, Nueva
Vizcaya, and Approaches Thereto, ed. Charles W. Hackett (Washington, D.C.: Carnegie
Institution of Washington, 1923), vol. 1, pp. 33–34. Coronado, governor of New Galicia in
Mexico asks the Spanish crown to augment his repartimiento.
KC-2.1.I.B
French and Dutch economic and diplomatic relationships with Indigenous communities:
§ Great Peace of Montreal: The Great Peace of Montréal (1701). This agreement was the
product of a treaty conference that included some 1,300 Indigenous participants as well as the leadership of New France.
§ Patroonships: Kiliaen van Rensselaer, “Instructions to Bastiaen Jansz Krol, January 12,
1630,” in Van Rensselaer Bowier Manuscripts, ed. A.J.F van Laer, (1908), pp. 158–161.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Unit 2: Learning Objective C
Explain how and why environmental and other factors shaped the development and expansion of various British colonies that developed and expanded from 1607 to 1754.
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTS
KC-2.1.II.A
The Chesapeake and North Carolina colonies grew prosperous exporting tobacco—a labor intensive product initially cultivated by white, mostly male indentured servants and later by enslaved Africans.
KC-2.1.II.B
The New England colonies, initially settled by
Puritans, developed around small towns with family farms and achieved a thriving mixed economy of agriculture and commerce.
KC-2.1.II.C
The middle colonies supported a flourishing export economy based on cereal crops and attracted a broad range of European migrants, leading to societies with greater cultural, ethnic, and religious diversity and tolerance.
KC-2.1.II.D
The colonies of the southern Atlantic coast and the British West Indies used long growing seasons to develop plantation economies based on exporting staple crops. They depended on the labor of enslaved Africans, who often constituted the majority of the population in these areas and developed their own forms of cultural and religious autonomy.
THEMATIC FOCUS
Geography and the Environment GEO
Geographic and environmental factors, including competition over and debates
about natural resources, shape the development of America and foster regional
diversity. The development of America impacts the environment and reshapes
geography, which leads to debates about environmental and geographic issues.

Distance and Britain’s initially lax attention led to the colonies creating self-governing institutions that were unusually democratic for the era. The New England colonies based power in participatory town meetings, which in turn elected members to their colonial legislatures; in the southern colonies, elite planters exercised local authority and also dominated the elected assemblies.

TOPIC 2.3
The Regions of British Colonies
Examples and Sources
KC-2.1.II.C
Greater cultural, ethnic, and religious diversity and tolerance in the middle colonies:
§ Huguenots: “The Case of the French Protestants Refugees, settled in and about
London, and in the English Plantations in America,” (1696). After Louis XIV repealed the
Edict of Nantes in 1685, roughly 200,000 French Calvinists (Huguenots) fled France
for England, the Netherlands, Germany, South Africa, and the English colonies in the
Americas. Here the Huguenots of London protest a bill that would have prevented their
North American counterparts and family members from working as merchants.
§ Quakers: Francis Daniel Pastorius, “Circumstantial Geographical Description of the
Lately Discovered Province of Pennsylvania” (1700), in Narratives of Early Pennsylvania,
West New Jersey, and Delaware, 1630–1707, ed. Albert Cook Meyers (New York:
C. Scribner’s Son, 1912), Chapters VI, VII, XI–XIII. In his account of early Pennsylvania
history, Pastorius describes the colony’s Indigenous and European inhabitants, paying
special attention to religious diversity and William Penn’s insistence on liberty of conscience.
KC-2.1.II.D
Cultural and religious autonomy among enslaved Africans:
§ Ring shout: “McIntosh County Shouters: Gullah-Geechee Ring Shout from Georgia,”
Library of Congress (2010). The ring shout is a devotional dance that combined
West African and European Christian elements. Practiced by enslaved people in the
Caribbean and North America, the ring shout is here performed by a twenty-first century
revival group. Suggested excerpt: the narration and performance that begins at the
18:30 mark.
§ Task System: Daniel Littlefield, “The Varieties of Slave Labor,” Freedom’s Story,

contrasted with the task system of rice cultivation in the low country of South Carolina.
The author suggests three reasons for the development of the task system, one of
which argues that enslaved Africans wanted a work organization that gave them more
control over their own time. Suggested excerpt: the first seven paragraphs.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Create Representations
Students create an annotated map of the the British colonies in North America. Then read the
Circumstantial Geographical Description of the Lately Discovered Province of Pennsylvania to
build their understanding of the demographic diversity of the colonies.
Duration: ~40 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
To prepare for this activity, ask students to read the section in their textbook about the
regions of British colonization. Then, in class provide all students with a blank physical
map of the 13 colonies and organize them into pairs to complete this activity.
2.
Guide students to use their maps to complete two tasks: color-code the following
geographical regions and labeling each region with one distinguishing group of settlers:
a.	 Chesapeake (e.g. indentured servants) b.	 New England (e.g. Puritans) c.	 Middle colonies (e.g. Quakers)
d.	 Southern Atlantic Coast and the British West Indies (e.g. enslaved Africans) 3.
Ask students to describe one economic characteristic that impacted the development
and expansion of each region using the notes taken from reading their textbook.
Allow them to reference their textbook and/or the internet in class if they are missing information about any of the regions.
4.
Ask them to read the source Circumstantial Geographical Description of the Lately
Discovered Province of Pennsylvania and identify and describe a claim and/or argument
in the source. For example, ask students to think about what this source says about
religious diversity in Pennsylvania. Guide them to return to the map and identify its
location using a different color and label the area.
To conclude, ask at least one pair of students to share for each region so their classmates
can add more notes to their map. During this share-out emphasize the diversity of the
middle colonies as compared to the homogeneity of New England and the demographics
of the other regions. This representation in a visual form can serve as a quick way to review.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Unit 2: Learning Objective D
Explain causes and effects of transatlantic trade over time.
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTS
KC-2.1.III.A
An Atlantic economy developed in which goods, as well as enslaved Africans and American Indians, were exchanged between
Europe, Africa, and the Americas through extensive trade networks. European colonial economies focused on acquiring, producing, and exporting commodities that were valued in Europe and gaining new sources of labor.
KC-2.1.III.B
Continuing trade with Europeans increased the flow of goods in and out of American
Indian communities, stimulating cultural and economic changes and spreading epidemic diseases that caused radical demographic shifts.
KC-2.2.I.C
The British government increasingly attempted to incorporate its North American colonies into a coherent, hierarchical, and imperial structure in order to pursue mercantilist economic aims, but conflicts with colonists and American Indians led to erratic enforcement of imperial policies.

Cultural changes in Indigenous communities:
§ Horses in the Great Plains: Long Soldier (Hunkpapa Lakota), “Winter Count on cloth,”
ca. 1902, Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian. While this image
represents the period from c. 1798 to 1902, it is an example of the growing importance
of horses among Indigenous communities in the Plains after their introduction in the
17th century. The image, a winter count, illustrates history by depicting an important event for each year.
§ Introduction of firearms: David Thompson’s Narrative of his Explorations in Western
America, 1784–1812, ed. J. B. Tyrrell (Toronto: Champlain Society, 1916), pp. 326–32. An
Indigenous oral history of the arrival of guns in the northern Plains and Rocky Mountain
West, as told by Saukamappee, a Cree who lived among the Piegans of the Blackfeet confederacy.
KC-2.2.I.C
British conflicts with colonists and Indigenous people:
§ Bacon’s Rebellion: “The Declaration of the People, against Sr: Wm: Berkeley, and
Present Governors of Virginia” (1676). Nathaniel Bacon, angered by Virginia governor
William Berkeley’s monopoly on trade with, and his attitudes toward, Indigenous
communities launched a rebellion that eventually drove Berkeley from Williamsburg
in 1676. This document lists the grievances held against Berkeley by Bacon and his followers.
§ Boston Revolt of 1689: “The Boston Declaration of Grievances,” (1689). After word
reached Massachusetts that Parliament had driven the Catholic King James II from
the throne, a coalition of Bostonians overthrew Edmund Andros, the man hand-picked
by James II in 1685 to govern the Dominion of New England. This document lists their
grievances against Andros. Suggested excerpt: sections I-IV.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Making Connections
Students read “The Boston Declaration of Grievances” (1689) and identify relevant
connections between this source and British imperial policies before and after the publication
of the document. This activity will use the Navigation Acts and salutary neglect as examples of British policy.
Duration: ~30 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
As preparation for this activity, ask students to read and take notes on their textbook’s
coverage of transatlantic trade. Also, instruct them to define the terms Navigation Acts and salutary neglect.
2.
In class, ask pairs of students to review their homework together and identify a relevant
connection between the terms and the source. Provide the following questions to help students get started:
§ How does this source demonstrate a British imperial policy? (i.e. The Dominion of New England) § Why would the British take this action?
§ What is the main connection you can make between the source and the Navigation
Acts?
§ What is the main connection you can make between the source and the policy of salutary neglect?
§ What evidence can you provide from your homework assignment to support either connection?
§ What makes these connections relevant?
Making relevant connections to the policy of salutary neglect will likely be more challenging
for students, so close this activity with a debrief that emphasizes how British imperial policies
impacted transatlantic trade over time and attempted to control the colonial economies.
Conclude by sharing with students how mercantilism was used to justify British imperial
policies and how some colonists responded by smuggling goods and becoming resentful.

Examples and Sources
KC-2.1.III.C
Accommodation:
§ Opechancanough: John Smith, A True Relation by Captain John Smith (1608), pp. 45–46.
Smith describes his early interactions with the Powhatan leader Opechancanough (“the
King of Paspahegh”). In Smith’s retelling, Opechancanough shows interest in English
technology and attempts to make Smith an ally of the Powhatan. Suggested excerpt:
begin on page 45 with “Much they treatned to assault our forte...” and continue to the end of page 46.
Conflict:
§ Opechancanough: Edward Waterhouse, “A Declaration of the State of the Colony and
Affaires in Virginia” (1622) pp. 13–24. This document contains the Virginia Company’s
official report of the attack by the Powhatan Confederacy on the colony’s settlements in 1622.
§ Queen Anne’s War: “South Carolina Via New York,” Boston News-Letter, April 24 to May 1,
1704 in An Historical Digest of the Provincial Press, ed. Lyman Horace Weeks and Edwin
Munroe Bacon, (Boston: The Society of Americana, 1907), vol. 1, p. 49. South Carolina
Colonel James Moore describes some of his raids to enslave Indigenous people in
Florida missions during Queen Anne’s War. Suggested excerpt: first paragraph.
§ Walking Purchase: “Deed of Nutimus, Teeshakommen, et. al....to John Thomas and
Richard Penn” (Pennsylvania, August 25, 1737), Pennsylvania Archives, First Series,
Vol. 1, pp. 541–543. To raise revenue from the sale of Indigenous land, Pennsylvania
officials orchestrated a land deal with the Delaware based on a 1686 agreement to sell
the amount of land that a man could walk in a day and a half. This deed is the result of the walking purchase.
Alliances:
§ Covenant Chain: “The Second answer of the five nations of Indians...14th Septr. 1722,”
in Documents Relative to the Colonial History of the State of New York, vol. 5, ed. E. B.
O’Callaghan (1855), pp. 667–669. Representatives of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois)
Confederacy speak to British colonial governors during a conference to renew the alliance known as the Covenant Chain.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Unit 2: Learning Objective F
Explain the causes and effects of slavery in the various British colonial regions.
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTS
KC-2.2.II.A
All the British colonies participated to varying degrees in the Atlantic slave trade due to the abundance of land and a growing
European demand for colonial goods, as well as a shortage of indentured servants.
Small New England farms used relatively few enslaved laborers, all port cities held significant minorities of enslaved people, and the emerging plantation systems of the
Chesapeake and the southern Atlantic coast had large numbers of enslaved workers, while the great majority of enslaved Africans were sent to the West Indies.
KC-2.2.II.B
As chattel slavery became the dominant labor system in many southern colonies, new laws created a strict racial system that prohibited interracial relationships and defined the descendants of African American mothers as black and enslaved in perpetuity.

New laws:
§ Maryland Anti-Amalgamation Law of 1664: “An Act Concerning Negroes and other
Slaves [1664],” in Archives of Maryland, vol. 1 (1883), pp. 533–534. Among the first
North American laws to describe enslavement as a permanent condition.
§ New York Slave Code of 1702: “An Act for Regulating Slaves [1702],” in Acts of
Assembly, Passed in the Province of New-York, from 1691 to 1718 (London, 1719),
pp. 58–59. This two-page law legalizes the physical punishment of enslaved people
by European New Yorkers, limits the ability of enslaved people to gather in groups and
testify in court and details punishments for White people who harbor fugitives.
§ Virginia anti-intermarriage law of 1691: “An act for suppressing outlying slaves
[1691],” in Encyclopedia Virginia. The full text of 1691 empowers local authorities to
imprison runaways and illegalizes interracial sexual relations and marriage.
KC-2.2.II.C
Resisting enslavement:
§ First Maroon War: Vincent Brown, Tacky’s Revolt: The Story of an Atlantic Slave War
(Cambridge: Belknap Press, 2020), pp. 108–17. Brown provides an overview of the First
Maroon War between British troops and maroons (Africans who escaped from slavery
in Jamaica). The account details earlier rebellions by enslaved people that grew into
ongoing conflict during the 1730s until the British recognized the maroons’ victory and freedom by treaty in 1739.
§ Fort Mose: Thomas Jefferys, Plan of the town and habour of St. Augustine, 1762. During
the colonial period, enslaved people resisted enslavement by escaping to the Spanish
colony in Florida where they found freedom and were welcomed, in part, to strengthen
the defenses of St. Augustine. In 1738, the Spanish governor established Mose, a
fortified town two miles north of St. Augustine, as a home for these Black residents.
§ New York Conspiracy of 1741: Daniel Horsmanden, The New York Conspiracy, or A History
of the Negro Plot, with the Journal of the Proceedings Against the Conspirators at
New-York in the Years 1741–2, (New York: Southwick & Pelsue, 1810), pp. 31–32.
Horsmanden, the judge who tried the people accused of the New York Conspiracy of 1741,
wrote this account of the events. Suggested excerpt: the entry for Saturday, April 11.

§ Stono Rebellion: George Cato, “A Family Account of the Stono Uprising, ca. 1937,” as
told to a White interviewer in the “Slave Narratives” of the WPA Federal Writers’ Project,
found in “Unpublished interviews with former slaves in South Carolina,” [1936–1937] by
Federal Writers’ Project (S.C.). George Cato, the then-50 year-old great-great-grandson
of Cato, the enslaved man who led the Stono Rebellion, is obviously removed in time
from the event. So this narrative relates enslaved peoples’ account of the event as it
was passed down for nearly two centuries in the Cato family through an oral history corroborated by other sources.
Maintaining culture:
§ Gullah: John Rose, The Old Plantation, watercolor, c. 1785–90, Williamsburg, Virginia,
Collections of Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum. This unsigned, undated
painting by a Beaufort, South Carolina enslaver and rice plantation owner (likely the
setting shown) shows a romanticized scene of enslaved men and women in what
would have been a rare moment of relaxation from their rice cultivation labors, dancing
and playing music instead. Of particular note in this painting are the retention and
creolization of West African musical practices, notably in the form of the instruments:
the stick, the drum, the banjo (perhaps made of a gourd) and—what appear to be
scarves—the sheguras, Sierra Leone style rattles made of a gourd enclosed in a net.
§ Naming patterns: Keith E. Baird and Mary A. Twining, “Naming practices on the Sea
Island,” in Sea Island roots: African Presence in the Carolinas and Georgia, ed. Keith
E. Baird, John Henrik Clarke, and Mary A. Twining (Trenton: Africa World Press, 1992),
pp. 37–42. Baird discusses continuity of West African names and naming practices among Gullah people.
§ Sweetgrass baskets: Lynette Youson, Gullah Fanner Basket, 2002, sweetgrass, bulrush,
pine needles, and palmetto fronds, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Gift of Martha
G. Ware and Steven R. Cole, 2011.47.76. This “fanner basket,” a type of basket used to
separate rice grains from husks, is made in the traditional coiled style of West African
basketweavers. Sweetgrass baskets demonstrate how West Africans maintained their
traditional basketmaking and rice cultivation techniques.

Pluralism:
§ Concessions and Agreements of West New Jersey: “Concessions and Agreements of
West New Jersey” (1676). Chapter 16 mandates religious freedom for all inhabitants of
the colony. Signed by over 150 men (mostly Quakers, including William Penn) it lays out
one of the most important of the civil liberties guaranteed by this colonial document.
§ Maryland Toleration Act of 1649: “An Act Concerning Religion” (1649), also known as
the “Maryland Toleration Act of 1649.” The document promises religious freedom to
all Christians (except for anti-Trinitarians). It was the first public act to use the phrase
“free exercise” of religion later included in the First Amendment of the U.S. Bill of Rights.
Suggested excerpt: the sixth paragraph.
§ Roger Williams: Roger Williams, “A Plea for Religious Liberty,” 1644. Williams wrote this
work in the years after he founded Rhode Island. Suggested excerpt: the first paragraph
to the paragraph that begins “but withal I desire it may be…”
KC-2.2.I.B
Transatlantic print culture:
§ Boston News-Letter: Boston News-Letter, no. 1 (April 17 to April 24, 1704). The first
edition of the Boston News-Letter, colonial America’s first newspaper to survive past
its first issue. The newspaper was founded by Boston postmaster John Campbell. Its
printed masthead copies London newspaper tradition.
Spread of Protestant evangelicalism:
§ Jonathan Edwards: Jonathan Edwards, “Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,”
(sermon, Enfield, July 8th, 1741). Edwards first preached this sermon, associated with
the first Great Awakening, in Massachusetts and then in Connecticut in 1741. Suggested
excerpt: section 5 beginning with “The Devil stands ready to fall upon them...”.
§ Hannah Heaton: Hannah Heaton, The World of Hannah Heaton: The Diary of an
Eighteenth-Century New England Farm Woman, ed. Barbara E. Lacey (DeKalb, IL:
Northern Illinois University Press, 2003). Heaton’s diary provides insight into the
experiences of a colonial American woman embracing the evangelical religion of the
first Great Awakening. Heaton discusses the experience of hearing George Whitefield
preach in 1741. Suggested excerpt: pages 3–4 of the diary (located on pages 6–7 of the 2003 edition).

§ George Whitefield: George Whitefield’s oak field pulpit, ca. 1742–1770, maker unknown,
American Tract Society, Garland, Texas. Whitefield used this moveable pulpit, to preach
an estimated two thousand times to crowds in America and Britain. Whitefield needed
a portable outdoor pulpit like this one because he drew too big a crowd to fit indoors or
because churches banned him from preaching inside.
KC-2.1.III.D   KC-2.2.I.D
Dissatisfaction and resistance:
§ Impressment: William Shirley, letter to the Lords of Trade, December 1, 1747. In this
letter, Massachusetts Governor William Shirley describes what has become known
as the Knowles Riot, a disturbance over the naval impressment (forced service) of
sailors in Boston at the direction of British Admiral Charles Knowles in November 1747.
Suggested excerpt: the fifth and sixth paragraphs.
§ Pennsylvania Charter of Privileges: “Charter of Privileges Granted by William Penn,
esq. to the Inhabitants of Pennsylvania and Territories,” October 28, 1701. The first
two “privileges” (listed under “FIRST”), detailing religious freedom and representative
government, provide an example of the local experiences of self-government and
greater religious independence associated with colonial resistance.
§ John Peter Zenger: [James Alexander], A Brief Narrative of the Case and Tryal of John
Peter Zenger, Printer of the New-York Weekly Journal (1736). This document details
the 1735 trial of John Peter Zenger, which advanced freedom of the press. At the
trial, Zenger’s attorney, Andrew Hamilton, argued that publishing the truth, cannot be
considered libel or sedition. Suggested excerpt: the last two pages (29–30).

KC-3.2
The American Revolution’s democratic and republican ideals inspired new experiments with different forms of government.
KC-3.2.I
The ideals that inspired the revolutionary cause reflected new beliefs about politics, religion, and society that had been developing over the course of the 18th century.
KC-3.2.II
After declaring independence, American political leaders created new constitutions and declarations of rights that articulated the role of the state and federal governments while protecting individual liberties and limiting both centralized power and excessive popular influence.
KC-3.2.III.i
New forms of national culture and political institutions developed in the United States alongside continued regional variations and differences over economic, political, social, and foreign policy issues.
KC-3.3
Migration within North America and competition over resources, boundaries, and trade intensified conflicts among peoples and nations.
KC-3.3.I
In the decades after American independence, interactions among different groups resulted in competition for resources, shifting alliances, and cultural blending.

Going Deeper in Historical Context
The purpose of this activity is to help students develop a deeper understanding of
contextualization. As students prepare to cover the historical developments of Period 3,
emphasize the historical context in which the U.S. gained independence and developed a national identity.
Duration: ~15 mins
Sequence: Start of lesson 1.

As a class, identify and then describe how these two historical developments may have
been influenced by events unfolding in Europe and around the world during the 18th century.
3.
Show students the “Unit at a Glance” for AP European History’s Unit 4 and the Unit at a
Glance for AP World History’s Unit 5. PDFs of the Course and Exam Descriptions can be
downloaded through AP Central. Highlight that the “Enlightenment” is a key topic in all three courses.
4.
Ask students to pair up and define the Enlightenment in a couple of sentences.
Conclude the activity with a class debrief on how the Enlightenment may have influenced the
American Revolution and the writing of the U.S. Constitution. Reassure students that it is fine if
they did not know this information since the goal of the activity is to preview topics that will be covered deeper later in the unit.

OPTIONAL SOURCES
Teachers have the flexibility to include in their syllabus primary and secondary sources that
align with local standards and priorities. The following optional sources and activity are not
required AP course content, but are instead simply examples of sources appropriate for a
college-level course. None of the AP Exam questions require students to have studied these
specific sources. These sources represent a variety of persons and perspectives relevant to
U.S. history, rather than an endorsement of their ideas or values. AP students are not asked to
affiliate themselves with the cultural or political values in these sources, but instead to analyze
such documents for the historical information they can yield.
Examples and Sources
KC-3.1.I.A
British colonies’ expansion into North America:
§ Jumonville Glen Skirmish: Joseph F. Stoltz, “Jumonville Glen Skirmish,” in The Digital
Encyclopedia of George Washington, mountvernon.org. This article examines the
ambush of French forces by Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) fighters and Anglo-American
militia (under the command of George Washington) that began the Seven Years’ War.
§ Ohio Company: “Instructions given Mr. Christopher Gist by the Comittee [sic] of the
Ohio Company the 11th day of September 1750,” in George Mercer Papers Relating to
the Ohio Company of Virginia, ed. Lois Mulkearn (1954), pp. 7–8 (jump to image 50 of
digital edition). Having been granted 200,000 acres by the British crown, investors in the
Ohio Company instructed their agent, Christopher Gist, to explore and survey land to the
west of the Appalachian Mountains inhabited by Indigenous communities and claimed by France.
3.1.I.B
Expense and efforts to raise revenue:
§ Joseph Galloway: Joseph Galloway, “AMERICANUS,” letter to The New-York Gazette,
August 15, 1765, in the Pennsylvania Journal, August 29, 1765. In this article, Galloway,
a member of the Pennsylvania colonial assembly, defends Britain’s right to tax the colonies.
KC-3.1.I.C
Colonial opposition:
§ George Washington: Jennifer Monroe McCutchen, “Proclamation Line of 1763,” The
Digital Encyclopedia of George Washington. McCutchen discusses the impact of the
Proclamation Line of 1763 on George Washington and his response.
Indigenous groups resisting encroachment:
§ Pontiac: Pontiac, “Speech at Detroit” (speech, Detroit, 1763). In this speech, Pontiac
discusses the relationship between Indigenous communities and European colonists.
Suggested excerpt: from the section that begins “This land, where you live…” to the line “There let them remain.”

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Explaining Historical Events Through Maps
The purpose of this activity is to have students use an image to explain a historical concept.
Duration: ~20 mins
Sequence: End of lesson 1.
Provide students with the article by Joseph Stoltz, “Jumonville Glen Skirmish” and use
this to highlight how French, British, and many Indigenous nations laid claim to the same
territory and how that was a factor that led to war.
2.
Display a picture of maps depicting European colonial possessions in 1754 and 1763.
3.
Ask students to identify and explain a historical development not depicted on the map.
For example, many maps fail to show the impact of the Seven Years’ War on Indigenous
lands or how some Indigenous populations successfully resisted attempts by
Europeans to control areas in North America. Consider posing a question to students
such as: Why might the changes depicted in the maps represent an incomplete picture of the land implications of the Seven Years’ War?
4.
Debrief by highlighting one of the following Indigenous peoples’ reactions to the end of
the Seven Years War: Shawnee, Delaware, Seneca, Ojibwa, or Ottawa. Most books will
highlight Pontiac’s Rebellion as an example of Indigenous resistance, which will work
well for students to use. In the debrief, emphasize that resistance did not always lead to
control; instead, it often ended in continued negotiation over space.
5.
End the activity by asking students to write one or two sentences that explain
Indigenous resistance at the end of the Seven Years’ War.
As you debrief this activity, remind students that historians often have to recognize both
what is visible in documents as well as that which is historically identifiable, but not explicitly
included in a source like a map. Indigenous resistance is a good example of this concept.

The effort for American independence was energized by colonial leaders such as Benjamin
Franklin, as well as by popular movements that included the political activism of laborers, artisans, and women.
KC-3.1.II.D

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Discussion Groups
The purpose of this activity is to help students develop a deeper understanding of sourcing
and allow them to practice unpacking and interpreting visual sources.
Duration: ~30 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
Select one of the suggested visual sources under “new taxes” and provide students
with a copy of the image and background information.
2.
Divide the class into groups of 4 and ask each group to analyze the source together for
content and to extract the main idea of the image. Provide the following questions to help students get started:
§ What do you see in the image?
§ Do you recognize any symbols?
§ What is the connection between this tax and the American Revolution?
3.
Assign each group member one of these four sourcing approaches:
§ Point of view: What aspects of the creator’s background could have influenced what they created in the visual source?
§ Purpose: What is the objective or goal of the creator? What verb captures their motive?
§ Historical Situation: What was happening at the time and/or in the place where the
visual source was created? Is it immediate and related to its creation as opposed to broader in scope?
§ Audience: Who is the intended recipient? How would this affect the reliability of the visual source?
4.
Afterward, each group should have a brief discussion where students describe and
then explain why their assigned sourcing approach would or wouldn’t be the best fit to
analyze this source. Ask them to reach a consensus as to which of the four sourcing
approaches would be the best option for determining the historical significance of the
visual source. Conduct a class discussion where each group shares their findings.
Conclude with a class discussion on the limitations encountered in each of the approaches
to sourcing the selected visual. Have students identify specific limitations they encountered
(i.e. what information wasn’t available for the visual source, etc.) and explain why particular
sourcing approaches can be more or less valuable for developing historical understanding.

THEMATIC FOCUS
American and National Identity NAT
The development of and debates about democracy, freedom, citizenship, diversity,
and individualism shape American national identity, cultural values, and beliefs about
American exceptionalism, and in turn, these ideas shape political institutions and
society. Throughout American history, notions of national identity and culture have
coexisted with varying degrees of regional and group identities.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Unit 3: Learning Objective D
Explain how and why colonial attitudes about government and the individual changed in the years leading up to the
American Revolution.
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTS
KC-3.2.I.A
Enlightenment ideas and philosophy inspired many American political thinkers to emphasize individual talent over hereditary privilege, while religion strengthened Americans’ view of themselves as a people blessed with liberty.
KC-3.2.I.B
The colonists’ belief in the superiority of republican forms of government based on the natural rights of the people found expression in Thomas Paine’s Common Sense and the
Declaration of Independence. The ideas in these documents resonated throughout
American history, shaping Americans’ understanding of the ideals on which the nation was based.

Teachers have the flexibility to include in their syllabus primary and secondary sources that
align with local standards and priorities. The following optional sources and activity are not
required AP course content, but are instead simply examples of sources appropriate for a
college-level course. None of the AP Exam questions require students to have studied these
specific sources. These sources represent a variety of persons and perspectives relevant to
U.S. history, rather than an endorsement of their ideas or values. AP students are not asked to
affiliate themselves with the cultural or political values in these sources, but instead to analyze
such documents for the historical information they can yield.
Examples and Sources
KC-3.2.I.A
Religion strengthened Americans’ view of liberty:
§ Sarah Osborn: Sarah Osborn, Memoirs of the Life of Mrs. Sarah Osborn, Who Died in
Newport, (Rhode-Island), on the Second Day of August, 1796 in the Eighty-third Year of
her Age, ed. Samuel Hopkins (Catskill: N. Elliot, 1814), pp. 310–312. Osborn’s diary entry
for April 1, 1767 provides a sample of a typical entry, and mentions her hopes and fears
for colonial Rhode Islanders’ souls in particular.
§ Phillis Wheatley: Phillis Wheatley, “On the Death of Reverend Mr George Whitefield,
—1770” in Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral (London: A. Bell, 1773), pp.
22–24. Wheatley’s book of poems was printed in London rather than in Boston where
she was enslaved, in large part because of her race and condition of enslavement. “On
the Death of Reverend Mr. George Whitefield” highlights Wheatley’s embrace of the
Christian religion.

This activity is built around using Phillis Wheatley’s, “On the Death of the Reverend Mr.
George Whitefield, —1770,” as an example of the philosophical foundations of the American
Revolution. The purpose of this activity is to help students understand how an author’s background can impact their point of view.
Duration: ~20 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
Provide some background information on Phillis Wheatley and a copy of the source.
2.
Ask students to analyze the source specifically for point of view. Guide them to
consider how the author’s background might have influenced what she wrote in this poem.
3.
Ask students to explain which parts of Wheatley’s background are most relevant to what is said in the source.
Conclude with a class discussion that reinforces how someone’s point of view might be
simultaneously influenced by multiple contexts in which they lived. The key is being able to
explain why particular parts of an author’s background are relevant, and therefore valuable, when developing historical understanding.

Increased awareness of inequality:
§ An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery, 1780: “An Act for the Gradual Abolition
of Slavery” (1780). Passed by the Pennsylvania General Assembly on March 1, 1780,
this act was the first extensive abolition act in the United States. Suggested excerpts:

purchasing of Negroes; with some advice thereon, extracted from the epistle of
the yearly-meeting of the people called Quakers held at London in the year 1748”
(Germantown, PA: Printed by Christopher Sower, 1760). Benezet offers evidence that the
African slave trade, and the system of slavery itself, are both destructive to enslaved and
enslaver alike. Suggested excerpt: the last paragraph of page 6 through first paragraph
of page 8 in the first edition or pages 8–10 in the 1760 second edition.
§ Freedom petitions in Massachusetts courts: Prince Hall et al., “Petition for freedom to
the Massachusetts Council and the House of Representatives,” January 13, 1777. In this
petition, signed by Hall and seven other free Black men, the petitioners use natural rights
and Christian ideas popular in the revolutionary era to argue that enslaved people have an inalienable right to freedom.

Claims in Sources
Students will work on identifying and describing a historical claim from a primary source, in this instance the Anthony Benezet document.
Duration: ~20 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
Provide students with a copy of the document, and working in groups, ask students to
highlight the claim about enslavement by Benezet. Guide students through the process
of discretely highlighting only the claim. Some students are inclined to highlight too
much of a source and thus lose sight of the task, so it is important to help them focus on identifying just the claim.
2.
Check for understanding by asking a few groups to share and then identify where
Benezet’s main claims are in the text. Emphasize the need to highlight only the author’s
claims and discuss why specific elements do or do not represent claims.
3.
Ask the groups to describe the claim in their own words.
A crucial element of this activity is reminding students that they always need to describe the
claim in their own words. Too often, students will overquote a document. Taking the time to
show them what effective examples look like is important, particularly early in the year.

foundations of this state constitution. Suggested excerpt: the Preamble and Chapter I,
Sec. 3 (House of Representatives), Art. 4.
§ New Jersey: New Jersey State Constitution (1776). This constitution is notable for
using “they” instead of “he” and not including racial categories in describing who could
vote. The provision would allow women and African Americans who owned the required
property to vote until 1807, when the state legislature limited voting rights to White male
citizens who paid taxes. Suggested excerpt: Article IV, “Voting Qualifications.”
§ Pennsylvania: The Pennsylvania State Constitution (1776). This Constitution reflects the
Declaration of Independence in stressing representative self-government. Suggested
excerpt: the Preamble and the Plan or Frame of Government Sec. 6.

Duration: ~5 mins
Sequence: Start of lesson 1.
Display the first portion of the Virginia Constitution of 1776 (everything from “Whereas
George…” to “…his allegiance & protection”) and ask students to describe what they
see. As students share their ideas, help them see how this document provides a claim
(King George is a tyrant) with a list of evidence to support that claim.
2.
Ask students to think about the period before the Revolution and identify the three
pieces of evidence from the list that best supports the claim. Allow several students to share and discuss their answers.
Close by displaying the section of the Constitution titled “Executive” and explain how the
actions of the king detailed in the beginning of the Constitution contributed to the limits
placed on the executive in this section of the Virginia Constitution and in the Articles of Confederation.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Making Connections
Students read the Constitution and identify evidence of continuity and change in the document.
Duration: ~45 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
As preparation for this activity, ask students to read the full Constitution and create a
list of the topics addressed in each article for homework.
2.
Organize students into groups of three. As a group, ask them to review their homework
and identify a continuity and change in U.S. History reflected in each article of the
Constitution. Provide the following to help students get started.
§ Identify one part of each article that reflects a change in U.S. History.
§ What evidence can you provide to demonstrate this change?
§ Identify one part of each article that reflects the continuity of earlier patterns in U.S. History.
§ What evidence can you provide to demonstrate this continuity?
§ Here is an example to get you started: Article VI states that religious tests shall never
be required to hold government office. This reflects the continuity of valuing religious freedom, like in colonial Pennsylvania.
Students may not be able to identify a continuity and change for each article, and this is okay.
Encourage them to complete as much as they can in the time available. Identifying continuities
may be more challenging for students, so close this activity with a debrief that emphasizes
how the continuity of earlier concerns and values are reflected in the Constitution despite the substantial changes instituted by the document.

Teachers have the flexibility to include in their syllabus primary and secondary sources that
align with local standards and priorities. The following optional sources and activity are not
required AP course content, but are instead simply examples of sources appropriate for a
college-level course. None of the AP Exam questions require students to have studied these
specific sources. These sources represent a variety of persons and perspectives relevant to
U.S. history, rather than an endorsement of their ideas or values. AP students are not asked to
affiliate themselves with the cultural or political values in these sources, but instead to analyze
such documents for the historical information they can yield.
Examples and Sources
KC-3.3.II.B
Challenges from the war between France and Britain:
§ British naval impressment: U.S. Congress, An extract of the Act, entitled “An act, for
the relief and protection of American seamen” (1796). In 1796, Congress passed the
Seamen’s Protection Act, an effort to prevent the impressment of American sailors by
the British navy and to provide procedures in cases of impressment. The fifth and sixth
sections of the act were widely printed and distributed in American seaports to inform
merchant sea captains about how to report impressments from their vessels to U.S.
diplomatic representatives. Suggested excerpt: Section 5.
§ Citizen Genet: Edmond Charles Genet, letter to George Washington, August 13, 1793.
In this letter, the French diplomat Edmund Genet appeals to President Washington for
support in the midst of the “Citizen Genet Affair,” the controversy over Genet’s efforts to
enlist America’s support against Britain in the French Revolutionary Wars.
§ Democratic-Republican Societies: New York Democratic Society, “At a meeting of the
Democratic Society of the City of New-York, on Wednesday, the 28th day of May, 1794”
(1794). Democratic-Republican Societies were founded to support the principles of the
French Revolution and to oppose the Federalist Party and policies of the Washington
administration. Suggested excerpt: the first, fourth (starting “While we heartily”), fifth (“It
has been objected”), and sixth (“To this we reply”) paragraphs.
§ Jay Treaty: James Madison, letter to Robert R. Livingston, August 10, 1795. In this letter,
James Madison reacts to the provisions of the Jay Treaty, particularly the commercial
advantages that it provided Britain. Suggested excerpt: from the second sentence to the
sentence beginning “Many even of those who have hitherto....

Spanish missions in California.
§ San Carlos: Jean-François de Galaup La Pérouse, Monterey in 1786, Life in a California
Mission: the Journals of Jean-François de Galaup La Pérouse (Berkeley: Heyday Books,
1989), pp. 81–82. Jean-François de Galaup La Pérouse was a French explorer who visited
California in 1786. During his visit he noted the similarities between the treatment of
Indigenous people at Spanish missions and enslaved people on Caribbean plantations.
Suggested excerpt: the three paragraphs on pages 81–82 of Chapter 2.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Discussion Groups
Provide students background information about the topic then use this activity to help
students develop a deeper understanding of sourcing. Select one each of the suggested
primary sources for KC-3.3.II.B, KC-3.3.I.E, and KC-3.3.I.D.
Duration: ~30 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
Divide the class into groups of four and have each group read and analyze one of the
selected sources. Assign each group member one of these four sourcing approaches:
Possibilities:
§ POV: What about the author’s background could have influenced what they said in the source?
§ Purpose: What is the objective or goal of the author? What verb captures their motive?
§ Historical Situation: What was happening at the time and in the place where the
source was created? Is it immediate and related to its creation as opposed to broader in scope?
§ Audience: Who is intended as the recipient? How would this affect the reliability of the source?
2.
Afterward, each group should have a brief discussion where students describe and
then explain why their assigned sourcing approach would or wouldn’t be the best fit for
this source. Once they reach a consensus as to which of the four approaches would
be the best option for determining the historical significance of the source, conduct a
class discussion where each group shares their findings.
As a class, discuss the limitations encountered in each of the approaches to sourcing.
Ask students to identify specific limitations they encountered (i.e. what information wasn’t
available for their source) and explain why particular sourcing approaches, depending on the
source at hand, can be more or less valuable for developing historical understanding.

National culture and regional variations:
§ Charles Brockden Brown: Charles Brockden Brown, Wieland: or, the Transformation:
An American Tale (1798). Wieland, Brown’s first major published work, is centered on a
Philadelphia family and considered to be a distinctly American Gothic novel. Suggested
excerpt: the first three pages of Chapter 6.
§ Hector St. John de Crèvecoeur: J. Hector St. John Crevecoeur, “Letter III: What is an
American?” in Letters from an American Farmer, (1782). In this work, the author defines
“an American” as a “new man.” Suggested excerpt: pages 55–56 of the 1904 edition.
§ Federal architecture: William Birch, “Girard’s Bank, late the Bank of the United States,
in Third Street Philadelphia,” 1800. This engraving by artist William Birch shows a street
view of what was then known as “Girard’s Bank,” but was formerly the “Bank of the
United States,” a Federal style building completed in 1797 to house the First Bank of the
United States.
§ Gowan Pamphlet: David Miller, “Manumission of Gowan Pamphlet,” December 16,
1793. This document offers a window into the life of Gowan Pamphlet, America’s first
known ordained Black Baptist preacher (in 1772) and founder of the First Baptist Church
in Williamsburg, Virginia. Inspired by both the Great Awakening and the American
Revolution, Pamphlet preached messages of equality and hope to Black Americans.
§ Charles Willson Peale: Charles Willson Peale, Portrait of Benjamin Franklin, 1789,
Philadelphia History Museum, Philadelphia. Peale painted this portrait of Franklin, the
last completed before Franklin’s death, at the request of the organization he served
as President—Philadelphia’s American Philosophical Society. Peale painted Franklin
with a copy of his publication on his electrical experiment, holding a lightning rod, while lightning strikes in the Philadelphia background.

Help students understand how Topic 3.12 connects to larger patterns in U.S. History. Select
one of the suggested sources and ask students to complete the following steps:
Duration: ~25 mins
Sequence: End of Lesson 1.
Ask students to carefully read the source. On the left hand side of their copy, ask them
to write down the main idea of the source. On the right-hand side, ask them to identify a
significant historical development or process associated with the source.
2.
Working in pairs, ask students to share their findings and make a relevant connection to
a development from an earlier period in U.S. History. When doing this, students should
identify an appropriate reasoning process (comparison, causation, or continuity and
change) for the connection they are making. Ask students to choose and complete a
graphic organizer that works well to analyze this connection. It may be helpful to offer
examples of the types of graphic organizers students might use?
3.
Ask students to write a brief description of the relationship between the historical
development or process associated with the source and the connection they made in
step 2. Remind students that it is important for them to explain why the connection they
made is relevant to the developments in this unit.
Review the students’ work and emphasize that the ability to effectively make connections
between and among historical developments and processes helps us understand the relevance of the events we study.

Building an Argument
Students review content from periods 2 and 3 while practicing their ability to develop claims
supported by evidence. Complete this activity before any unit assessments.
Duration: ~35 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
Display the eight AP Themes (page 21 of the Course and Exam Description) for the
class and briefly review each. Ask each student to select the theme that they feel
changed most significantly in the period from 1607 to 1800. Organize students who
selected the same theme into groups of two to four.
2.
Ask each group to identify two changes and two continuities in the history of the U.S.
during the period from 1607 to 1800 (making sure they are related to the theme their
group selected). Then ask students to draft a thesis statement using the changes and
continuities they identified. If a group is struggling, provide the following sentence
frame as a guide:
§ While there was some continuity related to [insert theme] like [insert examples of
continuity], this period saw major changes like [insert examples of change].
3.
Ask each group to review their notes from periods 2 and 3 to find one specific example of each continuity and each change.
4.
Ask each group member to select one of the examples from step 3 and draft a linkage
statement that explains how the specific example supports the thesis statement.
Debrief this activity by asking a few groups to share their thesis and one or two linkage
statements. Students may struggle to identify accurate and relevant continuities so be
prepared to model how to use specific examples to support an argument. Take a few minutes
to discuss a continuity and some examples for each of the themes your students selected for
this activity to help all of the groups understand this skill.

Spend a class period helping students understand some contexts for this unit. Considering
this unit’s key concepts (previewed below), select one or two for which your students will most need context.
To understand context, your students could examine:
§ Change from and/or continuity with preceding historical developments.
§ Similarities and/or differences with contemporaneous historical developments in different regions or geographical areas.
Whenever possible, draw upon students’ relevant prior knowledge, and anchor this
contextualization lesson in historical source material of varying formats such as visuals,
data, or written texts, or conduct an activity that engages students in exploring context.

Duration: ~25 mins
Sequence: Start of lesson 1.
Inform students they will be reviewing broad developments related to United States
expansion in the period from 1783 to 1800 to provide context for the specific
developments they will study in the period from 1800 to 1848.
2.
Divide students into groups and provide the following examples of broad historical
developments and processes that influenced expansion in the late eighteenth century:
Indigenous resistance, westward migration, American identity, land treaties/negotiation, and Northwest Ordinance.
3.
Groups select two of the events or developments and brainstorm how their selected
events connect to the expansion of the United States from 1783 to 1800.
4.
Groups share the results of their brainstorm and describe how their selected
developments connect to the broader process of expansion in the period.
Close by briefly describing the major developments of period 4 and explain how they are
situated within the broader context of United States expansion. Ask a few students to predict
how the developments and processes they discussed in this activity will connect to the events they study in period 4.

specific sources. These sources represent a variety of persons and perspectives relevant to
U.S. history, rather than an endorsement of their ideas or values. AP students are not asked to
affiliate themselves with the cultural or political values in these sources, but instead to analyze
such documents for the historical information they can yield.
Examples and Sources
KC-4.1.I.A
National debates:
§ Embargo Act of 1807: “An Act laying an Embargo on all ships and vessels in the ports
and harbors of the United States,” December 22, 1807. This legislation restricted

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY

This activity is built around John J. Barralet’s and Benjamin Tanner’s “America guided by
wisdom An allegorical representation of the United States depicting their independence and
prosperity” as an example of a growing American presence on the world stage. The purpose
of this activity is to help students practice sourcing.
Duration: ~20 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
Provide students with a copy of the source.
2.
Since the goal of this activity is to explain (not merely identify), share the following
sentence starters:
§ Point of view: Created by an American artist in the aftermath of the War of 1812, the
print conveys a positive perspective on the United States by…
§ Purpose: The print seeks to convince the viewer of the prosperity of the United
States by…
§ Historical situation: In the aftermath of the War of 1812, the United States …
§ Audience: The print may have been primarily designed to communicate with an
American audience of… 3.
Working in pairs, ask students to complete the sentences above so they can focus on their explanation.
Possible answers:
§ POV: …showing the American seal illuminated by rays of sunlight; showing America
being guided by Roman gods who represented wisdom and trade; depicting a
triumphant military leader on horseback in front of a grand and majestic neoclassical building.
§ Purpose: …depicting an abundance of fruit, vegetables, and other objects produced
by the work of American women and men and ready for trade with countries
overseas; depicting a grand and majestic neoclassical building that would have required significant prosperity to erect.
§ Historical situation: …was eager to engage in trade with other nations and expand
its influence despite the ambiguous outcome of the war, which did little to address
Americans’ concerns about these issues. The ocean-going ships in the harbor
and symbols of prosperity like the cornucopia reflect this ambition for trade and international influence.
§ Audience: … people who could afford the sort of education in classical mythology
and European culture that would enable them to recognize the images, symbols,
and words in this print. However, the artist may have also reached a larger audience
by including easily recognizable symbols like the flag and George Washington and
explanations of the lesser-known symbols in the caption.

Conclude with a class discussion focused on explaining that when they are sourcing, students
must go beyond mere identification and get to how the sourcing approach is reflected in
the document. Note that they will continue to work on this skill, eventually focusing on why
their analysis of the source is significant to their arguments in essays. Another key point to
emphasize is that students will need to select which sourcing approach is most valuable when it comes to developing historical understanding.

Start by providing the following prompt and lead a brief discussion with students about
how it connects to Topic 4.5 in the Course Framework:
§ Evaluate the extent to which the market revolution changed American society in the early 19th century.
2.
Because this activity is only about supporting an argument and not creating an
argument, provide students with three options that contain portions of thesis
statements. Students will select one of these to use for step 4.
§ business leaders transformed American society through the creation of industrial workspaces
§ manufacturing processes fundamentally altered labor opportunities
§ urban spaces continued to be centers of economic opportunity 3.
Ask students to read Samuel Slater’s letter to Moses Brown.
4.
Divide students into pairs and ask them to brainstorm ways they could connect pieces
of historical evidence from the source to the example they selected in step 2. Be sure
to highlight the elements found in each thesis excerpt such as “industrial work spaces,”
“labor opportunities,” and “urban spaces” that connect to the information found in the source.
5.
Ask students to write individual linkage statements that explain how the historical
evidence selected from the source supports the thesis excerpt they selected.
Close the activity by leading a discussion about why relevant evidence needs to connect to
and support a thesis, as opposed to simply being relevant evidence generally related to a prompt.

§ Age requirements (i.e. no minors) § Racial restrictions (i.e. only White men) § Gender restrictions (i.e. only males) 4.
Lead a discussion about how the removal of some voting qualifications and increased
participation represented the expansion of democracy and led to the Age of Jackson being called the “Era of the Common Man.”
Conclude the activity by asking students to explain how the creation of universal White
manhood suffrage demonstrates a change in American society, even though political power
was still limited. Debrief with a discussion that emphasizes the complexities of the expanding
American democracy. Remind students that democratic practices, including suffrage, could

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Making and Explaining Connections
Students read Charles G. Finney’s “Sermon I, Sinners bound to change their own hearts” to
make and explain relevant connections between the Second Great Awakening and Topic 2.7 (i.e. First Great Awakening under KC-2.2.I.A).
Duration: ~40 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
For homework, ask students to read and take notes on their textbook’s coverage of the
Second Great Awakening and review the coverage of the First Great Awakening.
2.
Organize students in pairs and ask them to briefly review their homework while making
relevant connections between the two social/religious movements. Provide the following questions to help students get started:
§ How were the First and Second Great Awakening similar?
§ How were they different?
3.
Provide students with a copy of the source and ask them to answer these questions as
they read:
§ What is the main connection you can make between the source and the Second
Great Awakening?
§ What is the main connection you can make between the source and the First Great
Awakening?
§ What evidence can you provide from your homework assignment to support either connection?
§ What makes these connections relevant?
4.
To go deeper, ask students to focus on explaining these connections by writing two or
three sentences that answer each of the following questions:
§ How does this source relate to the Second Great Awakening?
§ How does this source relate to the First Great Awakening?
§ Why would American Protestants during the Second Great Awakening get involved in reform movements?
5.
If you would like to extend this activity, point out that the next topic will discuss reform movements. Then ask students:
§ How could one make a relevant and insightful connection across periods that might
demonstrate a complex understanding of reform movements?
§ How could one use the Second Great Awakening as context for reform movements?
Explaining relevant connections instead of merely making them will be more challenging
for students, so close this activity with a debrief that emphasizes how the First and Second
Great Awakenings relate to one another. For example, point out that a major similarity is that
they both influenced other historical developments—the First Great Awakening impacted
the American Revolution while the Second Great Awakening influenced reform movements.

U.S. History Themes found on page 21 of this Course and Exam Description.
Duration: ~20 mins
Sequence: End of lesson 1.
Ask students to read the source and respond to the following questions independently.
§ Which AP U.S. History Theme does this source most relate to?
§ Why did you choose this theme?
§ What can this source teach you about the theme you chose?
§ Does this source provide evidence of a cause or effect related to this theme?
2.
Ask students to compare their work to a classmate that chose the same theme. Guide
them to take a second look at the source to see if they can find evidence of both cause and effect related to the theme.
Ask a few students to share their work and discuss how historians use primary sources to
learn about both cause and effect in the past. If the theme most students chose to focus on
is different from the Thematic Focus for this topic (Geography and the Environment) extend
the discussion by asking students if the source is helpful for learning about the theme of Geography and the Environment as well.

UNIT 4
OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Self/Peer Revision
Students review content from period 4 while drafting and refining essay outlines to develop
their ability to use historical reasoning to structure their arguments.
Duration: ~50 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
Display the AP U.S. History Reasoning Processes from this Course and Exam
Description (page 17). Discuss each process, give examples, and emphasize the
importance of using one of these approaches to structure their argument in essays.
2.
Organize students into pairs and assign each group member one of the prompts below.
§ Evaluate the relative importance of causes of reform activity in the United States in the period from 1800 to 1848.
§ To what extent did political parties contribute to the development of national unity in the United States between 1790 and 1840?
3.
Working independently, ask each student to draft three thesis statements for their
prompt, one for each reasoning process. To help students get started, provide the
following example:
§ Evaluate the extent to which changes in electoral politics influenced the development of democracy between 1820 and 1840.
§ Comparison: Changes in electoral politics significantly expanded democracy for
White men, but the impact was much different for women and African Americans because they didn’t receive the right to vote.
§ Causation: The expansion of voting rights to all White men led to political campaigning by candidates for government offices.
§ Continuity and Change: In the period from 1820 to 1840 the number of people
involved in the political process increased through the expansion of access to
voting and more participation in reform movements. However, the function of the
government in the period largely remained consistent.
4.
Ask students to take turns sharing their thesis statements with their partner. Ask the
groups to discuss each thesis and decide which approach they believe is best for
organizing an essay in response to each prompt. Instruct partners to provide feedback
on the selected thesis statements so the original author can refine and improve their thesis.
5.
Ask students to independently draft an outline or complete a graphic organizer for the
essay based on the thesis they selected and refined in step 4. Instruct students to take
turns sharing their outlines and provide feedback on how well their partner used the
reasoning process to organize their essay. Ask students to revise their outlines based on their partner’s feedback.
Debrief this activity by leading a discussion about the importance of planning ahead when
writing essays. Emphasize that, as the author, they can choose the reasoning process(es) they
feel is best, but the essay must be organized and coherent.

PREVIEW: UNIT 5 KEY CONCEPTS
KC-5.2
Intensified by expansion and deepening regional divisions, debates over slavery and other economic, cultural, and political issues led the nation into civil war.
KC-5.2.I
Ideological and economic differences over slavery produced an array of diverging responses from Americans in the North and the South.
KC-5.2.II
Debates over slavery came to dominate political discussion in the 1850s, culminating in the bitter election of 1860 and the secession of Southern states.
KC-5.3
The Union victory in the Civil War and the contested reconstruction of the South settled the issues of slavery and secession, but left unresolved many questions about the power of the federal government and citizenship rights.
KC-5.3.I
The North’s greater manpower and industrial resources, the leadership of Abraham Lincoln and others, and the decision to emancipate enslaved people eventually led to the Union military victory over the Confederacy in the devastating
Civil War.
KC-5.3.II.i
Reconstruction and the Civil War ended slavery, altered relationships between the states and the federal government, and led to debates over new definitions of citizenship, particularly regarding the rights of African Americans, women, and other minorities.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Explaining Historical Context
In this activity students practice contextualizing by using developments in period 4 to contextualize the Civil War.
Duration: ~30 mins
Sequence: End of lesson 1.
Show students the “Unit at a Glance” for Period 4 in this Course and Exam Description.
Remind them that Period 4 covered the years 1800–1848 which included part of the pre-war period.
2.
Divide students into groups and assign each group one of the following broad developments or processes from before Period 5.
§ Westward expansion § Regional differences § Political controversies and compromises 3.
Ask each group to write a sentence on the board—using the broad development
they were given—to explain why the pre-war period can be considered a “Road to the
Civil War.” 4.
Ask the entire class to choose the best response and then brainstorm one specific
piece of historical evidence connected to the response they chose.
5.
Show students the “Unit at a Glance” for Period 5 in this Course and Exam Description
and ask them to focus on topics 5.2–5.7 to identify how each can be related to the broad developments and processes from Step 2.
Possible answers:
§ Westward expansion: Topic 5.2 (Manifest Destiny) and Topic 5.3 (The Mexican–
American War)
§ Regional differences: Topic 5.5 (Sectional Conflict: Regional Differences)
§ Political controversies and compromises: Topic 5.4 (The Compromise of 1850), Topic
5.6 (Failure of Compromise), and 5.7 (Election of 1860 and Secession) 6.
As a class, write a few sentences that explain how the Civil War, which will be covered in
Topics 5.8 and 5.9, may have been influenced by events, developments, or processes
unfolding in the nation during period 4 and the first part of period 5.
Conclude the activity with a class prediction of how the Mexican–American War may have
influenced the Civil War. Remind students that historical context is established through broad
developments and processes, but is ultimately explained with specific pieces of evidence

Geography and the Environment GEO
Geographic and environmental factors, including competition over and debates
about natural resources, shape the development of America and foster regional
diversity. The development of America impacts the environment and reshapes
geography, which leads to debates about environmental and geographic issues.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Unit 5: Learning Objective B
Explain the causes and effects of westward expansion from 1844 to 1877.
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTS
KC-5.1.I.A
The desire for access to natural and mineral resources and the hope of many settlers for economic opportunities or religious refuge led to an increased migration to and settlement in the West.
KC-5.1.I.B
Advocates of annexing western lands argued that Manifest Destiny and the superiority of American institutions compelled the United
States to expand its borders westward to the Pacific Ocean; however, this frequently provoked competition and violent conflict.
KC-5.1.I.D
Westward migration was boosted during and after the Civil War by the passage of new legislation promoting western transportation and economic development.
KC-5.1.I.E
U.S. interest in expanding trade led to economic, diplomatic, and cultural initiatives to create more ties with Asia.

OPTIONAL SOURCES
Teachers have the flexibility to include in their syllabus primary and secondary sources that
align with local standards and priorities. The following optional sources and activity are not
required AP course content, but are instead simply examples of sources appropriate for a
college-level course. None of the AP Exam questions require students to have studied these
specific sources. These sources represent a variety of persons and perspectives relevant to
U.S. history, rather than an endorsement of their ideas or values. AP students are not asked to
affiliate themselves with the cultural or political values in these sources, but instead to analyze
such documents for the historical information they can yield.
Examples and Sources
KC-5.1.I.A
Increased migration to and settlement in the West:
§ Mormon Migration: Brigham Young, “The Pioneers – Capabilities and Settlement of the
Great Basin – Exhortation to Faithfulness” (speech, Salt Lake City, July 24, 1852). In this
speech at the Mormon Tabernacle in Salt Lake City, Young commemorates the 5-year anniversary of the first Mormon settlers in Utah.
§ Pacific Mail Steamship Company: “On Board the Pacific Mail Steamship ‘Alaska’,”
Harper’s Weekly, May 20, 1876, pp. 408–409. University of California, Berkeley, Bancroft
Library. This drawing depicts the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, which operated
routes from San Francisco to Hong Kong, Yokohama, and Shanghai, carrying many Asian
immigrants to California in the second half of the 19th century.
§ Willamette Valley: Elijah Bristow, letter to his family, April 4, 1847, in Illinois Journal,
November 11, 1847. This letter is from one of the first emigrants in Oregon’s Willamette
Valley to his family in Illinois. He describes the resources in Oregon and economic
opportunity for emigrants, as well as the difficulties emigrants face.
§ Luzena Wilson: Luzena Wilson, “Luzena Stanley Wilson, ‘49er: Memories Recalled Years
Later for her Daughter Correnah Wilson Wright” (1937). In these memoirs, Wilson recalls
her migration to California and experiences during the Gold Rush. Suggested excerpts:
Chapter 2 and the beginning of Chapter 6 to the paragraph ending “…I retired from active business in the kitchen.”
KC-5.1.I.B
Advocates of annexing western lands:
§ John O’Sullivan: John O’Sullivan, “Annexation,” The United States Magazine and
Democratic Review, Volume 17 (New York: 1845), 5–10. In this article, O’Sullivan, the
editor of the Democratic Review, coins the term Manifest Destiny and argues that the
U.S. is destined to control Texas, California, and all of North America.
§ James K. Polk: James K. Polk, “Inaugural Address” (speech, Washington, D.C., March
4, 1845). Polk’s 1845 inaugural address promotes expansion through the annexation of
Texas. Suggested excerpt: The second half of the speech beginning with “The Republic of Texas has made...”

§ Francis A. Walker: Francis A. Walker, The Indian Question (Boston: James R.
Osgood and Co., 1874), pp. 62–82, 98–100. In this book, Walker, an Army officer and
Commissioner of Indian Affairs, outlines his preferred policy of solving the “Indian
Question” by forcing Indigenous people onto reservations and gradually instructing them in “civilization.”
KC-5.1.I.E
Initiatives to create more ties with Asia:
§ Treaty of Kanagawa: Millard Fillmore, “From Millard Fillmore, President of the United
States of America, to His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of Japan, November 13, 1852,”
in Narrative of the Expedition of an American Squadron to China and Japan, compiled by
Francis L. Hawks (Washington, D.C.: A.O.P. Nicholson, 1856), vol. 1, pp. 256–259. In this
letter, which would lead to the Treaty of Kanagawa, Fillmore asks the Emperor of Japan to open trade with the United States.
§ Treaty of Wangxia: “Treaty of Peace, Amity, and Commerce, Between the United States
of America and the Chinese Empire,” July 3, 1844. This is the first official treaty between
the United States and China, which China agreed to after the Opium War (1839–1842)
against Great Britain. Suggested excerpts: Articles XVIII, XIX, XXI, XXX and XXXII.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Explaining Historical Events through Maps
In this activity students explain the historical concept of Manifest Destiny using John
O’Sullivan’s “Annexation.”
Duration: ~40 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
For homework, ask students to read their textbook’s coverage of the concept of
Manifest Destiny. Then, in class, provide all students with a blank political map of North
America and have them pair up to complete this activity.
2.
Ask students to label and demarcate each of the following areas associated with
Manifest Destiny:
a.	 Texas b.	 California c.	 Utah Territory d.	 New Mexico Territory e.	 Oregon Country 3.
Ask students to describe one or two specific reasons why many Americans advocated
for westward expansion in each of these regions and add those reasons to the map.
Students should use the notes taken from reading their textbook. Allow them to
reference their textbook and/or the internet in class if they are missing information about any of the areas.
Possible answers:
§ Texas: plantation agriculture
§ California: gold and trade with Asia
§ Utah: religious freedom 4.
Ask them to read the O’Sullivan source for the overall ideological motivations it reveals
and to develop a deeper understanding of the concept. Ask each pair to write two
sentences at the top of their map explaining the historical concept of Manifest Destiny.
To conclude, ask at least two pairs of students to share their explanation of how the concept
of Manifest Destiny was used to justify westward expansion during the 1840s. This visual
representation can serve as a quick way to review the historical concept of Manifest Destiny.

Examples and Sources
KC-5.1.I.C
Questions about the status of slavery:
§ Frederick Douglass: Frederick Douglass, “War with Mexico,” North Star, January 21,
1848. In this article from the abolitionist newspaper North Star, Douglass argues against
the Mexican–American War, linking it to the interests of enslavers. Suggested excerpt:
the first half of the article.
§ Henry David Thoreau: Henry David Thoreau, “On the Duty of Civil Disobedience”
(1849). Thoreau, writing amidst the Mexican–American War, expresses his opposition
to the war, slavery, and government policy. Suggested excerpts: paragraphs 7 (“How
does it become a man...”) to 11 (“Practically speaking, the opponents of reform...”) and
paragraph 21 (“I do not hesitate to say”) to 23 (“Under a government which imprisons...”).
KC-5.1.I.C and KC-5.1.II.C
Indigenous people and Mexican Americans in the newly acquired lands:
§ Californios: Richard Henry Dana, Jr., Two Years Before the Mast: A Personal Narrative
(Boston: Fields, Osgood and Co., 1869), pp. 92–93. Dana relates his observations on the
culture of the Californios – descendants of Spanish and Mexican settlers. Suggested
excerpt: the text that begins with the paragraph that starts “The men in Monterey
appeared…” on page 92 (near the end of Chapter XII).
§ Juan Cortina: Juan Nepomuceno Cortina, “Juan Nepomuceno Cortina to the
Inhabitants of the State of Texas, and especially to those of the City of Brownsville,”
in Difficulties on the Southwestern Frontier, 36th Congress, 1st session, 1860, House
Executive Document, 52, pp. 70–72. Cortina issued this proclamation in 1859 after
declaring the Republic of the Rio Grande independent from Texas and the United States.
In this proclamation, Cortina lists the grievances of Mexicans living under American rule in Texas.
§ Comanchería: Antonie Marschull (Mrs. Ernest Marschull), Treaty of Peace by John
O. Meusebach and Colonist with the Comanche Indians, March 2, 1847, Texas State
Library and Archives Commission. Meusebach organized a German settlement in Texas
between the Llano and Colorado rivers, a region under the control of the Comanche. He
met with ten Comanche leaders in 1847 to create and sign the Meusebach-Comanche
Treaty.

Duration: ~30 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
Ask students to carefully read the sources and identify one similarity between the main
ideas in each. Guide students in underlining or highlighting the section in each source where they see a similarity.
Possible answers:
§ Both sources address treatment of Mexicans and Mexican Americans by Anglo
Americans.
§ Both sources characterize some actions as criminal (e.g., stealing lands and animals, etc.).
2.
Ask students to identify one difference between the main ideas in each source. Instruct
students to circle or, using another color, highlight the section in each source where they see a difference.
Possible answer:
§ While Cortina supports separation from the United States, Vallejo is more receptive
to being affiliated with the American political and economic systems.
3.
Ask a few students to share their responses and briefly describe the most significant change for individuals of Mexican ancestry.
Close the activity with a class debrief. Review the timeline of conflicts between Mexico and
the United States from 1836 to 1848, highlighting how questions arose about the status of
individuals of Mexican ancestry after the U.S. acquired these western territories. Emphasize
that making comparisons between sources is a useful approach to understanding historical
developments, such as effects of military conflicts on particular populations.

Teachers have the flexibility to include in their syllabus primary and secondary sources that
align with local standards and priorities. The following optional sources and activity are not
required AP course content, but are instead simply examples of sources appropriate for a
college-level course. None of the AP Exam questions require students to have studied these
specific sources. These sources represent a variety of persons and perspectives relevant to
U.S. history, rather than an endorsement of their ideas or values. AP students are not asked to
affiliate themselves with the cultural or political values in these sources, but instead to analyze
such documents for the historical information they can yield.
Examples and Sources

Controversy over slavery:
§ Jane Swisshelm: Jane G. Swisshelm, “Mrs. Swisshelm’s Letters…No. 11, Washington –
Ross’s Speech – Compromises Generally – Harris’s Speech,” New-York Daily Tribune,
April 15, 1850, p 1. An abolitionist and women’s rights advocate, Swisshelm was
the owner and editor of the Pittsburgh Saturday Visiter. In this article (available from
the Library of Congress), Swisshelm questions the value of compromise when it
perpetuates the enslavement of people. Suggested excerpt: the second half of the article.
§ Daniel Webster: Daniel Webster, “Seventh of March Speech” (speech, Washington D.C.,
March 7, 1850). Webster gave this address in support of the Compromise of 1850. It was
a direct response to John C. Calhoun’s speech “Union, or Disunion?” that opposed the
admission of California as a free state. Suggested excerpt: the beginning of the speech
to the sentence ending “...I shall have accomplished little” and from the paragraph
beginning “Now, Sir, upon the general nature and influence of slavery…” to the paragraph
ending “…which find vent and support in different parts of the Union.”

Duration: ~30 mins
Sequence: End of lesson 1.
Ask students to read the source independently and write one sentence describing the historical development addressed in the source.
2.
Ask students to compare their sentences with a classmate and discuss which AP
Theme (page 21) is most relevant to this development.
3.
Randomly assign each pair of students an AP Theme that is different from the one they selected in step 2.
4.
Tell students to use their class notes or textbook to identify and describe a historical
development related to the new theme that is happening at the same time or just before the development addressed in the source.
5.
With their partners, ask students to draft a one paragraph response to this prompt:
§ Does understanding the historical development you described in step 4 provide a
broader picture that helps you better understand the source? Why or why not?
Close this activity by discussing how to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant events
when considering the historical context of a particular development. Ask a few students to
share their paragraphs and lead a discussion about how placing events in context helps us better understand historical developments.

are many possibilities, items to look for include: difference in enslaved populations,
socioeconomic status, and various reactions to specific events such as Lincoln’s election.
3.
Distribute individual copies of the cartoon and ask students to identify one reason why
many people in the western portion of Virginia might have disagreed with secession
and what the cartoon implies about the process associated with secession.
4.
Instruct students to contextualize Southern states’ secessions by referencing broader
historical processes and their relationship to these secessions. Their answers should
be three to four sentences long and should also use at least two pieces of specific
evidence to explain secession. Encourage students to use the information from steps 1 and 2 to help formulate a response.

the effects of the rebellion, and creating bread riots,” May 23, 1863. As a result of
economic hardship brought on by the Civil War, about 5,000 people (mostly women)
sacked shops and stores in Richmond, Virginia. This illustration from a New York newspaper depicts the unrest.
KC-5.3.I.D
Confederate successes:
§ Battles of Bull Run/Manassas: Solomon Bamberger, Map of the Battles of Bull Run Near
Manassas (Richmond: West & Johnston, 1861). The battlefield located along the small
stream in northern Virginia is known by two different names, Bull Run and Manassas.
On July 21, 1861 Union and Confederate forces clashed resulting in a Union retreat. On
August 29 and 30, 1862, Union and Confederate forces again clashed in that area and again, Union forces retreated.
§ Fort Sumter: George T. Perry, Part of Charleston Harbor, embracing forts Moultrie,
Sumter, Johnson, and Castle Pinckney, also Sullivan, James & Morris islands; and
showing the position of the Star of the West, when fired into from Morris Island, [map]
(Philadelphia: P.S. Duval & Son, 1861). On April 12, 1861, after negotiations and attempts
to resupply failed, Confederate forces fired on the fort, starting the military phase of the
Civil War. Ft. Sumter stayed under Confederate control until February 22, 1865.
§ Robert E. Lee: George B. McClellan, letter to Edwin Stanton, June 28, 1862 in The War
of the Rebellion, A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate
Armies, Series I, Volume XI, Part I (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1884),
p. 61. The Peninsula Campaign, of 1862, was an attempt by Union General George B.
McClellan to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond. Lee received the command
of Confederate forces during the campaign and won his first battle against the Union
at Gaines’ Mill, effectively stopping the Union advance to Richmond. In this letter to
Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, McClellan discusses his loss to Lee’s forces.

The development of and debates about democracy, freedom, citizenship, diversity,
and individualism shape American national identity, cultural values, and beliefs about
American exceptionalism, and in turn, these ideas shape political institutions and
society. Throughout American history, notions of national identity and culture have
coexisted with varying degrees of regional and group identities.

Explain how Lincoln’s leadership during the Civil
War impacted American ideals over the course of the war.
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTS
KC-5.3.I.B
Lincoln and most Union supporters began the Civil War to preserve the Union, but
Lincoln’s decision to issue the Emancipation
Proclamation reframed the purpose of the war and helped prevent the Confederacy from gaining full diplomatic support from European powers. Many African Americans fled southern plantations and enlisted in the Union Army, helping to undermine the Confederacy.
KC-5.3.I.C
Lincoln sought to reunify the country and used speeches such as the Gettysburg
Address to portray the struggle against slavery as the fulfillment of America’s founding democratic ideals.

If you selected Susie King Taylor as an example of African American service in the Union Army,
use this activity to help students understand the importance of considering the author’s point of view when reading historical documents.
Duration: ~15 mins
Sequence: End of lesson 1.
Provide students with this brief bulleted biography of the author.
§ Taylor was born into slavery in Savannah, Georgia.
§ Georgia restricted education for enslaved people; however Taylor’s grandmother
arranged for her to attend secret schools where she learned to read and write.
§ Taylor escaped slavery with her uncle by fleeing to the Union Army.
§ Taylor supported the African American First South Carolina Regiment of the Union
Army as a laundress, nurse, and educator.

Unit 5: Learning Objective K
Explain the effects of government policy during
Reconstruction on society from 1865 to 1877.
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTS
KC-5.3.II.ii
Reconstruction altered relationships between the states and the federal government and led to debates over new definitions of citizenship, particularly regarding the rights of African
Americans, women, and other minorities.
KC-5.3.II.A
The 13th Amendment abolished slavery, while the 14th and 15th amendments granted
African Americans citizenship, equal protection under the laws, and voting rights.
KC-5.3.II.B
The women’s rights movement was both emboldened and divided over the 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution.
KC-5.3.II.C
Efforts by radical and moderate Republicans to change the balance of power between
Congress and the presidency and to reorder race relations in the defeated South yielded some short-term successes. Reconstruction opened up political opportunities and other leadership roles to formerly enslaved persons but it ultimately failed, due both to determined
Southern resistance and the North’s waning resolve.

Reconstruction resulted in continuity and change in regional and national understandings of what it meant to be American.
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTS
KC-5.3.II.D
Southern plantation owners continued to own the majority of the region’s land even after
Reconstruction. Formerly enslaved persons sought land ownership but generally fell short of self-sufficiency, as an exploitative and soil-intensive sharecropping system limited blacks’ and poor whites’ access to land in the South.
KC-5.3.II.E
Segregation, violence, Supreme Court decisions, and local political tactics progressively stripped away African American rights, but the 14th and 15th amendments eventually became the basis for court decisions upholding civil rights in the 20th century.

Examples and Sources
5.3.II.D:
Sharecropping:
§ Charles Roberts and Cooper Hughs: Isham G. Bailey, contract with Cooper Hughs, and
Charles Roberts, January 1, 1867. This contract is a representative example of the type
of agreement forged between newly freedpeople and plantation owners in the years after the Civil War.
KC-5.3.II.E
Segregation, violence, Supreme Court decisions, and local political tactics:
§ Convict leasing systems: Journal of the House of Representatives of the State of
Mississippi at a Regular Session Thereof, Convened in the City of Jackson, January 5,
1875 (Jackson: Pilot Publishing, 1875), p. 305. Six African American representatives to
the Mississippi House wrote a statement protesting a bill to expand the convict lease
system. The short “Explanation of Vote” has their four reasons for opposing the bill.
§ Camilla Massacre: Philip Joiner, affidavit taken by O.H. Howard, Albany Georgia,
September 23, 1868. In April 1868, thirty-three African American men were elected
to the state legislature. White representatives expelled the African American
representatives in early September of 1868. One of them, Philip Joiner, organized a
march from Albany, Georgia to Camilla to protest the unconstitutional expulsion. Local
White citizens in Camilla fired upon the marchers, killing between nine and fifteen people
and wounding about forty others. In this affidavit, Joiner recounts the event.
§ Ku Klux Klan: Thomas Nast, “The Union as it was, The lost cause, worse than slavery,”
Harper’s Weekly, October 24, 1874, 878. On December 24, 1865, six former officers
of the Confederacy formed a fraternal group that became an anti-African American,
anti-Catholic, and anti-foreigner organization. This group used intimidation, terror, and
physical violence to repress the African American population. This image captures
Nast’s concerns about the Ku Klux Klan.
§ Slaughterhouse Cases: Eric Foner, Reconstruction: America’s Unfinished Revolution:
1863–1877 (New York: History Book Club, 2005), pp. 529–534. Foner explains the
impact of the Slaughterhouse Cases on federal action and policy during Reconstruction.

Arising from the 1873 Colfax Massacre in Louisiana where between 70 and 150
African Americans were killed to prevent political organizing, the Supreme Court
held in U.S. v. Cruikshank that the 14th Amendment did not reach the action

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Unit 5: Learning Objective M
Compare the relative significance of the effects of the Civil War on
American values.
REVIEW: UNIT 5 KEY CONCEPTS
KC-5.2
Intensified by expansion and deepening regional divisions, debates over slavery and other economic, cultural, and political issues led the nation into civil war.
KC-5.2.I
Ideological and economic differences over slavery produced an array of diverging responses from Americans in the North and the South.
KC-5.2.II
Debates over slavery came to dominate political discussion in the 1850s, culminating in the bitter election of 1860 and the secession of Southern states.
KC-5.3
The Union victory in the Civil War and the contested reconstruction of the South settled the issues of slavery and secession, but left unresolved many questions about the power of the federal government and citizenship rights.
KC-5.3.I
The North’s greater manpower and industrial resources, the leadership of Abraham Lincoln and others, and the decision to emancipate enslaved people eventually led to the Union military victory over the Confederacy in the devastating
Civil War.
KC-5.3.II.i
Reconstruction and the Civil War ended slavery, altered relationships between the states and the federal government, and led to debates over new definitions of citizenship, particularly regarding the rights of African Americans, women, and other minorities.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Self/Peer Revision
Students work together to review and refine draft essays, developing their ability to construct
and support arguments using historical reasoning. They will review content from period 5 by
drafting and refining an essay about the causes of the Civil War.
Duration: ~50 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
In preparation, ask students to draft an essay in response to the following prompt (since
this activity occurs mid-way through the course, the complexity requirement is omitted
to support the incremental development of skills).
§ Respond to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a line of reasoning.
§ Describe a broader historical context relevant to the prompt.
§ Support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant examples of evidence.
§ Use historical reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, continuity or change) to frame
or structure an argument that addresses the prompt.
§ Evaluate the extent to which debates over slavery in the period from 1830 to 1860 led the United States into the Civil War.
2.
Organize the class into pairs. Ask students to read essay sample 3A from the 2019 LEQ
3 found on AP Central and then discuss how well the response did each of the following.
§ Respond to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a line of reasoning.
§ Describe a broader historical context relevant to the prompt.
§ Support an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant examples of evidence.
§ Use historical reasoning (e.g., comparison, causation, continuity or change) to frame
or structure an argument that addresses the prompt.
3.
Discuss sample 3A with the class. Ask students to explain how the essay does each of
the bullets above. A scoring commentary for this essay is available on AP Central; this may be helpful for the discussion.
4.
Now ask students to take turns reading and discussing their draft essays. Ask them to
work together to refine and improve each others’ essays.
Collect the revised draft essays. Review them and provide each student with feedback. Allow
students to revise their essays based on your feedback. Collect the second draft of the
essays and review them to gauge your students’ progress toward developing contextualized
arguments that are thesis driven, supported by evidence, and structured using historical reasoning.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Explaining Historical Context
Students will create a graphic organizer to review content from periods 1–5 and predict how
earlier historical developments might provide helpful context for understanding change and continuity in period 6.
Duration: ~20 mins
Sequence: Start of lesson 1.
Draw a horizontal timeline across your white board. Begin with 1491 and end with 1877.
Identify the beginning of period 6 on the timeline by drawing a long vertical line at 1865
from the top of the board to the timeline. To indicate the major historical developments
in period 6, list the titles of topics 6.2 to 6.13 immediately to the right of this line in a
column. Now add a few major events and developments to the timeline from periods
1–5. Include events that are both directly relevant to period 6 (like the market revolution
and Manifest Destiny) and events that are less relevant (like the Columbian Exchange and Northwest Ordinance).
2.
Divide students into pairs and ask them to discuss how the developments on the
horizontal timeline from before 1865 might help them understand the historical
developments in period 6, listed to the right of the vertical line at 1865.
3.
Ask each pair to respond to the prompt below in a few sentences.
§ Predict how one development from before 1865 might help us understand a change
or continuity related to one of the developments from the period after 1865.
Circulate the room to check the students’ work. Ask a few students with accurate predictions
to come to the board and draw a line connecting the two developments they selected
and share their prediction. Conclude by briefly explaining how some developments on the
horizontal timeline are more relevant to period 6 than others.

OPTIONAL SOURCES
Teachers have the flexibility to include in their syllabus primary and secondary sources that
align with local standards and priorities. The following optional sources and activity are not
required AP course content, but are instead simply examples of sources appropriate for a
college-level course. None of the AP Exam questions require students to have studied these
specific sources. These sources represent a variety of persons and perspectives relevant to
U.S. history, rather than an endorsement of their ideas or values. AP students are not asked to
affiliate themselves with the cultural or political values in these sources, but instead to analyze
such documents for the historical information they can yield.
Examples and Sources
KC-6.1.III.A
Improvements in mechanization:
§ Mechanically produced barbed wire: Frederic Remington, The Fall of the Cowboy,
1895, Amon Carter Museum of American Art. This painting, illustrates the end of an era,
in part brought about by the advent of barbed wire. Barbed wire, invented in 1873, was
widely used in the West to enclose private farm land. These fenced barriers made the
open range ranching and cattle drives of the past impractical.
§ Steam-powered tractors: John Deere & Company, “New Deal Gang Plow with Traction
Engine Advertisement,” State Historical Society of Iowa, 1889. While John Deere didn’t
manufacture tractors until after the turn of the century, they did produce “gang plows”
for use with steam powered tractors. In this advertisement for plows suitable for use with
steam powered tractors, John Deere highlights both the benefits and limitations of the new technology.
KC-6.1.III.B
Local and regional cooperative organizations:
§ Colored Farmers’ Alliance: Rev. J.L. Moore, “The Florida Colored Farmer’s Alliance,
1891,” National Economist, March 7, 1891. While farmers’ organizations in this period
are commonly associated with the West, the movement was extensive in the South as
well. In this letter, the Rev. J.L. Moore argues that the needs of Black workers are ignored
at the ballot box and calls for the creation of a new party for farmers and laborers, irrespective of race.
§ Farmers’ Alliance: The Industrial Struggle: A History of the Farmers Alliance and Its Work
From Its Incipient Stages in 1879 to the Culmination of a perfect National Organization,
Oct. 14, 1880 (Chicago: The Western Rural, 1893), p. 88. This source from a member
of the Farmers’ Alliance offers a view into the organization’s rhetoric, tactics, and
challenges. Suggested excerpt: begin with the line “Reforms are never accomplished in
a twinkling...” (top of column 1 in the section titled “The Steady Pull”) to the line that ends “...when right and justice rule in society.”
§ The Grange: American Oleograph Co., “I Feed You All!,” c. 1875. This lithograph, inspired
by the Grange, depicts farmers as a central part of American society.

New communities and centers of commercial activity:
§ Chinatown in Seattle: Kornel Chang, Pacific Connections: The Making of the U.S.-
Canadian Borderlands (Berkeley: University of California, 2012), pp. 35–41. Chang
explores the role of Seattle businessman Chin Gee Hee in the economy of the Pacific
Northwest. As a labor broker, Chin contributed to the growth of the Chinese community in the region.
§ Deadwood: S. J. Morrow, “Deadwood in 1876, General view of the Dakota Territory
gold rush town from a hillside above,” 1876. John C. H. Grabill, “Deadwood. From
Mt. Moriah,” 1888. John C. H. Grabill, “The Race. The great Hub-and-Hub race at
Deadwood, Dak., July 4, 1888, between the only two Chinese hose teams in the United
States,” July 4, 1888. J.C.H. Grabill, “Deadwood, South Dakota, Champion Chinese
hose team of America,” 1888. These photographs show the emergence and growth of
Deadwood, South Dakota as a center of the Black Hills Gold Rush in the 1870s.
§ Dodge City: “The Cattle Drive,” Dodge City Times, February 22, 1883, no. 353, p. 5. This
article, available through the Library of Congress, was written around the peak of the
cattle boom in Dodge City. It describes the cattle drive and how it benefits Dodge City.
§ Laundry houses: Cronise Studio, “Chinese Laundry House,” ca. 1890, identifier neg.
no. 55042, Washington State University Libraries Digital Collections. This photograph,
taken in Salem, Oregon, shows Chinese men in front of a laundry house, a business
increasingly managed in the West by Chinese immigrants.
§ Nicodemus: Willianna Hickman, “Willianna Hickman Remembers Nicodemus,” 1878
in We Are Your Sisters: Black Women in the Nineteenth Century, ed. Dorothy Sterling
(New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1984), pp. 375–376. Hickman, an early emigrant to
Nicodemus, recalls the journey to Kansas and her disappointment upon arrival, as well
the eventual success of her family and the community.
§ Sacramento: W.W. Elliot & Co., Sacramento, Sacramento: Daily Record-Union and
Weekly Union, 1890, control number 75693099, Library of Congress. This map depicts
an ariel view of Sacramento in 1890 and includes drawings of the prominent buildings
of the city. The text at the bottom describes the centrality of the railroad to the city’s economy.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Explaining Historical Concepts Using Visuals
If you selected the source “I Feed You All!,” a visual that was inspired by the Granger
movement, use this activity to develop students’ ability to explain a historical concept while
also highlighting economic developments during westward expansion.
Duration: ~25 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
Start the activity by briefly explaining the opportunities and challenges faced by western farmers in this period.
2.
Display “I Feed You All!” on the board and divide students into pairs. Be sure the image
is clear enough for students to read the small text under each figure.
3.
Ask each pair to identify the profession and/or economic activity represented by each
figure in the image and then discuss each of the following questions.
§ Which figure in the image do you think the artist thought was the most important?
Why?
§ What is the primary message of the image?
§ How does the image relate to the opportunities and challenges western farmers faced in this period?
To conclude, tell students that this image was inspired by the Grange, a cooperative
organization composed of farmers. Lead a debrief that guides students to explain how and
why this source portrays the American farmer as a central figure in economic development
during westward expansion. During this discussion, explain the role cooperative organizations like the Grange played in this period.

Unit 6: Learning Objective B
Explain the causes and effects of the settlement of the West from 1877 to 1898.
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTS
KC-6.2.II.B
In hopes of achieving ideals of self-sufficiency and independence, migrants moved to both rural and boomtown areas of the West for opportunities, such as building the railroads, mining, farming, and ranching.
KC-6.2.II.C
As migrant populations increased in number and the American bison population was decimated, competition for land and resources in the West among white settlers, American
Indians, and Mexican Americans led to an increase in violent conflict.
KC-6.2.II.D
The U.S. government violated treaties with American Indians and responded to resistance with military force, eventually confining
American Indians to reservations and denying tribal sovereignty.
KC-6.2.II.E
Many American Indians preserved their cultures and tribal identities despite government policies promoting assimilation, and they attempted to develop self-sustaining economic practices.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Sourcing: Historical Situation
Students develop their ability to explain the significance of a source’s historical situation. This
activity can be used with any of the primary sources connected to Topic 6.4.
Duration: ~20 mins
Sequence: Start of lesson 1.
For homework or at the start of class, ask students to read the section of their textbook
on the “New South” and use what they learned to write a brief definition.
2.
To help students place the concept of the “New South” in the context of broader
historical developments, ask them to define and connect the following terms to
historical developments related to Reconstruction.
§ Industrialization § Sharecropping § Segregation
Tell students these definitions do not need to be exhaustive; instead, the definitions
should be brief and connect the historical concepts to Reconstruction. Here is an
example for sharecropping: Southern Democrats sought to suppress the economic
opportunities of African Americans by developing a system of sharecropping. This
system made African Americans dependent on White landowners and became
entrenched as Democrats took control of political and economic processes following
Reconstruction.
3.
Distribute the source you selected to students. Instruct them to read through the
source on their own and highlight material directly related to the debates surrounding the concept of the “New South.” 4.
Debrief the source and guide students through the connections between the source and the “New South.” 5.
Ask students to review their responses to step 2 and then write one or two sentences
that explains how the historical situation in which the source was created is significant
for understanding the document and its relationship to the concept of “New South.”
Close the activity by asking a few students to share their responses and lead a discussion
about how to best explain the significance of a source’s historical situation.

Duration: ~30 mins
Sequence: End of lesson 1.
Display the prompt below and the two sample thesis statements:
Prompt: Evaluate the extent to which industrial capitalism changed American society in the period from 1865 to 1900.
Thesis, Option A: The rise of labor unions during the Gilded Age altered the relationships between workers and management.
Thesis, Option B: Industrial capitalism led to improvements in the standards of living for many Americans.
2.
Provide the following list of topics:
Hours, Wages, Working Conditions, Labor Organizers, Clerical Workers, Business
Leaders, Middle Class, Stratification of Wealth, Leisure Time, Consumer Culture.
3.
Ask students to select one of the sample thesis statements and two of the terms from
the list that they believe have a similar relationship to the thesis they selected.
4.
Ask students to identify the reasoning process (comparison, causation, or continuity
and change) they feel best matches the thesis they selected.
5.
Instruct students to use this reasoning process to organize and draft a body paragraph
to support the thesis that includes a topic sentence and evidence related to each of the terms selected in step 3.
6.
Distribute the selected sources for this activity. Ask students to read the source and
consider how they can use it as evidence to support the thesis.
7.
Using the same reasoning process as step 4, ask students to organize and draft a
second paragraph that utilizes evidence from the at least one of the sources to support the thesis.
8.
As a self-check, ask students to circle their evidence and underline where they used
historical reasoning to explain how each piece of evidence supports the thesis.
Close the activity by asking a few students to share one of their paragraphs and emphasize
the importance of using historical reasoning to organize evidence in arguments.

Examples and Sources
KC-6.2.I.B
Urban neighborhoods:
§ Chinatown in San Francisco: William Howard, “The Founding of Golden Hills’ News
(1854),” in Chinese American Voices: From the Gold Rush to the Present, ed. Judy Yung,
Gordon H Chang, and H. Mark Lai (Berkeley, University of California, 2006), pp. 13–14.
This editorial introduces the United States’ first Chinese-language newspaper.
§ Japantown in Tacoma: Lisa M. Hoffman and Mary L. Hanneman, Becoming Nisei:
Japanese American Urban Lives in Prewar Tacoma (Seattle: University of Washington
Press, 2021). Chapter 1 in this book is helpful for contextualizing the connected histories
of modern Japan, U.S.–Japan relations, the development of an ethnic enclave in the
American West, and urban race and social relations. Suggested excerpts: pages 33-48
or, for a shorter selection, the section titled “Issei in Tacoma” on pages 46-48.
§ Little Italy in New York: Tyler Andinder, City of Dreams: A 400-year Epic History of
Immigrant New York (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2016), pp. 383–409. In Chapter 17, “Little
Italys,” Anbinder discusses Italian immigration in Gilded Age New York, with a focus on
life in various “Little Italys.” Note: the book also includes chapters on other immigrant
experiences—German, Irish, Chinese, and others—that may be of interest).
§ Polish Downtown in Chicago: “Kloski Inn,” 1890, The Polish Museum of America,
Old Polish Chicago Collection. This is a photograph from 1890 of an inn in the Polish
neighborhood of Chicago. The sign identifies this building as a meeting place of the
Kosciuszko Guards, a Polish immigrant organization named after a Polish soldier who
fought for the Patriots during the American Revolution.
§ Ybor City in Tampa: Gary R. Mormino and George Pozzetta, The Immigrant World
of Ybor City: Italians and Their Latin Neighbors in Tampa, 1885–1985 (Gainesville:
University of Florida Press, 2018). Mormino and Pozzetta’s book explores the
interconnected experiences of Spaniards, Italians and Cubans on Florida’s West Coast a

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Unpacking Arguments
Students develop their ability to unpack historical interpretations in secondary sources,
identifying and describing claims and/or arguments made by historians. This activity is most
beneficial after students are familiar with the immigration and migration that took place during
the Gilded Age. Utilize the excerpts from Becoming Nisei: Japanese American Urban Lives in
Prewar Tacoma and City of Dreams: A 400-year Epic History of Immigrant New York for this activity.
Duration: ~20 mins
Sequence: End of lesson 1.
Briefly discuss the historical topic of the selected sources. Divide the class in half and distribute each source to one half of the class.
2.
Working in pairs, ask students to complete the tasks described below.
§ Examine the title and year of publication. Are there any clues that help you
understand what the historian believes is significant about the topic of the excerpt.
Historians often title works based on their objective and thesis.
§ Examine the events, developments, and processes specifically referenced in the
excerpt. Underline or highlight any specific historical information used by the historian in the excerpt.
3.
Ask students to analyze their findings by looking for links between the topic, title, and
events, developments and processes referenced in the excerpt.
4.
Individually, ask each student to describe the historian’s argument in no more than two
sentences. Circulate the room to check for understanding.
5.
Re-partner students with a classmate who analyzed the other secondary source.
Working together, ask students to respond to this prompt:
§ Briefly describe one major similarity or difference between Andinder’s and Hoffman
and Hanneman’s interpretations of urban immigrant neighborhoods.
Conclude by summarizing the similarities and differences between the two interpretations and
discuss how the sources help students understand immigration in the Gilded Age.

understand how changes at Coney Island were situated in the broader historical context of the Gilded Age.
Duration: ~45 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
Assign the excerpt from Kathy Peiss’s Cheap Amusements with the following questions
as homework. Direct students to use four different color highlighters as they read, one
for each question. They should highlight the portions of text that help them answer
each question with the appropriate color. Students should use their notes from earlier
in this period to add margin notes to further help answer the questions. If students are
confused, they should record any questions they have while reading.
§ What was happening at Coney Island and did it reflect a continuity or change in U.S.
History?
§ Explain how Coney Island fits into the broader historical context of the rise of industrial capitalism?
§ What can we learn about society in the Gilded Age from the difference between the east and west sides of Coney Island?
§ To what extent were the changes related to gender at Coney Island an example of
larger changes in gender relations in the period from the early 1800s to 1900?
2.
Place students in groups of about eight and ask them to begin by asking each other any
questions they drafted while reading. If their classmates are unable to answer, ask them to direct the question to you.
3.
Once any points of confusion are addressed, ask students to take turns posing the
questions from step 1 to the group and engage in an open discussion to arrive at answers. Circulate the room to guide discussion.
Close with a debrief that summarizes a brief answer to each question, emphasizing how
placing the changes at Coney Island in a broader historical context helps us understand its significance in U.S. History.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Discussion Groups
Students engage in small group discussions to identify and explore the significance of a
source’s audience. Select one of the suggested primary sources for this topic to use with this activity.
Duration: ~20 mins
Sequence: End of lesson 1.
Organize students into groups of three to four and give each student a copy of the
source with a source line/attribution similar to those used on the exam. See the sample
exam questions in the Course and Exam Description for examples.
2.
Allow the students a few minutes to read the source and then ask them to conduct a
group discussion based on the following questions about venue, access, influence, and link (V.A.I.L).
§ Venue:

◆Where was the source originally made available to the audience?

◆In a publication like a newspaper, broadside, or book?

◆In person like a speech?

◆In a personal correspondence like a letter?

◆Somewhere else?

◆What does this tell you about the size and composition of the audience?
§ Access:

◆Who would have had access to the venue?

◆Who could read it? Who would understand the language and message? Who
might not? Keep in mind that direct access isn’t always necessary. Was this a message that might have spread by word of mouth?

◆Who was likely invited? Who was excluded? Was this likely published or delivered later for a larger audience?

◆Was there a cost for access? Who could pay for access?

◆Can you tell how well the author knows the audience? Can you tell if the author wanted the message to stay private?

◆What does this tell you about the size and composition of the audience?
§ Influence:

◆Based on venue and access, briefly describe the audience for the source, be as
specific as possible and support your conclusions with evidence from the source and/or the source line.

◆What role did this group or person play in society?

◆How much and what type of influence did this group or person have in society?

◆Did this group or person have direct or indirect power in society?

◆What does this tell you about the significance of the audience?

OPTIONAL SOURCES
Teachers have the flexibility to include in their syllabus primary and secondary sources that
align with local standards and priorities. The following optional sources and activity are not
required AP course content, but are instead simply examples of sources appropriate for a
college-level course. None of the AP Exam questions require students to have studied these
specific sources. These sources represent a variety of persons and perspectives relevant to
U.S. history, rather than an endorsement of their ideas or values. AP students are not asked to
affiliate themselves with the cultural or political values in these sources, but instead to analyze
such documents for the historical information they can yield.
Examples and Sources
KC-6.1.II.A
Arguments for laissez-faire policies and competition:
§ Grover Cleveland: Grover Cleveland, Veto Message to the House of Representatives,
February 16, 1887. This veto message outlines the reasons for Cleveland’s veto of a bill to provide government aid to farmers.
§ Horace Greeley: “Proceedings of the Liberal Republican Convention, in Cincinnati, May
1st, 2d, and 3d, 1872” (New York: Baker & Godwin, 1872), pp. 19–21. This is the official
account of the 1872 Liberal Republican Party Convention where Greeley was nominated for President. Suggested excerpt: principle 6.
KC-6.1.I.E.ii
Foreign policy:
§ Alaska: Cancelled check in the amount of $7.2 million, for the purchase of Alaska,
August 1, 1868, records of the Accounting Officers of the Department of the Treasury,
record group 217, National Archives. The document is a check issued by the U.S.
Department of Treasury in the amount of $7.2 million for the U.S. purchase of Alaska
from the Russian Empire, representing 2 cents per acre, as the two parties had agreed on March 30, 1867.
§ Hawaii: “Joint Resolution to Provide for Annexing the Hawaiian Islands to the United
States,” July 7, 1898. In this two-page document, Hawaii is ceded to the United States
by the “Republic of Hawaii,” the government led by White Americans who overthrew the
Kingdom of Hawaii.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Contextualizing Primary Sources
Using one of the suggested sources for foreign policy, guide students in explaining how the
historical development or process in the selected source is situated within a broader historical context.
Duration: ~25 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
Ask students to read the selected source with a partner and complete the following
steps:
§ Read through the source title and description: What does the year of publication, title,
and author suggest about the source? Annotate your findings.
§ Read the source: Work with a partner to write one sentence that describes the specific
historical development or process reflected in the source.
2.
Guide students through a class debrief. To ensure that students accurately understand
the source, concentrate on American efforts to establish greater influence overseas and gain access to markets and natural resources.
3.
In a brainstorm, ask students to suggest several broader historical contexts related
to the time period. They should think about relevant regional, national, or international developments.
If students struggle, provide them with some of the following examples:
§ The Civil War; European presence in the Western Hemisphere despite the Monroe
Doctrine; rise of industrial capitalism in the United States; imperialism by European
powers; The Spanish–American War; growing importance of naval power 4.
Write two of the suggestions on the board that provide helpful context for
understanding the historical development in the source. These suggestions should
be developments that the students are already familiar with. Ask students to do the
following:
§ Select the suggested context you are most confident connects to the historical development addressed in the source.
§ Individually write one or two sentences explaining how the suggested context relates to the development.
§ Exchange answers with at least two other students, one who selected the same
context and one who selected the other option. Check your work and consider how
both suggestions provide a helpful context for understanding the development.
Debrief the activity by discussing why contextual understanding of a specific development or
process is an essential part of developing a deeper historical understanding.

UNIT 6
OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Self/Peer Revision
Students will utilize a scaffolded approach to drafting and revising a document-based essay
to build a foundational understanding of how to develop complex arguments. This activity
utilizes the DBQ titled “Stanton and others on change by reform movements” found in AP
Classroom. To support scaffolding and keep the DBQ confined to period 6, delete documents
6 and 7 and edit the prompt to read: Evaluate the extent to which reform movements changed
United States society in the period from 1877 to 1898.
Duration: ~50 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
The rubric requires students to demonstrate a complex understanding of the historical
development that is the focus of the prompt. Review the rubric and translate the
expectation for complexity into student friendly language. For example:
§ With so many people in such a large country, the history the United States is
complex. Write an essay that explains why there is not a simple answer to this question.
§ The rubric requires students to demonstrate a complex understanding through
sophisticated argumentation and/or effective use of evidence.
§ In a sophisticated argument, the author demonstrates how the history of an event is
not simple. Instead, they might explain that an event:

◆was shaped by several different factors, for example economic motivations and cultural values.

◆was viewed differently by different groups of people, for example regional differences of opinion.

◆has many causes with some causes being more important than others.

◆led to multiple different changes, for example political and economic.

◆led to change, while there were also continuities, for example things changed for one group of people but not another.
§ Authors effectively use evidence when they demonstrate a detailed understanding of
the history they are writing about. This might include:

◆Effectively using an abundance of evidence to support an argument.

◆Consistently demonstrating an understanding of the source of the evidence used to support an argument.
2.
For homework, ask students to select one of the suggested approaches to
complexity below and write a draft of the DBQ essay implementing that approach.
These examples are provided to support scaffolded learning and only represent two
possible approaches to developing a complex argument in response to this prompt.
Teachers are free to provide additional suggestions or replace these suggestions with approaches of their own.
§ Use the documents and your knowledge of the period to draft a response that argues
that reform efforts did little to change society by 1898. Corroborate your argument
with evidence about how political leaders’ efforts to end corruption in government,
labor unions’ efforts to reform business practices, and citizens’ efforts to end gender
and racial discrimination all had limited success.

Using the “Preview: Unit 7 Key Concepts” section of the Topic 7.1 page in the Course
and Exam Description as a guide, give students a brief introduction to each topic.
3.
Lead a brief discussion focused on defining the meaning of broader historical context.
Note that historical developments are often best understood in the context of regional,
national, or global processes that develop over time. Label the triangles on the board
as follows: top: “broad development,” middle: “specific example,” and bottom: “linkage statement.” 4.
Ask students to consider how global, national, or regional developments in period 6
might provide helpful context for understanding the topics listed under each triangle
on the board. Explain that contextualizing historical developments can be done in three steps.
§ Step 1: Identify a broad pattern related to the topic.
§ Step 2: Identify a specific example of that broad pattern.
§ Step 3: Use the specific example to explain how the broad pattern is linked to the historical development you are contextualizing.
5.
Use an example like the one below to model completing these steps for the triangle about “International Conflicts.”
§ Broad development: Business and government leaders worked to gain greater
influence and control over markets outside the U.S. (Topics 6.6 and 6.12)
§ Specific example: Hawaii
§ Linkage Statement: In the second half of the 19th century, U.S. business interests
and government leaders worked to gain greater influence and control over markets
outside the U.S. For example, agricultural business interests expanded their influence
in the Kingdom of Hawaii in the late 19th century, eventually leading to the overthrow
of the government and the annexation of Hawaii to the United States. Events like this
demonstrate how U.S. economic interests contributed to an expanded role of the
country in the world and provide a helpful context for understanding the motivation
for larger military conflicts like the Spanish–American War.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Think, Pair, Share
This activity is built around “Aguinaldo’s Case against the United States,” as an example of
the nationalist movement in the Philippines. The purpose of this activity is to help students practice sourcing.
Duration: ~30 mins
Sequence: End of lesson 1.
Provide students with a copy of the source.
2.
Since the goal of this activity is to explain sourcing (not merely identify it), share the following sentence starters:
§ Point of view: Written by a personal representative of the main leader of the Filipino
independence movement, Emilio Aguinaldo, the article conveys a negative perspective
of America’s on-going presence in the Philippines by…
§ Purpose: The article seeks to convince readers to oppose U.S. actions in the
Philippines by…
§ Historical situation: In the aftermath of the Spanish–American War as Americans were debating U.S. imperialist policies…
§ Audience: The article was intended for the American people… 3.
Divide students into pairs and ask them to complete the sentences above, focusing on
an explanation. Encourage students to reference their class notes or textbook when
developing their response for historical situation.
Possible answers based on the language of the source:
§ POV: …using strong language to describe U.S. actions in the Philippines including
calling them a “barbaric war” and “ghastly horrors.”
§ Purpose: …pointing out the hypocrisy of “government by consent in America” and
“government by force in the Philippine Islands” and arguing that the U.S. didn’t fulfill its
promise to free the Philippines, claiming that the “atrocious cruelties” of the U.S. and Spain are equal.
§ Historical situation: …many Filipinos, like some anti-imperialists in the U.S. at the time,
were becoming increasingly angry with the failure of the U.S. to live up to the ideals set
forth at the start of the war to help the Philippines break free from Spain and establish
a government modeled on the U.S. This frustration grew into an insurrection that began shortly after this document was published.
§ Audience: …whom the author believes were being misled by incorrect accounts of
events as told by the American military and news media. By exposing the U.S. actions in
the Philippines, the author hopes the American public will “rise en masse” to demand a change in U.S. policies.

document. Note that they will continue to work on this skill, by focusing on why their analysis
of the source is significant to their arguments in essays. Emphasize that students need to
consider which sourcing approach(es) best illuminate a particular source, so that they can focus their analysis accordingly.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Discussion Groups
Provide students background information about the topic then use this activity to help
students develop a deeper understanding of sourcing and the limitations of sourcing. Select
one of the suggested primary sources for each of the historical developments in this topic
(Progressive Era journalists; Progressive reformers; preservationists and conservationists) for use with this activity.
Duration: ~30 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
Divide the class into groups of 4 and ask each group to read and analyze one of the selected sources.
2.
Assign each group member one of these four sourcing approaches and ask them to
consider the associated questions to evaluate its usefulness for developing historical understanding.
§ POV: What about the author’s background could have influenced what they said in the source?
§ Purpose: What is the objective or goal of the author? What verb captures their motive?
§ Historical situation: What was happening at the time and in the place where the source
was created? Is it immediate and related to its creation as opposed to broader in scope?
§ Audience: Who is intended as the recipient? How can you tell? How would this affect the reliability of the source?
3.
Each group should have a brief discussion where students describe and then explain
why their assigned sourcing would or wouldn’t be the best fit for the source. Once
they reach a consensus as to which of the four approaches would be the best option
for helping them understand the historical significance of the source, conduct a class
discussion where each group shares their findings.
Conclude with a class discussion on the limitations encountered in each of the approaches to
sourcing. Ask students to identify specific limitations they encountered (i.e. what information
wasn’t available for their source) and explain why particular sourcing approaches, depending
on the source at hand, can be more or less valuable for developing historical understanding.

War I, nativist campaigns against some ethnic groups led to the passage of quotas that restricted immigration, particularly from southern and eastern Europe, and increased barriers to Asian immigration.
KC-7.2.II.B.i
The increased demand for war production and labor during World War I led many Americans to migrate to urban centers in search of economic opportunities.
KC-7.2.II.C
In the Great Migration during and after World
War I, African Americans escaping segregation, racial violence, and limited economic opportunity in the South moved to the North and West, where they found new opportunities but still encountered discrimination.

Divide students into small groups. Ask them to share their definitions of consumerism
and work together to select the best definition in the group.
3.
With this definition in mind, ask students to compare the role of consumerism in the
1920s to its role in the Market Revolution of the early 1800s and the rise of industrial
capitalism in the late 1800s. Ask groups to brainstorm a short list of technological
innovations that connect to the development of consumerism in the 19th and 20th
centuries. Ask them to consider how consumerism demonstrates continuity and change over time.

Contextualizing Primary Sources
Using one of the suggested sources for nativism, ask students to explain how the historical
development or process in the selected source is situated within a broader historical context.
Duration: ~20 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
Ask students to read the selected source with a partner and complete the following
steps:
§ Read through the source title and description: What does the year of publication, title,
and author suggest about the source? Annotate your findings.
§ Read the source: Work with a partner to write one sentence that describes the specific
historical development or process reflected in the source.

OPTIONAL SOURCES
Teachers have the flexibility to include in their syllabus primary and secondary sources that
align with local standards and priorities. The following optional sources and activity are not
required AP course content, but are instead simply examples of sources appropriate for a
college-level course. None of the AP Exam questions require students to have studied these
specific sources. These sources represent a variety of persons and perspectives relevant to
U.S. history, rather than an endorsement of their ideas or values. AP students are not asked to
affiliate themselves with the cultural or political values in these sources, but instead to analyze
such documents for the historical information they can yield.
Examples and Sources

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Making and Explaining Connections
Students read Frances Perkins’s “Social Insurance for U.S.” to make and explain relevant
connections between this source and historical developments and processes from the same time-period.
Duration: ~40 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
For homework, ask students to read and take notes on their textbook’s coverage of the
Great Depression.
2.
Divide students into pairs and ask them to briefly review their homework and consider
connections between the Great Depression and the role of government in the economy.
Provide the following questions to help students get started:
§ How did the Great Depression result in calls for a stronger financial regulatory system?
§ How did the Great Depression transform the U.S. into a limited welfare state?
3.
Provide students with a copy of the source and ask them to answer these questions as
they read:
§ What is the main connection you can make between the source and calls for a stronger financial regulatory system?
§ What is the main connection you can make between the source and transforming the
U.S. into a limited welfare state?
§ What evidence can you provide from your homework assignment to support either connection?
4.
Ask students to focus on explaining these connections by writing two or three
sentences that answer each of the following questions:
§ How does this source relate to calls for a stronger financial regulatory system?
§ How does this source relate to transforming the U.S. into a limited welfare state?
§ Why would Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s administration try to redefine the role played by the federal government in the national economy
Explaining relevant connections instead of merely making them will be more challenging for
students, so close this activity with a debrief that emphasizes how the Great Depression
relates to both calls for a stronger financial regulatory system and transforming the U.S. into a limited welfare state.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Unit 7: Learning Objective K
Explain how the Great
Depression and the New Deal impacted American political, social, and economic life over time.
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTS
KC-7.1.III.A
Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal attempted to end the Great Depression by using government power to provide relief to the poor, stimulate recovery, and reform the American economy.
KC-7.1.III.B
Radical, union, and populist movements pushed Roosevelt toward more extensive efforts to change the American economic system, while conservatives in Congress and the Supreme Court sought to limit the New
Deal’s scope.

Making and Explaining Connections
Students make and explain relevant connections between a source and the historical
developments and processes in period 7.  Select one of the suggested primary sources about the use of government power for this activity.
Duration: ~40 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
For homework, ask students to read and take notes on their textbook’s coverage
of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal while focusing on the three Rs: relief, recovery, and reform.
2.
Divide the class into groups of 3 and ask each group member to take responsibility
for one of the three Rs as they briefly review their homework to explore connections
between the New Deal and the American economy. Provide the following questions to help students get started:
§ Relief: How did the New Deal attempt to provide relief to the poor? What are one or two
federal agencies or actions that strived to achieve this goal?
§ Recovery: How did the New Deal attempt to stimulate recovery? What are one or two
federal agencies or actions that strived to achieve this goal?
§ Reform: How did the New Deal attempt to change the American economy? What are
one or two federal agencies or actions that strived to achieve this goal?
3.
Provide students with a copy of the selected source. Ask them to read it and then answer the following questions with their group:
§ What is the main connection you can make between the source and the New Deal’s goals of relief, recovery, or reform?
§ What evidence can you provide from your homework assignment to support your connections?
§ What makes these connections relevant?
4.
Ask students to focus on explaining these connections by writing two or three
sentences that answer each of the following questions:
§ How does this source relate to the New Deal’s goals of providing relief, recovery, or reform?
§ Evaluate the extent to which FDR’s New Deal can be considered successful in ending
the Great Depression. Use the source and evidence from your homework to briefly support your argument.
Explaining relevant connections instead of merely making them will be more challenging for
students, so close this activity with a debrief that emphasizes how FDR’s New Deal agencies
and policies relate to economic conditions during the Great Depression.

Foreign policy:
§ Dawes Plan: George C. Herring, The American Century and Beyond: U.S. Foreign
Relations, 1893–2014 (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 157–161. In
1924, U.S. banker Charles Dawes led the negotiations of an arrangement that not only
helped Germany repay reparations from World War I, but also helped revive the German
economy. Suggested excerpt: the paragraph that begins “In Europe reconstruction…” on
page 157 to the paragraph that ends “…European recovery and stability” on page 161.
§ Kellogg-Briand Pact: George C. Herring, The American Century and Beyond: U.S.
Foreign Relations, 1893–2014 (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 178–179.
This treaty made war illegal as an instrument of national policy, demonstrating an
American willingness to become involved in international affairs in ways that limited the
likelihood of being involved in war. Suggested excerpt: the paragraph that begins “The
high water mark …” on page 178 to the paragraph that ends “…for peaceful change” on page 179.
§ U.S. occupation of Haiti: James Weldon Johnson, “The Truth About Haiti, An NAACP
Investigation,” The Crisis, September 1920, p. 220. In July 1915, Wilson sent Marines
into Haiti to “restore order.” The troops remained until Roosevelt withdrew them in 1934
as part of his Good Neighbor Policy. In this article, Johnson questions the motives and
justifications for the occupation. Suggested excerpt: the paragraph that begins “It is a

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Explaining Historical Developments
Strengthen students’ ability to explain historical developments about interwar foreign policy
decisions with a secondary source reading and discussion. Select one of the suggested
secondary sources for this topic to use with this activity.
Duration: ~50 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
Begin the activity by asking students to use the internet to define each pair of terms.
§ Unilateral foreign policy vs. multilateral foreign policy
§ Interventionist foreign policy vs. non-interventionist foreign policy § Internationalism vs. isolationism 2.
Lead a discussion about these terms. Ask students to share their definitions and
provide an example of each term from an earlier period in U.S. history. Explain that
while each of these terms represents distinct approaches to foreign policy, they
share characteristics (e.g. isolationism and non-interventionism both advocate for
staying out of other countries’ internal affairs), they are rarely mutually exclusive (e.g. a
country might take a multilateral approach to trade but a unilateral approach to national
security), they are often situational (e.g. a country might follow a non-interventionist
approach in one area of the world but take an interventionist approach in a different
area), and that there is rarely consensus about which approach is best (remind students
about the debates related to imperialism in Topic 7.2).
3.
Distribute individual copies of the excerpt you selected. Instruct students to make a
key at the top of their reading, assigning a unique abbreviation to each foreign policy
approach listed in step 1. Have them read the source, underline examples of each
approach, and add the appropriate abbreviation to the margins. Note that they may
need to use multiple abbreviations for the same text.
4.
Lead a class discussion about the historical developments they underlined. Ask them to consider and discuss the following questions.
§ Which foreign policy approaches were most evident in the source? Why and how did the U.S. follow these approaches?
§ Was there any evidence of inconsistency in the United States’ approach to foreign policy? Explain the inconsistency.
§ Was there evidence of disagreement among policymakers about which approach to take? If so, why?
5.
In a quick write, have students use specific evidence from the source to support or refute the following claim.
§ In the years following World War I, the United States pursued a unilateral foreign policy that favored isolationism.

Targeted Annotation
Strengthen students’ ability to explain historical developments with this targeted annotation
activity. Select one or two of the suggested text sources for this topic to use with this activity.
Duration: ~20 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
Start the class by explaining mass mobilization in the context of World War II. In your
discussion, be sure to emphasize how this both created opportunities and generated
debates about civil liberties and democratic principles.
2.
Distribute the selected source(s) and ask students to use two different colored pens to
color code the source while reading. They should use one color to underline text that
reveals opportunities and another color for text related to debates about civil liberties
and/or democratic principles. Note that students may need to use both colors for the same text.
3.
After students have underlined the text, instruct them to add margin notes connecting
the text to one or more of the following specific historical events or developments:
§ Economic recovery that ended the Great Depression § America’s strong industrial base § New job opportunities § Migration within and to the United States § Racial segregation § Racial discrimination § Japanese internment 4.
In a quick write, ask students to sum up their notes from step 3 by explaining one way in
which mass mobilization affected United States society.
Close the activity by leading a debrief about how and why U.S. participation in World War II transformed American society.

highlight more text for some sourcing approaches than others. Model the color coding of point of view to help students get started.
§ Color 1: highlight or underline language in the source that is helpful for understanding
the point of view. Look for information about the authors, their background, and their opinion of the issue discussed.
§ Color 2: highlight or underline language in the source that is helpful for understanding
the purpose. Look for verbs that capture the authors’ motive, goal, or intent.
§ Color 3: highlight or underline language in the source that is helpful for understanding
the historical situation. Look for any background information or context provided by the authors.

describe the point of view, purpose, historical situation, and audience of the source.
4.
Display the following model that explains how or why the document’s point of view is relevant to the argument in step 1.
§ The source comes from the point of view of allied leaders, including the U.S.
President, who make it clear that they represent the “free peoples of the world” who
just defeated the Germans. With this success against the Germans, they confidently
demand the surrender of the Japanese while saying that they want a “strengthening
of democratic tendencies” in the country. The United States continued this
significant leadership role after the war, encouraging democracy in the world.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Self/Peer Revision
Students will utilize a scaffolded approach to drafting and revising a document-based essay
in order to build a foundational understanding of how to develop complex arguments. This
activity utilizes the DBQ titled “Evaluate the extent of change during World War II” found in AP
Classroom.
Duration: ~50 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
The rubric requires students to demonstrate a complex understanding of the historical
development that is the focus of the prompt. Review the rubric and translate the
expectation for complexity into student friendly language. For example:
§ With so many people in such a large country, the history of the United States is
complex. When writing your essay, explain why there is not a simple answer to this question.
§ The rubric rewards students for demonstrating a complex understanding through
sophisticated argumentation and/or effective use of evidence.
§ In a sophisticated argument, the author demonstrates how the history of an event is
not simple. Instead, they might explain that an event:

◆was shaped by several different factors, for example economic motivations and cultural values.

◆was viewed differently by different groups of people, for example regional differences of opinion.

◆has many causes with some causes being more important than others.

◆led to multiple different changes, for example political and economic.

◆led to change, while there were also continuities, for example things changed for one group of people but not another.
§ Authors effectively use evidence when they demonstrate a detailed understanding of
the history they are writing about. This might include:

◆Effectively using an abundance of evidence to support an argument.

◆Consistently demonstrating an understanding of the source of the evidence used to support an argument.
2.
For homework, ask students to select one of the suggested approaches to
complexity below and write a draft of the DBQ essay implementing that approach.
These examples are provided to support scaffolded learning and only represent two
possible approaches to developing a complex argument in response to this prompt.
Teachers are free to provide additional suggestions or replace these suggestions with approaches of their own.
§ Use the documents and your knowledge of the period to draft a response that
argues that there were major changes in the economy in the U.S. during World War II
but few lasting social changes. Corroborate your argument about economic change
with evidence from different parts of the country and from different segments of
the population. Corroborate your argument about the limits of social change with
evidence of continued discrimination against multiple segments of the population based on race and gender.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Discussion Groups
Use this activity to help students develop a deeper understanding of sourcing and the
limitations of sourcing. Select one of the suggested primary sources for each of the historical
developments in this topic (Policymakers; International aid; Indirect military confrontation) and then complete the following steps.
Duration: ~30 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
Divide the class into groups of 4 and ask each group to read and analyze one of the selected sources.
2.
Assign each group member one of these four sourcing approaches and ask them to
consider the associated questions to evaluate its usefulness for developing historical understanding.
§ POV: What about the author’s background could have influenced what they said in the
source? Nationality, profession, political party affiliation, etc.?
§ Purpose: What is the objective or goal of the author? What verb captures their motive?
§ Historical situation: What was happening at the time and in the place where the
source was created? Is it immediate and related to its creation as opposed to broader in scope?
§ Audience: Who is intended as the recipient? How can you tell? How would this affect the reliability of the source?
3.
Each group should have a brief discussion in which students describe and then explain
why their assigned sourcing approach would or wouldn’t be the best fit for the source.
Once they reach a consensus as to which of the four approaches would be the best
option for helping them understand the historical significance of the source, conduct a
class discussion where each group shares their findings.
Conclude with a class discussion on the limitations encountered in each of the approaches to
sourcing. Ask students to identify specific limitations they encountered (i.e. what information
wasn’t available for their source) and explain why particular sourcing approaches, depending
on the source at hand, can be more or less valuable for developing historical understanding.

Students explore how contextualization helps us better understand history. Start by selecting one of the sources suggested for this topic.
Duration: ~25 mins
Sequence: End of lesson 1.
Ask students to read the source independently and write one sentence describing the historical development addressed in the source.
2.
Ask students to compare their sentences with a classmate and discuss which
AP Theme (page 21 of the Course and Exam Description) is most relevant to this development.
3.
Randomly assign each pair of students an AP Theme that is different from the one they selected in step 2.
4.
Tell students to use their class notes or textbook to identify and describe a historical
development related to the new theme that is happening at the same time or just before the development addressed in the source.
5.
With their partners, ask students to draft a one-paragraph response to this prompt:
§ Does understanding the historical development you described in step 4 provide a
broader picture that helps you better understand the source? Why or why not?
Close this activity by discussing how to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant events
when considering the historical context of a particular development. Ask a few students to
share their paragraphs and lead a discussion about how placing events in context helps us better understand historical developments.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Explaining Historical Developments
Build students’ ability to explain the historical process of U.S. foreign policy with the Vietnam
War as an example. This activity works best after students have studied the Vietnam War.
Select one suggested source from this topic to use with the activity.
Duration: ~30 mins
Sequence: End of lesson 1.
Divide students into groups. Assign half of the groups to the first claim below and the other half to the second claim.
§ The Vietnam War represented a continuity in U.S. foreign policy,
§ The Vietnam War represented a change in U.S. foreign policy.
2.
Ask the groups to brainstorm at least two pieces of historical evidence that support their assigned claim.
3.
After groups finish their initial brainstorm, instruct the groups to collectively write at
least three sentences that explain how their evidence supports the claim.
4.
The groups will then exchange answers with other groups with the same claim to read
how they defended the claim. After exchanging among the groups, ask students to
select the best defenses of the claims to share with the class.
5.
Give individuals the opportunity to reflect and write their own interpretation. In a quick
write, ask students to individually support one of the following claims.
§ U.S. involvement in Vietnam reflected a continuity in foreign policy decisions.
§ U.S. involvement in Vietnam reflected a change in foreign policy decisions.
§ U.S. involvement in Vietnam reflected both a change and a continuity in foreign policy decisions.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Self/Peer Revision
Students will utilize a scaffolded approach to drafting and revising a long essay in order to
improve their ability to develop complex arguments. This activity uses the long essay question
titled “Role of democratic ideas in the civil rights movement” in AP Classroom. This essay
question, as well as scoring guidelines and student samples, is also available on
AP Central as the 2019 FRQ #4.
Duration: ~50 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
If necessary, consult the suggested activities for topics 6.14 and 7.15 that scaffold how
to teach the expectations for historical complexity with student friendly language.
2.
Display the prompt and provide students with the following claim and the three
suggested approaches for demonstrating an understanding of historical complexity.
These examples are provided to support scaffolded learning and only represent three
possible approaches to developing a complex argument in response to this prompt.
Teachers are free to provide additional suggestions or replace these suggestions with approaches of their own.
§ Prompt: Evaluate the extent to which ideas about democracy contributed to the
African American Civil Rights movement in the period from 1940 to 1970.
§ Claim: “Ideas about democracy, such as the notion that everyone should be treated
equally, the right to assemble and right to petition government, greatly contributed to
the African American Civil Rights movement from 1940–1970.”
§ Corroborate: Provide multiple pieces of evidence (quantity and quality) that use
insightful connections across themes (e.g. how the pursuit of economic opportunity
reinforced democratic ideas) and/or time periods (e.g. how democratic ideas have
motivated reforms since Reconstruction) to support the claim.
§ Qualify: Provide evidence that supports the claim that democratic ideas contributed
to the civil rights movement but also considers diverse or alternative views. For
example, support the claim with evidence of how democratic ideas contributed to the
civil rights movement, but qualify the argument by providing evidence that Cold War era competition motivated much of the political and social changes that occurred during the movement.
§ Modify: Provide evidence that challenges the premise of the prompt by considering
diverse or alternative views. Modify the claim with ideas of how Black nationalism,
anti-imperialism, and/or Black liberation influenced the civil rights movement more than democratic ideas.
3.
Ask students to write a response to the long essay prompt using one of the suggested approaches in step 2 for historical complexity.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Oral Presentations
Strengthen students’ ability to explain historical developments with an oral presentation
of a source. Utilize the following suggested sources for this activity: “Radio Address to the
Nation on Grenada and Nicaragua,” “Report to Congress on the Strategic Defense System
Architecture,” “Address to Members of the British Parliament,” and “Joint Soviet-United States
Statement of the Summit at Geneva.”
Duration: ~40 mins
Sequence: End of lesson 1.
Randomly distribute one of the four sources to each student so the class has several
students with the same source. Instruct students with the same source to form a group.
2.
In groups, ask students to read the source to determine how well it supports the
assertion in the bullet below. Students may need to conduct some quick research
about the topic of the source in their textbook or on the internet to help them
understand the reading. Ask the groups to provide a two-minute verbal evaluation of
how well the source demonstrates a method used by Reagan to oppose communism.
§ Reagan asserted U.S. opposition to communism through speeches, diplomatic
efforts, limited military interventions, and a buildup of nuclear and conventional weapons (KC-9.3.I.A).
3.
If the groups didn’t cite specific evidence from their source to support their evaluations,
ask (or encourage their classmates to ask) follow-up questions about how well the source supports the assertion.
4.
In a quick write, ask each student to summarize the presentations by writing a short
paragraph explaining how Reagan sought to combat communism.
Debrief by leading a discussion about the extent to which President Reagan’s efforts succeeded in bringing an end to the Cold War.

OPTIONAL ACTIVITY
Guided Discussion
If you selected the source ¿Qué Pasa USA?, an episode of the first bilingual sitcom in the
United States, use this activity to help students develop a deeper understanding of sourcing, including limitations.
Duration: ~40 mins
Sequence: Anytime 1.
Provide students background information about Cuban immigration to the United
States from the revolution in 1959 to the present day and use the source description of
¿Qué Pasa USA? to prepare students for viewing the clip.
2.
Show the clip of the episode in class and lead a brief discussion on how students might
use this source as evidence in a response to the following prompt:
§ Evaluate the extent to which migration to and within the United States affected U.S.
culture from 1980 to 2010.
3.
Display the sourcing requirement in the document-based question (DBQ) rubric and
briefly discuss how considering these approaches helps historians understand sources
and evaluate their usefulness as evidence in supporting historical arguments.
§ For at least three documents, explains how or why the document’s point of view,
purpose, historical situation, and/or audience is relevant to an argument.
4.
Conduct a class discussion on the four approaches to sourcing. Help students evaluate
the usefulness of each approach in developing an argument that uses ¿Qué Pasa
USA? as evidence in response to the prompt in step 2. Use the following pro/con list
to guide the discussion. Remind students that they will only need to use one of these
approaches in evaluating each source in their DBQ essay, so they should give careful
thought to which approach will best help them support their argument.
Pros and Cons:
§ Point of View:

◆Pros: Understanding the point of view could help evaluate the extent to which the
depiction of the characters and story line reflect reality.

◆Cons: Evaluating the point of view of a television show is challenging because of
the number of people and organizations involved in its creation (i.e. writer, director,
producer, television network…) so it is difficult to draw conclusions about the significance of point of view.
§ Purpose:

◆Pros: Understanding the purpose could help explain its enduring popularity and
the extent to which it accurately reflects the experience of Spanish speaking
Americans.

◆Cons: Presumably, there are many purposes: to explore the difficulty of redefining
one’s identity while undergoing various degrees of cultural assimilation, to
highlight generational differences, to entertain the audience, to generate revenue
for the television network…. Considering the potential complexity of the episode’s
purpose, it may be difficult to draw conclusions about its significance.

Period 9: 1980–Present
UNIT 9 § Historical situation:

◆Pros: Considering the historical situation in which ¿Qué Pasa USA? was created
and viewed helps build an understanding of the historical developments that
motivated the creation and rebroadcast of the show and the extent to which it
reflects the sustained impact of migration on U.S. culture.

◆Cons: Considering that the show was largely created and originally aired before
1980, caution must be exercised when using this show as historical evidence for
the experience of immigrants in earlier or later periods. Evaluating the historical
situation for this source requires consideration of several time periods (dates
of creation, broadcast, and rebroadcast); this level of analysis will take time and broad content knowledge.
§ Audience:

◆Pros: Considering the themes and regular use of Spanish, it is safe to conclude
that the audience was largely Cuban Americans and other Spanish speakers.
Considering that the show was broadcast from the 1970s through the 2000s on a
major network indicates that this audience was rather large. Considering the size
and composition of the audience, evaluating the significance of the audience is
important for understanding the scope of the show’s impact.

◆Cons: It may be challenging to know specifics about the audience which may make it difficult to draw some conclusions.
5.
Ask students to decide which approach is most helpful and write a few sentences explaining the significance.
Conclude by asking students to identify specific limitations they encountered (i.e. what
information wasn’t available for their source) and explain why particular sourcing approaches
can be more or less valuable for developing historical understanding.

Selecting and Using
Course Materials
Using a wide array of historical source material helps
students become proficient with the historical thinking skills and develop a conceptual understanding of
U.S. history. In addition to using a college-level textbook
that will provide required course content, students
should regularly examine primary source material in
different and varied forms as well as other types of
historical scholarship. Rich, diverse source material
provides more flexibility in designing learning activities
that develop the habits of historical thinking that are essential for student success in the course.
Textbooks
The AP U.S. History course requires the use of a
college-level textbook that includes discussion of
historical developments and processes from 1491 into
the 21st century in a way that encourages conceptual
understanding. While nearly all college-level U.S. history
textbooks will address the various themes of U.S. history,
they may cover these thematic approaches differently.
It will be important to identify other types of secondary sources and supplement the textbook accordingly.
Ideally, the textbook selected will use the thematic approaches as threads to make connections across different time periods.
AP Central has an example textbook list of
college-­level textbooks that meet AP Course Audit
resource requirements. Additionally, the AP U.S. History
Teacher Community on AP Central provides reviews
of recently published texts to help teachers determine their appropriateness for the AP course.
Primary Sources
Students will find it useful to analyze primary source
material regularly to deepen their understanding of the
learning objectives and develop the required historical
thinking skills. While publishers are increasingly
including primary source material within the textbook, students should be introduced to a wide variety
of source material so that they can analyze historical
evidence from diverse sources. These sources should
include written documents as well as images, such as
photographs, cartoons, and works of art. The ancillary
materials and website sources that accompany most of
the recently published textbooks may have high-quality
primary source documents, artwork, charts, and other
sources of data that are linked to the topics and themes
addressed in the textbook. If the textbook used does
not provide ample primary sources, or the sources are
too brief, teachers may decide to supplement their
course with document readers that provide lengthier
selections or online compilations of primary sources related to particular topic areas.

Secondary Sources
Student success in the course also depends on
exposure to and analysis of multiple secondary sources.
Secondary sources include noncontemporary accounts
of the past written by historians or scholars of other
related disciplines, such as economists, sociologists,
political commentators, or art historians, as well as data
sets, charts, and maps. Secondary sources of all types
can provide a broader and more substantive perspective on topics addressed by a textbook. Additionally, secondary sources can be helpful in supplementing textbooks with older publication dates.
It is especially important that students practice
analyzing and comparing historians’ interpretations of
events. Students should have opportunities to compare
a primary source with a secondary source or compare the views represented by two different secondary sources. This need can often be met by source
collections that provide both primary and secondary
source material, or through ancillary resource material
offered by textbook publishers. When finding resources
to use with students, teachers may consider a variety
of sources that vary in complexity, building toward
publications by practicing historians, university presses, or scholarly journals.
School library media specialists can also help identify databases that contain a variety of useful source material—both primary and secondary. Many schools already subscribe to databases, such as ABC-CLIO,
JSTOR, or Gale, that may augment the materials found
in texts or document readers. Library media specialists
can assist in developing course-specific LibGuides
that give students easy access to the source material identified by the teacher.
Teaching with the Founding
Documents
Students who engage in close reading and analysis
of the ideas and debates of the founding documents
gain historical understanding and capacity to trace
the influence of these ideas throughout the course.
For this reason, teachers may use these documents in
an in-depth examination of the themes of the course and ideas of freedom and democracy. Teachers who
are especially interested in using a cross-disciplinary approach, such as American studies, or teaching
this course in conjunction with a course like AP U.S.
Government and Politics, may find this approach especially helpful.
Ultimately, a command of the ideas and language of
the founding documents and their influence will not only help students succeed on the AP Exam and in
college but also will open up opportunities for them to
participate more deeply in civic life in the United States and globally.

Instructional Strategies
The AP U.S. History course framework outlines the concepts and skills students must master in order to be
successful on the AP Exam. To address those concepts and skills effectively, it helps to incorporate a variety of
instructional approaches into daily lessons and activities. The following table presents strategies that can help
students apply their understanding of course concepts.
Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Close Reading
Students read, reread, and analyze small chunks of text word for word, sentence by sentence, and line by line.
Develops comprehensive understanding of a text.
When students are reading foundational documents, such as the Declaration of Independence, have them highlight relevant words and passages that support the author’s claim. Ask students to connect the grievances listed in the third section of the Declaration to specific abuses enacted by Parliament and the king.
Create
Representations
Students create tables, graphs, or other infographics to interpret text or data.
Helps students organize information using multiple ways to present data.
Give students a set of data, such as voting patterns by race and gender, and have them create a graph that best shows the data and the trends.
Critique
Reasoning
Through collaborative discussion, students critique the arguments of others, questioning the author’s perspective, evidence presented, and reasoning behind the argument.
Helps students learn from others as they make connections between concepts and learn to support their arguments with evidence and reasoning that make sense to peers.
Have students critique
Abraham Lincoln’s arguments for reunification in his first inaugural address. Have students examine Lincoln’s perspective and the evidence and reasoning he uses to support this position.
Debate
Students present an informal or formal argument that defends a claim with reasons, while others defend different claims about the same topic or issue. The goal is to debate ideas without attacking the people who defend those ideas.
Gives students an opportunity to collect and orally present evidence supporting the affirmative and negative arguments of a proposition or issue.
Have students debate which
U.S. president was the most significant, using evidence and reasoning to support their claims.

Purpose
Example
Debriefing
Students participate in a facilitated discussion that leads to consensus understanding or helps them identify the key conclusions or takeaways.
Helps students solidify and deepen understanding of content.
For complex issues, such as financial panics, lead students in a debrief to ensure their understanding.
Discussion
Groups
Students engage in an interactive, small-group discussion, often with an assigned role (e.g., questioner, summarizer, facilitator, evidence keeper) to consider a topic, text, question, etc.
Helps students gain new understanding of or insight into a text or issue by listening to multiple perspectives.
Assign students to groups to discuss a learning objective, such as Explain how and why a new national culture developed from 1800 to 1848, with the view to help them gain new understanding by hearing the views of their classmates.
Fishbowl
Some students form an inner circle and model appropriate discussion techniques while an outer circle of students listens, responds, and evaluates.
Provides students with an opportunity to engage in a formal discussion and to experience roles both as participant and active listener; students also have the responsibility of supporting their opinions and responses using specific textual evidence.
Have students discuss the arguments presented in American Revolution–era documents and how they responded to British actions and policies leading up to the
American Revolution.
Graphic
Organizer
Students use a visual representation for the organization of information.
Builds comprehension and facilitates discussion by representing information in visual form.
Ask students to use a graphic organizer to compare political, economic, religious, social, intellectual, and technological ideas. Make sure students use any organizer thoughtfully and are not simply filling in the blanks.
Guided
Discussion
A guided discussion is an umbrella strategy that allows for the use of different techniques as you guide students through the lesson.
Helps students see the big picture and builds their confidence when dealing with difficult content and/or new skills.
Use brainstorming and quickwrite as strategies during a guided discussion in which you help students understand the motivations and patterns of colonization in North America by European countries and ultimately why the British “won.” continued on next page

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Jigsaw
Each student in a group reads a different text or different passage from a single text, taking on the role of “expert” on what was read. Students share the information from that reading with students from other groups and then return to their original groups to share their new knowledge.
Helps students summarize and present information to others in a way that facilitates an understanding of a text (or multiple texts) or issue without having each student read the text in its entirety; by teaching others, they become experts.
Use this strategy to facilitate understanding of the various objectives and accomplishments of the
Progressive movement. Have students read and analyze primary and secondary sources related to political corruption, social injustice, and economic inequality.
Look for a
Pattern
Students evaluate data or create visual representations to find a trend.
Helps students identify patterns that may be used to draw conclusions.
Using a complex graph (with at least two data sets), such as one showing agricultural production in the late 19th century, have students compare acres under cultivation and crop yield per acre to find a trend and draw a conclusion.
Making
Connections
Students are given a concept, term, or document and asked to write what they know about it. Then students are paired and asked to determine, describe, and then explain the connection between the two concepts.
Reinforces the fact that concepts are often connected and provides the opportunity for students to make and explain connections between and among these concepts.
Write concepts related to one of the course themes on cards, place them in a box, and have students pick a concept at random. Give students a few minutes to gather and recall information about the term and then pair students and ask them to find the connection between their concepts. Finally, ask the pairs to write a brief explanation of how the concepts are related.
Match Claims and Evidence
Students are given sample claims (most of which can be improved on) to evaluate and revise. Then students match their revised claims with pieces of evidence that can be used to support the claims.
Once matched, students write a statement explaining how and why the evidence supports the claim.
Provides opportunities for students to edit existing claims and match those claims with existing evidence in preparation for writing their own argumentative essays.
In early stages of practicing argumentation, ask small groups of students to write claims and supporting evidence statements based on a prompt. Have groups trade claims and evidence and revise or modify the claims (if necessary), match the claims and evidence, and write statements explaining why the evidence supports the claim.

Questioning the Text
Developing literal, interpretive, and universal questions about a text while reading it.
Allows students to engage more actively with texts, read with greater purpose and focus, and ultimately answer questions to gain greater insight into the text.
Ask students to read and analyze propaganda posters from either World War I or II and write down any clarification and discussion questions that come to mind while reading the text. Form groups around similar questions and ask students to research answers from a source, such as the textbook. Have groups present their findings and lead a discussion about propaganda, mobilization, and preparedness.
Quickwrite
Students write for a short, specific amount of time about a designated topic.
Helps students generate ideas in a short time.
As preparation for the free response questions, use
Unit 5: Learning Objective B,
Explain the causes and effects of westward expansion from 1844 to 1877, to have students write claims and explain evidence that supports their claims for various topics.
Self/Peer
Revision
Students work alone or with a partner to examine a piece of writing for accuracy and clarity.
Provides students with an opportunity for editing a written text to ensure correctness of identified components.
Have students perform self and peer revisions of their practice argument essays so that they have the opportunity to review their practice claims, supporting evidence, sourcing, and analysis and reasoning.

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Shared Inquiry
Students actively read a provocative text, asking interpretive questions (questions for which there are no predetermined right answers) before and during reading. After reading the text, students engage with their peers to make meaning from the text, offer different answers to the questions, and debate one another, supporting their positions with specific evidence from the text.
Allows a teacher to lead a deep discussion about a text and encourages diverse ideas to emerge as students think deeply and share interpretations.
Provide a selection of primary sources from individuals involved in Latino, American
Indian, and Asian American movements. In groups, ask students to formulate
responses to Unit 8: Learning
Objective L, Explain how and why various groups responded to calls for the expansion of civil rights from 1960 to 1980, and present their ideas to the class.
Then lead a whole-group discussion comparing these movements to the African
American movement for civil rights.
Socratic
Seminar
A focused discussion tied to a topic, question, or selected text in which students ask questions of one another.
The questions initiate a conversation that continues with a series of responses and additional questions.
Helps students arrive at a new understanding by asking questions that clarify; challenging assumptions; probing perspective and point of view; questioning facts, reasons, and evidence;
or examining implications and outcomes.
Use a question such as
How and why was the United
States a world leader after
World War II? to initiate a discussion in which students can illustrate their understanding of the learning objectives and historical development statements.
Think-Pair-
Share
Students think through a question or issue alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with the class.
Enables the development of initial ideas that are then tested with a partner in preparation for revising ideas and sharing them with a larger group.
To practice comparing the responses by the executive, legislative, and judicial branches to the calls for expansion of civil rights, have students use think-pair-share to come up with similarities, differences, and relevance to the historical situation.

Developing Historical
Thinking Skills
Throughout the AP U.S. History course, students will develop skills that are
fundamental to the study of history. Since these historical thinking skills represent
the complex skills that adept historians demonstrate, students will benefit from
multiple opportunities to develop them in a scaffolded manner.
The historical thinking skills and reasoning processes used in the course framework
help students begin to understand and create historical arguments in a process
similar to that used by historians. This process begins with a close analysis of
historical sources and reaches its conclusion when evidence, drawn from historical
sources, is used effectively to support an argument about the past.
The tables on the pages that follow look at each of the skills and provide examples
of tasks or questions for each skill, along with instructional notes and strategies for integrating that skill into the course.

Historical Thinking Skill 1:
Identify and explain historical developments and processes
Historical knowledge is gained from a variety of formats: knowledge transfer from
the teacher, reading textbooks, analyzing primary and secondary sources, and from
other media. In order to perform historical analysis and argumentation, students
need to establish a depth of knowledge about historical events, processes, and
people and their actions. This skill allows students to gain that empirical knowledge
that they can then apply using more sophisticated skills.
Skill
Tasks/Questions
Sample Activity
Instructional
Strategies 1.A Identify a historical concept, development, or process.
§ Identify the characteristics and traits of a concept, development, or process.
§ What does the historical evidence tell you about a concept, development, or process?
Ask students to read the “Declaration of Sentiments” and identify the sentiments expressed by the authors.

Historical Thinking Skill 2: Analyze sourcing and situation of primary and secondary sources
Historians use primary sources and the arguments of other historians (secondary
sources) as the foundation for creating an understanding about historical
events—in short, a historical argument. Sources need to be closely evaluated so
that they can be used properly to support, refute, or even modify an argument. By
using these skills, students will build an understanding of source analysis that they
can later use in developing their own historical arguments. Good analysis requires a critical evaluation of the source’s limitations.
Skill
Tasks/Questions
Sample Activity
Instructional
Strategies 2.A Identify a source’s point of view, purpose, historical situation, and/or audience.
§ Identify the author.
§ Identify his or her perspective.
§ Identify the purpose.
§ Identify the intended audience.
§ Place the source within its historical situation.
Lead students on a guided reading of Booker T. Washington’s “Atlanta Compromise” speech. Ask them to identify the author and his perspective (point of view).
§ Critique
Reasoning § Jigsaw 2.B Explain the point of view, purpose, historical situation, and/or audience of a source.
§ Explain the many different variables that impact a
source’s:
◆	 Content ◆	 Tone ◆	 Interpretation ◆	 Audience ◆	 Purpose
Ask students to examine the factors that led
Booker T. Washington to respond to Jim Crow the way he did in the time period of the late 19th and early 20th centuries?
§ Socratic
Seminar 2.C Explain the significance of a source’s point of view, purpose, historical situation, and/or audience, including how these might limit the use(s) of a source.
§ Why does the source’s point of view, purpose, historical situation, and audience matter?
§ What does the source not tell you?
§ How do the tone and audience of a source affect its value to historians?
§ How could historians use this information in their analysis of evidence?
Identify the justifications used by James K. Polk when he asked Congress for a declaration of war against
Mexico in 1846. Have students explain how the purpose, historical situation, and/or audience might limit the use(s) of this source.

Historical Thinking Skill 3: Analyze arguments in primary and secondary sources
Because historians rely on primary and secondary sources to serve as evidence
to support their claims, they need to closely analyze these sources. This analysis
includes investigating what the source does and does not communicate,
determining the argument established by a source, and identifying the evidence the author uses to support that argument.
Skill
Tasks/Questions
Sample Activity
Instructional
Strategies 3.A Identify and describe a claim and/or argument in a text-based or non text-based source.
§ What is the author trying to prove in the source?
Ask students to identify
Benjamin Franklin’s argument in his “Join or Die” political cartoon.
§ Debriefing 3.B Identify the evidence used in a source to support an argument.
§ What is the source’s argument?
§ What specific examples does the author use to support the argument?
Ask students to identify the justifications that
William McKinley presents in his April 11, 1898, message to Congress requesting a declaration of war against Spain.
§ Critique
Reasoning 3.C Compare the arguments or main ideas of two sources.
§ Identify the argument or main idea in each source.
§ What are the similarities between the arguments or main ideas in each source?
§ What are the differences between the arguments or main ideas in each source?
Using excerpted transcripts of majority and dissenting opinions, ask students to compare the justices’ interpretations of the 14th Amendment in the case
Plessy v. Ferguson (1896).
§ Fishbowl 3.D Explain how claims or evidence support, modify, or refute a source’s argument.
§ Explain the source's claim.
§ Explain the evidence presented in the source.
§ Explain how outside evidence supports the claims in the source.
§ Explain how outside evidence contradicts the claims in the source.
Ask students to explain the arguments made in the
Declaration of Independence.
What outside evidence supports and refutes the claims made?

Historical Thinking Skill 4: Analyze the context of historical events, developments, or processes
Historical events, developments, and processes do not happen in a vacuum. They
cannot be understood without proper examination within the relevant context.
While students are often taught to focus on comparison, causality, and patterns of
continuity and change over time as ways to look at these events, historical context
also plays a part. Analyzing historical events using context helps students see the
big picture and make the connections they will need to make when developing
thoughtful arguments. These skills guide students through the process of contextual analysis.
Skill
Tasks/Questions
Sample Activity
Instructional
Strategies 4.A Identify and describe a historical context for a specific historical development or process.
§ What events led up to the one being studied?
§ What else is happening in North America or the world at this time?
The United States acquired lands mainly in the Western
Hemisphere. As you move into studying Unit 6, have students relate the various motivations for the acquisition of those lands to broader economic and political developments.
§ Debriefing § Discussion
Groups 4.B Explain how a specific historical development or process is situated within a broader historical context.
§ What does the source tell us about the time in which it was created?
§ Use historical reasoning to explain how an event relates to a broader process.

§ Examine the evidence through the lens of another historical event or development.
§ How can this evidence be used to explain other, related historical events?
Have students examine
Washington’s Proclamation of Neutrality in the context of the American Revolution and the U.S. Constitution. Extend the discussion to include
American foreign policy of the 1790s under Washington.

Analyzing patterns and making connections is the bridge between all of the
previous historical thinking skills. This skill pulls everything together and allows
students to connect all concepts. Whether they are using sources or their own
historical knowledge, students will use the historical reasoning processes to identify
and explain patterns and connections between historical events and developments.

Historical Thinking Skill 6: Develop an argument
Writing claims is often the first argumentation skill that students practice, but claims
are difficult to develop without prompting. Giving students prompts to work with can
help them as they learn this skill. The prompt should establish parameters that force
students to take a position, either by choosing one of two presented alternatives or
by assessing the extent to which a given proposition or scenario is valid.
In order to develop a historically defensible claim, students need to know what
evidence is available to support that claim. They can practice writing claims using
just their knowledge as evidence, as they will in the long essay question. They
should also write claims using documents, to practice both evidence and sourcing
(a few at first, then build quantity as students gain skills and confidence), as they will in the document-based question.
The reasoning processes, discussed in more depth starting on page 236, will
help students develop historical reasoning needed to appropriately connect their evidence to their claims.
There is no simple path to teaching students to develop complex arguments. The
tasks/questions and the sample activities in the table below can serve as a roadmap.
However, students will also need a mastery of the course content, source analysis,
a highly developed understanding of historical context, and the ability to make
connections between and among events to demonstrate this skill. In short, it is the culminating skill for an AP U.S. History student.
Skill
Tasks/Questions
Sample Activity
Instructional
Strategies 6.A Make a historically defensible claim.
§ What do you know about the development or processes established in the prompt?
§ What are your options regarding positions to take?
§ What historical reasoning process is indicated (or best fits the structure of the essay you plan to write)?
§ Based on the prompt and the evidence (either provided or from your own knowledge), which position will you take?
§ State in a few words how you will prove your claim (“because” statement).
Provide students with a practice writing prompt, such as Evaluate the extent to which Manifest
Destiny was motivated by social or economic reasons.
Have students break down the prompt into potential positions (Manifest Destiny was socially motivated or Manifest Destiny was economically motivated, or was motivated by both).
Have them identify a historical reasoning process that best fits the essay that they would go on to develop (such as comparison or causation).
Ask them to think of evidence that would support all of the identified positions. Then ask them to write a defensible claim that establishes a line of reasoning by stating their chosen position and providing a roadmap for how they are going to prove their claim (“because” statement).

Strategies 6.B Support an argument using specific and relevant evidence.
§ Describe specific examples of historically relevant evidence.
§ Explain how specific examples of historically relevant evidence support an argument.
§ Brainstorm relevant evidence that relates to the development or process established in the prompt.
§ Hone your initial list of evidence by describing specific examples that support the argument.
§ If practicing a document based question, evaluate the evidence provided.
§ Determine whether the evidence supports, refutes, or modifies each of the possible positions.
Provide students with three to four documents* that could be used to support the positions outlined in a sample prompt, such as Evaluate the extent to which Reconstruction produced a radical change in the lives of African Americans.
Ask students to evaluate the evidence using a Venn diagram.
They should group the evidence into three categories: evidence that supports the idea that
Reconstruction was a radical change, evidence that the change was not as radical, and evidence that could be used to support both positions. For each piece of evidence, have students write a statement explaining how the evidence supports the position(s).
*Teachers can use this same activity for long essay question practice by asking students to brainstorm relevant evidence instead of providing documents.

§ If causation is indicated, how does the evidence show a pattern of causes and/or effects?
§ If continuity and change is indicated, identify patterns or developments that indicate it and draw conclusions in support of your claim.
In a practice argumentation essay, have students identify the historical reasoning process indicated in the prompt. Then have them develop and use a graphic organizer (such as a
Venn diagram or flow chart) to arrange the evidence in a way that reflects the organizational structure of the historical reasoning process.

Developing the
Reasoning Processes
Reasoning processes describe the cognitive operations
that students will be required to apply when engaging
with the historical thinking skills on the AP Exam. The
reasoning processes ultimately represent ways in which historians think.
Student responses on the AP Exam should reflect
their ability to apply a reasoning process that aligns
to the intent of the question. For example, if students are asked to explain how and why European and Native American perspectives of others developed and changed in the period 1450–1607, successful student responses will be organized around the reasoning process of comparison. In many cases,
guiding students toward a better alignment between the reasoning process and the task unlocks their
understanding and helps them improve their writing.

Questions 5–7 refer to the following excerpt.
“The Erie Canal poured into New York City [wealth] far exceeding that which
its early friends predicted. . . . In the city, merchants, bankers, warehousemen,

services, fostering round after round of business innovations that within a
decade of the opening of the Erie Canal had made New York by far the best place in America to engage in commerce. . . .
“. . . Even before its economic benefits were realized fully, rival seaports
with hopes of tapping interior trade began to imagine dreadful prospects
of permanent eclipse. Whatever spirit of mutual good feeling and national
welfare once greeted [internal improvements] now disappeared behind
desperate efforts in cities . . . to create for themselves a westward connection.”

PART B: SHORT-ANSWER QUESTION WITH SECONDARY SOURCE
The following is an example of short-answer question 1 found on the AP Exam.
Note that on the actual AP Exam, students will answer three short-answer questions.
1.	 “Of all the amusements that bedazzled the single working woman, dancing
proved to be her greatest passion. After a long day laboring in a factory or shop,
young women dressed themselves in their fanciest finery, put on their dancing
shoes, and hurried out to the neighborhood hall, ballroom, or saloon equipped
with a dance floor. . . . By the 1910s, over five hundred public dance halls opened
their doors each evening throughout greater New York. . . .
“New ballrooms and dance palaces offered a novel kind of social space for
their female patrons, enhancing and legitimizing their participation in a
public social life. The commercial culture of the dance halls meshed with
that of working-class youth in a symbiotic relationship, reinforcing emergent values and ‘modern’ attitudes.”
Kathy Peiss, historian, Cheap Amusements: Working Women and Leisure in Turn-of-the-Century New York, 1986
“As strikers thronged the public streets of New York City [in 1909],
demonstrated in parades and mass meetings, and picketed in front of
factories, they challenged established assumptions about the identity and
appearance of political actors and access to public space. These working-class,
largely immigrant women comprised a subordinated group long denied an
active voice in recognized political forums. By occupying the arena of labor
politics through a mass strike, they demanded a voice.”
Nan Enstad, historian, Ladies of Labor, Girls of Adventure:
Working Women, Popular Culture, and Labor Politics at the Turn of the
Twentieth Century, 1999
Using the excerpts above, answer (a), (b), and (c).
(A)	Briefly describe ONE important difference between Peiss’ and Enstad’s
historical interpretations of women’s emergence in the public sphere at the turn of the twentieth century.
(B)	 Briefly explain how ONE specific historical event, development, or
circumstance from the period 1880–1929 that is not specifically mentioned
in the excerpts could be used to support Peiss’ argument.
(C)	 Briefly explain how ONE specific historical event, development, or
circumstance from the period 1880–1929 that is not specifically mentioned
in the excerpts could be used to support Enstad’s argument.

Document 2
Source: Josiah Strong, Our Country: Its Possible Future and Its Present Crisis, 1885.
It seems to me that God, with infinite wisdom and skill, is training the
Anglo-Saxon race for an hour sure to come in the world’s future. Heretofore
there has always been in the history of the world a comparatively unoccupied
land westward, into which the crowded countries of the East have poured
their surplus populations. But the widening waves of migration, which
millenniums ago rolled east and west from the valley of the Euphrates, meet
today on our Pacific coast. There are no more new worlds. The unoccupied
arable lands of the earth are limited, and will soon be taken. The time is
coming when the pressure of population on the means of subsistence will
be felt here as it is now felt in Europe and Asia. Then will the world enter
upon a new stage of its history—the final competition of races, for which
the Anglo-Saxon is being schooled. . . . Then this race of unequaled energy,
with all the majesty of numbers and the might of wealth behind it—the
representative, let us hope, of the largest liberty, the purest Christianity, the
highest civilization—having developed peculiarly aggressive traits calculated
to impress its institutions upon mankind, will spread itself over the earth.
Document 3
Source: Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, The Interest of America in Sea Power,
Present and Future, 1897.
To affirm the importance of distant markets, and the relation to them of
our own immense powers of production, implies logically the recognition
of the link that joins the products and the markets,—that is, the carrying
trade; the three together constituting that chain of maritime power to which
Great Britain owes her wealth and greatness. Further, is it too much to say that,
as two of these links, the shipping and the markets, are exterior to our own
borders, the acknowledgment of them carries with it a view of the relations of
the United States to the world radically distinct from the simple idea of self sufficingness? . . . There will dawn the realization of America’s unique position,
facing the older worlds of the East and West, her shores washed by the oceans
which touch the one or the other, but which are common to her alone.
Despite a certain great original superiority conferred by our geographical
nearness and immense resources,—due, in other words, to our natural
advantages, and not to our intelligent preparations,—the United States is
woefully unready, not only in fact but in purpose, to assert in the Caribbean
and Central America a weight of influence proportioned to the extent of
her interests. We have not the navy, and, what is worse, we are not willing to
have the navy, that will weigh seriously in any disputes with those nations
whose interests will conflict there with our own. We have not, and we are
not anxious to provide, the defence of the seaboard which will leave the navy
free for its work at sea. We have not, but many other powers have, positions, either within or on the borders of the Caribbean.

Note, July 3, 1900.
To the Representatives of the United States at Berlin, London, Paris, Rome,
St. Petersburg, and Tokyo Washington, July 3, 1900
In this critical posture of affairs in China it is deemed appropriate to define
the attitude of the United States as far as present circumstances permit this
to be done. We adhere to the policy . . . of peace with the Chinese nation, of
furtherance of lawful commerce, and of protection of lives and property of
our citizens by all means guaranteed under extraterritorial treaty rights and
by the law of nations. . . . We regard the condition at Pekin[g] as one of virtual
anarchy. . . . The purpose of the President is . . . to act concurrently with the
other powers; first, in opening up communication with Pekin[g] and rescuing
the American officials, missionaries, and other Americans who are in
danger; secondly, in affording all possible protection everywhere in China to
American life and property; thirdly, in guarding and protecting all legitimate
American interests; and fourthly, in aiding to prevent a spread of the disorders
to the other provinces of the Empire and a recurrence of such disasters. . . .
The policy of the Government of the United States is to seek a solution which
may bring about permanent safety and peace to China, preserve Chinese
territorial and administrative entity, protect all rights guaranteed to friendly
powers by treaty and international law, and safeguard for the world the
principle of equal and impartial trade with all parts of the Chinese Empire.

Source: President Theodore Roosevelt, Fourth Annual Message to Congress,
December 6, 1904.
There are kinds of peace which are highly undesirable, which are in the long
run as destructive as any war. Tyrants and oppressors have many times made a
wilderness and called it peace. Many times peoples who were slothful or timid
or shortsighted, who had been enervated by ease or by luxury, or misled by false
teachings, have shrunk in unmanly fashion from doing duty that was stern and
that needed self-sacrifice, and have sought to hide from their own minds their
shortcomings, their ignoble motives, by calling them love of peace. . . .
It is our duty to remember that a nation has no more right to do injustice
to another nation, strong or weak, than an individual has to do injustice to
another individual; that the same moral law applies in one case as in the other.
But we must also remember that it is as much the duty of the Nation to guard
its own rights and its own interests as it is the duty of the individual so to do. . . .
It is not true that the United States feels any land hunger or entertains any
projects as regards the other nations of the Western Hemisphere save such
as are for their welfare. All that this country desires is to see the neighboring
countries stable, orderly, and prosperous. Any country whose people
conduct themselves well can count upon our hearty friendship. If a nation
shows that it knows how to act with reasonable efficiency and decency in
social and political matters, if it keeps order and pays its obligations, it need
fear no interference from the United States. Chronic wrongdoing, or an
impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society,
may in America, as elsewhere, ultimately require intervention by some
civilized nation, and . . . the exercise of an international police power.

Scoring Criteria
Decision Rules
A.  THESIS/CLAIM (0–1 pt) 1 pt.
Responds to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis/ claim that establishes a line of reasoning.
To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt rather than restating or rephrasing the prompt.
The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion.
B.  CONTEXTUALIZATION (0–1 pt) 1 pt.
Describes a broader historical context relevant to the prompt.
To earn this point, the response must describe broader historical events, developments, or processes that occur before, during, or continue after the time frame of the prompt that are relevant to the topic. This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference.
AP History Rubrics
Introductory notes:
§ Except where otherwise noted, each point of the rubric is earned independently.
For instance, a student could earn a point for evidence beyond the documents without earning a point for thesis/claim.
§ Accuracy: The components of this rubric each require that students demonstrate
historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, a
response may contain errors that do not detract from its overall quality, as long as
the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate.
§ Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain
grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a student unless
they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and reasoning processes described in the rubrics.

Scoring Guidelines
1.	 “Of all the amusements that bedazzled the single working woman, dancing proved to be her greatest passion.
After a long day laboring in a factory or shop, young women dressed themselves in their fanciest finery, put on their
dancing shoes, and hurried out to the neighborhood hall, ballroom, or saloon equipped with a dance floor. . . .
By the 1910s, over five hundred public dance halls opened their doors each evening throughout greater New York. . . .
“New ballrooms and dance palaces offered a novel kind of social space for their female patrons,
enhancing and legitimizing their participation in a public social life. The commercial culture of the dance
halls meshed with that of working-class youth in a symbiotic relationship, reinforcing emergent values and ‘modern’ attitudes.”
Kathy Peiss, historian, Cheap Amusements: Working Women and Leisure in Turn-of-the-Century New York, 1986
“As strikers thronged the public streets of New York City [in 1909], demonstrated in parades and mass
meetings, and picketed in front of factories, they challenged established assumptions about the identity and
appearance of political actors and access to public space. These working-class, largely immigrant women comprised
a subordinated group long denied an active voice in recognized political forums. By occupying the arena of labor
politics through a mass strike, they demanded a voice.”
Nan Enstad, historian, Ladies of Labor, Girls of Adventure:
Working Women, Popular Culture, and Labor Politics at the Turn of the Twentieth Century, 1999
Using the excerpts above, answer (a), (b), and (c).
(A)	Briefly describe ONE important difference between Peiss’ and Enstad’s historical interpretations of
women’s emergence in the public sphere at the turn of the twentieth century.
(B)	 Briefly explain how ONE specific historical event, development, or circumstance from the period
1880–1929 that is not specifically mentioned in the excerpts could be used to support Peiss’ argument.
(C)	 Briefly explain how ONE specific historical event, development, or circumstance from the period
1880–1929 that is not specifically mentioned in the excerpts could be used to support Enstad’s argument

Scoring Guidelines for Part B: Short-Answer Question with Secondary Source  3 points
(A)
Describe one important difference between Peiss’s and Enstad’s historical interpretations of women’s
emergence in the public sphere at the turn of the twentieth century.
Examples that earn this point include the following:
•	 Peiss argues that pursuits of entertainment in dance halls by working class women created new,
legitimate social spaces for women, however Enstand argues that working women’s participation in
labor politics gave them a new voice and place in the public sphere.
•	 Peiss links the growth of women in public social life to a commercial culture that provided opportunities
for women to enter the public sphere while Enstand argues that women became political actors who demanded a public voice.
1 point
(B)
Explain how one historical event, development, or circumstance from the period 1880–1929 that is not
specifically mentioned in the excerpts could be used to support Peiss’s argument.
Examples that earn this point include the following:
•	 Like the dance halls, department stores and amusement parks became aspects of the commercial
culture that represented new opportunities for women to enjoy public places as legitimate participants.
•	 The concept of the New Woman became a cultural phenomenon, as the older idea of separate spheres
diminished. The idea of the New Woman supported a more public role for women in the early 1900s.
•	 The growth of cities and urban America gave young women more opportunities to leave rural America
and participate in the developments described by Peiss.
•	 New technologies such as electric lighting made possible new public spaces for personal freedom for women.
1 point
(C)
Explain how one specific historical event, development, or circumstance from the period 1880–1929 that
is not specifically mentioned in the excerpts could be used to support Enstad’s argument.
Examples that earn this point include the following:
•	 Women’s participation in the suffrage movement, settlement house work, temperance organizing, and
the Progressive movement all contributed to modern attitudes about women and increased their roles in the public sphere.
•	 The ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution gave women the vote and a voice in politics.
•	 Women were the main participants in the New York shirtwaist strike of 1909. During this strike women
made public demands like those described by Enstad.
•	 Women organized or participated in labor unions such as the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’
Union (ILGWU) which is an example of their growing voice in the public sphere.
•	 Working-class women had key public roles in the successful Lawrence (Massachusetts) textile strike of
1912, this demonstrates that women became active political voices through labor movements.

It seems to me that God, with infinite wisdom and skill, is training the Anglo-Saxon race for an hour sure to come
in the world’s future. Heretofore there has always been in the history of the world a comparatively unoccupied land
westward, into which the crowded countries of the East have poured their surplus populations. But the widening
waves of migration, which millenniums ago rolled east and west from the valley of the Euphrates, meet today on our
Pacific coast. There are no more new worlds. The unoccupied arable lands of the earth are limited, and will soon be
taken. The time is coming when the pressure of population on the means of subsistence will be felt here as it is now
felt in Europe and Asia. Then will the world enter upon a new stage of its history—the final competition of races, for
which the Anglo-Saxon is being schooled. . . . Then this race of unequaled energy, with all the majesty of numbers
and the might of wealth behind it—the representative, let us hope, of the largest liberty, the purest Christianity,
the highest civilization—having developed peculiarly aggressive traits calculated to impress its institutions upon mankind, will spread itself over the earth.

To affirm the importance of distant markets, and the relation to them of our own immense powers of production,
implies logically the recognition of the link that joins the products and the markets,—that is, the carrying trade;
the three together constituting that chain of maritime power to which Great Britain owes her wealth and greatness.
Further, is it too much to say that, as two of these links, the shipping and the markets, are exterior to our own borders,
the acknowledgment of them carries with it a view of the relations of the United States to the world radically distinct
from the simple idea of self-sufficingness? . . . There will dawn the realization of America’s unique position, facing the
older worlds of the East and West, her shores washed by the oceans which touch the one or the other, but which are common to her alone.
Despite a certain great original superiority conferred by our geographical nearness and immense resources,—due,
in other words, to our natural advantages, and not to our intelligent preparations,—the United States is woefully
unready, not only in fact but in purpose, to assert in the Caribbean and Central America a weight of influence
proportioned to the extent of her interests. We have not the navy, and, what is worse, we are not willing to have the
navy, that will weigh seriously in any disputes with those nations whose interests will conflict there with our own. We
have not, and we are not anxious to provide, the defence of the seaboard which will leave the navy free for its work at
sea. We have not, but many other powers have, positions, either within or on the borders of the Caribbean.

Source: President Theodore Roosevelt, Fourth Annual Message to Congress, December 6, 1904.
There are kinds of peace which are highly undesirable, which are in the long run as destructive as any war. Tyrants and
oppressors have many times made a wilderness and called it peace. Many times peoples who were slothful or timid
or shortsighted, who had been enervated by ease or by luxury, or misled by false teachings, have shrunk in unmanly
fashion from doing duty that was stern and that needed self-sacrifice, and have sought to hide from their own minds
their shortcomings, their ignoble motives, by calling them love of peace. . . .
It is our duty to remember that a nation has no more right to do injustice to another nation, strong or weak, than an
individual has to do injustice to another individual; that the same moral law applies in one case as in the other. But we
must also remember that it is as much the duty of the Nation to guard its own rights and its own interests as it is the duty of the individual so to do. . . .
It is not true that the United States feels any land hunger or entertains any projects as regards the other nations of
the Western Hemisphere save such as are for their welfare. All that this country desires is to see the neighboring
countries stable, orderly, and prosperous. Any country whose people conduct themselves well can count upon
our hearty friendship. If a nation shows that it knows how to act with reasonable efficiency and decency in social
and political matters, if it keeps order and pays its obligations, it need fear no interference from the United States.
Chronic wrongdoing, or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society, may
in America, as elsewhere, ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation, and . . . the exercise of an international police power.

1 point
Responds to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis/claim that establishes a line of reasoning.
Decision Rules and Scoring Notes
Responses that do not earn this point:
•
Are not historically defensible.
•
Only restate or rephrase the prompt.
•
Do not respond to the prompt.
•
Do not establish a line of reasoning.
•
Are overgeneralized.
Responses that earn this point:
•
Provide a historically defensible thesis or claim about the causes of the expanding
role of the United States in the world in the period from 1865 to 1910. The thesis or
claim must either provide some indication of the reason for making that claim OR establish categories of the argument.
Examples that do not earn this point:
Do not focus on the topic of the prompt •
“American imperialism contributed to calls for isolationist policies after
World War I.”
Provide a historically defensible claim, but do not establish a line of reasoning •
“The United States gained a lot of territory during this period.”
Provide a restatement of the prompt •
“Different causes and events had a major importance in expanding the role of the US in the world.”
Examples that earn this point:
Establish a line of reasoning with analytic categories •
“In expanding its role in the world, the United States sought economic opportunity
through international business relationships, political opportunity to police the
world, and they sought to cultivate other societies to better spread the American culture.” •
“The country was doing this for a few reasons, such as expanding its territory
(manifest destiny or imperialism), preserving its national interests such as trading with China, and helping other nations.”
Establish a line of reasoning that evaluates the topic of the prompt with analytic categories •
“This change in foreign policy was caused by the need for new markets to expand
the US economy and by imperialist sentiment. However, the most important
cause of this change in the US’s role can be attributed to nationalist and Darwinist
sentiment because it was driven emotionally, and therefore was a stronger motive.” •
“While some historians may argue that the US desire to expand its role in the world
was due to the fact that the US felt it was its duty to civilize nations and act as a global
police, the most important reason for America expanding its role in the world can be
attributed to its competition with Europe over global influence, its desire to expand its
economy through trading opportunities, and the US ideal of manifest destiny.”
Establish a line of reasoning •
“From 1865 to 1910 the United States expanded its role in the world because
of the belief in manifest destiny.” (Minimally acceptable thesis/claim)
Additional Notes:
•
The thesis or claim must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion (which may not be limited to the first or last paragraphs).
•
The thesis or claim must identify a relevant development(s) in the period, although it is not required to encompass the entire period.

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes
Responses that do not earn points:
•	 Use evidence from less than three of the documents •	 Misinterpret the content of the document •	 Quote, without an accompanying description, of the content of the documents •	 Address documents collectively rather than considering separately the content of each document
Responses that earn 1 point:
•	 Accurately describe—rather than simply quote— the content from at least three of the documents
to address the causes of the expanding role of the
United States in the world from 1865 to 1910.
Responses that earn 2 points:
•	 Support an argument in response to the prompt by accurately using the content of at least four documents.
Examples of describing the content of a document:
Describe evidence from the documents relevant to
the topic but do not use that evidence to support an argument
•	 (Document 6): “The image depicts Uncle Sam offering potential colonies the choice between choosing education or war.”
•	 (Document 2): “The document demonstrates how
many American believed their religion to be superior and had pride in their racial heritage.”
Examples of supporting an argument using the content of a document:
•	 (Document 2): “However, social causes were also a factor in the practice of American imperialism. This was seen through the application of Social Darwinism to a global scale. Many felt that Anglo-Saxons were a more fit race than any to expand, and Christianize
and civilize the rest of the world (Doc 2).” (Uses evidence from the document to support an argument about a social cause of American imperialism)
•	 (Document 3): “Mahan argues that the United
States needs a stronger navy to support its growing economy and maintain its power.
Having a strong navy meant gaining bases for it around the world.” (Uses evidence from the document to support an argument about economic and military causes for American imperialism)
Additional Notes:
•
To earn two points, the four documents do not have to be used in support of a single argument—they can be used across sub-arguments or to address counterarguments.

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes
Responses that do not earn this point:
•	 Explain sourcing for fewer than two of the documents.
•
Identify the point of view, purpose, historical
situation, and/or audience but fail to explain how or why it is relevant to an argument.
•
Summarize the content or argument of the document
without explaining the relevance of this summary to
the point of view, purpose, historical situation, and/or audience.
Responses that earn this point:
•
Must explain how or why — rather than simply identifying — the document’s point of view,
purpose, historical situation, or audience is relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt for each of the two documents sourced.
Examples that do not earn this point:
Identify the point of view, purpose, historical
situation, and/or audience, but do not explain how or why it is relevant to an argument • “In document 1, the audience is the United States government.”
Summarize the content of the document without
explaining the relevance of this to the point of view, purpose, historical situation, and/or audience • “The purpose of this document was to tell America why Russia was ceding its territory and giving permission.”
Example of acceptable explanation of the relevance of the author’s point of view:
•
(Document 4): “The point of view of the artist is actually critical of America’s policy of imperialism,
seeing it as a sign of America’s ego in its superiority and greed.” (Connects the point of view of
the document relevant to an argument about the ideological and economic causes of American imperialism)
Example of acceptable explanation of the relevance of the author’s purpose •
(Document 6): “Puck, being a satire magazine, likely published this cartoon with the purpose of
showing the hypocritical nature of the Spanish-American War; it was fought to liberate Cuba,
but it ended with the oppression of the Philippines.” (Connects the purpose of the document
relevant to an argument about the ideological causes of the Spanish-American War)
Example of acceptable explanation of the relevance of the historical situation of a source:
•
(Document 4): “The cartoon is best understood in the context of the Spanish American War. The
Spanish gave up its claims to Cuba and the Philippines, leaving the territory open for the US to
take advantage of.” (Connects the historical situation of the document relevant to an argument
about the increased possibilities for the United States to exert international influence during the period)
Example of acceptable explanation of the relevance of the audience:
•
(Document 5): “As a presidential address to Congress, document 7 likely offers a picture of what
Theodore Roosevelt believed to be the most convincing reasons for the United States to grow
its standing in the world.” (Connects the audience of the document relevant to an argument that
addresses the political justifications for increasing United States participation in the world) continued on next page

General Scoring Notes
•	 Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a student could earn
a point for evidence without earning a point for thesis/claim.
•	 Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible content
knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality,
as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate.
•	 Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not
be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and practices described below.

Responses that earn 2 points:
•
Use at least two specific historical examples to

Examples that do not earn points:
Provide evidence that is not relevant to the topic of the prompt • “The 13th Amendment is an example of the increase in the power of the federal government because it abolished slavery.”
Examples of evidence that are specific and relevant include the following (two examples required):
•
Anti-Federalists’ role in the ratification debate •
Federalists’ role in the ratification debate •
The role of the Federalist papers in shaping the republic •
Alexander Hamilton’s role in shaping the republic •
John Jay’s role in shaping the republic •
Thomas Jefferson’s role in shaping the republic •
James Monroe’s role in shaping the republic •
The passage of the Northwest Ordinance under the
Articles of Confederation •

Constitution •
George Washington’s role in shaping the republic •
The resistance to federal power that occurred during the Whiskey Rebellion
Example of a statement that earns one point for
evidence:
•
“John Jay and Alexander Hamilton wrote many of the
Federalist papers.”
Examples that successfully support an argument
with evidence:
• “Alexander Hamilton’s arguments in the Federalist
papers were a key factor in the ratification of the
Constitution and helped justify new and expanded functions of the federal government.” (Uses evidence to support an argument about the causes for growing federal power) • “The concerns of the Anti-Federalists during the
ratification debates led to the addition of the Bill
of Rights. The addition of the Bill of Rights actually changed the role of the federal government by explicitly making federal authority a significant
guarantor of individual rights.” (Uses evidence to support an argument about a change in federal authority) • “The suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion is an example of the increased power and authority of the federal government after ratification to collect taxes and maintain domestic order.” (Uses evidence to support an argument about the increased authority of the government after ratification)
Additional Notes:
•
Typically, statements credited as evidence will be more specific than statements credited as contextualization.
•
If a response has a multipart argument, then it can meet the threshold of two pieces of evidence by giving one example for one part of the argument and another
example for a different part of the argument, but the total number of examples must still be at least two.

(For example, using the whiskey tax as evidence of a change in the government’s economic function and the proclamation of neutrality as evidence of change in the government’s diplomatic function.)

May assert the use of historical reasoning but does not use it to frame or structure an argument.
Responses that earn 1 point:
•
Must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an argument on how the United
States Constitution fostered change in the function
of the federal government in the period from 1776 to
1800. The reasoning might be uneven or imbalanced, or the evidence may be overly general or lacking specificity.
Responses that earn 2 points:
May demonstrate a complex understanding through sophisticated
argumentation that is relevant to the prompt. This may be done in a variety of ways, such as:
•
Explaining multiple themes or perspectives to explore complexity or nuance; OR •
Explaining multiple causes or effects, multiple similarities or
differences, or multiple continuities or changes; OR •
Explaining both cause and effect, both similarity and difference, or both continuity and change; OR •
Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across
periods or geographical areas. These connections should clearly
relate to an argument that responds to the prompt.
May demonstrate a complex understanding through effective use of
evidence relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt. This may be done in a variety of ways that might include:
•
Explaining how multiple pieces of specific and relevant evidence (at least
four) support a nuanced or complex argument that responds to the prompt; OR •
Using evidence effectively to demonstrate a sophisticated
understanding of different perspectives relevant to the prompt.

Scoring Criteria
Row D (continued)
Examples that do not earn
points:
Provide evidence but offer no reasoning to connect the evidence to an argument • “The United States constitution, largely written by James Madison, describes the Senate and House of Representatives in article one.”
Using a historical reasoning process to frame or structure an argument could include:
•
Explaining changes in the United States national government from the period under the Articles of
Confederation to the period under the Constitution.
•
Discussing continuities in United States national government-such as its relatively modest power from the period under the Articles of Confederation to the period under the Constitution.
Example of acceptable use of historical reasoning:
• “The United States national government changed
after the ratification of the Constitution by assuming
new functions and responsibilities for new issues,
such as maintaining a national army.” (Indicates a change as a result of the Constitution.)
Demonstrating complex understanding might include any of the
following, if appropriate elaboration is provided:
•
Assessing both Federalist arguments in favor of the Constitution and
Anti-Federalist arguments against it (Explains nuance) •
Explaining both continuities in government before and after the
Constitution (such as many of the same leaders, the same context
of economic crisis) and changes (such as the expansion of federal
authority over taxes and economy). (Explains both continuity and change) •
Making comparisons with the way that the functions of the federal
government changed during the New Deal. (Explains relevant and insightful connections) •
Arguing convincingly that the ratification of the Constitution did not
significantly change social structures in the United States, or that it
reinforced the power of the elite. (Qualifies an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence) •
Corroborating an argument about increased federal power with
economic evidence (e.g. taxation), social evidence (e.g. regulation of
slavery in the territories), and evidence regarding America’s role in the
world (e.g. Quasi-War). (Uses evidence to demonstrate a sophisticated
understanding of different perspectives relevant to the prompt)
Additional Notes:
•
To earn the first point for analysis and reasoning, the response must use historical reasoning to structure a response to the prompt, although the reasoning might be
uneven or imbalanced, or the evidence may be overly general or lacking in specificity.
•
This complex understanding must be part of the argument and may be demonstrated in any part of the response.
•
While it is not necessary for this complex understanding to be woven throughout the response, it must be more than merely a phrase or reference.
