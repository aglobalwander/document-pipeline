AP Equity and Access Policy
College Board strongly encourages educators to make equitable access a guiding
principle for their AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared
students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination
of barriers that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and
socioeconomic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented. Schools
should make every effort to ensure their AP classes reflect the diversity of their
student population. College Board also believes that all students should have
access to academically challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes,
which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to
equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.

About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking
AP courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and
AP Exams are developed and scored by college faculty
and experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges
and universities in the United States grant credit,
advanced placement, or both on the basis of successful
AP Exam scores; more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the content
and skills that are the focus of the corresponding
college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also
organizes the content and skills into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many AP teachers have
told us they follow in order to focus their instruction.
The intention of this publication is to respect teachers’
time and expertise by providing a roadmap that they
can modify and adapt to their local priorities and
preferences. Moreover, by organizing the AP course
content and skills into units, the AP Program is able
to provide teachers and students with free formative assessments—Personal Progress Checks—that
teachers can assign throughout the year to measure
student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students:
Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically
challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to equitable preparation and
access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses:
The AP Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP courses
must participate in the AP Course Audit, a process through which AP teachers’ course materials are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.

AP Statistics Course and Exam Description

=== Page 9 ===
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the
AP teacher and the school principal (or designated
administrator) to confirm awareness and understanding
of the curricular and resource requirements. A syllabus
or course outline, detailing how course requirements
are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The
AP Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor;
all AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision,
piloting, and analysis to ensure that questions are
accurate, fair, and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development,
College Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher
education institutions. This feedback is carefully
considered to ensure that AP courses and exams are
able to provide students with a college-level learning
experience and the opportunity to demonstrate their
qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam
development process, relies on the expertise of both
AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice
questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course performance
assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands
of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are
scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion
is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained,
and their work is monitored throughout the Reading
for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief
Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers
in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of
the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a curve.
Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which means that
every student who meets the criteria for an AP score of
2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no matter how many
students that is. The criteria for the number of points
students must earn on the AP Exam to receive scores
of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently
validates for credit and placement purposes—include:
§§ The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
§§ The number of points researchers have found to be predictive that an AP student will succeed when placed into a subsequent higher-level college course.
§§ Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP scores as follows:
AP Score

College Grade
Equivalent 5
Extremely well qualified
A 4

AP Statistics Course and Exam Description

=== Page 10 ===
While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for
scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and universities.
To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/placement policy, a search engine is available at apstudent .collegeboard.org/creditandplacement/search -credit-policies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score the free-response sections of the AP Exams.
Ninety-eight percent of surveyed educators who took
part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an
AP Reader, including opportunities to:
§§ Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
§§ Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure
to the quality and depth of the responses from the
entire pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
§§ Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
§§ Score from home: AP Readers have online distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects. Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
§§ Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs):
AP Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide suggests a
sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds skill instruction across units, organizes content
into topics, and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course topics and skills, create
customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.
*To report misuses, please call, 877-274-6474  (International: +1-212-632-1781).

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
§§ Teachers and students sign in to or create their College Board accounts.
§§ Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
§§ Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
§§ Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP Coordinator.
§§ Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and
AP Coordinators to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following
additional benefits:
§§ Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
§§ Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
§§ Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student pack.
The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
§§ Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

Instructional
Model
Integrating AP resources throughout the course can help students develop skills and
conceptual understandings. The instructional model outlined below shows possible ways to incorporate AP resources into the classroom.
Plan
Teachers may consider the following approaches as they plan their instruction before teaching each unit.
§§ Review the overview at the start of each unit guide to identify essential questions,
conceptual understandings, and skills for each unit.
§§ Use the Unit at a Glance table to identify related topics that build toward a common
understanding, and then plan appropriate pacing for students.
§§ Identify useful strategies in the Instructional Approaches section to help teach the concepts and skills.
Teach
When teaching, supporting resources could be used to build students’ conceptual understanding and their mastery of skills.
§§ Use the topic pages in the unit guides to identify the required content.
§§ Integrate the content with a skill, considering any appropriate scaffolding.
§§ Employ any of the instructional strategies previously identified.
§§ Use the available resources on the topic pages to bring a variety of assets into the classroom.
Assess
Teachers can measure student understanding of the content and skills covered in the unit and provide actionable feedback to students.
§§ At the end of each unit, use AP Classroom to assign students the online Personal
Progress Checks, as homework or as an in-class task.
§§ Provide question-level feedback to students through answer rationales; provide unit- and
skill-level feedback using the progress dashboard.
§§ Create additional practice opportunities using the AP Question Bank and assign them through AP Classroom.

About the
AP Statistics Course
The AP Statistics course introduces students to the major concepts and tools for collecting,
analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data. There are four themes evident in the
content, skills, and assessment in the AP Statistics course: exploring data, sampling and
experimentation, probability and simulation, and statistical inference. Students use technology,
investigations, problem solving, and writing as they build conceptual understanding.
College Course Equivalent
The AP Statistics course is equivalent to a one-semester, introductory, non-calculus-based college course in statistics.
Prerequisites
The AP Statistics course is an excellent option for any secondary school student who has
successfully completed a second-year course in algebra and who possesses sufficient
mathematical maturity and quantitative reasoning ability. Because second-year algebra is the
prerequisite course, AP Statistics is usually taken in either the junior or senior year. Decisions
about whether to take AP Statistics and when to take it depend on a student’s plans:
§§ Students planning to take a science course in their senior year will benefit greatly from taking AP Statistics in their junior year.
§§ For students who would otherwise take no mathematics in their senior year, AP Statistics
allows them to continue to develop their quantitative skills.
§§ Students who wish to leave open the option of taking calculus in college should include
precalculus in their high school program and perhaps take AP Statistics concurrently with precalculus.
§§ Students with the appropriate mathematical background are encouraged to take both
AP Statistics and AP Calculus in high school.

AP STATISTICS

=== Page 18 ===
Introduction
The AP Statistics course outlined in this framework
reflects a commitment to what college faculty value
and mirrors the core curricula found in corresponding college courses. This framework defines content
students must know and skills students must master in
order to learn and retain an understanding of statistics
they can apply in academic and everyday endeavors.
Teachers may adjust the framework to meet state and local requirements.
The framework is organized in a logical sequence, based on teacher input and
commonly used textbooks. These sequences represent one reasonable learning
pathway for the course, among many. Teachers may adjust the suggested
sequencing of units or topics, although they will want to carefully consider how
to account for such changes as they access course resources for planning, instruction, and assessment.
Balancing guidance and flexibility, this approach helps to prepare students for college credit and placement.

Course Framework
Components
Overview
This course framework provides a clear and detailed description of the course requirements necessary for student success.
The course framework includes two essential components:
1   COURSE SKILLS
The course skills are central to the study and practice of statistics.
Students should develop and apply the described skills on a regular basis over the span of the course.
2   COURSE CONTENT
The course content is organized into commonly taught units of study that
provide a suggested sequence for the course. These units comprise the
content and conceptual understandings that colleges and universities
typically expect students to master to qualify for college credit and/or
placement. This content is grounded in big ideas, which are cross-cutting
concepts that build conceptual understanding and spiral throughout the course.

Course
Skills
The AP Statistics course skills describe what a student should be able to do while
exploring course concepts. The table that follows presents these skills, which
students should develop during the AP Statistics course. These skills form the basis of the tasks on the AP Exam.
The unit guides later in this publication embed and spiral these skills throughout
the course, providing teachers with one way to integrate them in the course
content with sufficient repetition to prepare students to transfer those skills when
taking the AP Exam. Because the course skills are aligned to specific learning
objectives, AP Exam questions will also reflect this pairing.
More detailed information about teaching the course skills can be found in the
Instructional Approaches section of this publication.

AP STATISTICS
Course
Content
Based on the Understanding by Design® (Wiggins and McTighe) model, this
course framework provides a clear and detailed description of the course
requirements necessary for student success. The framework specifies what
students must know, be able to do, and understand, with a focus on three big
ideas that encompass the principles and processes in the discipline of statistics.
The framework also encourages instruction that prepares students for advanced
coursework in statistics or other fields using statistical reasoning and for active,
informed engagement with a world of data to be interpreted appropriately and applied wisely to make informed decisions.
Big Ideas
The big ideas serve as the foundation of the course and allow students to create
meaningful connections among concepts. They are often overarching concepts or
themes that become threads that run throughout the course. Revisiting the big
ideas and applying them in a variety of contexts allows students to develop deeper
conceptual understanding. Below are the big ideas of the course and a brief description of each.
2
BIG IDEA 1: VARIATION AND DISTRIBUTION (VAR)
The distribution of measures for individuals within a sample or population
describes variation. The value of a statistic varies from sample to sample.
How can we determine whether differences between measures represent
random variation or meaningful distinctions? Statistical methods based
on probabilistic reasoning provide the basis for shared understandings
about variation and about the likelihood that variation between and among
measures, samples, and populations is random or meaningful.
BIG IDEA 2: PATTERNS AND UNCERTAINTY (UNC)
Statistical tools allow us to represent and describe patterns in data and to
classify departures from patterns. Simulation and probabilistic reasoning
allow us to anticipate patterns in data and to determine the likelihood of errors in inference.

UNITS
The course content is organized into commonly
taught units. The units have been arranged in a logical sequence frequently found in many college courses and textbooks.
The nine units in AP Statistics, and their weighting on the
multiple-choice section of the AP Exam, are listed below.
Pacing recommendations at the unit level and on the
Course at a Glance provide suggestions for how to teach the required course content and administer the Personal Progress Checks. The suggested class
periods are based on a schedule in which the class meets five days a week for 45 minutes each day.
While these recommendations have been made to
aid planning, teachers should of course adjust the
pacing based on the needs of their students, alternate
schedules (e.g., block scheduling), or their school’s academic calendar.
TOPICS
Each unit is broken down into teachable segments
called topics. The topic pages (starting on p. 36) contain all required content for each topic.
BIG IDEA 3: DATA-BASED PREDICTIONS, DECISIONS, AND
CONCLUSIONS (DAT)
Data-based regression models describe relationships between variables
and are a tool for making predictions for values of a response variable.
Collecting data using random sampling or randomized experimental design
means that findings may be generalized to the part of the population from
which the selection was made. Statistical inference allows us to make data-based decisions.

AP STATISTICS
Unit
Guides
Introduction
Designed with extensive input from the community of AP Statistics
educators, the unit guides offer teachers helpful guidance in building
students’ skills and knowledge. The suggested sequence was identified
through a thorough analysis of the syllabi of highly effective AP teachers
and the organization of typical college textbooks.
This unit structure respects new AP teachers’ time by providing one
possible sequence they can adopt and modify rather than having to
build from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units enable the
AP Program to provide interested teachers with formative assessments—
the Personal Progress Checks—that they can assign their students at
the end of each unit to gauge progress toward success on the AP exam.
However, experienced AP teachers who are satisfied with their current
course organization and exam results should feel no pressure to adopt
these units, which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

UNIT OPENERS
Developing Understanding provides an overview that
contextualizes and situates the key content of the unit within the scope of the course.
Big ideas serve as the foundation of the course and help
develop understanding as they spiral throughout the course.
The essential questions are thought-provoking questions that motivate students and inspire inquiry.
Building Course Skills describes specific skills that are appropriate to focus on in that unit.
Preparing for the AP Exam provides helpful tips and common
student misunderstandings identified from prior exam data.
15–23%  AP EXAM WEIGHTING
Building Course Skills
2.A  2.B  2.D
Having access to a world of data is meaningless without the ability to organize and analyze that information. To develop these skills, students will need multiple opportunities to interact with data presented in different formats, i.e., as a table, a graph, or even just a list of values. Students should be asked to verbally describe the patterns and characteristics they see in the data (including shape, center, variability, and unusual features for a quantitative variable) and then compare the characteristics of two different sets of data. Students should also create displays that appropriately represent the data (e.g., using a bar graph for categorical data).
Teachers can provide explicit feedback on students’ verbal responses so they understand the level of detail needed.
For example, when students are asked to describe a distribution of quantitative data, they often provide an acronym associated with that type of distribution (e.g., SOCS or CUSS) but then struggle to discuss all the elements the acronym stands for.
In particular, students often neglect to discuss unusual features such as gaps or outliers. Teachers can reinforce that these elements must be addressed in their descriptions and that all data has context (e.g., the variable of interest, including any units of measurement).
Preparing for the AP Exam
In preparation for the AP Exam, teachers can encourage students to carefully read each question and completely answer the question asked. When interpreting representations of quantitative data, for example, students should describe shape, center, and variability, as well as unusual features, such as outliers. A response focused only on the center, for example, would be considered incomplete. Students should also provide complete explanations in context for all conclusions made from data. If asked to justify the selection of a particular conclusion over other options, students should include both a reasoning for their choice and rationales for not choosing the others.

BIG IDEA 2
Patterns and Uncertainty UNC § How certain are we that what seems to be a pattern is not just a coincidence?
UNIT 1
Developing Understanding
Unit 1 introduces students to data and the vocabulary of statistics. Students also learn
to talk about data in real-world contexts. Variability in data may seem to suggest certain
conclusions about the data distribution, but not all variation is meaningful. Statistics allows
us to develop shared understandings of uncertainty and variation. In this unit, students
will define and represent categorical and quantitative variables, describe and compare
distributions of one-variable data, and interpret statistical calculations to assess claims about
individual data points or samples. Students will also begin to apply the normal distribution
model as an introduction to how theoretical models for populations can be used to describe
some distributions of sample data. Later units will more fully develop probabilistic modeling and inference.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
UNC-3.K.1
For independent samples (sampling with replacement) of a categorical variable from a population with population proportion, p, the sampling distribution of the sample proportion, ˆp, has a mean, ˆp p μ = and a standard deviation, ( ) ˆ 1 p p p n σ − = .
UNC-3.K.2
If sampling without replacement, the standard deviation of the sample proportion is smaller than what is given by the formula above. If the sample size is less than 10% of the population size, the difference is negligible.
UNC-3.L.1
For a categorical variable, the sampling distribution of the sample proportion, ˆp, will have an approximate normal distribution, provided the sample size is large enough:
10 np ≥ and (1 ) 10 n p − ≥
UNC-3.M.1
Probabilities and parameters for a sampling distribution for a sample proportion should be interpreted using appropriate units and within the context of a specific population.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
UNC-1.I.1
A statistic is a numerical summary of sample data.
UNC-1.I.2
The mean is the sum of all the data values divided by the number of values. For a sample, the mean is denoted by x-bar:
1 1 n i i x x n = =  , where xi represents the i th data point in the sample and n represents the number of data values in the sample.
UNC-1.I.3
The median of a data set is the middle value when data are ordered. When the number of data points is even, the median can take on any value between the two middle values.
In AP Statistics, the most commonly used value for the median of a data set with an even number of values is the average of the two middle values.
UNC-1.I.4
The first quartile, Q1, is the median of the half of the ordered data set from the minimum to the position of the median. The third quartile,
Q3, is the median of the half of the ordered data set from the position of the median to the maximum. Q1 and Q3 form the boundaries for the middle 50% of values in an ordered data set.

The pth percentile is interpreted as the value that has p% of the data less than or equal to it.
UNC-1.J
Calculate measures of variability for quantitative data. [Skill 2.C]
UNC-1.J.1
Three commonly used measures of variability (or spread) in a distribution are the range, interquartile range, and standard deviation.
UNC-1.J.2
The range is defined as the difference between the maximum data value and the minimum data value. The interquartile range (IQR) is defined as the difference between the third
and first quartiles: Q3 − Q1. Both the range and the interquartile range are possible ways of measuring variability of the distribution of a quantitative variable.
UNC-1.J.3
Standard deviation is a way to measure variability of the distribution of a quantitative variable. For a sample, the standard deviation
is denoted by s:
2 1 ( ) 1 x i s x x n = − − . The square of the sample standard deviation, s2, is called the sample variance.
UNC-1.J.4
Changing units of measurement affects the values of the calculated statistics.
UNC-1.K
Explain the selection of a particular measure of center and/or variability for describing a set of quantitative data. [Skill 4.B]
UNC-1.K.1
There are many methods for determining outliers. Two methods frequently used in this
course are:
i.	 An outlier is a value greater than 1.5 × IQR above the third quartile or more than 1.5 × IQR below the first quartile.
ii.	 An outlier is a value located 2 or more standard deviations above, or below, the mean.
UNC-1.K.2
The mean, standard deviation, and range are considered nonresistant (or non-robust) because they are influenced by outliers. The median and IQR are considered resistant (or
robust), because outliers do not greatly (if at all) affect their value.

UNC-1.L.2
A boxplot is a graphical representation of the five-number summary (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, maximum).
The box represents the middle 50% of data, with a line at the median and the ends of the box
corresponding to the quartiles. Lines (“whiskers”) extend from the quartiles to the most extreme point that is not an outlier, and outliers are indicated by their own symbol beyond this.

VAR-2.A.1
A parameter is a numerical summary of a population.
VAR-2.A.2
Some sets of data may be described as approximately normally distributed. A normal curve is mound-shaped and symmetric.
The parameters of a normal distribution are the population mean, µ, and the population standard deviation, σ.
VAR-2.A.3
For a normal distribution, approximately 68% of the observations are within 1 standard deviation of the mean, approximately 95% of observations are within 2 standard deviations of the mean, and approximately 99.7% of observations are within 3 standard deviations of the mean. This is called the empirical rule.

Building Course Skills
2.C  2.D  4.B
In Unit 2, students are looking at the relationship between variables. The ability to calculate and describe statistical values, such as a conditional relative frequency or the slope
of a regression line, is critical for data analysis because students must be able to analyze patterns before drawing conclusions about the data. Students should be allowed to perform their calculations using technology to help them become more aware of procedural errors. Students will also need practice translating output from technology (“calculator speak”) into appropriate statistical language.
As any statistician will assert, a numerical calculation is only as good as one’s ability to interpret what it means in the real world.
Rather than just reporting values from their calculations, students must be able to connect their numerical results to the scenario’s context and formulate a verbal response that makes that connection clear.
Teachers can model good communication and provide high-quality feedback to help students use accurate statistical language when comparing side-by-side bar graphs, for example, and to avoid common errors in reasoning, such as using the word “line” to explain why a relationship is linear.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Students need ongoing practice with interpretation of vocabulary and calculated values in context. It is typically not sufficient to speak generally about the direction of a relationship, for example. If the question is about a linear model for predicting the weight of a wolf based on its length, students should write that a positive relationship means that longer wolves tend to have higher weights (see 2017 FRQ 1). Students can communicate statistical uncertainty by using words such as “tend to have” and “on average,” being careful to be precise with language. For example, when explaining evidence of a linear relationship, the difference between discussing a rate of change, as opposed to a change, is the difference between right and wrong. For the sake of clarity, the word “correlation” should be reserved for discussions about relationships between two quantitative variables.

UNIT 2
Developing Understanding
Building on Unit 1, students will explore relationships in two-variable categorical or
quantitative data sets. They will use graphical and numerical methods to investigate an
association between two categorical variables. Skills learned while working with two-way tables
will transfer to calculating probabilities in Unit 4.
Students will describe form, direction, strength, and unusual features for an association
between two quantitative variables. They will assess correlation and, if appropriate, use a
linear model to predict values of the response variable from values of the explanatory variable.
Students will interpret the least-squares regression line in context, analyze prediction errors
(residuals), and explore departures from a linear pattern.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches into the classroom. They  were developed in
partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways that they approach teaching
some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional Approaches section beginning
on p. 207 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 2.5 2.8
Quickwrite
Give students a scatterplot and its associated computer output. Have them identify
and describe the meaning of the following values in the context of the problem: slope,
y-intercept, coefficient of determination, and standard error of the residuals. Also have
them calculate the correlation and explain how they found it. Have students compare their write-ups in groups of three to four.
2 2.7
Reversing Interpretations
Instead of asking students to interpret a residual, give them the residual and the equation
of the least-squares regression line and ask them to make a prediction for a particular
observation (e.g., “One wolf in the pack had a length of 1.4 m and a residual of −9.87.
What does that −9.87 tell us about that particular wolf?”) 3 2.8
Build the Model Solution
Provide students with strips of paper containing portions of the model solution for
2018 FRQ 1 and have them work to assemble the phrases into a solution for the FRQ.
Words can be grouped for part a, as follows: [The estimate of the intercept is] [72.95]. [It is]
[estimated that] [the average time to] [finish checkout] [if there are no other customers in
line] [is 72.95 seconds]. Additional numbers or phrases for part a could include [174.40], [is 174.50 seconds], and [the time to].
4 2.9
Predict and Confirm
Have students toss a handful of M&Ms and record how many land M side up. This is trial 1.
Then have them remove the ones that were M side up. For trial 2, have students toss the
remaining candies (the ones left over after removing the ones that landed M side up) and
record how many land M side up on the second toss. Ask students to think about the
trend and make a prediction: Will it be linear? A scatterplot of many trials should show a nonlinear relationship.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
DAT-1.A
Describe the characteristics of a scatter plot. [Skill 2.A]
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
DAT-1.A.1
A description of a scatter plot includes form, direction, strength, and unusual features.
DAT-1.A.2
The direction of the association shown in a scatterplot, if any, can be described as positive or negative.
DAT-1.A.3
A positive association means that as values of one variable increase, the values of the other variable tend to increase. A negative association means that as values of one variable increase, values of the other variable tend to decrease.
DAT-1.A.4
The form of the association shown in a
scatterplot, if any, can be described as linear or non-linear to varying degrees.
DAT-1.A.5
The strength of the association is how closely the individual points follow a specific pattern, e.g., linear, and can be shown in a scatterplot.
Strength can be described as strong, moderate, or weak.
DAT-1.A.6
Unusual features of a scatter plot include clusters of points or points with relatively large discrepancies between the value of the response variable and a predicted value for the response variable.

Calculate a predicted response value using a linear regression model. [Skill 2.C]
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
DAT-1.D.1
A simple linear regression model is an equation that uses an explanatory variable, x, to predict the response variable, y.
DAT-1.D.2
The predicted response value, denoted by ˆy, is calculated as ˆy a bx = + , where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope of the regression
line, and x is the value of the explanatory variable.
DAT-1.D.3
Extrapolation is predicting a response value
using a value for the explanatory variable that is beyond the interval of x-values used to determine the regression line. The predicted value is less
reliable as an estimate the further we extrapolate.

Calculate a predicted response using a least squares regression line for a transformed data set.
[Skill 2.C]
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
DAT-1.J.1
Transformations of variables, such as evaluating the natural logarithm of each value of the response variable or squaring each value of the explanatory variable, can be used to create transformed data sets, which may be more linear in form than the untransformed data.
DAT-1.J.2
Increased randomness in residual plots after transformation of data and/or movement of 2r  to a value closer to 1 offers evidence that the least-squares regression line for the transformed data is a more appropriate model to use to predict responses to the explanatory variable than the regression line for the untransformed data.

1.B  1.C  4.A  4.B
Statisticians must be adept at determining “What is this question asking?” Students should get into the habit of identifying the task in the given prompt before they begin, then checking that their response addresses that task. For example, when asked if it would be appropriate to generalize the results of a given experiment, students need to provide a clear “yes” or “no” decision in their response, along with an explanation that supports their decision.
Although students may recognize that they need to justify their reasoning, they often struggle to include explicit evidence supporting their claims. For instance, claims about non-response bias should be supported with evidence indicating whether the sample result is likely to be too high or too low compared to the population value that is being estimated. As another example, students need to clearly explain why a particular variable might lead to confounding in a given setting.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Students should continue to practice using precise language in their writing for the
AP Exam. For example, some students refer to random selection when they should be writing about random assignment, or vice versa. Students should write about random selection when discussing generalizing results of a sample to the population.
Students should write about random assignment when discussing experiments or their results. Because random assignment to treatments in an experiment tends to balance the effects of uncontrolled variables across groups, researchers can conclude that statistically significant differences in the response are caused by the effects of the treatments. When justifying a claim that experimental treatments cause such statistically significant differences, students should cite the random assignment of treatments and should not refer to other irrelevant elements of well-designed experiments. Students should also continue to practice connecting responses to the specific context of the question.

UNIT 3
Developing Understanding
Depending on how data are collected, we may or may not be able to generalize findings
or establish evidence of causal relationships. For example, if random selection is not
used to obtain a sample from a population, bias may result and statistics from the sample
cannot be assumed to generalize to the population. For data collected using well-designed
experiments, statistically significant differences between or among experimental treatment
groups are evidence that the treatments caused the effect. Students learn important
principles of sampling and experimental design in this unit; they will learn about statistical inference in Units 6–9.

Graphic Organizer
Provide students with a table listing all possible combinations of whether a study
involves random sampling (yes or no) and random assignment (yes or no). Ask them to fill
in each cell with both the type of conclusion that is appropriate (association or causation)
and the generalizability of the results (to the population or to only those similar to the study participants).

Password-Style Games
After completing the lessons on sampling and surveying, use the following 10 terms in a
password-style game: census, simple random sample, stratified random sample, cluster
sample, systematic random sample, bias, voluntary response bias, undercoverage,
nonresponse bias, and response bias. The winner is the pair whose partner guesses the most terms correctly from the descriptions given.

Sentence Starters
Provide students with the scenario from 2006 Form B FRQ 5. Have them complete the
following sentence starter to explain confounding: “ are confounded with because each was used in only one . If a difference
in the draft is observed, we will not know whether the difference is due to the

or the .” 5 3.5
Think-Pair-Share
Provide students with a description of a well-designed experiment (e.g., 2010 FRQ 1) and
ask them to individually identify the type of design, the experimental units, the treatments,
and how the study addresses the principles of a well-designed experiment (including
random assignment, control, blinding, and replication). Then have students share their thoughts with their neighbor.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
DAT-2.C.1
When an item from a population can be selected only once, this is called sampling without replacement. When an item from the population can be selected more than once, this is called sampling with replacement.
DAT-2.C.2
A simple random sample (SRS) is a sample in which every group of a given size has an equal chance of being chosen. This method is the basis for many types of sampling mechanisms.
A few examples of mechanisms used to obtain
SRSs include numbering individuals and using a random number generator to select which ones to include in the sample, ignoring repeats, using a table of random numbers, or drawing a card from a deck without replacement.
DAT-2.C.3
A stratified random sample involves the division of a population into separate groups, called strata, based on shared attributes or characteristics (homogeneous grouping).
Within each stratum a simple random sample is selected, and the selected units are combined to form the sample.

When part of the population has a reduced chance of being included in the sample, the sample will typically not be representative of the population (undercoverage bias).
DAT-2.E.4
Individuals chosen for the sample for whom data cannot be obtained (or who refuse to respond) may differ from those for whom data can be obtained (nonresponse bias).
DAT-2.E.5
Problems in the data gathering instrument or process result in response bias. Examples include questions that are confusing or leading (question wording bias) and self-reported responses.
DAT-2.E.6
Non-random sampling methods (for example, samples chosen by convenience or voluntary response) introduce potential for bias because they do not use chance to select the individuals.

A well-designed experiment should include
the following:
a.	 Comparisons of at least two treatment groups, one of which could be a control group.
b.	 Random assignment/allocation of treatments to experimental units.
c.	 Replication (more than one experimental unit in each treatment group).
d.	 Control of potential confounding variables where appropriate.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
VAR-3.B
Describe elements of a well-designed experiment.
[Skill 1.B]
VAR-3.C.1
In a completely randomized design, treatments are assigned to experimental units completely at random. Random assignment tends to balance the effects of uncontrolled (confounding) variables so that differences in responses can be attributed to the treatments.
VAR-3.C.2
Methods for randomly assigning treatments to experimental units in a completely randomized design include using a random number generator, a table of random values, drawing chips without replacement, etc.
VAR-3.C.3
In a single-blind experiment, subjects do not know which treatment they are receiving, but members of the research team do, or vice versa.
VAR-3.C.4
In a double-blind experiment neither the subjects nor the members of the research team who interact with them know which treatment a subject is receiving.
VAR-3.C.5
A control group is a collection of experimental units either not given a treatment of interest or given a treatment with an inactive substance (placebo) in order to determine if the treatment of interest has an effect.

For randomized complete block designs, treatments are assigned completely at random within each block.
VAR-3.C.8
Blocking ensures that at the beginning of the experiment the units within each block are similar to each other with respect to at least one blocking variable. A randomized block design helps to separate natural variability from differences due to the blocking variable.
VAR-3.C.9
A matched pairs design is a special case of a randomized block design. Using a blocking variable, subjects (whether they are people or not) are arranged in pairs matched on relevant factors. Matched pairs may be formed naturally or by the experimenter.
Every pair receives both treatments by randomly assigning one treatment to one member of the pair and subsequently assigning the remaining treatment to the second member of the pair. Alternately, each subject may get both treatments.

Random assignment of treatments to experimental units allows researchers to conclude that some observed changes are so large as to be unlikely to have occurred by chance. Such changes are said to be statistically significant.
VAR-3.E.3
Statistically significant differences between or among experimental treatment groups are evidence that the treatments caused the effect.
VAR-3.E.4
If the experimental units used in an experiment are representative of some larger group of units, the results of an experiment can be generalized to the larger group. Random selection of experimental units gives a better chance that the units will be representative.

Developing Understanding
Probabilistic reasoning allows statisticians to quantify the likelihood of random events over
the long run and to make statistical inferences. Simulations and concrete examples can help
students to understand the abstract definitions and calculations of probability. This unit builds
on understandings of simulated or empirical data distributions and fundamental principles
of probability to represent, interpret, and calculate parameters for theoretical probability
distributions for discrete random variables. Interpretations of probabilities and parameters
associated with a probability distribution should use appropriate units and relate to the context of the situation.

Building Course Skills
2.B  3.A  3.B  4.B
Probability is a notoriously difficult topic for students to grasp because it’s difficult to conceptualize future outcomes in concrete ways. Before introducing new formulas, teachers can help students get an intuitive feel for why the formulas (and related notation) make sense. For example, the probability formulas for   or
P A
B  and for   |
P A B  can be presented intuitively with two-way tables. Simulations can also help students internalize what it means to quantify random behavior. To help students understand when to apply different probability rules, teachers can use explicit strategies such as matching verbal scenarios to their corresponding probability formulas.
Students frequently misinterpret probability distributions and parameters for random variables. Teachers can reinforce that a complete interpretation will include context and units. A common misconception later in the course is that every question involving probability requires a significance test.
Students should practice making predictions and decisions based on probability alone to avoid this misconception early on.
They should revisit these problems in later units to practice differentiating between inference and probability problems.
Preparing for the AP Exam
To help students prepare for the AP Exam, teachers can model showing all steps in probability calculations and expect students to do the same. Calculations on the
AP Exam should include presentation of an appropriate expression that communicates the structure of the formula, substitution of relevant values extracted from the problem, and an answer. In 2017 FRQ 3, for example, a student who writes “ ( ) ( | ) ( )
P G
P G J
P J = ⋅ +
P( | ) ( ) (0.2119)(0.7)
G K
P K ⋅ = + (0.8413)(0.3) 0.4007 = ” has communicated the products in the multiplication rule, the sum in the addition rule, and an understanding that the events are mutually exclusive—all components of a complete response. To avoid a common error, students who present the same work using a tree diagram should practice using probabilities in the diagram correctly. Students importing incorrect solutions from one part of a multipart question to solve another will not be penalized a second time, unless the subsequent result is not a reasonable value
(like a probability less than 0 or greater than 1).

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches into the classroom. They  were developed in
partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways that they approach teaching
some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional Approaches section beginning
on p. 207 for more examples of activities and strategies.

Sample Activity 1 4.3 4.5 4.8
Error Analysis
Using 2015 FRQ 3, provide students with several answers containing errors for each part.
Provide some responses with incorrect notation, incorrect work, missing work, work that
shows calculator commands only, an incorrect formula or approach, and an incorrect final answer. Then ask students to identify the errors.
2 4.3 4.5 4.6
Think-Pair-Share
Provide students with a set of five probability questions: one for the complement rule, the
conditional probability formula, the general multiplication rule, the multiplication rule for
independent events, and the general addition rule. Ask students to individually identify
the formula needed to solve each problem, without doing the final calculations. Then have them share their thoughts with a partner.
3 4.5 4.6
Create Representations
Provide students with the scenario from 2018 FRQ 3. Ask them to create a tree diagram
to organize the information in the problem. Then ask them to use the information in the
problem to set up a hypothetical 100,000 table (to make the decimals easy to work with),
such as the one below. Encourage students to try both representations when solving probability questions in the future.

After modeling an odd one out example, have students form groups of four and give each
of them a description of either a binomial or a geometric random variable. Explain that three
of their variables follow the same probability distribution and one is different. Have students
work together in their groups to determine whose is the odd one out and explain why.
5 4.2 4.12
Predict and Confirm
Ask students to consider couples who plan to continue having children until they have one
girl and predict how many children they think these couples will have, on average. Then
ask each student to perform 10 trials using a coin toss where Heads = Girl and Tails = Boy.
A trial is finished once one girl is observed and the number of total children is recorded.
Combine the class results and calculate the average. Confirm with the geometric mean formula once it is discussed.

3.B  3.C  4.B
The probabilities associated with the normal distribution are what statisticians use to justify claims about populations they’ll never be able to measure directly. Revisiting these properties early in Unit 5 will reinforce why sampling distributions allow statisticians to approximate parameters for the population of interest. Sketching, shading, and labeling a normal distribution aids in understanding the probability being calculated. Students should practice creating graphical representations, labeling the mean, and marking off values 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations from the mean.
Students often struggle to interpret parameters of probability distributions in context, simply describing features of the graph rather than explicitly connecting those features to the situation described in the problem. Teachers can remind students that context is about a variable (“tip amounts,” for example), not just the units (dollars). It’s also critical that students explicitly show that the appropriate conditions have been verified, and that they avoid using nonspecific language
like “it” in their interpretations. Using an error analysis strategy with sample responses can help familiarize students with these issues before they make similar mistakes.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Responses on the AP Exam often uncover gaps in understanding of sampling distributions. Students must clearly communicate whether they are talking about the distribution of a population, a sample of values (heights, for example), or a sample statistic from repeated samples (mean heights, for example). Broad generalizations, such as “larger samples have less variability,” leave the exam reader unsure of whether the student is referring to variability within a sample (for which the statement would be false) or a sampling distribution. The word “it” often introduces ambiguity to a response.
Students frequently show confusion about what condition to check when asserting that the sampling distribution of a given statistic is approximately normal. Students should support normal probability calculations with a sketch or a calculation of a standardized score (z-score), rather than relying on calculator syntax.

Variation and Distribution  VAR §§ How likely is it to get a value this large just by chance?
BIG IDEA 2
Patterns and Uncertainty  UNC §§ How can we anticipate patterns in the values of a statistic from one sample to another?
UNIT 5
Developing Understanding
This unit applies probabilistic reasoning to sampling, introducing students to sampling
distributions of statistics they will use when performing inference in Units 6 and 7. Students
should understand that sample statistics can be used to estimate corresponding population
parameters and that measures of center (mean) and variability (standard deviation) for these
sampling distributions can be determined directly from the population parameters when
certain sampling criteria are met. For large enough samples from any population, these
sampling distributions can be approximated by a normal distribution. Simulating sampling
distributions helps students to understand how the values of statistics vary in repeated
random sampling from populations with known parameters.

Sample Activity 1 5.2
Think Aloud
Group students into pairs within a larger group of four. Have each student individually
read 2014 FRQ 3 and think aloud with their partner, brainstorming ways to begin each
part of the question. Each student then independently completes all parts. Have the pairs
compare answers within their groups, improving their individual responses as necessary.
Groups can then compare their responses with other groups. Finally, have students score their responses according to the rubric.

Use Manipulatives
From a large container of pennies, have each student take two random samples of size 5,
two of size 10, and two of size 25, and record the dates on those pennies. Have students
calculate the mean of the dates in each sample and then construct four “dotplots” on the
floor: one using the pennies, one using nickels placed at the mean of the student’s sample
size 5, one using dimes placed at the mean of the sample size 10, and one using quarters placed at the mean of the sample size 25.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
UNC-3.H.1
A sampling distribution of a statistic is the distribution of values for the statistic for all possible samples of a given size from a given population.
UNC-3.H.2
The central limit theorem (CLT) states that when the sample size is sufficiently large, a sampling distribution of the mean of a random variable will be approximately normally distributed.
UNC-3.H.3
The central limit theorem requires that the sample values are independent of each other and that n is sufficiently large.
UNC-3.H.4
A randomization distribution is a collection of statistics generated by simulation assuming known values for the parameters. For a randomized experiment, this means repeatedly randomly reallocating/reassigning the response values to treatment groups.

~16–18 CLASS PERIODS
Developing Understanding
This unit introduces statistical inference, which will continue through the end of the course.
Students will analyze categorical data to make inferences about binomial population
proportions. Provided conditions are met, students will use statistical inference to construct
and interpret confidence intervals to estimate population proportions and perform
significance tests to evaluate claims about population proportions. Students begin by
learning inference procedures for one proportion and then examine inference methods for a
difference between two proportions. They will also interpret the two types of errors that can
be made in a significance test, their probabilities, and possible consequences in context.

Building Course Skills
1.D  3.D  4.D
Unit 6 is a critical transition point in the course, as students begin learning skills that will be applied repeatedly in subsequent units. Students need to familiarize themselves with these procedures so they can build proficiency over time. Applying different inference methods requires fluency with verifying conditions. Students often
check conditions superficially (e.g., just listing “SRS”) without explicitly connecting them to the problem. Teachers can make sure students practice verifying conditions in context by providing numerical calculations and explaining how each condition is met.
Precision of language is key. Students often interpret confidence intervals and confidence levels incorrectly. Providing students with sentence starters or templates can help them learn to generate appropriate responses (e.g., Confidence
interval: “We are 95% confident that the interval from to captures the [parameter in context].”). For decisions based on a hypothesis test, students may incorrectly claim that “we can accept” or “have proven” the null. Teachers can reinforce early and often that statistical tests do not provide evidence for what can be accepted or proved; they only provide evidence for “rejecting” or “failing to reject” the null.
Preparing for the AP Exam
When using statistical inference to construct confidence intervals or perform significance tests, students should identify the appropriate inference method by name or formula. For inference with population proportions, students should verify that the following conditions are met: (1) random sample and (2) large sample (e.g., ˆ 10 np ≥

and ˆ (1 ) 10 n p − ≥ ). When sampling without replacement, students should also verify that the sample size is at most 10% of the population. Verification should be simple and specific.
Next, students should present calculations and then interpret results in the context of the problem. Students often find it beneficial to use language provided in the question.
In 2017 FRQ 2, for example, the response might read “We can be 95% confident that the proportion of all customers who, having asked for a cup of water when placing an order, will fill the cup with a soft drink is between 0.1883 and 0.3867.”

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches into the classroom. They  were developed in
partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways that they approach teaching
some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional Approaches section beginning
on p. 207 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 6.4 6.7 6.8
Error Analysis
Give student pairs a worksheet with 20 sets of hypotheses (including hypotheses for a
population proportion and for the difference of two proportions), each with a common
student mistake. Have students circle the incorrect part, write why the circled component
is incorrect, and then write the correct hypotheses. Include errors such as using statistics
instead of parameters, and interchanging the = and > in the two hypotheses.
2 6.5 6.6 6.11
Sentence Starters
For a given question, provide students with a set of hypotheses, p-value, significance
level, and context. Have them compare the p-value to the significance level to determine
whether or not to reject the null hypothesis. Using a given sentence starter with blanks to
fill in, have students write a sentence in context explaining if they have enough evidence to “reject 0
H ”, or if they will “fail to reject 0
H .” Make sure students avoid the common mistake of implying that evidence supports an “accept 0
H ” conclusion or a “reject a
H ” conclusion.
3 6.2 6.8
The Scribe and the Calculator
Have students work with a partner to construct and interpret a confidence interval for
a population proportion. Only one partner is allowed to use the calculator, and only the
other partner is allowed to write. When a calculation needs to be made, the scribe can only
describe to the calculator operator which buttons to push; when writing needs to be done,
the calculator operator can only describe to the scribe what needs to be written. Have
students switch roles when constructing and interpreting a confidence interval for the difference of two population proportions.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
UNC-4.B
Verify the conditions for calculating confidence intervals for a population proportion.
[Skill 4.C]
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
UNC-4.B.2
In order to calculate a confidence interval to estimate a population proportion, p, we must check for independence and that the sampling distribution is approximately normal.
a.	 To check for independence:
i.	 Data should be collected using a random sample or a randomized experiment.
ii.	 When sampling without replacement, check that 10% n
N ≤ , where N is the size of the population.
b.	 To check that the sampling distribution of ˆp is approximately normal (shape):
i.	 For categorical variables, check that both the number of successes, ˆ np, and the number of failures, ˆ (1 ) n p − are at least 10 so that the sample size is large enough to support an assumption of normality.
UNC-4.C
Determine the margin of error for a given sample size and an estimate for the sample size that will result in a given margin of error for a population proportion.
[Skill 3.D]
UNC-4.C.1
Based on sample data, the standard error of a statistic is an estimate for the standard deviation for the statistic. The standard error of ˆp is ˆ ˆ ˆ (1 ) p p p
SE n − = .
UNC-4.C.2
A margin of error gives how much a value of a sample statistic is likely to vary from the value of the corresponding population parameter.
UNC-4.C.3
For categorical variables, the margin of error is the critical value ( * z ) times the standard
error (SE) of the relevant statistic, which equals * ˆ ˆ (1 ) p p z n − for a one sample proportion.
UNC-4.C.4
The formula for margin of error can be rearranged to solve for n, the minimum sample size needed to achieve a given margin of error.
For this purpose, use a guess for ˆp or use ˆ 0.5 p =

in order to find an upper bound for the sample size that will result in a given margin of error.

VAR-6.D.1
The null hypothesis is the situation that is assumed to be correct unless evidence suggests otherwise, and the alternative hypothesis is the situation for which evidence is being collected.
VAR-6.D.2
For hypotheses about parameters, the null hypothesis contains an equality reference (=, ≥, or ≤), while the alternative hypothesis
contains a strict inequality (<, >, or ≠). The type of inequality in the alternative hypothesis is based on the question of interest. Alternative hypotheses with < or > are called one-sided, and alternative hypotheses with ≠ are called two sided. Although the null hypothesis for a one sided test may include an inequality symbol, it is still tested at the boundary of equality.

[Skill 4.B]
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
DAT-3.A.1
The p-value is the proportion of values for the null distribution that are as extreme or more extreme than the observed value of the test
statistic. This is:
a.	 The proportion at or above the observed value of the test statistic, if the alternative is >.
b.	 The proportion at or below the observed value of the test statistic, if the alternative is <.
c.	 The proportion less than or equal to the negative of the absolute value of the test statistic plus the proportion greater than or equal to the absolute value of the test statistic, if the alternative is ≠.
DAT-3.A.2
An interpretation of the p-value of a significance test for a one-sample proportion should recognize that the p-value is computed by assuming that the probability model and null hypothesis are true, i.e., by assuming that the true population proportion is equal to the particular value stated in the null hypothesis.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
DAT-3.B.1
The significance level, , is the predetermined probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given that it is true.

DAT-3.B.3
Rejecting the null hypothesis means there is sufficient statistical evidence to support the
alternative hypothesis. Failing to reject the null means there is insufficient statistical evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.
DAT-3.B.4
The conclusion about the alternative hypothesis must be stated in context.
DAT-3.B.5
A significance test can lead to rejecting or not rejecting the null hypothesis, but can never lead to concluding or proving that the null hypothesis is true. Lack of statistical evidence for the alternative hypothesis is not the same as evidence for the null hypothesis.

Verify the conditions for making statistical inferences when testing a difference of two population proportions.
[Skill 4.C]
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
VAR-6.J.1
In order to make statistical inferences when testing a difference between population proportions, we must check for independence and that the sampling distribution is approximately normal:
a.	 To check for independence:
i.	 Data should be collected using two independent, random samples or a randomized experiment.
ii.	 When sampling without replacement, check that 1 1 10% n
N ≤ and 2 2 10% n
N ≤ .
b.	 To check that the sampling distribution of 1 2 ˆ ˆ p p − is approximately normal (shape):
i.	 For the combined sample, define the combined (or pooled) proportion, 1 1 2 2 1 2 ˆ ˆ ˆc n p n p p n n + = + . Assuming that H0 is true ( 1 2 0 p p − =  or = 1 2 p p ), check that 1ˆc n p ,   1 ˆ 1 c n p  , 2 ˆc n p , and   2 ˆ 1 c n p 

are all greater than or equal to some predetermined value, typically either 5 or 10.

Building Course Skills
1.E  1.F  4.C  4.E
Unit 7 focuses on means, which has many similarities to the conditions and procedures for proportions. Since students sometimes confuse t-tests with z-tests, it will help to review the underlying rationales each time conditions come up. This will help students develop understanding through repeated practice in new situations. Teachers can encourage students to be mindful of notation and use the formula sheet as a reference.
Teachers can reinforce that inference testing requires careful selection of a procedure based on specific conditions for a given problem. Common errors include mislabeling conditions (e.g., incorrectly associating the large sample condition with independence), relying upon vague references to the normal distribution, or applying an inappropriate large sample condition. The null and alternative hypotheses must be clearly stated in terms of population parameters, not sample statistics. A formal decision compares the p-value to the level of significance.
Students should also practice providing a numerical reference to support their claim (e.g., “Because 0.05 p < , we reject the null hypothesis.”) and interpreting findings within the context of the question.
Preparing for the AP Exam
It is critical for students to recognize that free-response questions asking whether data provide convincing evidence of some finding are asking for a significance test, not just a descriptive analysis. When using statistical inference for significance tests, students should identify the correct parameter and hypotheses, identify an appropriate test procedure and check conditions, calculate a test statistic and p-value, and provide a conclusion in context, along with a justification based on linkage between the p-value and the conclusion. For inference with means, the appropriate test
will often be a t-test, but if  is known, a z-test would be appropriate (see 2018 FRQ 6(a)).
For a t-test, conditions are (1) random sample and (2) large sample (e.g., 30 n > ). When sampling without replacement, students should also verify that the sample size is at most 10% of the population.
BIG IDEA 1

BIG IDEA 2
Patterns and Uncertainty  UNC §§ How can we make sure that samples are independent?
BIG IDEA 3
Data-Based
Predictions, Decisions, and Conclusions  DAT §§ Why is it inappropriate to accept a hypothesis as true based on the results of statistical inference testing?
UNIT 7
Developing Understanding
In this unit, students will analyze quantitative data to make inferences about population
means. Students should understand that t∗ and t-tests are used for inference with means
when the population standard deviation, , is not known. Using s for  in the formula for z
gives a slightly different value, t, whose distribution, which depends on sample size, has more
area in the tails than a normal distribution. The boundaries for rejecting a null hypothesis using
a t-distribution tend to be further from the mean than for a normal distribution. Students
should understand how and why conditions for inference with proportions and means are similar and different.

Developing Understanding
Unit 6 introduced inference for proportions of categorical data. Unit 8 introduces chi square tests, which can be used when there are two or more categories. Students need to
understand how to select from the following tests: the chi-square test for goodness of fit (for
a distribution of proportions of one categorical variable in a population), the chi-square test
for independence (for associations between categorical variables within a single population),
or the chi-square test for homogeneity (for comparing distributions of a categorical variable
across populations or treatments). To integrate conceptual understanding, teachers can make
connections between frequency tables, conditional probability, and calculating expected
counts. The chi-square statistic is introduced to measure the distance between observed and expected counts relative to expected counts.
Building Course Skills
1.E  3.E  4.C  4.E
In Unit 8, students should continue applying the same problem-solving structure to chi-square significance testing: State the hypotheses in words, explicitly identify the correct procedure, verify conditions, calculate the test statistic and the p-value, and then draw a conclusion in context that is directly linked to the p-value. Students should have opportunities to practice the distinctive elements for each type of chi-square test, such as analysis of expected counts, degrees of freedom, verbally stated hypotheses, and two-way tables.
When the p-value is large, drawing an appropriate conclusion is challenging for students. Saying there is “no association” between two variables is equivalent to incorrectly “accepting the null hypothesis.”
Instead, teachers can teach students to use nondeterministic language in their conclusions, that is, “The data do not provide strong enough evidence to conclude that the variables are associated.” Students should have frequent opportunities to practice writing, with detailed feedback to help them improve.
Preparing for the AP Exam
When writing hypotheses, students should refer to the population, using language from the question. For example, “The null hypothesis is that the age group at diagnosis and gender are independent (i.e., they are not associated) for the population of people currently being treated for schizophrenia” (see Scoring
Guidelines for 2017 FRQ 5). As always, students should name the test and provide evidence verifying appropriate conditions.
For chi-square tests, the conditions are (1) random selection or randomized experiment and (2) large counts. Students should be sure to say that all expected counts (rather than actual counts) are at least 5. Students need to clearly present calculations and state the conclusion in context with linkage to p-values. Students should avoid tacitly accepting the null hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than conventional significance levels, the correct conclusion of a chi-square test for independence would be that there is insufficient evidence that there is an association.

VAR-8.K.1
In order to make statistical inferences for a chi-square test for two-way tables (homogeneity or independence), we must verify the following:
a.	 To check for independence:
i.	 For a test for independence: Data should be collected using a simple random sample.
ii.	 For a test for homogeneity: Data should be collected using a stratified random sample or randomized experiment.
iii.	 When sampling without replacement, check that 10% n
N ≤ .
b.	 The chi-square tests for independence and homogeneity become more accurate with more observations, so large counts should be used (shape).
i.	 A conservative check for large counts is that all expected counts should be greater than 5.

Inference for
Quantitative Data:
Slopes
2–5%  AP EXAM WEIGHTING
UNIT 9
~7–8 CLASS PERIODS
Developing Understanding
Students may be surprised to learn that there is variability in slope. In their experience in
previous courses, the slope of the line of best fit does not vary for a particular set of bivariate
quantitative data. However, suppose that every student in a university physics course collects
data on spring length for 10 different hanging masses and calculates the least-squares
regression line for their sample data. The students’ slopes would likely vary as part of an
approximately normal sampling distribution centered at the (true) slope of the population
regression line relating spring length to hanging mass. In this unit, students will learn how
to construct confidence intervals for and perform significance tests about the slope of a
population regression line when appropriate conditions are met.
BIG IDEA 1
Variation and Distribution  VAR §§ How can there be variability in slope if the slope statistic is uniquely determined for a line of best fit?
BIG IDEA 2
Patterns and Uncertainty  UNC §§ When is it appropriate to perform inference about the slope of a population regression line based on sample data?
BIG IDEA 3
Data-Based Predictions,
Decisions, and Conclusions  DAT §§ Why do we not conclude that there is no correlation between two variables based on the results of a statistical inference for slopes?
Building Course Skills
1.A  4.B  4.E
In Unit 9, students should have multiple opportunities to practice interpreting the slope, y-intercept, 2r , standard deviation of the residual s, and standard error of the slope in context from computer output.
They should refrain from using deterministic language such as “a 1-foot increase in X is associated with a 0.445-point increase in Y,” instead framing the association in terms of potential outcomes (i.e., “a predicted 0.445-point increase”). Students should also practice writing “increase” or “additional” for both variables, not just the dependent variable.
Students should practice identifying what the question is asking or what needs to be solved. Without careful reading, students often provide answers that are not relevant or required, for example, conducting a significance test when the question does not call for one, or giving the expected number of successes or failures when asked to calculate a probability. Teachers can have them practice identifying the task before they begin, then checking that the response they’ve provided addresses the task.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Students should pay attention to timing as they work through full-length sections of past exams in order to leave enough time to complete the investigative task, which is weighted more heavily than the other free response questions. The investigative task includes both familiar course content and questions requiring extended reasoning. As an example of a straightforward application of a topic from this unit, 2007 Form B
FRQ 6 part b asks students to find a 95% confidence interval for the slope of a regression line. This familiar task gives students an opportunity to gain confidence and earn some credit, and it serves as an entry to subsequent parts of the question.
Although the investigative task will require students to transfer course skills to unfamiliar settings, students who understand course content will have everything they need to complete the task.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches into the classroom. They  were developed in
partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways that they approach teaching
some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional Approaches section beginning
on p. 207 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 9.2
Note-Taking
Begin by having students use a chart to record the symbols for statistics and parameters
that have been used previously to construct confidence intervals:
Statistic
Parameter ˆp p x μ s σ
Then, when constructing a confidence interval for the population slope parameter, have
students add a new row for the symbols for the sample slope and population slope: b and β ,
respectively. This will reinforce that the slope of the least-squares regression line is a sample
statistic and can be used to estimate the population parameter slope.
2 9.3
Error Analysis
Give students some raw data on the distance and cost to fly from their hometown to various major cities. For example:
Flying from to Distance
Cost 512 miles $179 1256 miles $257 3256 miles $387
Then introduce some questions justifying a claim and error analysis. For example, how
could you refute a claim that the average cost per mile (the population slope) is $0.50 per mile if you believe it to be false?
3 9.5
Notation Read Aloud
Have students read AP Exam questions aloud (e.g., 2011 FRQ 5, 2010 Form B FRQ 6,
2005 Form B FRQ 5, and 2001 FRQ 6), including the given notation. Remind students
that the computer output provides the two-sided p-value, and that there are two different
p-values in the chart: The top p-value is for the intercept, and the bottom p-value is for the
slope. Then have students discuss each of the values in the computer output and carry out a test for the slope of a regression model.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
UNC-4.AC
Identify an appropriate confidence interval procedure for a slope of a regression model. [Skill 1.D]
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
UNC-4.AC.1
Consider a response variable, y, that is linearly related to an explanatory variable, x. For a simple random sample of n observations, the sample regression line, ˆy =a+bx , is an estimate of the population regression line µy =α +βx. For a particular observation, (xi , yi), the residual from the sample regression line, yi −ˆyi = yi −(a+bxi), is an estimate of yi −(α +βxi), the deviation of the response variable from the population regression line. For all points (x, y) in the population, the standard deviation of all of the deviations of the response variable from the population regression line, σ, can be estimated by the standard deviation of the residuals from the sample regression line,    2 2 i i y y s n    
. (Note: This formula uses n – 2 in the denominator instead of n – 1 because two parameters, α and β, must be estimated to obtain the predicted values from the least-squares regression line.)
UNC-4.AC.2
For a simple random sample of n observations, let b represent the slope of a sample regression line. Then the mean of the sampling distribution for b equals the population slope:
b µ β = .
The standard deviation of the sampling distribution for b is b x n σ σ σ = , where ( ) 2 i x x x n σ − =  .

Selecting and Using
Course Materials
This section includes descriptions of available resources and materials that many AP Statistics
teachers have found helpful. Teachers are encouraged
to get involved in some of the online communities to
ask questions, discuss ideas, and trade thoughts with other teachers.
Textbooks
The foundational component for most classes is still the textbook, and there are many excellent textbooks to choose from. Most current textbooks
come with an array of resources designed to provide reinforcement for the students and facilitate the assessment process for the teacher. For example, some textbooks provide an accompanying pacing
guide, a bank of practice questions, activities for each
unit, video tutorials, or online homework problems that coincide with each chapter.
While the College Board provides examples of textbooks on AP Central to help determine whether a text is considered appropriate in meeting the
AP Statistics Course Audit curricular requirement,
teachers select textbooks locally. Also note that many
publishers offer teachers the opportunity to request
a sample copy of a textbook they are interested in adopting for classroom use. This process allows
teachers to review materials in order to determine what book will work best for them and their students.
The Use of Technology
The AP Statistics course depends heavily on the
availability of technology suitable for the interactive,
investigative aspects of data analysis. Ideally, students
should have access to both computers and calculators for work in and outside the classroom.
A computer does more than eliminate the drudgery
of hand computation and graphing—it is an essential
tool for structured inquiry. First, it produces graphs
that are specifically designed for data analysis. These
graphical displays make it easier to observe patterns in
data, to identify important subgroups of the data, and to
locate any unusual data points. Second, the computer
allows the student to fit complex mathematical models
to the data and to assess how well the model fits the
data by examining the residuals. Finally, the computer is
helpful in identifying an observation that has an undue
influence on the analysis and in isolating its effects.
In addition to its use in data analysis, the computer
facilitates the simulation approach to probability that
is emphasized in the AP Statistics course. Probabilities
of random events, probability distributions of random
variables, and sampling distributions of statistics can
be studied conceptually, using simulation. This frees
the student and teacher from a narrow approach that depends on a few simple probabilistic models.
Because the computer is central to what statisticians do, it is considered essential for teaching the AP Statistics course. However, it is not yet possible for students to have access to a computer during the AP Statistics Exam. Without a
computer and under the conditions of a timed exam, students cannot be asked to perform the amount
of computation that is needed for many statistical investigations. Consequently, standard computer output will be provided as necessary and students
will be expected to interpret it. For an example of
computer output, see sample multiple-choice question #16 on p. 247.
Currently, the graphing calculator is the only
computational aid that is available to students for use
as a tool for data analysis on the AP Statistics Exam.
Computational capabilities of graphing calculators used
in the course and on the exam should include standard
statistical univariate and bivariate summaries through
linear regression. Graphical capabilities should include common univariate and bivariate displays such as
histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots. Students find
calculators where data are entered into a spreadsheet format particularly easy to use.
Students may not use minicomputers, pocket
organizers, electronic writing pads, or calculators with
QWERTY (i.e., typewriter) keyboards on the AP Statistics
Exam. For a complete list of calculators eligible for use
on the exam, see Calculator Policy for AP Statistics,
found on the AP Statistics course page on apstudent .collegeboard.org. The calculator memory will not

AP Statistics Course and Exam Description

=== Page 217 ===
be cleared, but students may only use the memory to
store programs, not notes. For the exam, students are
not allowed to access any information in their graphing
calculators or elsewhere if it's not directly related to
upgrading the statistical functionality of older graphing
calculators to make them comparable to statistical
features found on newer models. The only acceptable upgrades are those that improve the computational
functionalities and/or graphical functionalities for
data they key into the calculator while taking the
examination. Unacceptable enhancements include, but
are not limited to, keying or scanning text or response
templates into the calculator. Students attempting to
augment the capabilities of their graphing calculators
in any way other than for the purpose of upgrading
features as described above will be considered to be cheating on the exam.
Online Tools and Resources
In addition to the resources offered through a teacher's choice of textbook, many great resources exist online—and are often free. These include sample
test questions, applets, simulations, question banks, and best practices. Teachers can sample these resources to find which ones can most benefit their students.
APPLETS AND SIMULATIONS
The use of internet-based applets or simulation
sites is fast becoming a critical component of the
AP Statistics pedagogy. Interpreting data procured
through a simulation process is an important skill not
only for the AP Exam but also for sound statistical
reasoning in other contexts. Thus, it is important that students have experience with producing and interpreting data. Below are a few examples of free applets and simulation programs that are easily incorporated into classroom activities and
instruction. This is not a comprehensive list, nor is it an endorsement of any of these resources.

Hands-on Manipulatives
Since a major component of the AP Statistics course
deals with the proper gathering and interpreting of data,
it is important that students spend at least part of the year gathering data of their own.
Activities that involve gathering data through simulation exercises should be incorporated throughout the year. Computer programs are useful for working in large scales of data and running greater numbers
of simulations, but the initial process of simulating a
chance event and generating data from that event is
more valuable to students if they are actively generating that data themselves.
For that reason, running an exercise that simulates the
event in a convenient way for students to do in class is
strongly encouraged. Often this can be done with simple
everyday items, including dice, cards, coins, beads, and
bead counters. Or, there are many activities online that
simulate the use of candy, beads, or other simple items.
Large post-it easel paper can be used to display the
results around the classroom, summarize the work, and keep it visible to refer to later in the year.
Professional Organizations
Professional organizations also serve as excellent resources for best practices and professional
development opportunities. Below is a list of prominent organizations that serve the statistics and math education communities.

Instructional Strategies
The AP Statistics course framework outlines the
concepts and skills students must master in order to be successful on the AP Exam. In order to address
those concepts and skills effectively, it helps to
incorporate a variety of instructional approaches into
daily lessons and activities. Important components
of the course should include the use of technology,
projects and laboratories, cooperative group problem solving, and writing.
Note that the AP Statistics course lends itself naturally to
a mode of teaching that engages students in constructing
their own knowledge. For example, students working
individually or in small groups can plan and perform data
collection and analyses where the teacher serves in
the role of a facilitator rather than a lecturer. This gives
students ample opportunity to think through problems,
make decisions, and share questions and conclusions with other students as well as with the teacher.
These approaches, along with targeted strategies
for teaching AP Statistics, will allow students to build
interdisciplinary connections with other subjects and
with their world outside of school. The following table
presents strategies that can help students apply their understanding of course concepts.
Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Ask the Expert
Students are assigned as “experts” on problems they have mastered;
groups rotate through the expert stations to learn about problems they have not yet mastered.
Provides opportunities for students to share their knowledge and learn from one another.
When practicing probability problems, assign students as “experts” on mutually exclusive events, conditional probability, independent events, and unions of events. Have students rotate through stations in groups, working with the station expert to complete a small batch of problems that apply a particular probability rule.
Build the Model
Solution
Students work in pairs to assemble a sentence representing a model solution to a free-response question.
Helps students build proficiency with precise language and communication, especially for topics that involve interpretations (e.g., confidence intervals and correlation coefficients).
Take a printed version of a model solution and cut it apart into sections (e.g., grouped by phrases). Print and cut out additional words that do not belong in the response (e.g., include the word “mean” if the response is supposed to be about a “proportion”). Distribute sets of these strips to student pairs and have them select which strips are relevant and assemble those into a model solution. They should set aside the strips that are not relevant to the solution.

Purpose
Example
Create
Representations
Students create pictures, tables, graphs, lists, equations, models, and/or verbal expressions to interpret text or data.
Helps organize information using multiple ways to present data and to answer a question or show a problem solution.
Pair students up and give one partner a graphical display and the other student a blank piece of paper. Without sharing their papers with their partners, the student with the graph should describe their distribution to the other student.
The other student should draw the graph based solely on the description they were given. Next, have students compare graphs and discuss how the instructions could have been clearer.
Debriefing
Students discuss their understanding of a concept to lead to consensus on its meaning.
Helps clarify misconceptions and deepen understanding of content.
Provide students with a dotplot of 50 individuals’ heights, as well as a numbered list of those heights (from 01 to 50). First, ask each student to randomly select two heights from the list using a random number generator or a random number table and then find the mean of these two heights. Have all students collectively create a dotplot of their sample means. Inform students that this is called a sampling distribution with a sample size of 2. Next, have students discuss with a partner and develop an explanation of what a sampling distribution is and why it is utilized.
Discussion
Groups
Students work within groups to discuss content, to create problem solutions, and to explain and justify a solution.
Aids understanding through the sharing of ideas, interpretation of concepts, and analysis of problem scenarios.
Give each group of students an example of a statistical test.
Have students work together to write out the null and alternative hypothesis in words. They should then work together to determine
Type I and Type II errors as well as potential consequences of those errors. Different groups would then compare answers, and if there is any disagreement, they will need to rationalize their decisions.
Error Analysis
Students analyze an existing solution to determine whether (or where) errors have occurred.
Allows students to troubleshoot existing errors so they can solve correctly when they do the same types of problems on their own.
Provide students a sample response that implicitly accepts the null hypothesis and ask them to explain the faulty reasoning.

Example
FRQ Partner Quiz (also see The
Scribe and the
Calculator)
Students work with a partner to solve a problem.
However, only one of the partners is allowed to write on the paper, and only the other is allowed to use the calculator.
Students must communicate and discuss how to do the problem more so than in a typical group setting.
Have students work with partners on a statistical situation (test or interval).
Have them discuss which test or interval they need to do. The student with the calculator will find the test statistic and p-value (or will find the interval). The student with the paper will write down the hypothesis (if a test) and assumptions/conditions.
Once they get the test statistic and p-value (or the interval), have them write up the decision and/or conclusion. Have students switch jobs for the next problem.
Gallery Walk
Student pairs write their solution on a large piece of paper and post on a wall in the room. Students stand in front of their solutions and then move to the right to the next solution. Using sticky notes, students write a positive comment about the response; then move to the right again and continue the process until they’ve visited all posted responses. Pairs then return to their original solution and read the feedback.
Provides feedback from multiple perspectives, is more immediate than teacher feedback on students’ writing, and gives students practice reading and doing error analysis on existing responses.
This strategy can be used anytime students are practicing free-response questions (FRQs), especially when asked to justify their answer. It also serves well as a method for end-of-unit or end-of-course review.
Graphic
Organizer
Students represent ideas and information visually (e.g., Venn diagrams, flowcharts).
Provides students a visual system for organizing multiple ideas and details related to a particular concept.
Have students create their own flowchart for determining which inference procedure applies for a given situation.
Look for a Pattern
Students observe information or create visual representations to find a trend.
Helps to identify patterns that may be used to make predictions.
Give partners a tape measure and have them measure each other’s heights and arm spans. On a large group scatterplot, have students plot the data point that represents their measurements. Then have them describe to their partners what trends or patterns they see. Once every student has added their point to the scatterplot, ask them to predict arm spans based on different heights that you give them, including at least one instance where they are asked to extrapolate.

Purpose
Example
Marking the Text
Students highlight, underline, and/or annotate text to focus on key information to help understand the text or solve the problem.
Helps the student identify important information in the text and make notes about the interpretation of tasks required and concepts to apply to reach a solution.
Give students examples of statistical situations. Have students highlight or underline the key phrases to help them determine which statistical test to use for each situation. For example, does it require a significance test or a confidence interval? Does it involve means or proportions? Is there only one variable or are there two or more variables?
Match Mine
Students work in pairs to describe the layout of cards on their game board, without being able to see each other’s boards.
Emphasizes the use of appropriate vocabulary and allows students to practice accurate communication around different representations.
Create a blank 3x3 grid as a “game board” and 9 index cards depicting distributions of differing shapes, center, skewness, clustering, etc.
Pair up students and insert a folder between the partners so they can’t see each other’s boards. Distribute a blank grid and a set of cards to each partner. Student A arranges the cards however they choose on their grid then describes that arrangement so that Student B can attempt to match it on their own board. When the pair thinks that they have correctly made all matches, have them compare their arrangements to see how well they did.
Model Questions
Students answer questions from released
AP Statistics Exams.
Provides rigorous practice and assesses students’ ability to apply multiple skills on content being presented in either a multiple choice or a free response question.
After learning the three different chi-square tests, have students practice by completing free-response questions in which they are asked to determine which chi-square test to use and then carry out the test to find a solution.
Notation
Read Aloud
Students read symbols and notational representations aloud.
Helps students to accurately interpret symbolic representations.
This strategy can be used to introduce new symbols and statistical notation to ensure that students learn proper terminology from the start. For example, after introducing symbolic notation for conditional probability, ask students to write or say aloud the verbal translation of a given problem that uses that notation.

Strategy

Purpose
Example
Note-Taking
Students create a record of information while reading a text or listening to a speaker.
Helps in organizing ideas and processing information.
Have students write down the conditions to be verified when calculating confidence intervals for a population proportion so they can refer to those conditions at a later point in time.
Notice and Wonder
Students are shown a data display on its own with little or no context around it. Students comment on what they notice or wonder about it.
Allows students to access the relevant information being conveyed by the graph without worrying about having to answer something “correctly.”
This strategy works equally well for a 5-minute warm-up or for a lengthier, in-depth discussion.
Select an interesting graph, or one they will be seeing in an upcoming lesson, and ask students to write down three things they “notice” or “wonder” as they look at it.
Then have student volunteers share their observations in groups or with the class.
Odd One Out
In groups of four, students are given four problems, images, or graphs. Three of the items should have something in common.
Each student in the group works with one of the four items and must decide individually whether their item fits with the other three items and then write a reason why. Students then respond within their groups.
Allows students to explore relationships and graphical features that are similar to or different from one another.
Begin by modeling an example:
three images that are four-legged animals and one that’s an inanimate object. Explain why the object is the “odd one out.” Then provide each student in the group with one of four images displaying distribution graphs. Three of the graphs, for instance, could be approximately normal, while the fourth graph is bimodal. Have students examine their graph and write on mini whiteboards “Mine is in because . . .” or “Mine is out because . . . ." Have each group discuss and signal when they’ve reached consensus. Then reveal the answer and explain what the three similar graphs have in common and why the other is the odd one out.
Paraphrasing
Students restate in their own words the essential information in a text or problem description.
Assists with comprehension, recall of information, and problem solving.
After reading a free-response question, have students re-express the scenario in their own words. For example, on an experimental design question, have them restate the important facets of the experiment (control, randomization, replication, the variable being measured, comparison) before reading what the question itself asks.

Example
Password-Style
Games
Students are in pairs with one student facing the teacher and the other with their back to the teacher.
The teacher projects a word and the student facing the teacher describes the word to their partner. This repeats every 10 seconds for six words. Students then switch roles.
Reinforces understanding of key vocabulary terms by having students use different approaches for describing those terms.
Have students arrange themselves into partners (or triads), with one partner seated so their back is to the teacher. When projecting the term, “normal distribution,” the students facing the teacher provide clues to try to get their partner to write the term on their mini whiteboard. After 10 seconds,
project a new term: “chi-square test.” Continue the process for as many terms as there are for that activity.
Peer Critique
Students work in teams or with partners to critique student solutions and responses to free-response questions.
Helps to establish criteria for a model response based on content and communication.
Project an anonymous student solution to a homework question (e.g., a description of the shape, center, spread, and outliers for a histogram in context). Have students discuss/critique in their groups and share with the whole class.
Predict and Confirm
Students make conjectures about what results will develop in an activity, confirming or modifying the conjectures based on outcomes.
Stimulates thinking by making, checking, and correcting predictions based on evidence from the outcome.
Before performing a class simulation, have students discuss with their neighbor what values the distribution may take and how often they expect/predict those values to occur. For instance, what might the distribution look like for a binomial setting with 0.5 p = and 16 n = , when we perform 20 trials? Have students perform the simulation, then confirm their predictions.
Quickwrite
Students write for a short, specific amount of time about a designated topic.
Helps generate ideas in a short time.
Provide students with a prompt, such as “Describe how to construct a sampling distribution.” Then allow 1–2 minutes for them to write a response (e.g., “obtain sample, collect responses, calculate statistic, plot statistic, repeat”).
Allow more writing time for more difficult prompts.

Purpose
Example
Quiz-Quiz-Trade
Students answer a question independently and then quiz a partner on the same question.
Allows students to talk to multiple peers and solve many problems while coaching each other and hearing different ways of solving or arriving at a solution.
Give students a card containing a question and have them write the answer on the back.
Then have them stand up and find a partner. One student quizzes the other and then they reverse roles.
Have them switch cards, find a new partner, and the process repeats.
Relief Pitcher
In teams of four, students rotate from “bull pen” to “pitcher’s mound” to answer questions and earn points for the team.
Allows students to work together toward a common goal as they practice applying their statistics knowledge and skills.
This strategy works well to review multiple concepts at the end of a unit or to spiral review at the end of the course. For instance, when reviewing for a unit test, students can earn 5 points if they get a question correct when up at the “pitcher’s mound” and 3 points if they don’t know the answer but their team in the “bull pen” helps them answer it.
Reversing
Interpretations
Students are provided with an interpretation and then they generate the value and a possible scenario rather than providing students the value and having them generate the interpretation.
Helps students explore the same concept from multiple approaches and deepens their understanding of why a certain interpretation aligns with a particular value in context.
Instead of only asking students to interpret the slope and y-intercept of a least-squares regression line, provide them with an interpretation and ask them to unpack it. For example, “Weight increases by 35.02 kg for each 1-meter increase in length, on average. What does this describe?”
Round Table
Students are given a worksheet with multiple problems, and work individually to solve, then rotate after each problem to allow other group members to check their work.
Allows students the chance to analyze each other’s work and coach their peers, if necessary.
In groups of four, each student has an identical paper with four different problems on it. Have students complete the first one on their paper and then pass the paper clockwise to another member in their group.
That student checks the first problem and then completes the second problem on the paper.
Have students rotate again, and the process continues until each student has their original paper back.

Example
Scavenger Hunt
Provide students with a “starter” question. Then place solution cards around the room—each card should contain the solution to a previous problem, along with the next problem in the “scavenger hunt.”
Students walk around answering each new problem and finding the corresponding solution around the room.
Allows students to self correct and analyze their own work if they get an answer they don’t see posted.
When practicing probability calculations, place a card with a starter question somewhere in the classroom, for example:
Calculate the expected number of tardy students for the probability
distribution:
X 0 1 2 3 ( )
P X 0.5 0.3 0.1 0.1
Place another card somewhere in the room with the solution to that card, plus another question,
for example: “Solution: 0.8 Next
problem: Jeff’s bowling scores are roughly normal with mean 120 and a standard deviation of 20.
Jared’s bowling scores are roughly normal with mean 180 and a standard deviation of 10. If their scores are independent, what is their combined standard deviation of their team score?” The answer is written on the next card
(“Solution: 22.4”).
Continue posting solution cards with new problems until the final card presents a problem whose solution is on the original starter card (note that this solution would be added to the starter card above).
Students can begin the scavenger hunt at any question, then search around the room for the solution they found, as this will lead them to the next problem they need to solve, until they end up at the first card they started with.

Example
Sentence Starters
Students respond to a prompt by filling in the missing parts of a given sentence template.
Helps students practice communication skills by providing a starting point and modeling a sentence structure that would apply for a particular type of problem.
For linear regression models, provide a scenario that includes a least-squares equation. Then have students use a given sentence starter to interpret the meaning of the slope in context. For example, students could be given the scenario in 2017 FRQ 1, including the least-squares equation ˆ 16.46 35.02 y x = − + . To help students begin writing their interpretations, provide a sentence starter such as “The least-squares regression line predicts that the would increase by approximately for each .” The sentence starter provided could become more open ended as students become more comfortable with writing interpretations in context.
Simulation
Students develop a “best guess” for a parameter by collecting data through simulation, then investigating the distribution of data collected by the class.
Helps students understand what sampling distribution is by crowdsourcing data from the class;
also helps make abstract problems more accessible and reinforces the role of probability in inference.
When estimating a population proportion of red cards in a standard deck, put students in pairs and have them draw n cards and then record the proportion that are red. Repeat a large number of times and then create a class dotplot and estimate the parameter value based on the center of the dotplot.
Sketch and Switch
Students create a sketch of a distribution that has a given set of characteristics then switch papers to review each other’s work.
Reinforces key vocabulary, provides exposure to varying solutions based on the same characteristics, and allows students to give and receive feedback on each other’s work.
For distributions of a single variable, have students sketch a “bimodal, left-skewed” distribution or a “symmetric, bimodal distribution with two outliers.” For scatterplots, have them sketch a “weak negative non-linear association.”
Team Challenge
Students work in teams of three or four to solve an unfamiliar problem that requires transfer of knowledge and skills from multiple areas of the course.
Builds confidence in approaching complex questions by sharing ideas and providing feedback to peers.
To introduce the investigative task, have students work in teams to develop a model solution to a question that is beyond most students’ ability to fully complete on their own.

Example
Team FRQ
Each student in a group of four completes one step of the four-step process for inference with the rest of the group’s input.
Allows students to integrate their own knowledge with that of their teammates in order to create a comprehensive solution to a free response question.
Give student groups a free-response question (FRQ) that requires students to identify, set up, perform, and interpret the results of an appropriate significance test to answer a particular question. Student A states a pair of hypotheses with group input. Student B identifies a test procedure while the group checks that the conditions have been verified. Student C finds the value of the test statistic while others find the p-value. Student D states the conclusion while the group checks for linkage to p-value and context.
When groups are finished, have them score their responses as a class using the free-response question scoring guidelines.
The Scribe and the Calculator (also see FRQ
Partner Quiz)
Students do problems together in pairs; only one student is allowed to use the calculator, and only the other student is allowed to write on the paper.
Allows students to practice communication and use of technology with a peer.
Group students into pairs and present them with the following
scenario: “A basketball player makes 80% of her free throws. Assuming her shots are independent and she takes 20 shots, calculate the probability that at least 15 of the shots are made.” Instruct students to begin working on a solution, noting that one student can only write (but can’t touch the calculator), while the other student can only use the calculator (but can’t write anything). Consider assigning the “calculator” role to the student who is weaker on technology to help them practice.
Think Aloud
Students talk through a difficult problem by describing what the text means.
Helps in comprehending the text, understanding the components of a problem, and thinking about possible paths to a solution.
When students have learned the different types of inference tests and intervals, have them talk through key questions, such as “How many groups?” “Is this a categorical or quantitative variable?” “How was the data collected?” or “Am I testing a claim or estimating an amount?” continued on next page

Example
Think-Pair-Share (or Wait, Turn, and Talk)
Students are given time to think through a problem on their own, followed by sharing their ideas with a partner and then concluding by sharing results with the class.
Allows students uninterrupted time to process their initial ideas and then revise those ideas with a partner in preparation for sharing them with a larger group.
When looking at a dotplot or boxplot, have students first think individually about what features are the most interesting to them (or about the center, shape, and variability) and then have them share their thoughts with their neighbor. Call on pairs of students to share their thoughts.
Two Wrongs
Make a Right
Students list all the reasonably likely ways in which a student could answer a question incorrectly.
Helps students to recognize the common errors and misconceptions that occur so they are less likely to make those errors themselves.
When comparing distributions, have students provide examples that do not describe all relevant features (shape, center, spread, and unusual points).
Use
Manipulatives
Students use objects to examine relationships between the information given.
Supports comprehension by providing a tangible or visual representation of a problem or concept.
When constructing the sampling distribution of the sample mean, have students put dot stickers with an x written on them to reinforce the idea that the dots on the dotplot are means, not single observations.
When performing simulations, use concrete objects to help students understand how often certain values of a variable would occur just by chance. For example, if a simulation has 10 freshmen and six seniors, use 10 blue beads to represent “freshmen” and six red beads to represent “seniors.”

strategies for helping students to develop the skill of using probability and simulation.
Skill Category 3: Using Probability and Simulation
Skill
Key Questions
Sample Activities
Instructional
Strategies 3.A Determine relative frequencies, proportions, or probabilities using simulation or calculations.
§§ How can I use a random process to model this scenario?
§§ What population does this dotplot represent?
§§ If your dotplot is not approximately normal, why not?
§§ How is a population distribution different from a sampling distribution?
§§ How is a sampling distribution of sample size 2 similar to and different from a sampling distribution of sample size 5 from the same population?

After 4? 10? 30? What does this mean?” §§ Debriefing §§ Simulation §§ The Scribe and the Calculator §§ Use Manipulatives 3.B Determine parameters for probability distributions.
§§ Why might the mean of a probability distribution for a discrete random variable be less than (or greater than) the average of possible values?
§§ As an introduction, provide students with estimates of probabilities of litter size for black bears:
( ) 1 cub 0.06
P = , ( ) 2 cubs 0.23
P = , ( ) 3 cubs 0.63
P = , ( ) 4 cubs 0.08
P = , and ( ) 5 or more cubs 0.01
P < .
Ask student groups to represent this probability distribution for a sample of 30 litters in a table to predict the mean and standard deviation of the number of cubs in a litter for black bears. Students should explain their reasoning in groups. Class discussion should lead to the correct formulas.

Skill Category 4: Develop an explanation or justify a conclusion
using evidence from data, definitions, or statistical inference
Students consistently struggle with communicating their arguments on the AP Exam. Students often need targeted support to develop this skill, so
teachers should remind students that communicating
reasoning is at least as important as finding a solution.
Well-communicated reasoning validates solutions.
Teachers can also reinforce that when students are
asked to provide reasoning or a justification for their solution, a successful response will include:
§§ A logical sequence of steps §§ An argument that explains why those steps are appropriate
§§ An accurate interpretation of the solution (with units), always in the context of the situation
In order to help students develop these communication skills, teachers can:
§§ Have students practice explaining their solutions orally to a small group or to the class.
§§ Present an incomplete argument or explanation
and have students supplement it for greater clarity or completeness.
§§ Provide sentence starters, template guides, and communication tips to help scaffold the writing process.

Strategies 4.A Make an appropriate claim or draw an appropriate conclusion.
§§ What do you expect to be true about the number of red cards in a fair deck of cards? What seems to be true?
§§ How would proportions be different when drawing cards from a deck without replacement, as opposed to with replacement?
§§ What are your assumptions about this scenario?
§§ What, if anything, can we conclude about causation in this scenario?
§§ Does our conclusion imply that we have “accepted” the null, that we are “certain” about something, or that we have “proven” something?
§§ Manipulate a deck of cards by stacking it with more reds, for example (the class is not aware of this). Have one student pick cards one at a time, with replacement, and shuffling between each pick. Have another student tally the number of reds/blacks. Have students discuss expectations (50% reds) and what they’re seeing. This can be used as an introduction to the concept of significance tests. [Topic 6.4] §§ Have students look at student samples of inappropriate claims or drawing inappropriate conclusions from released FRQs. Then have them compare these samples to the scoring guidelines or notes from the Chief Reader Report.
Finally, have students correct a set of new incorrect samples so that the samples are making appropriate claims or drawing appropriate conclusions.

General Scoring Notes
Each part of the question (indicated by a letter) is initially scored by determining if it meets the criteria for
essentially correct, partially correct, or incorrect. The response is then categorized based on the scores
assigned to each letter part and awarded a score between 0 and 4 (see the table at the end of each question).
Model Solution
Scoring
Part (A)
2.A
2.D
UNC-1.H
UNC-1.M
UNC-1.O
The distributions of lead concentration for both
Region A and Region B are skewed to the right.
The median lead concentration of Region B (between 100 ppm and 150 ppm) is greater than the median lead concentration of Region A (between 50 ppm and 100 ppm).
The range of lead concentration of Region A (between 400 ppm and 500 ppm) is greater than the range of lead concentration of Region B (between 250 ppm and 350 ppm
Essentially correct (E) if the response addresses the following five components:
1.	 Shape (right skewed)
2.	 Center (e.g., correct location of mean and/or median)
3.	 Variability (e.g., correct range and/or IQR)
4.	 Comparison between regions of at least one of the
following: shapes, centers, or variability
5.	 Context (lead concentration)
Partially correct (P) if the response includes only three or four of the five components listed above.
Incorrect (I) if the response does not satisfy the criteria for E or P.
Part (B)
4.E
DAT-3.H
Because the p-value of 0.007 is less than the level
of significance of 0.05, the data provide convincing
statistical evidence that there is a difference between the mean lead concentration in the two regions.
Essentially correct (E) if the response provides both of
the following:
1.	 Correct conclusion (Yes, the data provide convincing
statistical evidence) in context (lead concentration)
2.	 Justification based on comparing the p-value to the significance level, α
Partially correct (P) Option 1:
The response provides both of the following:
1.	 Correct conclusion (Yes) but without context
2.	 Justification based on comparing the p-value to the significance level, α
Partially correct (P) Option 2:
The response provides both of the following:
1.	 Correct conclusion (Yes) in context (lead concentration)
2.	 Justification based on the p-value, but without
comparison of the p-value to the significance level, α
Incorrect (I) if the response does not satisfy the criteria for E or P.

Essentially correct (E) if the response includes the following three components.
1.	 Shows evidence that the calculation of at least one
probability necessary to complete the table is based on a binomial with = 3 n and = 0.8 p , either by using the
binomial formula with correct values substituted in, or
by using the notation B (3, 0.8), or by using a calculator
command, such as binompdf (n = 3, p = 0.8, s = 2).
However, an unlabeled calculator command such as binompdf(3, 0.8, 2) does not satisfy component 1.
Note:
•	 A normal approximation is not appropriate because the sample size is too small.
2.	 Correct calculation of = ( 1)

Calculation, Option 1:
The expected value of S is E(S) = ∑sP(s) = 0(0.008) + 1(0.096) + 2(0.384) + 3(0.512) = 2.4
Calculation, Option 2:
Because S is a binomial random variable, E(S) = np = 3(0.8) = 2.4.
Interpretation:
If the process of randomly selecting 3 moviegoers is repeated many times, the average number of moviegoers who make a purchase at the snack bar will be very close to 2.4.
Essentially correct (E) if the response satisfies the following four components.
1.	 Calculates the expected value correctly.
A correct expected value calculation that is consistent
with incorrect probabilities reported in part (a) satisfies component 1. If the expected value calculation is
rounded to an integer, the response does not satisfy component 1.
2.	 Interpretation—includes reference to long run, many samples or repeated sampling.
3.	 Interpretation—includes reference of average.
4.	 Context.
Partially correct (P) if the response includes only three of the four components.
Incorrect (I) if the response does not satisfy the criteria for E or P.
