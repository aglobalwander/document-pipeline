Introduction
Purpose of this document 1
Biology guide

=== Page 8 ===
The Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the
16 to 19 age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be
knowledgeable and inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on
encouraging students to develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes
necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The Diploma Programme model
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core (see figure 1). It encourages the
concurrent study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study two modern languages (or a modern
language and a classical language), a humanities or social science subject, an experimental science,
mathematics and one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the DP a
demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance. In each of the
academic areas students have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can choose subjects
that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.

Introduction
The Diploma Programme 2
Biology guide

=== Page 9 ===
Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they can,
instead of an arts subject, choose two subjects from another area. Normally, three subjects (and not
more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB
recommends 240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than at SL.
At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of the
course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some element of coursework assessed by teachers.
The core of the Diploma Programme model
All DP students participate in the three course elements that make up the core of the model.
Theory of knowledge (TOK) is a course that is fundamentally about critical thinking and inquiry into the
process of knowing rather than about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines the
nature of knowledge and how we know what we claim to know. It does this by encouraging students to
analyse knowledge claims and explore questions about the construction of knowledge. The task of TOK is
to emphasize connections between areas of shared knowledge and link them to personal knowledge in
such a way that an individual becomes more aware of their own perspectives and how they might differ from others.
In TOK, students explore the means of producing knowledge within the core theme of “knowledge and the
knower” as well as within various optional themes (knowledge and technology, knowledge and politics,
knowledge and language, knowledge and religion, and knowledge and indigenous societies) and areas of
knowledge (the arts, natural sciences, human sciences, history and mathematics). The course also
encourages students to make comparisons between different areas of knowledge and reflect on how
knowledge is arrived at in the various disciplines, what the disciplines have in common, and the differences between them.
Creativity, activity, service (CAS) is at the heart of the DP. The emphasis in CAS is on helping students to
develop their own identities, in accordance with the ethical principles embodied in the IB mission
statement and the IB learner profile. It involves students in a range of activities alongside their academic
studies throughout the DP. The three strands of CAS are creativity (arts and other experiences that involve
creative thinking), activity (physical exertion contributing to a healthy lifestyle) and service (an unpaid and
voluntary exchange that has a learning benefit for the student). Possibly, more than any other component
in the DP, CAS contributes to the IB’s mission to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect.
The extended essay (EE), including the world studies extended essay, offers the opportunity for IB students
to investigate a topic of special interest, in the form of a 4,000-word piece of independent research. The
area of research undertaken is chosen from one of the students’ six DP subjects, or in the case of the
interdisciplinary world studies essay, two subjects, and acquaints them with the independent research and
writing skills expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally presented, structured writing, in
which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent manner, appropriate to the subject
or subjects chosen. It is intended to promote high-level research and writing skills, intellectual discovery
and creativity. An authentic learning experience, it provides students with an opportunity to engage in
personal research on a topic of choice, under the guidance of a supervisor.
Approaches to teaching and approaches to learning
Approaches to teaching and approaches to learning (ATL) across the DP refers to deliberate strategies, skills
and attitudes that permeate the teaching and learning environment. These approaches and tools,
intrinsically linked with the learner profile attributes, enhance student learning and assist student

preparation for the DP assessment and beyond. The aims of approaches to teaching and learning in the DP
are to:
•
empower teachers as teachers of learners as well as teachers of content •
empower teachers to create clearer strategies for facilitating learning experiences in which students
are more meaningfully engaged in structured inquiry and greater critical and creative thinking •
promote both the aims of individual subjects (making them more than course aspirations) and linking
previously isolated knowledge (concurrency of learning) •
encourage students to develop an explicit variety of skills that will equip them to continue to be
actively engaged in learning after they leave school, and to help them not only obtain university
admission through better grades but also prepare for success during tertiary education and beyond •
enhance further the coherence and relevance of the students’ DP experience •
allow schools to identify the distinctive nature of an IB DP education, with its blend of idealism and practicality.
The five ATL (developing thinking skills, social skills, communication skills, self-management skills and
research skills) along with the six approaches to teaching (teaching that is inquiry-based, conceptually
focused, contextualized, collaborative, differentiated and informed by assessment) encompass the key values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy.
The IB mission statement and the IB learner profile
The DP aims to develop in students the knowledge, skills and attitudes they will need to fulfil the aims of
the IB, as expressed in the organization’s mission statement and the learner profile. Teaching and learning
in the DP represent the reality in daily practice of the organization’s educational philosophy.
Academic integrity
Academic integrity in the DP is a set of values and behaviours informed by the attributes of the learner
profile. In teaching, learning and assessment, academic integrity serves to promote personal integrity,
engender respect for the integrity of others and their work, and ensure that all students have an equal
opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquire during their studies.
All coursework—including work submitted for assessment—is to be authentic, based on the student’s
individual and original ideas with the ideas and work of others fully acknowledged. Assessment tasks that
require teachers to provide guidance to students or that require students to work collaboratively must be
completed in full compliance with the detailed guidelines provided by the IB for the relevant subjects.
For further information on academic integrity in the IB and the DP, please consult the IB publications
Academic integrity, Effective citing and referencing, Diploma Programme: From principles into practice and the
general regulations in Diploma Programme Assessment procedures (updated annually). Specific information
regarding academic integrity as it pertains to external and internal assessment components of this DP subject can be found in this guide.
Acknowledging the ideas or work of another person
Coordinators and teachers are reminded that candidates must acknowledge all sources used in work
submitted for assessment. The following is intended as a clarification of this requirement.
DP candidates submit work for assessment in a variety of media that may include audiovisual material, text,
graphs, images and/or data published in print or electronic sources. If a candidate uses the work or ideas of
another person, the candidate must acknowledge the source using a standard style of referencing in a
consistent manner. A candidate’s failure to acknowledge a source will be investigated by the IB as a
potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.
The Diploma Programme 4
Biology guide

=== Page 11 ===
The IB does not prescribe which style(s) of referencing or in-text citation should be used by candidates; this
is left to the discretion of appropriate faculty/staff in the candidate’s school. The wide range of subjects,
response languages and the diversity of referencing styles make it impractical and restrictive to insist on
particular styles. In practice, certain styles may prove most commonly used, but schools are free to choose a
style that is appropriate for the subject concerned and the language in which candidates’ work is written.
Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a given subject, it is expected that the minimum
information given includes: name of author, date of publication, title of source, and page numbers as applicable.
Candidates are expected to use a standard style and use it consistently so that credit is given to all sources
used, including sources that have been paraphrased or summarized. When writing text candidates must
clearly distinguish between their words and those of others by the use of quotation marks (or other
method, such as indentation) followed by an appropriate citation that denotes an entry in the bibliography.
If an electronic source is cited, the date of access must be indicated. Candidates are not expected to show
faultless expertise in referencing, but are expected to demonstrate that all sources have been
acknowledged. Candidates must be advised that audiovisual material, text, graphs, images and/or data
published in print or in electronic sources that is not their own must also attribute the source. Again, an
appropriate style of referencing/citation must be used.
Learning diversity and learning support requirements
Schools must ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided to
candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Access and inclusion
policy and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes: Removing barriers to learning.
The publications Meeting student learning diversity in the classroom and The IB guide to inclusive education: a
resource for whole school development are available to support schools in the ongoing process of increasing
access and engagement by removing barriers to learning.
Programme standards and practices
The programme standards and practices are a set of principles for schools to ensure quality and fidelity in
the implementation of IB programmes. Teaching and learning are important markers of quality and
effective practice in schools; thus the expectations teachers and learners share across all IB programmes can
be found in the programme standards and practices.
The programme standards and practices provide a framework to help teachers understand their rights and
responsibilities in IB World Schools as they develop learning environments and experiences for their
students. The IB recognizes that in order for effective teaching to take place, teachers must be supported in
their understanding, well-being, environment and resources. Teachers use the core tenets of IB philosophy
and pedagogy (approaches to teaching, ATL, the learner profile and international-mindedness) to design
learning experiences that prepare learners to fulfil the aims and objectives outlined in this guide.
To learn more about teachers’ rights and responsibilities, please see the IB publication Programme
standards and practices on the Programme Resource Centre.

What is nature of science?
Nature of science (NOS) is an overarching theme in the biology, chemistry and physics courses that seeks to
explore conceptual understandings related to the purpose, features and impact of scientific knowledge.
What do we want to know in science?
Nobel laureate and influential popularizer of science, Richard Feynman, once described the process of
science using the analogy of watching an unknown board game being played “... and you don’t know the
rules of the game, but you’re allowed to look at the board from time to time. And from these observations,
you try to figure out what the rules are of the game, [and] the rules of the pieces moving” (Feynman et al., 1963).
What is the scientific endeavour?
Classifying such observations and underlying patterns in the natural world is the essence of what scientists
do, underpinned by the assumption that the universe exists as an external reality accessible to the human
experience. The varied and often non-linear processes used in scientific methodologies have several key
features in common to maximize the validity and reliability of knowledge produced. The development of
falsifiable hypotheses, a requirement for replicable data, and the utilization of peer-review may be among
the most essential of these and help differentiate a scientific process from a pseudoscientific one. The
communal and collaborative nature of this approach further strengthens the objectivity of science by
ensuring the inclusion of diverse perspectives and shared responsibility for its outcomes.
What type of knowledge do we produce?
Formal scientific knowledge may encompass several categories including representative models,
explanatory theories and descriptive laws. As the focus of each discipline of natural science differs, so too
does the balance of their contributions to each category. What remains constant, however, is the
acknowledgement of assumptions, exceptions and limitations of scientific knowledge to provide realistic
parameters to our understanding of the natural world. Claims of certainty are treated with caution given
the presence of paradigmatic shifts throughout the history of science.
What is the impact of scientific knowledge?
As well as the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, it is useful to consider the interplay of science with
other areas of society. Although advances in technology traditionally fuelled great leaps in scientific
understanding, in recent times it may be more common to see science as a driver of technological
development. In addition, the implications of science within environmental, political, social, cultural and
economic domains can also be profound. These connections illustrate the importance of local, national and
international scientific bodies that engage with the public understanding of science and heighten the
responsibility of scientists to adhere to principles of academic integrity in their research.

Nature of science 6

Table 1
Aspects of nature of science
Aspects
How are scientific knowledge claims generated, tested, communicated,
evaluated and used? What issues arise from these actions?
Observations
Scientists act as observers, looking at Earth and all other parts of the universe, to
obtain data about natural phenomena. Observations can be made directly using
human senses, or with the aid of instruments such as electronic sensors. Unexpected
or unplanned observations can open up new research fields.
Patterns and trends
Scientists analyse their observations, looking for patterns or trends, and try to draw
general conclusions by inductive reasoning. They also look for discrepancies.
Scientists classify objects through pattern recognition. A trend may take the form of a
positive or negative correlation between variables. Correlations may be based on a
causal relationship, but correlation does not prove causation.
Hypotheses
Scientists make provisional explanations for the patterns that they have observed in
natural phenomena. These hypotheses can be tested, with further observations or
experiments, to obtain support for a hypothesis or show that it is false.
Experiments
Scientists design and perform experiments to obtain data, which can be used to test
hypotheses. The quality of experimental evidence depends on careful control of
variables and on the quantity of data generated. Progress in science often follows
technological developments that allow new experimental techniques. Creativity and
imagination play a role in experimental design, interpretation and conclusion.
Measurement
Quantitative measurements are more objective than qualitative observations, but all
measurements are limited in precision and accuracy. Measurements are repeated to
strengthen the reliability of data. Random errors in measurement due to unknown or
unpredictable differences lead to imprecision and uncertainty, whereas systematic errors lead to inaccuracy.
Models
Scientists construct models as artificial representations of natural phenomena. They
are useful when direct observation or experimentation is difficult. Models are
simplifications of complex systems and can be physical representations, abstract
diagrams, mathematical equations or algorithms. All models have limitations that need to be considered in their application.
Evidence
Scientists adopt a sceptical attitude to claims and evaluate them using evidence.
Some claims cannot be tested using verifiable evidence, so cannot be falsified. They
are therefore not scientific. Scientific knowledge must be supported by evidence.
Theories
Scientists develop general explanations that are widely applicable, based on observed
patterns or tested hypotheses. Predictions can be generated from these theories by
deductive reasoning. If these predictions are tested, they may corroborate a theory or
show that it is false and should be rejected. Paradigm shifts take place when a new
theory replaces an old one. The term “law” is sometimes used for statements that
allow predictions to be made about natural phenomena without explaining them.
Falsification
Scientists can use evidence to falsify a claim formulated as a hypothesis, theory or
model, but they cannot prove with certainty that such a claim is true. There is
therefore inherent uncertainty in all scientific knowledge. Nonetheless, many theories
in science are corroborated by strong evidence and allow for prediction and
explanation. Scientists must remain open-minded with respect to new evidence.
Science as a shared endeavour
Scientists communicate and collaborate throughout the world. Agreed conventions
and common terminology facilitate unambiguous communication. Peer review is

Aspects
How are scientific knowledge claims generated, tested, communicated,
evaluated and used? What issues arise from these actions?
essential to verify the research methods of knowledge claims prior to their publication in journals.
Global impact of science
Scientists have an obligation to assess the risks associated with their work and must
aim to do no harm. Developments in science may have ethical, environmental,
political, social, cultural and economic consequences that must be considered during
decision-making. The pursuit of science may have unintended consequences.
Research proposals are often filtered through ethics boards. Scientists have a
responsibility to communicate their findings to the public with honesty and clarity.
How is NOS different from TOK?
In contrast to the specificity of understanding of science, the TOK course encourages students to think
critically about the concepts that underpin knowledge production. For example, peer review is used as a
tool to support objectivity in scientific research. Through the study of TOK, students question the
limitations of the peer review process and extend their thinking to an assessment of objectivity in other areas of knowledge.
Nature of science 8
Biology guide

=== Page 15 ===
The word “biology” was introduced by German naturalist Gottfried Reinhold in 1802. Since then, our
understanding of living organisms has expanded considerably with the advent of techniques and
technologies such as imaging and molecular sequencing methods. Of all the sciences, biology is a study
that takes more of a pragmatic view than a theoretical approach.
The earliest evidence of life on Earth dates from at least 3.5 billion years ago. Through reproduction and
natural selection, life has diversified tremendously, occupying a wide variety of niches. This diversity makes
biology both a deeply fascinating and significantly challenging study.
The study of life makes progress through not only advances in techniques, but also pattern recognition,
controlled experiments and collaboration between scientists. Unifying themes provide frameworks for
interpretation and help us make sense of the living world: Form and function, Unity and diversity,
Continuity and change, and Interaction and interdependence are four of the themes around which this
biology syllabus is constructed, although other frameworks are possible.
The scale of life in biology ranges from the molecules and cells of organisms to ecosystems and the
biosphere. This way of considering complex systems as simpler components—an approach known as
reductionism—makes systems more manageable to study. It is the foundation of controlled experiments
and has thus enabled major discoveries, but it provides an incomplete view of life. At each level of
biological organization, different properties exist. Living systems are based on interactions,
interdependence and integration of components between all levels of biological organization.
A student of biology should gain not only a conceptual understanding of the subject, but also an awareness
of how biologists construct knowledge claims and the limitations of these methods.
Distinction between SL and HL
Students at SL and HL share the following.
•
An understanding of science through a stimulating experimental programme •
The nature of science as an overarching theme •
The study of a concept-based syllabus •
One piece of internally assessed work, the scientific investigation •
The collaborative sciences project
The SL course provides students with a fundamental understanding of biology and experience of the
associated skills. The HL course requires students to increase their knowledge and understanding of the
subject, and so provides a solid foundation for further study at university level.
The SL course has a recommended 150 teaching hours, compared to 240 hours for the HL course. This
difference is reflected in the additional content studied by HL students. Some of the HL content is
conceptually more demanding and explored in greater depth. The distinction between SL and HL is
therefore one of both breadth and depth. The increased breadth and depth at HL result in increased
networked knowledge, requiring the student to make more connections between diverse areas of the syllabus.
Introduction
Nature of biology 9

Biology and the core
Biology and theory of knowledge
The TOK course plays a special role in the DP by providing opportunities for students to reflect on the
nature, scope and limitations of knowledge and the process of knowing through an exploration of knowledge questions.
The areas of knowledge (AOK) are specific branches of knowledge, each of which can be seen to have a
distinct nature and sometimes use different methods of gaining knowledge. In TOK, students explore five
compulsory AOK: history, the human sciences, the natural sciences, mathematics and the arts.
There are several different ways in which aspects of the biology course can be connected to the exploration
of knowledge. During the teaching and learning of the biology course, teachers and students evaluate
knowledge claims by exploring questions concerning their validity, reliability, credibility and certainty, as
well as individual and cultural perspectives on them.
Exploration of the relationship between knowledge and TOK concepts can help students to deepen their
understanding and make connections between disciplines. For example, while discussing the depletion of
energy sources and the constant need for new energy resources to meet energy demands, students can
explore the concepts of responsibility, power and justification.
Many aspects of the biology course lend themselves to the exploration of knowledge questions. Some examples are provided in the following table.

Biology and the extended essay
Students who choose to write an EE in biology undertake independent research as part of an in-depth
study of a focused topic. The topic for study may be generated from the biology course or may relate to a
subject area beyond the syllabus content. This detailed study will help develop research, thinking, self management and communication skills, which will support students’ learning in the biology course, and in further studies.
Examples of areas for research topics •
Context: An assessment of the factors affecting species population, using databases or other secondary sources.
◦
Example: The impact of predation by the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) on Canada geese (Branta canadensis) nesting populations in Alaska.
Nature of biology 10

•
Context: Experiments on factors affecting all aspects of plant growth, flowering and germination ◦
Example: A comparison of the effect of salt (sodium chloride) concentration on germination in
radishes (Raphanus raphanistrum) and beet (Beta vulgaris).
•
Context: Factors affecting enzyme-based reactions in cells.
◦
Example: The effect of processing temperature (60–120°C) of soybean (Glycine max) meal on urease activity in freshly powdered soybeans.
•
Context: Using microorganism growth assays to monitor the presence of toxic chemicals in the environment.
◦
Example: The viability of yeast stained with methylene blue in aqueous ethanol solutions (0– 4.0%).
World studies (context: environmental and/or economic sustainability) •
Context: Trade in seed plants and food security based on agricultural practices.
◦
Example: Sustainable food security in Nepal based on a range of millet species and the need to protect genetic diversity.
Note: When students are referring to organisms in an examination, either the common name or the scientific name is acceptable.
Students and supervisors must ensure that an EE does not duplicate other work submitted for the diploma.
For more information, please refer to the Extended essay guide and the Extended essay teacher support material.
Biology and creativity, activity, service
The CAS component of the DP core provides many opportunities for students to link science concepts and
topics to practical experiences. Teachers can highlight how knowledge and understanding developed
through the course might inform meaningful experiences. Outside the classroom, CAS experiences might
also ignite students’ passion for addressing topics inside the biology classroom.
Some examples of relevant CAS experiences are as follows.
•
Organizing a science club for students in lower years •
Implementing environmental initiatives within the school or local community, such as recycling, composting and roof gardens •
Organizing or participating in a social media outreach or advocacy campaign, for example, on an environmental or health concern
CAS experiences can be a single event or may be an extended series of events. It is important that CAS
experiences be distinct from and not submitted as part of a biology assessment.
For more information, please refer to the Creativity, activity, service guide and the Creativity, activity, service teacher support material.
Biology and international-mindedness
Science has been, and continues to be, a truly international endeavour. From the beginnings of seismology
in China, through material science in Mesopotamia to astronomy in the Islamic Golden Age, the search for
an objective understanding of the natural world transcends the limitations imposed by national
boundaries. The scientific process, requiring curiosity, insight and an open-minded approach, benefits from
the widest possible participation across genders and cultures through inclusivity and diversity.
Given the global nature of many scientific issues, international organizations often have a focus on the
engagement of science with the public domain. The World Health Organization and the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change are two well-known examples that model a responsibility to inform nations of
scientific progress on an equitable basis. Underlying this responsibility is the interest of promoting a peaceful and sustainable future.
Nature of biology 11

Advancements in technology, along with the cost of modern research facilities, continues to reinforce the
role of international collaborative work. This was clearly demonstrated through the global initiatives
focused on addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, the initiatives that were undertaken to develop
the necessary knowledge and technology to create vaccines.
The importance of collaboration in contemporary science is reflected by the large number of international
organizations tasked with collating and sharing data with the scientific community. Access to shared
knowledge through websites and databases must be integrated into classroom teaching as it plays an important role in validating experimental work.
In addition to integrating technology and collaborative work, the collaborative sciences project provides an
excellent opportunity for students to engage with global issues.

The approaches to learning framework
What are approaches to learning skills and why do we teach them?
The approaches to learning (ATL) framework seeks to develop in students affective, cognitive and
metacognitive skills that will support their learning processes during and beyond their IB experience. The
development of ATL skills is closely connected with the IB learner profile attributes and therefore helps to
advance the IB mission. The ATL skills are an integral part of IB learning and teaching that should be
developed across the whole programme—it is not expected that a single course should ever address all of them.
How are they organized?
The ATL framework for IB programmes consists of five general skill categories: thinking skills,
communication skills, social skills, research skills and self-management skills. Each of these categories
covers a broad range, as shown by the examples presented in the table below. The ATL skill categories are
closely linked and interrelated and therefore individual skills may be relevant to more than one category.
How do we teach them?
ATL skills can be learned and taught, improved with practice and developed incrementally. The table below
illustrates, through a number of examples, how the biology course can support ATL skill development. The
examples shown in the table are not exhaustive. Teachers are encouraged to adapt them for use in their
school context and collaboratively identify further examples of ATL skill development.
Further information on the ATL framework and strategies for the development of the ATL skills can be
found in the Biology teacher support material and the Diploma Programme Approaches to teaching and learning website.

Experimental programme
Integral to the student experience of a biology course is the learning that takes place through scientific
inquiry within the classroom, laboratory or in the field. Experimentation through a variety of forms can be
used to introduce a topic, address a phenomenon or allow students to consider and examine authentic questions and curiosities.
A school’s experimental programme should allow students to experience the full breadth and depth of the
course, develop scientific skills and demonstrate safe, competent and methodical use of a range of tools,
techniques and equipment. Students should therefore be encouraged to develop investigations to support
their learning through open-ended inquiry with a focus on laboratory and fieldwork experiments, databases, simulations and modelling.
Approaches to the teaching and learning of biology 16
Biology guide

=== Page 23 ===
Conceptual learning
Concept-based teaching and learning is encouraged across the continuum of IB programmes.
Concepts are mental representations of categories. They are constructed, modified and activated by the
learner through learning experiences. Concepts do not exist in isolation but are interrelated. Conceptual
understanding is always a work in progress—it is continually being developed and refined.
Conceptual understanding is therefore an outcome of a non-linear, ongoing process of evolving
understandings, adapting previous understandings, and identifying and dispelling misconceptions. It
consists of making connections between prior and new knowledge to construct and build an awareness of this network of knowledge.
Concepts vary in their level of abstraction and universality.
•
They can be organizing ideas that are applicable in many contexts and have relevance both within and across subject areas.
•
They can provide a deep understanding of specific knowledge fields (or fields of knowledge) and help
to organize knowledge further, as well as reveal connections between different areas of the subject.
For example, consider the following sequence of three concepts.
Function >
Excretion >
Ultrafiltration
Understanding of the concept of ultrafiltration is part of the understanding of excretion, which in turn helps
to develop an understanding of form and function in biology.
Outcomes of a concept-based approach
Fostering critical thinking, the outcome of a concept-based approach is that students are able to:
• identify examples of a concept •
organize, reflect on, modify and expand their network of knowledge • apply concepts to existing and future knowledge •
apply their conceptual understanding as a scientific thinking tool for predicting outcomes, justifying conclusions and evaluating knowledge claims.
Structure of the syllabus and conceptual understanding
The biology syllabus comprises four themes, each made up of two concepts. Each theme is a lens through which the syllabus content can be viewed.
•
Theme A: Unity and diversity •
Theme B: Form and function •
Theme C: Interaction and interdependence •
Theme D: Continuity and change
The arrangement of syllabus content follows four levels of biological organization, which also serve as conceptual lenses.
•
Level 1: Molecules •
Level 2: Cells •
Level 3: Organisms •
Level 4: Ecosystems
The content is further arranged into topics, each with two guiding questions as signposts for inquiry. These
questions help students view the content of the syllabus through the conceptual lenses of both the themes and the levels of biological organization.
Linking questions strengthen students’ understanding by making connections. Linking questions
encourage students to apply concepts from one topic to another. The ideal outcome of the linking questions is networked knowledge.
Approaches to the teaching and learning of biology 17
Biology guide

=== Page 24 ===
The linking questions in the guide are not exhaustive. Students and teachers may encounter other
connections between understandings and concepts in the syllabus, leading them to create their own linking questions.
Teaching biology in context
The study of biology enables constructive engagement with topical scientific issues. By contextualizing
biological concepts, scientific knowledge claims can be evaluated more effectively, and informed choices
on such issues as human health and the environment can be made. Biological research has brought
innovation and benefit to many fields and continues to be at the heart of seeking effective solutions to
many global challenges. It is therefore important to explore applications of biology in our world while
teaching the course to elicit interest, understanding and curiosity.
Teaching the content of the course in relation to specific contexts supports the pedagogical principle of
teaching in local and global contexts as part of the approaches to teaching framework and offers a number
of advantages. First, it helps students relate their learning to genuine applications of biology, highlighting
the relevance to global issues as well as the significance in students’ own contexts. Second, it develops an
appreciation for the interaction between scientific solutions and their implications, be it ethical,
environmental or economic. Third, it helps to illustrate some of the NOS aspects underpinning the course.
The Biology teacher support material highlights possible areas that could be visited throughout the course
and that may provide context for some topics to stimulate the application of ideas and problem-solving
skills. Consideration of these and related areas may help provide ideas for the scientific investigation, the
collaborative sciences project, TOK exhibition, CAS, or an EE in biology or world studies.
Engaging with sensitive topics
Students and teachers are encouraged to engage with exciting, stimulating and personally relevant topics
and issues that may be, at times, sensitive or personally challenging. Teachers should be aware of this and
provide guidance on how to engage with such topics in a responsible manner. Consideration should be
given to the personal, political and spiritual values of others.
Prior learning
Past experience shows that students will be able to study biology at SL successfully with no background in,
or previous knowledge of, science. Their approach to learning, characterized by the IB learner profile attributes, will be significant here.
However, for most students considering the study of biology at HL, while there is no intention to restrict
access, some previous exposure to formal science education would be necessary. Specific topic details are
not specified but students who have undertaken the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) or studied an
equivalent national science qualification or a school-based science course would be well prepared for an HL subject.
Links to the Middle Years Programme
The MYP sciences courses seek to promote skills and attitudes needed to apply scientific knowledge in
theoretical, experimental and authentic contexts. A strong foundation is established for DP sciences in
which learners will capitalize on—and continue advancing—their skills and attitudes to develop
knowledge and understanding commensurate with pre-university level science.
The MYP offers a framework for learning and teaching while maintaining flexibility with curriculum content.
The content in MYP sciences courses can therefore vary greatly from one school to another. Content in DP
sciences courses is more prescribed, and this is one of the main differences teachers will notice when comparing the two programmes.
Approaches to the teaching and learning of biology 18
Biology guide

=== Page 25 ===
A connected, conceptual curriculum where learning is inquiry-based and contextualized is the pedagogical
principle that underpins both programmes and indeed the entire IB continuum (International
Baccalaureate, 2019).
Conceptual learning focuses on organizing ideas and their interconnections. A conceptual approach is
encouraged in IB programmes because it promotes deep learning and facilitates the construction of further
knowledge. Conceptual understanding aids the application of knowledge in unfamiliar and novel contexts.
This skill is reflected in the aims and assessment objectives of both programmes.
Broad concepts frame MYP learning and teaching with the purpose of unifying ideas across subject areas.
Discipline-specific related concepts are intended to provide disciplinary depth (International Baccalaureate,
2014). Key and related concepts are not required in the DP, although some teachers may find that they wish
to continue developing a curriculum around them. In DP sciences, overarching concepts are manifested in
the course roadmaps and the NOS. DP sciences seek to highlight the interconnectedness of the course
understandings. The intention is to promote conceptual understanding and further the construction of learners’ knowledge networks.
Both MYP and DP teaching involve inquiry-based approaches, which foster a high degree of student
engagement, collaboration and interaction. The inquiry, design, experimental, analysis, evaluation and
communication skills encouraged by criteria B and C will serve students well as they prepare to undertake
the scientific investigation for the internal assessment (IA). In addition, MYP students will gain familiarity
with criterion-related assessment and the use of assessment criteria, which will further support their understanding of the DP sciences IA criteria.
IB programmes encourage the exploration of scientific principles in connection to local and global contexts.
Doing so helps students ground abstract concepts in more concrete local and global real-world situations
as well as cultivating international-mindedness (see the “Approaches to teaching” section in Diploma
Programme Approaches to teaching and learning website). Teachers should therefore weave opportunities for
contextualization into the curriculum. MYP sciences criterion D analyses the real-world application of
science. In the DP, sciences teachers are encouraged to frequently anchor their teaching in real-world
applications that are invoked throughout the course of the programme.
In addition to equipping students with scientific knowledge and skills, the MYP and DP sciences courses
share similar guiding principles that seek to develop in students the learner profile attributes.
Links to the Career-related Programme
In the Career-related Programme (CP), students study at least two DP subjects, a core consisting of four
components, as well as a career-related study, which is determined by the local context and aligned with
student needs. The CP has been designed to add value to students’ career-related studies. This provides the
context for the choice of DP courses. The biology course can assist CP students planning careers in a variety
of professional fields where, for example, a sound understanding of science skills is important. These
include environmental science, forensic science and healthcare. Biology helps students understand the
underlying science in the contemporary world, and it encourages the development of strong problem solving, critical thinking and ethical approaches that will assist students in the global workplace.
Approaches to the teaching and learning of biology 19
Biology guide

=== Page 26 ===
The collaborative sciences project is an interdisciplinary sciences project, providing a worthwhile challenge
to DP and CP students, addressing real-world problems that can be explored through the sciences. The
nature of the challenge should allow students to integrate factual, procedural and conceptual knowledge developed through the study of their disciplines.
Through the identification and research of complex issues, students can develop an understanding of how
interrelated systems, mechanisms and processes impact a problem. Students will then apply their collective
understanding to develop solution-focused strategies that address the issue. With a critical lens they will
evaluate and reflect on the inherent complexity of solving real-world problems.
Students will develop an understanding of the extent of global interconnectedness between regional,
national, and local communities, which will empower them to become active and engaged citizens of the
world. While addressing local and global issues, students will appreciate that the issues of today exist across
national boundaries and can only be solved through collective action and international cooperation.
The collaborative sciences project supports the development of students’ ATL skills, including
teambuilding, negotiation and leadership. It facilitates an appreciation of the environment, and the social
and ethical implications of science and technology.
Full details of the requirements are in the Collaborative sciences project guide.

biological organization (1–4) as listed in the syllabus roadmap.
Relevant theme and level of organization
The theme and level of organization show the conceptual lenses through which the topic can be viewed.
Recommended teaching time
The approximate number of recommended hours for teaching the topic are given together for standard level and higher level.
Additional hours for higher level are listed separately after the core teaching hours.
The recommended teaching time includes related experimental work, relevant material from “Skills in the
study of biology”, and assessment of learning. However, it excludes the time allocated for the experimental programme.
Guiding questions •
These are overarching questions that frame the topic and guide inquiry.
•
They help to link the material to the theme or to the level of biological organization.
Course content
Content listed under the SL and HL heading should be taught to both standard and higher level students.
Sections marked as additional higher level should be taught only to HL students.
Each topic is divided into numbered understandings which are in turn divided into a content statement
and guidance. Some understandings will also include reference to the application of skills and NOS.
A1.1.1—The content statement indicates the content to be taught.
Guidance provides clarifications to the scope and requirements of the content statement and applications of skills within the content statement.
Application of skills includes directed activities that connect the “understanding” with a skill.
The application directs an action such as drawing from observation or a micrograph, interpreting data,
utilizing statistics, or designing or carrying out an experiment.
The following are not examples of the application of skills: drawing a diagram unaided to illustrate
comprehension of a content statement, and learning examples to support the content statement.
Nature of science (NOS) relates the content statement to the overarching theme of NOS.
Linking questions •
Two linking questions are provided at the end of each topic. The questions encourage students to
recognize that the topics can be viewed through lenses other than a single theme or level of biological

A1.1.1—Water as the medium for life
Students should appreciate that the first cells originated in water and that water remains the medium in which most processes of life occur.
A1.1.2—Hydrogen bonds as a consequence of the polar covalent bonds within water molecules
Students should understand that polarity of covalent bonding within water molecules is due to unequal
sharing of electrons and that hydrogen bonding due to this polarity occurs between water molecules.

SL and HL
A1.2.1—DNA as the genetic material of all living organisms
Some viruses use RNA as their genetic material but viruses are not considered to be living.
A1.2.2—Components of a nucleotide
In diagrams of nucleotides use circles, pentagons and rectangles to represent relative positions of phosphates, pentose sugars and bases.
Syllabus content 35
Biology guide

=== Page 42 ===
A1.2.3—Sugar–phosphate bonding and the sugar–phosphate “backbone” of DNA and RNA
Sugar–phosphate bonding makes a continuous chain of covalently bonded atoms in each strand of DNA
or RNA nucleotides, which forms a strong “backbone” in the molecule.
A1.2.4—Bases in each nucleic acid that form the basis of a code
Students should know the names of the nitrogenous bases.
A1.2.5—RNA as a polymer formed by condensation of nucleotide monomers
Students should be able to draw and recognize diagrams of the structure of single nucleotides and RNA polymers.
A1.2.6—DNA as a double helix made of two antiparallel strands of nucleotides with two strands linked by hydrogen bonding between complementary base pairs
In diagrams of DNA structure, students should draw the two strands antiparallel, but are not required to
draw the helical shape. Students should show adenine (A) paired with thymine (T), and guanine (G) paired
with cytosine (C). Students are not required to memorize the relative lengths of the purine and pyrimidine bases, or the numbers of hydrogen bonds.
Syllabus content 36
Biology guide

=== Page 43 ===
A1.2.7—Differences between DNA and RNA
Include the number of strands present, the types of nitrogenous bases and the type of pentose sugar.
Students should be able to sketch the difference between ribose and deoxyribose. Students should be familiar with examples of nucleic acids.
A1.2.8—Role of complementary base pairing in allowing genetic information to be replicated and expressed
Students should understand that complementarity is based on hydrogen bonding.
A1.2.9—Diversity of possible DNA base sequences and the limitless capacity of DNA for storing information
Explain that diversity by any length of DNA molecule and any base sequence is possible. Emphasize the
enormous capacity of DNA for storing data with great economy.
A1.2.10—Conservation of the genetic code across all life forms as evidence of universal common ancestry
Students are not required to memorize any specific examples.
Additional higher level
A1.2.11—Directionality of RNA and DNA
Include 5' to 3' linkages in the sugar–phosphate backbone and their significance for replication, transcription and translation.
A1.2.12—Purine-to-pyrimidine bonding as a component of DNA helix stability
Adenine–thymine (A–T) and cytosine–guanine (C–G) pairs have equal length, so the DNA helix has the
same three-dimensional structure, regardless of the base sequence.
A1.2.13—Structure of a nucleosome
Limit to a DNA molecule wrapped around a core of eight histone proteins held together by an additional histone protein attached to linker DNA.
Application of skills: Students are required to use molecular visualization software to study the
association between the proteins and DNA within a nucleosome.
A1.2.14—Evidence from the Hershey–Chase experiment for DNA as the genetic material
Syllabus content 37
Biology guide

=== Page 44 ===
Students should understand how the results of the experiment support the conclusion that DNA is the genetic material.
NOS: Students should appreciate that technological developments can open up new possibilities for
experiments. When radioisotopes were made available to scientists as research tools, the Hershey–Chase experiment became possible.
A1.2.15—Chargaff’s data on the relative amounts of pyrimidine and purine bases across diverse life forms
NOS: Students should understand how the “problem of induction” is addressed by the “certainty of
falsification”. In this case, Chargaff’s data falsified the tetranucleotide hypothesis that there was a repeating sequence of the four bases in DNA.

What intermediate stages could there have been between non-living matter and the first living cells?
Additional higher level
Note: There is no SL content in A2.1.
A2.1.1—Conditions on early Earth and the pre-biotic formation of carbon compounds
Include the lack of free oxygen and therefore ozone, higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and
methane, resulting in higher temperatures and ultraviolet light penetration. The conditions may have
caused a variety of carbon compounds to form spontaneously by chemical processes that do not now occur.
A2.1.2—Cells as the smallest units of self-sustaining life
Discuss the differences between something that is living and something that is non-living. Include reasons that viruses are considered to be non-living.
A2.1.3—Challenge of explaining the spontaneous origin of cells
Cells are highly complex structures that can currently only be produced by division of pre-existing cells.
Students should be aware that catalysis, self-replication of molecules, self-assembly and the emergence of
compartmentalization were necessary requirements for the evolution of the first cells.
NOS: Students should appreciate that claims in science, including hypotheses and theories, must be
testable. In some cases, scientists have to struggle with hypotheses that are difficult to test. In this case the
exact conditions on pre-biotic Earth cannot be replicated and the first protocells did not fossilize.
A2.1.4—Evidence for the origin of carbon compounds
Evaluate the Miller–Urey experiment.

A2.1.5—Spontaneous formation of vesicles by coalescence of fatty acids into spherical bilayers
Formation of a membrane-bound compartment is needed to allow internal chemistry to become different from that outside the compartment.
A2.1.6—RNA as a presumed first genetic material
RNA can be replicated and has some catalytic activity so it may have acted initially as both the genetic
material and the enzymes of the earliest cells. Ribozymes in the ribosome are still used to catalyse peptide bond formation during protein synthesis.
A2.1.7—Evidence for a last universal common ancestor
Include the universal genetic code and shared genes across all organisms. Include the likelihood of other
forms of life having evolved but becoming extinct due to competition from the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) and descendants of LUCA.
A2.1.8—Approaches used to estimate dates of the first living cells and the last universal common ancestor
Students should develop an appreciation of the immense length of time over which life has been evolving on Earth.
A2.1.9—Evidence for the evolution of the last universal common ancestor in the vicinity of hydrothermal vents
Include fossilized evidence of life from ancient seafloor hydrothermal vent precipitates and evidence of conserved sequences from genomic analysis.

A2.2.1—Cells as the basic structural unit of all living organisms
NOS: Students should be aware that deductive reason can be used to generate predictions from theories.
Based on cell theory, a newly discovered organism can be predicted to consist of one or more cells.
A2.2.2—Microscopy skills
Application of skills: Students should have experience of making temporary mounts of cells and tissues,
staining, measuring sizes using an eyepiece graticule, focusing with coarse and fine adjustments,
calculating actual size and magnification, producing a scale bar and taking photographs.
Syllabus content 39
Biology guide

=== Page 46 ===
NOS: Students should appreciate that measurement using instruments is a form of quantitative observation.
A2.2.3—Developments in microscopy
Include the advantages of electron microscopy, freeze fracture, cryogenic electron microscopy, and the
use of fluorescent stains and immunofluorescence in light microscopy.
A2.2.4—Structures common to cells in all living organisms
Typical cells have DNA as genetic material and a cytoplasm composed mainly of water, which is enclosed
by a plasma membrane composed of lipids. Students should understand the reasons for these structures.
A2.2.5—Prokaryote cell structure
Include these cell components: cell wall, plasma membrane, cytoplasm, naked DNA in a loop and 70S
ribosomes. The type of prokaryotic cell structure required is that of Gram-positive eubacteria such as
Bacillus and Staphylococcus. Students should appreciate that prokaryote cell structure varies. However,
students are not required to know details of the variations such as the lack of cell walls in phytoplasmas and mycoplasmas.
A2.2.6—Eukaryote cell structure
Students should be familiar with features common to eukaryote cells: a plasma membrane enclosing a
compartmentalized cytoplasm with 80S ribosomes; a nucleus with chromosomes made of DNA bound to
histones, contained in a double membrane with pores; membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles
including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and a variety of vesicles or vacuoles
including lysosomes; and a cytoskeleton of microtubules and microfilaments.
A2.2.7—Processes of life in unicellular organisms
Include these functions: homeostasis, metabolism, nutrition, movement, excretion, growth, response to stimuli and reproduction.
A2.2.8—Differences in eukaryotic cell structure between animals, fungi and plants
Include presence and composition of cell walls, differences in size and function of vacuoles, presence of
chloroplasts and other plastids, and presence of centrioles, cilia and flagella.
A2.2.9—Atypical cell structure in eukaryotes
Use numbers of nuclei to illustrate one type of atypical cell structure in aseptate fungal hyphae, skeletal
muscle, red blood cells and phloem sieve tube elements.
A2.2.10—Cell types and cell structures viewed in light and electron micrographs
Application of skills: Students should be able to identify cells in light and electron micrographs as
prokaryote, plant or animal. In electron micrographs, students should be able to identify these structures:
nucleoid region, prokaryotic cell wall, nucleus, mitochondrion, chloroplast, sap vacuole, Golgi apparatus,
rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, chromosomes, ribosomes, cell wall, plasma membrane and microvilli.
A2.2.11—Drawing and annotation based on electron micrographs
Application of skills: Students should be able to draw and annotate diagrams of organelles (nucleus,
mitochondria, chloroplasts, sap vacuole, Golgi apparatus, rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Syllabus content 40

chromosomes) as well as other cell structures (cell wall, plasma membrane, secretory vesicles and
microvilli) shown in electron micrographs. Students are required to include the functions in their annotations.
Additional higher level
A2.2.12—Origin of eukaryotic cells by endosymbiosis
Evidence suggests that all eukaryotes evolved from a common unicellular ancestor that had a nucleus and
reproduced sexually. Mitochondria then evolved by endosymbiosis. In some eukaryotes, chloroplasts
subsequently also had an endosymbiotic origin. Evidence should include the presence in mitochondria
and chloroplasts of 70S ribosomes, naked circular DNA and the ability to replicate.
NOS: Students should recognize that the strength of a theory comes from the observations the theory
explains and the predictions it supports. A wide range of observations are accounted for by the theory of endosymbiosis.
A2.2.13—Cell differentiation as the process for developing specialized tissues in multicellular organisms
Students should be aware that the basis for differentiation is different patterns of gene expression often triggered by changes in the environment.
A2.2.14—Evolution of multicellularity
Students should be aware that multicellularity has evolved repeatedly. Many fungi and eukaryotic algae
and all plants and animals are multicellular. Multicellularity has the advantages of allowing larger body size and cell specialization.

Note: There is no SL content in A2.3.
A2.3.1—Structural features common to viruses
Relatively few features are shared by all viruses: small, fixed size; nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) as genetic
material; a capsid made of protein; no cytoplasm; and few or no enzymes.
A2.3.2—Diversity of structure in viruses
Students should understand that viruses are highly diverse in their shape and structure. Genetic material
may be RNA or DNA, which can be either single- or double-stranded. Some viruses are enveloped in host
Syllabus content 41
Biology guide

=== Page 48 ===
cell membrane and others are not enveloped. Virus examples include bacteriophage lambda, coronaviruses and HIV.
A2.3.3—Lytic cycle of a virus
Students should appreciate that viruses rely on a host cell for energy supply, nutrition, protein synthesis
and other life functions. Use bacteriophage lambda as an example of the phases in a lytic cycle.
A.2.3.4—Lysogenic cycle of a virus
Use bacteriophage lambda as an example.
A2.3.5—Evidence for several origins of viruses from other organisms
The diversity of viruses suggests several possible origins. Viruses share an extreme form of obligate
parasitism as a mode of existence, so the structural features that they have in common could be regarded
as convergent evolution. The genetic code is shared between viruses and living organisms.
A2.3.6—Rapid evolution in viruses
Include reasons for very rapid rates of evolution in some viruses. Use two examples of rapid evolution:
evolution of influenza viruses and of HIV. Consider the consequences for treating diseases caused by rapidly evolving viruses.
Linking questions •

Unity and diversity—Organisms
Standard level and higher level: 3 hours
Additional higher level: 2 hours
Guiding questions •
What is a species?
•
What patterns are seen in the diversity of genomes within and between species?
SL and HL
A3.1.1—Variation between organisms as a defining feature of life
Students should understand that no two individuals are identical in all their traits. The patterns of variation
are complex and are the basis for naming and classifying organisms.
A3.1.2—Species as groups of organisms with shared traits
This is the original morphological concept of the species as used by Linnaeus.
A3.1.3—Binomial system for naming organisms
Syllabus content 42
Biology guide

=== Page 49 ===
Students should know that the first part of the name identifies the genus, with the second part of the
name distinguishing the species. Species in the same genus have similar traits. The genus name is given an
initial capital letter but the species name is lowercase.
A3.1.4—Biological species concept
According to the biological species concept, a species is a group of organisms that can breed and produce
fertile offspring. Include possible challenges associated with this definition of a species and that competing species definitions exist.
A3.1.5—Difficulties distinguishing between populations and species due to divergence of non interbreeding populations during speciation
Students should understand that speciation is the splitting of one species into two or more. It usually
happens gradually rather than by a single act, with populations becoming more and more different in
their traits. It can therefore be an arbitrary decision whether two populations are regarded as the same or different species.
A3.1.6—Diversity in chromosome numbers of plant and animal species
Students should know in general that diversity exists. As an example, students should know that humans
have 46 chromosomes and chimpanzees have 48. Students are not required to know other specific
chromosome numbers but should appreciate that diploid cells have an even number of chromosomes.
A3.1.7—Karyotyping and karyograms
Application of skills: Students should be able to classify chromosomes by banding patterns, length and
centromere position. Students should evaluate the evidence for the hypothesis that chromosome 2 in
humans arose from the fusion of chromosomes 12 and 13 with a shared primate ancestor.
NOS: Students should be able to distinguish between testable hypotheses such as the origin of chromosome 2 and non-testable statements.
A3.1.8—Unity and diversity of genomes within species
Students should understand that the genome is all the genetic information of an organism. Organisms in
the same species share most of their genome but variations such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms give some diversity.
A3.1.9—Diversity of eukaryote genomes
Genomes vary in overall size, which is determined by the total amount of DNA. Genomes also vary in base
sequence. Variation between species is much larger than variation within a species.
A3.1.10—Comparison of genome sizes
Application of skills: Students should extract information about genome size for different taxonomic
groups from a database to compare genome size to organism complexity.
A3.1.11—Current and potential future uses of whole genome sequencing
Include the increasing speed and decreasing costs. For current uses, include research into evolutionary
relationships and for potential future uses, include personalized medicine.
Syllabus content 43
Biology guide

=== Page 50 ===
Additional higher level
A3.1.12—Difficulties applying the biological species concept to asexually reproducing species and to bacteria that have horizontal gene transfer
The biological species concept does not work well with groups of organisms that do not breed sexually or
where genes can be transferred from one species to another.
A3.1.13—Chromosome number as a shared trait within a species
Cross-breeding between closely related species is unlikely to produce fertile offspring if parent chromosome numbers are different.
A3.1.14—Engagement with local plant or animal species to develop a dichotomous key
Application of skills: Students should engage with local plant or animal species to develop a dichotomous key.
A3.1.15—Identification of species from environmental DNA in a habitat using barcodes
Using barcodes and environmental DNA allows the biodiversity of habitats to be investigated rapidly.

Guiding questions •
What tools are used to classify organisms into taxonomic groups?
•
How do cladistic methods differ from traditional taxonomic methods?
Additional higher level
Note: There is no SL content in A3.2.
A3.2.1—Need for classification of organisms
Classification is needed because of the immense diversity of species. After classification is completed, a broad range of further study is facilitated.
A3.2.2—Difficulties classifying organisms into the traditional hierarchy of taxa
The traditional hierarchy of kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species does not always
correspond to patterns of divergence generated by evolution.
NOS: A fixed ranking of taxa (kingdom, phylum and so on) is arbitrary because it does not reflect the
gradation of variation. Cladistics offers an alternative approach to classification using unranked clades.
This is an example of the paradigm shift that sometimes occurs in scientific theories.
A3.2.3—Advantages of classification corresponding to evolutionary relationships
Syllabus content 44
Biology guide

=== Page 51 ===
The ideal classification follows evolutionary relationships, so all the members of a taxonomic group have
evolved from a common ancestor. Characteristics of organisms within such a group can be predicted because they are shared within a clade.
A3.2.4—Clades as groups of organisms with common ancestry and shared characteristics
The most objective evidence for placing organisms in the same clade comes from base sequences of
genes or amino acid sequences of proteins. Morphological traits can be used to assign organisms to clades.
A3.2.5—Gradual accumulation of sequence differences as the basis for estimates of when clades diverged from a common ancestor
This method of estimating times is known as the “molecular clock”. The molecular clock can only give
estimates because mutation rates are affected by the length of the generation time, the size of a
population, the intensity of selective pressure and other factors.
A3.2.6—Base sequences of genes or amino acid sequences of proteins as the basis for constructing cladograms
Examples can be simple and based on sample data to illustrate the tool.
NOS: Students should recognize that different criteria for judgement can lead to different hypotheses.
Here, parsimony analysis is used to select the most probable cladogram, in which observed sequence
variation between clades is accounted for with the smallest number of sequence changes.
A3.2.7—Analysing cladograms
Students should be able to deduce evolutionary relationships, common ancestors and clades from a
cladogram. They should understand the terms “root”, “node” and “terminal branch” and also that a node represents a hypothetical common ancestor.
A3.2.8—Using cladistics to investigate whether the classification of groups corresponds to evolutionary relationships
A case study of transfer of plant species between families could be used to develop understanding, for
example the reclassification of the figwort family (Scrophulariaceae). However, students are not required to memorize the details of the case study.
NOS: Students should appreciate that theories and other scientific knowledge claims may eventually be
falsified. In this example, similarities in morphology due to convergent evolution rather than common
ancestry suggested a classification that by cladistics has been shown to be false.
Note: When students are referring to organisms in an examination, either the common name or the scientific name is acceptable.
A3.2.9—Classification of all organisms into three domains using evidence from rRNA base sequences
This is the revolutionary reclassification with an extra taxonomic level above kingdoms that was proposed in 1977.

Unity and diversity—Ecosystems
Standard level and higher level: 4 hours
Additional higher level: 1 hour
Guiding questions •
What is the evidence for evolution?
•
How do analogous and homologous structures exemplify commonality and diversity?
SL and HL
A4.1.1—Evolution as change in the heritable characteristics of a population
This definition helps to distinguish Darwinian evolution from Lamarckism. Acquired changes that are not genetic in origin are not regarded as evolution.
NOS: The theory of evolution by natural selection predicts and explains a broad range of observations and
is unlikely ever to be falsified. However, the nature of science makes it impossible to formally prove that it
is true by correspondence. It is a pragmatic truth and is therefore referred to as a theory, despite all the supporting evidence.
A4.1.2—Evidence for evolution from base sequences in DNA or RNA and amino acid sequences in proteins
Sequence data gives powerful evidence of common ancestry.
A4.1.3—Evidence for evolution from selective breeding of domesticated animals and crop plants
Variation between different domesticated animal breeds and varieties of crop plant, and between them
and the original wild species, shows how rapidly evolutionary changes can occur.
A4.1.4—Evidence for evolution from homologous structures
Include the example of pentadactyl limbs.
A4.1.5—Convergent evolution as the origin of analogous structures
Students should understand that analogous structures have the same function but different evolutionary
origins. Students should know at least one example of analogous features.
A4.1.6—Speciation by splitting of pre-existing species
Students should appreciate that this is the only way in which new species have appeared. Students should
also understand that speciation increases the total number of species on Earth, and extinction decreases it.
Students should also understand that gradual evolutionary change in a species is not speciation.
A4.1.7—Roles of reproductive isolation and differential selection in speciation
Include geographical isolation as a means of achieving reproductive isolation. Use the separation of
bonobos and common chimpanzees by the Congo River as a specific example of divergence due to differential selection.
Additional higher level
A4.1.8—Differences and similarities between sympatric and allopatric speciation
Syllabus content 46
Biology guide

=== Page 53 ===
Students should understand that reproductive isolation can be geographic, behavioural or temporal.
A4.1.9—Adaptive radiation as a source of biodiversity
Adaptive radiation allows closely related species to coexist without competing, thereby increasing
biodiversity in ecosystems where there are vacant niches.
A4.1.10—Barriers to hybridization and sterility of interspecific hybrids as mechanisms for of preventing the mixing of alleles between species
Courtship behaviour often prevents hybridization in animal species. A mule is an example of a sterile hybrid.
A4.1.11—Abrupt speciation in plants by hybridization and polyploidy
Use knotweed or smartweed (genus Persicaria) as an example because it contains many species that have been formed by these processes.
Note: When students are referring to organisms in an examination, either the common name or the scientific name is acceptable.

SL and HL
A4.2.1—Biodiversity as the variety of life in all its forms, levels and combinations
Include ecosystem diversity, species diversity and genetic diversity.
A4.2.2—Comparisons between current number of species on Earth and past levels of biodiversity
Millions of species have been discovered, named and described but there are many more species to be
discovered. Evidence from fossils suggests that there are currently more species alive on Earth today than at any time in the past.
NOS: Classification is an example of pattern recognition but the same observations can be classified in
different ways. For example, “splitters” recognize more species than “lumpers” in a taxonomic group.
A4.2.3—Causes of anthropogenic species extinction
This should be a study of the causes of the current sixth mass extinction, rather than of non-anthropogenic causes of previous mass extinctions.
Syllabus content 47
Biology guide

=== Page 54 ===
To give a range of causes, carry out three or more brief case studies of species extinction: North Island
giant moas (Dinornis novaezealandiae) should be used as an example of the loss of terrestrial megafauna,
Caribbean monk seals (Neomonachus tropicalis) should be used as an example of the loss of a marine
species, and include one other species that has gone extinct from an area that is familiar to students.
Note: When students are referring to organisms in an examination, either the common name or the scientific name is acceptable.
A4.2.4—Causes of ecosystem loss
Students should study only causes that are directly or indirectly anthropogenic. Include two case studies
of ecosystem loss. One should be the loss of mixed dipterocarp forest in Southeast Asia, and the other
should, if possible, be of a lost ecosystem from an area that is familiar to students.
A4.2.5—Evidence for a biodiversity crisis
Evidence can be drawn from Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
Services reports and other sources. Results from reliable surveys of biodiversity in a wide range of habitats
around the world are required. Students should understand that surveys need to be repeated to provide
evidence of change in species richness and evenness. Note that there are opportunities for contributions
from both expert scientists and citizen scientists.
NOS: To be verifiable, evidence usually has to come from a published source, which has been peer reviewed and allows methodology to be checked. Data recorded by citizens rather than scientists brings
not only benefits but also unique methodological concerns.
A4.2.6—Causes of the current biodiversity crisis
Include human population growth as an overarching cause, together with these specific causes: hunting
and other forms of over-exploitation; urbanization; deforestation and clearance of land for agriculture with
consequent loss of natural habitat; pollution and spread of pests, diseases and invasive alien species due to global transport.
A4.2.7—Need for several approaches to conservation of biodiversity
No single approach by itself is sufficient, and different species require different measures. Include in situ
conservation of species in natural habitats, management of nature reserves, rewilding and reclamation of
degraded ecosystems, ex situ conservation in zoos and botanic gardens and storage of germ plasm in seed or tissue banks.
A4.2.8—Selection of evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered species for conservation prioritization in the EDGE of Existence programme
Students should understand the rationale behind focusing conservation efforts on evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered species (EDGE).
NOS: Issues such as which species should be prioritized for conservation efforts have complex ethical,
environmental, political, social, cultural and economic implications and therefore need to be debated.

Additional higher level
B2.1.11—Relationships between fatty acid composition of lipid bilayers and their fluidity
Unsaturated fatty acids in lipid bilayers have lower melting points, so membranes are fluid and therefore
flexible at temperatures experienced by a cell. Saturated fatty acids have higher melting points and make
membranes stronger at higher temperatures. Students should be familiar with an example of adaptations in membrane composition in relation to habitat.
B2.1.12—Cholesterol and membrane fluidity in animal cells
Students should understand the position of cholesterol molecules in membranes and also that cholesterol
acts as a modulator (adjustor) of membrane fluidity, stabilizing membranes at higher temperatures and preventing stiffening at lower temperatures.

of materials across a cell surface depends on its area whereas the need for exchange depends on cell volume.
NOS: Students should recognize that models are simplified versions of complex systems. In this case,
surface-area-to-volume relationship can be modelled using cubes of different side lengths. Although the
cubes have a simpler shape than real organisms, scale factors operate in the same way.

correlation could provide evidence against a hypothesis, but even strong correlations such as that
between saturated fat intake and coronary heart disease do not prove a causal link.
B3.2.7—Transport of water from roots to leaves during transpiration
Students should understand that loss of water by transpiration from cell walls in leaf cells causes water to
be drawn out of xylem vessels and through cell walls by capillary action, generating tension (negative
pressure potentials). It is this tension that draws water up in the xylem. Cohesion ensures a continuous column of water.
B3.2.8—Adaptations of xylem vessels for transport of water
Include the lack of cell contents and incomplete or absent end walls for unimpeded flow, lignified walls to

Application of skills: Students should understand the sequence of events in the left side of the heart that
follow the initiation of the heartbeat by the sinoatrial node (the “pacemaker”). Students should be able to
interpret systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements from data and graphs.
B3.2.17—Generation of root pressure in xylem vessels by active transport of mineral ions
Root pressure is positive pressure potential, generated to cause water movement in roots and stems when
transport in xylem due to transpiration is insufficient, for example when high humidity prevents
transpiration or in spring, before leaves on deciduous plants have opened.

Students should measure joint angles using computer analysis of images or a goniometer.
B3.3.8—Internal and external intercostal muscles as an example of antagonistic muscle action to facilitate internal body movements
Students should appreciate that the different orientations of muscle fibres in the internal and external
layers of intercostal muscles mean that they move the ribcage in opposite directions and that, when one
of these layers contracts, it stretches the other, storing potential energy in the sarcomere protein titin.
B3.3.9—Reasons for locomotion
Include foraging for food, escaping from danger, searching for a mate and migration, with at least one example of each.

Calvin cycle and mineral nutrients
Students are not required to know details of metabolic pathways, but students should understand that all

kidney and “epinephrine” comes from old Greek epi = above and nephros = kidney, respectively. Unusually,
these two terms persist in common use in different parts of the world.
C2.1.11—Transmembrane receptors with tyrosine kinase activity

Application of skills: Students should be able to describe negative and positive correlations and apply
correlation coefficients as a mathematical tool to determine the strength of these correlations. Students
should also be able to apply the coefficient of determination (R2) to evaluate the degree to which variation
in the independent variable explains the variation in the dependent variable. For example, conduction
speed of nerve impulses is negatively correlated with animal size, but positively correlated with axon diameter.

Students should know that these nerve endings have channels for positively charged ions, which open in
response to a stimulus such as high temperature, acid, or certain chemicals such as capsaicin in chilli
peppers. Entry of positively charged ions causes the threshold potential to be reached and nerve impulses
then pass through the neurons to the brain, where pain is perceived.
C2.2.16—Consciousness as a property that emerges from the interaction of individual neurons in the brain
Emergent properties such as consciousness are another example of the consequences of interaction.

Syllabus content 77
Biology guide

=== Page 84 ===
Auxin can diffuse freely into plant cells but not out of them. Auxin efflux carriers can be positioned in a cell
membrane on one side of the cell. If all cells coordinate to concentrate these carriers on the same side,
auxin is actively transported from cell to cell through the plant tissue and becomes concentrated in part of the plant.
C3.1.21—Promotion of cell growth by auxin
Include auxin’s promotion of hydrogen ion secretion into the apoplast, acidifying the cell wall and thus
loosening cross links between cellulose molecules and facilitating cell elongation. Concentration gradients
of auxin cause the differences in growth rate needed for phototropism.
C3.1.22—Interactions between auxin and cytokinin as a means of regulating root and shoot growth

C3.2.1—Pathogens as the cause of infectious diseases
Students should understand that a broad range of disease-causing organisms can infect humans. A
disease-causing organism is known as a pathogen, although typically the term is reserved for viruses,
bacteria, fungi and protists. Archaea are not known to cause any diseases in humans.
NOS: Students should be aware that careful observation can lead to important progress. For example,
careful observations during 19th-century epidemics of childbed fever (due to an infection after childbirth)
in Vienna and cholera in London led to breakthroughs in the control of infectious disease.
C3.2.2—Skin and mucous membranes as a primary defence
The skin acts as both a physical and chemical barrier to pathogens. Students are not required to draw or label diagrams of skin.
C3.2.3—Sealing of cuts in skin by blood clotting
Syllabus content 78
Biology guide

=== Page 85 ===
Include release of clotting factors from platelets and the subsequent cascade pathway that results in rapid
conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin by thrombin and trapping of erythrocytes to form a clot. No further details are required.
C3.2.4—Differences between the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system
Include the idea that the innate system responds to broad categories of pathogen and does not change
during an organism’s life whereas the adaptive system responds in a specific way to particular pathogens
and builds up a memory of pathogens encountered, so the immune response becomes more effective.
Students are not required to know any components of the innate immune system other than phagocytes.
C3.2.5—Infection control by phagocytes
Include amoeboid movement from blood to sites of infection, where phagocytes recognize pathogens,
engulf them by endocytosis and digest them using enzymes from lysosomes.
C3.2.6—Lymphocytes as cells in the adaptive immune system that cooperate to produce antibodies
Students should understand that lymphocytes both circulate in the blood and are contained in lymph
nodes. They should appreciate that an individual has a very large number of B-lymphocytes that each make a specific type of antibody.
C3.2.7—Antigens as recognition molecules that trigger antibody production
Students should appreciate that most antigens are glycoproteins or other proteins and that they are
usually located on the outer surfaces of pathogens. Antigens on the surface of erythrocytes may stimulate
antibody production if transfused into a person with a different blood group.
C3.2.8—Activation of B-lymphocytes by helper T-lymphocytes
Students should understand that there are antigen-specific B-cells and helper T-cells. B-cells produce
antibodies and become memory cells only when they have been activated. Activation requires both direct
interaction with the specific antigen and contact with a helper T-cell that has also become activated by the same type of antigen.
C3.2.9—Multiplication of activated B-lymphocytes to form clones of antibody-secreting plasma cells
There are relatively small numbers of B-cells that respond to a specific antigen. To produce sufficient
quantities of antibody, activated B-cells first divide by mitosis to produce large numbers of plasma B-cells
that are capable of producing the same type of antibody.
C3.2.10—Immunity as a consequence of retaining memory cells
Students should understand that immunity is the ability to eliminate an infectious disease from the body.
It is due to the long-term survival of lymphocytes that are capable of making the specific antibodies
needed to fight the infection. These are memory cells.
C3.2.11—Transmission of HIV in body fluids
Include examples of the mechanisms of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) transmission.
C3.2.12—Infection of lymphocytes by HIV with AIDS as a consequence
Students should understand that only certain types of lymphocyte are infected and killed, but that a
reduction in these lymphocytes limits the ability to produce antibodies and fight opportunistic infections.
Syllabus content 79

C3.2.13—Antibiotics as chemicals that block processes occurring in bacteria but not in eukaryotic cells
Include reasons that antibiotics fail to control infection with viruses.
C3.2.14—Evolution of resistance to several antibiotics in strains of pathogenic bacteria
Students should understand that careful use of antibiotics is necessary to slow the emergence of multiresistant bacteria.
NOS: Students should recognize that the development of new techniques can lead to new avenues of
research; for example, the recent technique of searching chemical libraries is yielding new antibiotics.
C3.2.15—Zoonoses as infectious diseases that can transfer from other species to humans
Illustrate the prevalence of zoonoses as infectious diseases in humans and their varied modes of infection
with several examples including tuberculosis, rabies and Japanese encephalitis. Include COVID-19 as an
infectious disease that has recently transferred from another species, with profound consequences for humans.
C3.2.16—Vaccines and immunization
Students should understand that vaccines contain antigens, or nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) with sequences
that code for antigens, and that they stimulate the development of immunity to a specific pathogen without causing the disease.
C3.2.17—Herd immunity and the prevention of epidemics
Students should understand how members of a population are interdependent in building herd
immunity. If a sufficient percentage of a population is immune to a disease, transmission is greatly impeded.
NOS: Scientists publish their research so that other scientists can evaluate it. The media often report on
the research while evaluation is still happening, and consumers need to be aware of this. Vaccines are
tested rigorously and the risks of side effects are minimal but not nil. The distinction between pragmatic truths and certainty is poorly understood.
C3.2.18—Evaluation of data related to the COVID-19 pandemic
Application of skills: Students should have the opportunity to calculate both percentage difference and percentage change.
Note: There is no additional higher level content in C3.2.

Syllabus content 80
Biology guide

=== Page 87 ===
SL and HL
C4.1.1—Populations as interacting groups of organisms of the same species living in an area
Students should understand that members of a population normally breed and that reproductive isolation
is used to distinguish one population of a species from another.
C4.1.2—Estimation of population size by random sampling
Students should understand reasons for estimating population size, rather than counting every individual,
and the need for randomness in sampling procedures.
NOS: Students should be aware that random sampling, instead of measuring an entire population,
inevitably results in sampling error. In this case the difference between the estimate of population size and
the true size of the whole population is the sampling error.
C4.1.3—Random quadrat sampling to estimate population size for sessile organisms
Both sessile animals and plants, where the numbers of individuals can be counted, are suitable.
Application of skills: Students should understand what is indicated by the standard deviation of a mean.
Students do not need to memorize the formula used to calculate this. In this example, the standard
deviation of the mean number of individuals per quadrat could be determined using a calculator to give a
measure of the variation and how evenly the population is spread.
C4.1.4—Capture–mark–release–recapture and the Lincoln index to estimate population size for motile organisms
Application of skills: Students should use the Lincoln index to estimate population size.
Population size estimate = M × N
R   , where M  is the number of individuals caught and marked initially, N  is
the total number of individuals recaptured and R  is the number of marked individuals recaptured.
Students should understand the assumptions made when using this method.
C4.1.5—Carrying capacity and competition for limited resources
A simple definition of carrying capacity is sufficient, with some examples of resources that may limit carrying capacity.
C4.1.6—Negative feedback control of population size by density-dependent factors
Numbers of individuals in a population may fluctuate due to density-independent factors, but density dependent factors tend to push the population back towards the carrying capacity. In addition to
competition for limited resources, include the increased risk of predation and the transfer of pathogens or pests in dense populations.
C4.1.7—Population growth curves
Students should study at least one case study in an ecosystem. Students should understand reasons for
exponential growth in the initial phases. A lag phase is not expected as a part of sigmoid population growth.
NOS: The curve represents an idealized graphical model. Students should recognize that models are often simplifications of complex systems.
Application of skills: Students should test the growth of a population against the model of exponential
growth using a graph with a logarithmic scale for size of population on the vertical axis and a non logarithmic scale for time on the horizontal axis.
Syllabus content 81
Biology guide

C4.1.8—Modelling of the sigmoid population growth curve
Application of skills: Students should collect data regarding population growth. Yeast and duckweed are
recommended but other organisms that proliferate under experimental conditions could be used.
C4.1.9—Competition versus cooperation in intraspecific relationships
Include reasons for intraspecific competition within a population. Also include a range of real examples of competition and cooperation.
C4.1.10—A community as all of the interacting organisms in an ecosystem
Communities comprise all the populations in an area including plants, animals, fungi and bacteria.
C4.1.11—Herbivory, predation, interspecific competition, mutualism, parasitism and pathogenicity as
categories of interspecific relationship within communities
Include each type of ecological interaction using at least one example.
C4.1.12—Mutualism as an interspecific relationship that benefits both species
Include these examples: root nodules in Fabaceae (legume family), mycorrhizae in Orchidaceae (orchid
family) and zooxanthellae in hard corals. In each case include the benefits to both organisms.
Note: When students are referring to organisms in an examination, either the common name or the scientific name is acceptable.
C4.1.13—Resource competition between endemic and invasive species
Choose one local example to illustrate competitive advantage over endemic species in resource
acquisition as the basis for an introduced species becoming invasive.
C4.1.14—Tests for interspecific competition
Interspecific competition is indicated but not proven if one species is more successful in the absence of
another. Students should appreciate the range of possible approaches to research: laboratory
experiments, field observations by random sampling and field manipulation by removal of one species.
NOS: Students should recognize that hypotheses can be tested by both experiments and observations
and should understand the difference between them.
C4.1.15—Use of the chi-squared test for association between two species
Application of skills: Students should be able to apply chi-squared tests on the presence/absence of two
species in several sampling sites, exploring the differences or similarities in distribution. This may provide evidence for interspecific competition.
C4.1.16—Predator–prey relationships as an example of density-dependent control of animal populations
Include a real case study.
C4.1.17—Top-down and bottom-up control of populations in communities
Students should understand that both of these types of control are possible, but one or the other is likely to be dominant in a community.

Students should know that in closed systems only energy is able to pass in and out.
C4.2.2—Sunlight as the principal source of energy that sustains most ecosystems
Include exceptions such as ecosystems in caves and below the levels of light penetration in oceans.
NOS: Laws in science are generalized principles, or rules of thumb, formulated to describe patterns
observed in nature. Unlike theories, they do not offer explanations, but describe phenomena. Like
theories, they can be used to make predictions. Students should be able to outline the features of useful generalizations.
C4.2.3—Flow of chemical energy through food chains
Students should appreciate that chemical energy passes to a consumer as it feeds on an organism that is the previous stage in a food chain.
C4.2.4—Construction of food chains and food webs to represent feeding relationships in a community
Represent relationships in a local community if possible. Arrows indicate the direction of transfer of energy and biomass.
C4.2.5—Supply of energy to decomposers as carbon compounds in organic matter coming from dead organisms
Include faeces, dead parts of organisms and dead whole organisms.
C4.2.6—Autotrophs as organisms that use external energy sources to synthesize carbon compounds from simple inorganic substances

Syllabus content 83
Biology guide

=== Page 90 ===
C4.2.7—Use of light as the external energy source in photoautotrophs and oxidation reactions as the energy source in chemoautotrophs
Students should understand that oxidation reactions release energy, so they are useful in living organisms.
Include iron-oxidizing bacteria as an example of a chemoautotroph.
C4.2.8—Heterotrophs as organisms that use carbon compounds obtained from other organisms to synthesize the carbon compounds that they require
Students should appreciate that complex carbon compounds such as proteins and nucleic acids are
digested either externally or internally and are then assimilated by constructing the carbon compounds that are required.
C4.2.9—Release of energy in both autotrophs and heterotrophs by oxidation of carbon compounds in cell respiration
Students are not required to be familiar with photoheterotrophs.
C4.2.10—Classification of organisms into trophic levels
Use the terms “producer”, “primary consumer”, “secondary consumer” and “tertiary consumer”. Students
should appreciate that many organisms have a varied diet and occupy different trophic levels in different food chains.
C4.2.11—Construction of energy pyramids
Application of skills: Students should use research data from specific ecosystems to represent energy
transfer and energy losses between trophic levels in food chains.
C4.2.12—Reductions in energy availability at each successive stage in food chains due to large energy losses between trophic levels
Decomposers and detritus feeders are not usually considered to be part of food chains. However, students
should understand the role of these organisms in energy transformations in food chains. Consider the causes of energy loss.
C4.2.13—Heat loss to the environment in both autotrophs and heterotrophs due to conversion of chemical energy to heat in cell respiration
Include the idea that energy transfers are not 100% efficient so heat is produced both when ATP is
produced in cell respiration and when it is used in cells.
C4.2.14—Restrictions on the number of trophic levels in ecosystems due to energy losses
At each successive stage in food chains there are fewer organisms or smaller organisms. There is therefore
less biomass, but the energy content per unit mass is not reduced.
C4.2.15—Primary production as accumulation of carbon compounds in biomass by autotrophs
The units should be mass (of carbon) per unit area per unit time and are usually g m−2 yr−1. Students should
understand that biomes vary in their capacity to accumulate biomass. Biomass accumulates when autotrophs and heterotrophs grow or reproduce.
C4.2.16—Secondary production as accumulation of carbon compounds in biomass by heterotrophs
Syllabus content 84
Biology guide

=== Page 91 ===
Students should understand that, due to loss of biomass when carbon compounds are converted to
carbon dioxide and water in cell respiration, secondary production is lower than primary production in an ecosystem.
C4.2.17—Constructing carbon cycle diagrams
Students should illustrate with a diagram how carbon is recycled in ecosystems by photosynthesis, feeding and respiration.
C4.2.18—Ecosystems as carbon sinks and carbon sources
If photosynthesis exceeds respiration there is a net uptake of carbon dioxide and if respiration exceeds
photosynthesis there is a net release of carbon dioxide.
C4.2.19—Release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere during combustion of biomass, peat, coal, oil and natural gas
Students should appreciate that these carbon sinks vary in date of formation and that combustion
following lightning strikes sometimes happens naturally but that human activities have greatly increased combustion rates.
C4.2.20—Analysis of the Keeling Curve in terms of photosynthesis, respiration and combustion
Include analysis of both the annual fluctuations and the long-term trend.
C4.2.21—Dependence of aerobic respiration on atmospheric oxygen produced by photosynthesis, and of
photosynthesis on atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by respiration
The fluxes involved per year are huge, so this is a major interaction between autotrophs and heterotrophs.
C4.2.22—Recycling of all chemical elements required by living organisms in ecosystems
Students should appreciate that all elements used by living organisms, not just carbon, are recycled and
that decomposers play a key role. Students are not required to know details of the nitrogen cycle and other nutrient cycles.
Note: There is no additional higher level content in C4.2.

polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the basis of separation of DNA fragments in gel electrophoresis.
D1.1.5—Applications of polymerase chain reaction and gel electrophoresis
Students should appreciate the broad range of applications, including DNA profiling for paternity and forensic investigations.
NOS: Reliability is enhanced by increasing the number of measurements in an experiment or test. In DNA
profiling, increasing the number of markers used reduces the probability of a false match.
Additional higher level
D1.1.6—Directionality of DNA polymerases
Students should understand the difference between the 5' and 3' terminals of strands of nucleotides and
that DNA polymerases add the 5' of a DNA nucleotide to the 3' end of a strand of nucleotides.

Limit examples to regulators of gene expression, introns, telomeres and genes for rRNAs and tRNAs in eukaryotes.
D1.2.15—Post-transcriptional modification in eukaryotic cells
Include removal of introns and splicing together of exons to form mature mRNA and also the addition of 5'
caps and 3' polyA tails to stabilize mRNA transcripts.
D1.2.16—Alternative splicing of exons to produce variants of a protein from a single gene
Students are only expected to understand that splicing together different combinations of exons allows
one gene to code for different polypeptides. Specific examples are not required.
D1.2.17—Initiation of translation
Include attachment of the small ribosome subunit to the 5' terminal of mRNA, movement to the start
codon, the initiator tRNA and another tRNA, and attachment of the large subunit. Students should
understand the roles of the three binding sites for tRNA on the ribosome (A, P and E) during elongation.

replication or repair. Include examples of chemical mutagens and mutagenic forms of radiation.
D1.3.5—Randomness in mutation
Students should understand that mutations can occur anywhere in the base sequences of a genome,
although some bases have a higher probability of mutating than others. They should also understand that

D1.3.6—Consequences of mutation in germ cells and somatic cells
Include inheritance of mutated genes in germ cells and cancer in somatic cells.
D1.3.7—Mutation as a source of genetic variation

most mutations are either harmful or neutral for an individual organism, in a species they are in the long
term essential for evolution by natural selection.
NOS: Commercial genetic tests can yield information about potential future health and disease risk. One
possible impact is that, without expert interpretation, this information could be problematic.

D1.3.9—Use of the CRISPR sequences and the enzyme Cas9 in gene editing
Students are not required to know the role of the CRISPR–Cas system in prokaryotes. However, students
should be familiar with an example of the successful use of this technology.
NOS: Certain potential uses of CRISPR raise ethical issues that must be addressed before implementation.
Students should understand that scientists across the world are subject to different regulatory systems.
For this reason, there is an international effort to harmonize regulation of the application of genome editing technologies such as CRISPR.
D1.3.10—Hypotheses to account for conserved or highly conserved sequences in genes
Conserved sequences are identical or similar across a species or a group of species; highly conserved
sequences are identical or similar over long periods of evolution. One hypothesis for the mechanism is the
functional requirements for the gene products and another hypothesis is slower rates of mutation.

Students should understand that cell proliferation is achieved using the cell cycle. Students should
understand the sequence of events including G1, S and G2 as the stages of interphase, followed by mitosis and then cytokinesis.
D2.1.14—Cell growth during interphase
Students should appreciate that interphase is a metabolically active period and that growth involves
biosynthesis of cell components including proteins and DNA. Numbers of mitochondria and chloroplasts
are increased by growth and division of these organelles.
D2.1.15—Control of the cell cycle using cyclins
Limit to the concentration of different cyclins increasing and decreasing during the cell cycle and a

Emphasize that DNA base sequences are not altered by epigenetic changes, so phenotype but not genotype is altered.
D2.2.5—Differences between the genome, transcriptome and proteome of individual cells
No cell expresses all of its genes. The pattern of gene expression in a cell determines how it differentiates.
D2.2.6—Methylation of the promoter and histones in nucleosomes as examples of epigenetic tags
Methylation of cytosine in the DNA of a promoter represses transcription and therefore expression of the gene downstream.
Methylation of amino acids in histones can cause transcription to be repressed or activated. Students are
not required to know details of how this is achieved.
D2.2.7—Epigenetic inheritance through heritable changes to gene expression
Limit to the possibility of phenotypic changes in a cell or organism being passed on to daughter cells or
offspring without changes in the nucleotide sequence of DNA. This can happen if epigenetic tags, such as
DNA methylation or histone modification, remain in place during mitosis or meiosis.
D2.2.8—Examples of environmental effects on gene expression in cells and organisms
Include alteration of methyl tags on DNA in response to air pollution as an example.
D2.2.9—Consequences of removal of most but not all epigenetic tags from the ovum and sperm

•
How do plant and animal cells differ in their regulation of water movement?
SL and HL
D2.3.1—Solvation with water as the solvent
Include hydrogen bond formation between solute and water molecules, and attractions between both
positively and negatively charged ions and polar water molecules.
D2.3.2—Water movement from less concentrated to more concentrated solutions
Students should express the direction of movement in terms of solute concentration, not water
concentration. Students should use the terms “hypertonic”, “hypotonic” and “isotonic” to compare concentration of solutions.
D2.3.3—Water movement by osmosis into or out of cells
Students should be able to predict the direction of net movement of water if the environment of a cell is
hypotonic or hypertonic. They should understand that in an isotonic environment there is dynamic equilibrium rather than no movement of water.
D2.3.4—Changes due to water movement in plant tissue bathed in hypotonic and those bathed in hypertonic solutions
Application of skills: Students should be able to measure changes in tissue length and mass, and analyse
data to deduce isotonic solute concentration. Students should also be able to use standard deviation and
standard error to help in the analysis of data. Students are not required to memorize formulae for
calculating these statistics. Standard deviation and standard error could be determined for the results of
this experiment if there are repeats for each concentration. This would allow the reliability of length and
mass measurements to be compared. Standard error could be shown graphically as error bars.
D2.3.5—Effects of water movement on cells that lack a cell wall
Include swelling and bursting in a hypotonic medium, and shrinkage and crenation in a hypertonic
medium. Also include the need for removal of water by contractile vacuoles in freshwater unicellular
organisms and the need to maintain isotonic tissue fluid in multicellular organisms to prevent harmful changes.
D2.3.6—Effects of water movement on cells with a cell wall
Include the development of turgor pressure in a hypotonic medium and plasmolysis in a hypertonic medium.

D2.3.8—Water potential as the potential energy of water per unit volume
Students should understand that it is impossible to measure the absolute quantity of the potential energy
of water, so values relative to pure water at atmospheric pressure and 20°C are used. The units are usually kilopascals (kPa).
D2.3.9—Movement of water from higher to lower water potential
Students should appreciate the reasons for this movement in terms of potential energy.
D2.3.10—Contributions of solute potential and pressure potential to the water potential of cells with walls
Use the equation ψw = ψs + ψp. Students should appreciate that solute potentials can range from zero
downwards and that pressure potentials are generally positive inside cells, although negative pressure
potentials occur in xylem vessels where sap is being transported under tension.
D2.3.11—Water potential and water movements in plant tissue
Students should be able to explain in terms of solute and pressure potentials the changes that occur when
plant tissue is bathed in either a hypotonic or hypertonic solution.

Guiding questions •
How does asexual or sexual reproduction exemplify themes of change or continuity?
•
What changes within organisms are required for reproduction?
SL and HL
D3.1.1—Differences between sexual and asexual reproduction
Include these relative advantages: asexual reproduction to produce genetically identical offspring by
individuals that are adapted to an existing environment, sexual reproduction to produce offspring with
new gene combinations and thus variation needed for adaptation to a changed environment.
D3.1.2—Role of meiosis and fusion of gametes in the sexual life cycle
Students should appreciate that meiosis breaks up parental combinations of alleles, and fusion of gametes
produces new combinations. Fusion of gametes is also known as fertilization.
D3.1.3—Differences between male and female sexes in sexual reproduction
Syllabus content 95
Biology guide

=== Page 102 ===
Include the prime difference that the male gamete travels to the female gamete, so it is smaller, with less
food reserves than the egg. From this follow differences in the numbers of gametes and the reproductive strategies of males and females.
D3.1.4—Anatomy of the human male and female reproductive systems
Students should be able to draw diagrams of the male-typical and female-typical systems and annotate them with names of structures and functions.
D3.1.5—Changes during the ovarian and uterine cycles and their hormonal regulation
Include the roles of oestradiol, progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
and both positive and negative feedback. The ovarian and uterine cycles together constitute the menstrual cycle.
D3.1.6—Fertilization in humans
Include the fusion of a sperm’s cell membrane with an egg cell membrane, entry to the egg of the sperm
nucleus but destruction of the tail and mitochondria. Also include dissolution of nuclear membranes of
sperm and egg nuclei and participation of all the condensed chromosomes in a joint mitosis to produce two diploid nuclei.
D3.1.7—Use of hormones in in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment
The normal secretion of hormones is suspended, and artificial doses of hormones induce superovulation.
D3.1.8—Sexual reproduction in flowering plants
Include production of gametes inside ovules and pollen grains, pollination, pollen development and
fertilization to produce an embryo. Students should understand that reproduction in flowering plants is
sexual, even if a plant species is hermaphroditic.
D3.1.9—Features of an insect-pollinated flower
Students should draw diagrams annotated with names of structures and their functions.
D3.1.10—Methods of promoting cross-pollination
Include different maturation times for pollen and stigma, separate male and female flowers or male and
female plants. Also include the role of animals or wind in transferring pollen between plants.
D3.1.11—Self-incompatibility mechanisms to increase genetic variation within a species
Students should understand that self-pollination leads to inbreeding, which decreases genetic diversity
and vigour. They should also understand that genetic mechanisms in many plant species ensure male and
female gametes fusing during fertilization are from different plants.
D3.1.12—Dispersal and germination of seeds
Distinguish seed dispersal from pollination. Include the growth and development of the embryo and the mobilization of food reserves.

Additional higher level
D3.1.13—Control of the developmental changes of puberty by gonadotropin-releasing hormone and steroid sex hormones
Limit to the increased release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by the hypothalamus in
childhood triggering the onset of increased luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH) release. Ultimately the increased sex hormone production leads to the changes associated with puberty.
D3.1.14—Spermatogenesis and oogenesis in humans
Include mitosis, cell growth, two divisions of meiosis and differentiation. Students should understand how
gametogenesis, in typical male and female bodies, results in different numbers of sperm and eggs, and different amounts of cytoplasm.
D3.1.15—Mechanisms to prevent polyspermy
The acrosome reaction allows a sperm to penetrate the zona pellucida and the cortical reaction prevents other sperm from passing through.
D3.1.16—Development of a blastocyst and implantation in the endometrium
Students are not required to know the names of other stages in embryo development.
D3.1.17—Pregnancy testing by detection of human chorionic gonadotropin secretion
Include the production of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the embryo or developing placenta and
the use of monoclonal antibodies that bind to hCG.
D3.1.18—Role of the placenta in foetal development inside the uterus
Students are not required to know details of placental structure apart from the large surface area of the
placental villi. Students should understand which exchange processes occur in the placenta and that it
allows the foetus to be retained in the uterus to a later stage of development than in mammals that do not develop a placenta.
D3.1.19—Hormonal control of pregnancy and childbirth
Emphasize that the continuity of pregnancy is maintained by progesterone secretion initially from the
corpus luteum and then from the placenta, whereas the changes during childbirth are triggered by a
decrease in progesterone levels, allowing increases in oxytocin secretion due to positive feedback.
D3.1.20—Hormone replacement therapy and the risk of coronary heart disease
NOS: In early epidemiological studies, it was argued that women undergoing hormone replacement
therapy (HRT) had reduced incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and this was deemed to be a cause and-effect relationship. Later randomized controlled trials showed that use of HRT led to a small increase
in the risk of CHD. The correlation between HRT and decreased incidence of CHD is not actually a cause and-effect relationship. HRT patients have a higher socioeconomic status, and this status has a causal relationship with lower risk of CHD.

What patterns of inheritance exist in plants and animals?
•
What is the molecular basis of inheritance patterns?
SL and HL
D3.2.1—Production of haploid gametes in parents and their fusion to form a diploid zygote as the means of inheritance
Students should understand that this pattern of inheritance is common to all eukaryotes with a sexual life
cycle. They should also understand that a diploid cell has two copies of each autosomal gene.
D3.2.2—Methods for conducting genetic crosses in flowering plants
Use the terms “P generation”, “F1 generation”, “F2 generation” and “Punnett grid”. Students should
understand that pollen contains male gametes and that female gametes are located in the ovary, so
pollination is needed to carry out a cross. They should also understand that plants such as peas produce
both male and female gametes on the same plant, allowing self-pollination and therefore self-fertilization.
Mention that genetic crosses are widely used to breed new varieties of crop or ornamental plants.
D3.2.3—Genotype as the combination of alleles inherited by an organism
Students should use and understand the terms “homozygous” and “heterozygous”, and appreciate the distinction between genes and alleles.
D3.2.4—Phenotype as the observable traits of an organism resulting from genotype and environmental factors
Students should be able to suggest examples of traits in humans due to genotype only and due to
environment only, and also traits due to interaction between genotype and environment.
D3.2.5—Effects of dominant and recessive alleles on phenotype
Students should understand the reasons that both a homozygous-dominant genotype and a
heterozygous genotype for a particular trait will produce the same phenotype.
D3.2.6—Phenotypic plasticity as the capacity to develop traits suited to the environment experienced by
an organism, by varying patterns of gene expression
Phenotypic plasticity is not due to changes in genotype, and the changes in traits may be reversible during the lifetime of an individual.
D3.2.7—Phenylketonuria as an example of a human disease due to a recessive allele
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a recessive genetic condition caused by mutation in an autosomal gene that
codes for the enzyme needed to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine.
D3.2.8—Single-nucleotide polymorphisms and multiple alleles in gene pools
Syllabus content 98
Biology guide

=== Page 105 ===
Students should understand that any number of alleles of a gene can exist in the gene pool but an individual only inherits two.
D3.2.9—ABO blood groups as an example of multiple alleles
Use IA, IB and i to denote the alleles.
D3.2.10—Incomplete dominance and codominance
Students should understand the differences between these patterns of inheritance at the phenotypic
level. In codominance, heterozygotes have a dual phenotype. Include the AB blood type (IAIB) as an
example. In incomplete dominance, heterozygotes have an intermediate phenotype. Include four o'clock
flower or marvel of Peru (Mirabilis jalapa) as an example.
Note: When students are referring to organisms in an examination, either the common name or the scientific name is acceptable.
D3.2.11—Sex determination in humans and inheritance of genes on sex chromosomes
Students should understand that the sex chromosome in sperm determines whether a zygote develops
certain male-typical or female-typical physical characteristics and that far more genes are carried by the X chromosome than the Y chromosome.
D3.2.12—Haemophilia as an example of a sex-linked genetic disorder
Show alleles carried on X chromosomes as superscript letters on an uppercase X.
D3.2.13—Pedigree charts to deduce patterns of inheritance of genetic disorders
Students should understand the genetic basis for the prohibition of marriage between close relatives in many societies.
NOS: Scientists draw general conclusions by inductive reasoning when they base a theory on observations
of some but not all cases. A pattern of inheritance may be deduced from parts of a pedigree chart and this
theory may then allow genotypes of specific individuals in the pedigree to be deduced. Students should
be able to distinguish between inductive and deductive reasoning.
D3.2.14—Continuous variation due to polygenic inheritance and/or environmental factors
Use skin colour in humans as an example.
Application of skills: Students should understand the distinction between continuous variables such as
skin colour and discrete variables such as ABO blood group. They should also be able to apply measures of central tendency such as mean, median and mode.
D3.2.15—Box-and-whisker plots to represent data for a continuous variable such as student height
Application of skills: Students should use a box-and-whisker plot to display six aspects of data: outliers,
minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile and maximum. A data point is categorized as an outlier if it
is more than 1.5 × IQR (interquartile range) above the third quartile or below the first quartile.

D3.2.17—Punnett grids for predicting genotypic and phenotypic ratios in dihybrid crosses involving pairs of unlinked autosomal genes
Students should understand how the 9:3:3:1 and 1:1:1:1 ratios are derived.
NOS: 9:3:3:1 and 1:1:1:1 ratios for dihybrid crosses are based on what has been called Mendel’s second law.
This law only applies if genes are on different chromosomes or are far apart enough on one chromosome
for recombination rates to reach 50%. Students should recognize that there are exceptions to all biological “laws” under certain conditions.
D3.2.18—Loci of human genes and their polypeptide products
Application of skills: Students should explore genes and their polypeptide products in databases. They
should find pairs of genes with loci on different chromosomes and also in close proximity on the same chromosome.
D3.2.19—Autosomal gene linkage
In crosses involving linkage, the symbols used to denote alleles should be shown alongside vertical lines
representing homologous chromosomes. Students should understand the reason that alleles of linked genes can fail to assort independently.
D3.2.20—Recombinants in crosses involving two linked or unlinked genes
Students should understand how to determine the outcomes of crosses between an individual
heterozygous for both genes and an individual homozygous recessive for both genes. Identify
recombinants in gametes, in genotypes of offspring and in phenotypes of offspring.
D3.2.21—Use of a chi-squared test on data from dihybrid crosses
Students should understand the concept of statistical significance, the p = 0.05 level, null/alternative
hypothesis and the idea of observed versus expected results.
NOS: Students should recognize that statistical testing often involves using a sample to represent a
population. In this case the sample is the F2 generation. In many experiments the sample is the replicated or repeated measurements.

examples of muscle and adipose tissue that act as effectors of temperature change.
D3.3.6—Thermoregulation mechanisms in humans
Students should appreciate that birds and mammals regulate their body temperature by physiological and
behavioural means. Students are only required to understand the details of thermoregulation for humans.
Include vasodilation, vasoconstriction, shivering, sweating, uncoupled respiration in brown adipose tissue and hair erection.
Additional higher level
D3.3.7—Role of the kidney in osmoregulation and excretion
Students should understand the distinction between excretion and osmoregulation. Osmoregulation is
regulation of osmotic concentration. The units for osmotic concentration are osmoles per litre (osmol L−1).
D3.3.8—Role of the glomerulus, Bowman’s capsule and proximal convoluted tubule in excretion
Students should appreciate how ultrafiltration remove solutes from blood plasma and how useful
substances are then reabsorbed, to leave toxins and other unwanted solutes in the filtrate, which are excreted in urine.
D3.3.9—Role of the loop of Henle
Limit to active transport of sodium ions in the ascending limb to maintain high osmotic concentrations in
the medulla, facilitating water reabsorption in the collecting ducts.
D3.3.10—Osmoregulation by water reabsorption in the collecting ducts
Include the roles of osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, changes to the rate of antidiuretic hormone
secretion by the pituitary gland and the resultant switches in location of aquaporins between cell
membranes and intracellular vesicles in cells of the collecting ducts.

Guiding questions •
What processes can cause changes in allele frequencies within a population?
•
What is the role of reproduction in the process of natural selection?
SL and HL
D4.1.1—Natural selection as the mechanism driving evolutionary change
Students should appreciate that natural selection operates continuously and over billions of years, resulting in the biodiversity of life on Earth.
NOS: In Darwin’s time it was widely understood that species evolved, but the mechanism was not clear.
Darwin’s theory provided a convincing mechanism and replaced Lamarckism. This is an example of a
paradigm shift. Students should understand the meaning of the term “paradigm shift”.
D4.1.2—Roles of mutation and sexual reproduction in generating the variation on which natural selection acts
Mutation generates new alleles and sexual reproduction generates new combinations of alleles.
D4.1.3—Overproduction of offspring and competition for resources as factors that promote natural selection
Include examples of food and other resources that may limit carrying capacity.
D4.1.4—Abiotic factors as selection pressures
Include examples of density-independent factors such as high or low temperatures that may affect survival of individuals in a population.
D4.1.5—Differences between individuals in adaptation, survival and reproduction as the basis for natural selection
Students are required to study natural selection due to intraspecific competition, including the concept of
fitness when discussing the survival value and reproductive potential of a genotype.
D4.1.6—Requirement that traits are heritable for evolutionary change to occur
Syllabus content 102
Biology guide

=== Page 109 ===
Students should understand that characteristics acquired during an individual’s life due to environmental
factors are not encoded in the base sequence of genes and so are not heritable.
D4.1.7—Sexual selection as a selection pressure in animal species
Differences in physical and behavioural traits, which can be used as signs of overall fitness, can affect
success in attracting a mate and so drive the evolution of an animal population. Illustrate this using
suitable examples such as the evolution of the plumage of birds of paradise.
D4.1.8—Modelling of sexual and natural selection based on experimental control of selection pressures
Application of skills: Students should interpret data from John Endler’s experiments with guppies.
Additional higher level
D4.1.9—Concept of the gene pool
A gene pool consists of all the genes and their different alleles, present in a population.
D4.1.10—Allele frequencies of geographically isolated populations
Application of skills: Students should use databases to search allele frequencies. Use at least one human example.
D4.1.11—Changes in allele frequency in the gene pool as a consequence of natural selection between
individuals according to differences in their heritable traits
Darwin developed the theory of evolution by natural selection. Biologists subsequently integrated
genetics with natural selection in what is now known as neo-Darwinism.
D4.1.12—Differences between directional, disruptive and stabilizing selection
Students should be aware that all three types result in a change in allele frequency.
D4.1.13—Hardy–Weinberg equation and calculations of allele or genotype frequencies
Use p  and q  to denote the two allele frequencies. Students should understand that p + q = 1  so genotype
frequencies are predicted by the Hardy–Weinberg equation: p2 + 2pq + q2 = 1.
If one of the genotype frequencies is known, the allele frequencies can be calculated using the same equations.
D4.1.14—Hardy–Weinberg conditions that must be maintained for a population to be in genetic equilibrium
Students should understand that if genotype frequencies in a population do not fit the Hardy–Weinberg
equation, this indicates that one or more of the conditions is not being met, for example mating is non random or survival rates vary between genotypes.
D4.1.15—Artificial selection by deliberate choice of traits
Artificial selection is carried out in crop plants and domesticated animals by choosing individuals for
breeding that have desirable traits. Unintended consequences of human actions, such as the evolution of
resistance in bacteria when an antibiotic is used, are due to natural rather than artificial selection.

continuity over long periods. There is evidence for some ecosystems persisting for millions of years.
D4.2.2—Requirements for stability in ecosystems
Include supply of energy, recycling of nutrients, genetic diversity and climatic variables remaining within tolerance levels.
D4.2.3—Deforestation of Amazon rainforest as an example of a possible tipping point in ecosystem stability
Include the need for a large area of rainforest for the generation of atmospheric water vapour by
transpiration, with consequent cooling, air flows and rainfall. Include uncertainty over the minimum area
of rainforest that is sufficient to maintain these processes.
Application of skills: Students should be able to calculate percentage change. In this case the extent of
deforestation can be assessed by calculating the percentage change from the original area of forest.
D4.2.4—Use of a model to investigate the effect of variables on ecosystem stability
Mesocosms can be set up in open tanks but sealed glass vessels are preferable because entry and exit of
matter can be prevented but energy transfer is still possible. Aquatic or microbial ecosystems are likely to be more successful than terrestrial ones.
NOS: Care and maintenance of the mesocosms should follow IB experimental guidelines.
D4.2.5—Role of keystone species in the stability of ecosystems
Students should appreciate the disproportionate impact on community structure of keystone species and
the risk of ecosystem collapse if they are removed.
D4.2.6—Assessing sustainability of resource harvesting from natural ecosystems
Sustainability depends on the rate of harvesting being lower than the rate of replacement. Include one
terrestrial plant species and one species of marine fish as examples of renewable resources and how sustainability of harvesting can be assessed.

phosphate fertilizers, including increased biochemical oxygen demand (BOD).
D4.2.9—Biomagnification of pollutants in natural ecosystems
Students should understand how increased levels of toxins accumulate in the tissues of consumers in
higher trophic levels. Include DDT and mercury as examples.
D4.2.10—Effects of microplastic and macroplastic pollution of the oceans
Students should understand that plastics are persistent in the natural environment due to non biodegradability. Include examples of the effects of plastic pollution on marine life.
NOS: Scientists can influence the actions of citizens if they provide clear information about their research
findings. Popular media coverage of the effects of plastic pollution on marine life changed public
perception globally, which has driven measures to address this problem.
D4.2.11—Restoration of natural processes in ecosystems by rewilding
Methods should include reintroduction of apex predators and other keystone species, re-establishment of
connectivity of habitats over large areas, and minimization of human impact including by ecological
management. Include the example of Hinewai Reserve in New Zealand.

D4.2.12—Ecological succession and its causes
Succession can be triggered by changes in both an abiotic environment and in biotic factors.
D4.2.13—Changes occurring during primary succession
Use any suitable terrestrial example to illustrate these general principles: increases in size of plants,
amount of primary production, species diversity, complexity of food webs and amount of nutrient cycling.
D4.2.14—Cyclical succession in ecosystems
Students should appreciate that in some ecosystems there is a cycle of communities rather than a single
unchanging climax community. Students should refer to an example.
D4.2.15—Climax communities and arrested succession
Given any specific environmental conditions, ecological succession tends to lead to a particular type of
climax community, but human influences can prevent this from developing. Use grazing by farm livestock and drainage of wetlands as examples.

reflective snow and ice, accelerating rates of decomposition of peat and previously undecomposed
organic matter in permafrost, release of methane from melting permafrost and increases in droughts and forest fires.
D4.3.3—Change from net carbon accumulation to net loss in boreal forests as an example of a tipping point
Include warmer temperatures and decreased winter snowfall leading to increased incidence of drought
and reductions in primary production in taiga, with forest browning and increases in the frequency and
intensity of forest fires, which result in legacy carbon combustion.
D4.3.4—Melting of landfast ice and sea ice as examples of polar habitat change
Include potential loss of breeding grounds of the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) due to early

As evidence-based examples, include upslope range shifts for tropical-zone montane bird species in New
Guinea and range contraction and northward spread in North American tree species.
D4.3.7—Threats to coral reefs as an example of potential ecosystem collapse
Increased carbon dioxide concentrations are the cause of ocean acidification and suppression of
calcification in corals. Increases in water temperature are a cause of coral bleaching. Loss of corals causes the collapse of reef ecosystems.

Students should recognize that within an ecosystem temperature may act as the cue in one population
and photoperiod may be the cue in another. Include spring growth of the Arctic mouse-ear chickweed
(Cerastium arcticum) and arrival of migrating reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) as one example. Also include a
suitable local example or use the breeding of the great tit (Parus major) and peak biomass of caterpillars in north European forests as another.
Note: When students are referring to organisms in an examination, either the common name or the scientific name is acceptable.
D4.3.11—Increases to the number of insect life cycles within a year due to climate change
Use the spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus or Dendroctonus micans) as an example.
Note: When students are referring to organisms in an examination, either the common name or the scientific name is acceptable.
D4.3.12—Evolution as a consequence of climate change
Include changes in the fitness of colour variants of the tawny owl (Strix aluco) as a consequence of changes in snow cover.
Note: When students are referring to organisms in an examination, either the common name or the scientific name is acceptable.

General
Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most important aims of assessment in the
Diploma Programme (DP) are that it should support curricular goals and encourage appropriate student
learning. Both external and internal assessments are used in the DP. IB examiners mark work produced for
external assessment, while work produced for internal assessment is marked by teachers and externally moderated by the IB.
There are two types of assessment identified by the IB.
•
Formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is concerned with providing accurate and
helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of learning taking place and the nature of
students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop students’ understanding and capabilities.
Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide information to
monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives (0404-01).
•
Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring
student achievement at, or towards the end, of the course of study (0404-04).
A comprehensive assessment policy is viewed as being integral with teaching, learning and course
organization. For further information, see the IB Programme standards and practices publication.
The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not norm-referenced. This approach to
assessment judges students’ work by their performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, and
not in relation to the work of other students. For further information on assessment within the DP, please
refer to the publication Assessment principles and practices—Quality assessments in a digital age.
To support teachers in the planning, delivery and assessment of the DP courses, a variety of resources can
be found on the Programme Resource Centre or purchased from the IB store (store.ibo.org). Additional
publications such as specimen papers and markschemes, teacher support material (TSM), subject reports
and grade descriptors can also be found on the Programme Resource Centre. Past examination papers as
well as markschemes can be purchased from the IB store.
Methods of assessment
The IB uses several methods to assess work produced by students.
Assessment criteria
Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended. Each criterion concentrates on a
particular skill that students are expected to demonstrate. An assessment objective describes what
students should be able to do, and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do it. Using
assessment criteria allows discrimination between different answers and encourages a variety of responses.
Each criterion comprises a set of hierarchically ordered level descriptors. Each level descriptor is worth one
or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The maximum marks for each
criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are added
together to give the total mark for the piece of work.
Markbands
Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance against which responses are judged.
They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds to Assessment
Assessment in the Diploma Programme 108
Biology guide

=== Page 115 ===
a range of marks to differentiate student performance. A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which
particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.
Analytic markschemes
Analytic markschemes are prepared for those examination questions that expect a particular kind of
response and/or a given final answer from students. They give detailed instructions to examiners on how to
break down the total mark for each question for different parts of the response.
Marking notes
For some assessment components marked using assessment criteria, marking notes are provided. Marking
notes give guidance on how to apply assessment criteria to the particular requirements of a question.
Inclusive access arrangements
Inclusive access arrangements are available for candidates with access requirements. Standard assessment
conditions may put candidates with assessment access requirements at a disadvantage by preventing them
from demonstrating their attainment level. Inclusive access arrangements enable candidates to
demonstrate their ability under assessment conditions that are as fair as possible.
The IB document Access and inclusion policy provides details on all the inclusive access arrangements
available to candidates. The IB document Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes: Removing
barriers to learning outlines the position of the IB with regard to candidates with diverse learning needs in
the IB programmes. For candidates affected by adverse circumstances, the publication Diploma Programme
Assessment procedures (updated annually), which includes the general regulations, provides details on access consideration.
Responsibilities of the school
The school is required to ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided
to candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Access and
inclusion policy and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes: Removing barriers to learning.

Purpose of internal assessment
Internal assessment is an integral part of the course and is compulsory for both SL and HL students. It
enables students to demonstrate the application of their skills and knowledge, and to pursue their personal
interests, without the time limitations and other constraints that are associated with written examinations.
The internal assessment should, as far as possible, be woven into normal classroom teaching and not be a
separate activity conducted after a course has been taught.
The internal assessment requirements at SL and at HL are the same.
Guidance and authenticity
The scientific investigation (SL and HL) submitted for internal assessment must be the student’s own work.
However, it is not the intention that students should decide upon a title or topic and be left to work on the
internal assessment component without any further support from the teacher. The teacher should play an
important role during both the planning stage and the period when the student is working on the
internally assessed work. It is the responsibility of the teacher to ensure that students are familiar with:
•
the requirements of the type of work to be internally assessed •
the Sciences experimentation guidelines publication •
the assessment criteria. Students must understand that the work submitted for assessment must address these criteria effectively.
Teachers and students must discuss the internally assessed work. Students should be encouraged to initiate
discussions with the teacher to obtain advice and information, and students must not be penalized for
seeking guidance. As part of the learning process, teachers should read and give advice to students on one
draft of the work. The teacher should provide oral or written advice on how the work could be improved,
but not edit the draft. The next version handed to the teacher must be the final version for submission.
It is the responsibility of teachers to ensure that all students understand the basic meaning and significance
of concepts that relate to academic integrity, especially authenticity and intellectual property. Teachers
must ensure that all student work for assessment is prepared according to the requirements and must
explain clearly to students that the internally assessed work must be entirely their own. Where
collaboration between students is permitted, it must be clear to all students what the difference is between collaboration and collusion.
All work submitted to the IB for moderation or assessment must be authenticated by a teacher, and must
not include any known instances of suspected or confirmed malpractice. Each student must confirm that
the work is their authentic work and constitutes the final version of that work. Once a student has officially
submitted the final version of the work, it cannot be retracted. The requirement to confirm the authenticity
of work applies to the work of all students, not just the sample work that will be submitted to the IB for the
purpose of moderation. For further details, refer to the IB publications Academic integrity, Diploma
Programme: From principles into practice and the relevant general regulations (in Diploma Programme
Assessment procedures).
Authenticity may be checked by discussion with the student on the content of the work, and by scrutiny of one or more of the following.
•
The student’s initial proposal •
The first draft of the written work •
The references cited
Assessment
Internal assessment 114
Biology guide

=== Page 121 ===
•
The style of writing compared with work known to be that of the student •
The analysis of the work by a web-based plagiarism detection service such as www.turnitin.com
The same piece of work cannot be submitted to meet the requirements of both the IA and the EE.
Time allocation
Internal assessment is an integral part of the biology course, contributing 20% to the final assessment in the
SL and the HL courses. This weighting should be reflected in the time that is allocated to teaching the
knowledge, skills and understanding required to undertake the work, as well as the total time allocated to carry out the work.
It is recommended that a total of approximately 10 hours (SL and HL) of teaching time should be allocated to the work. This should include:
•
time for the teacher to explain to students the requirements of the internal assessment •
class time for students to work on the internal assessment component and ask questions •
time for consultation between the teacher and each student •
time to review and monitor progress, and to check authenticity.
Safety requirements and recommendations
It is the responsibility of everyone involved in science education to make an ongoing commitment to safe and healthy practical work.
The working practices and protocols should be effective in safeguarding students and protecting the
environment. Schools are responsible for following national or local guidelines, which differ from country to
country. The Biology teacher support material provides some further guidance.
Using assessment criteria for internal assessment
For internal assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion
has level descriptors describing specific achievement levels, together with an appropriate range of marks.
The level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure to achieve may be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL against the criteria using the level descriptors.
•
The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.
•
The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by
the student, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be made
when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark awarded
should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is not
necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.
•
When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors for each criterion until
they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a
piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the
one that more appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.
•
Where there are two marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper marks if the
student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent; the work may be close to
achieving marks in the level above. Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work
demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in the level below.
•
Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.
Internal assessment 115
Biology guide

=== Page 122 ===
•
Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary but should concentrate on identifying the
appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.
•
The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by a
student. Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of the work being assessed.
•
A student who attains a high achievement level in relation to one criterion will not necessarily attain
high achievement levels in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a student who attains a low
achievement level for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the other
criteria. Teachers should not assume that the overall assessment of the students will produce any particular distribution of marks.
•
It is recommended that the assessment criteria be made available to students.
Internal assessment details—SL and HL
The scientific investigation
Duration: 10 hours
Weighting: 20%
The IA requirement is the same for biology, chemistry and physics. The IA, worth 20% of the final
assessment, consists of one task—the scientific investigation.
The scientific investigation is an open-ended task in which the student gathers and analyses data in order to answer their own formulated research question.
The outcome of the scientific investigation will be assessed through the form of a written report. The
maximum overall word count for the report is 3,000 words.
The following are not included in the word count.
•
Charts and diagrams •
Data tables •
Equations, formulas and calculations •
Citations/references (whether parenthetical, numbered, footnotes or endnotes) •
Bibliography •
Headers
The following details should be stated at the start of the report.
•
Title of the investigation •
IB candidate code (alphanumeric, for example, xyz123) •
IB candidate code for all group members (if applicable) •
Number of words
There is no requirement to include a cover page or a contents page.
Facilitating the scientific investigation
The research question should be of interest to the student, but it is not necessary that it encompasses
concepts beyond those described by the understandings within the guide.
The scientific investigation undertaken must have sufficient extent and depth to allow for all the descriptors
of the assessment criteria to be meaningfully addressed.
The investigation of the research question must involve the collection and analysis of quantitative data that
should be supported by qualitative observations where appropriate.
The scientific investigation allows a wide range of techniques for data gathering and analysis to be
employed. The approaches that could be used in isolation or in conjunction with each other are as follows.
•
Hands-on practical laboratory work
Internal assessment 116
Biology guide

=== Page 123 ===
•
Fieldwork •
Use of a spreadsheet for analysis and modelling •
Extraction and analysis of data from a database •
Use of a simulation.
The Biology teacher support material contains further guidance on these possible approaches.
Teachers must:
•
ensure that students are familiar with the assessment criteria •
ensure that students are able to investigate their individual research question •
counsel the students on whether their proposed methodology is feasible in consideration of available time and resources •
ensure that students have given appropriate consideration to safety, ethical and environmental factors before undertaking the action phase •
remind students of the requirements for academic integrity and the consequences of academic
malpractice. The difference between collaboration and collusion must be made clear.
Developing the research question
Each student is expected to formulate, investigate and answer a unique research question, seeking advice from their teacher.
A student must not present the same set of raw data as another student.
Methodology for individual work
Each student develops their own methodology to answer their individual research question. The student
investigates by:
• manipulating an independent variable or • selecting variables during fieldwork or • selecting different data from external databases.
The student might seek support from peers when collecting data.
Methodology for collaborative work
Collaborative work is optional and where it is facilitated the groups formed must be no larger than three
students. Students may organize their own groups. The teacher must provide guidance to ensure that all
students are fully engaged in the collaborative activity. Students must clearly understand the requirement to conduct an individual investigation.
The methodology developed to answer their individual research question may be in part the outcome of
collaborative activity. A student within the group investigates their individual research question by
manipulating:
•
a different independent variable from those selected by other group members or •
the same independent variable with a different dependent variable from those selected by other group members or •
different data from those selected by other group members from within a larger communally acquired data set.
In this context, collaborative work is permitted under the understanding that the final report presented for
assessment is that of the individual student. A report by the group is not permitted. All authoring, including
Internal assessment 117
Biology guide

=== Page 124 ===
the description of the methodology, must be done individually. This diagram illustrates a possible route
through the IA process where students collaborate.
Figure 3
A possible route through collaborative work
Class collaboration to set up a database
A school may take part in a large-scale activity collecting data to generate a database using standardized
protocols. If a student decides to utilize this database in order to answer their research question, then the
investigation must be treated as a database investigation. In such a case the methodology should be
focused on the way the data is filtered and sampled from the whole database in the same way as if the data was wholly acquired from an external source.
Assessing the scientific investigation
The performance in IA at both SL and HL is marked against common assessment criteria, with a total mark
out of 24. Student work is internally assessed by the teacher and externally moderated by the IB.
The four assessment criteria are as follows.
•

Data analysis •
Conclusion •
Evaluation
Each assessment criterion has level descriptors describing specific achievement levels, together with an
appropriate range of marks. The level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the
lower levels failure to achieve may be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL against the same criteria using the level
descriptors and aided by the clarifications. The criteria must be applied systematically using a best-fit
approach—when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels the mark
awarded should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is not
necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded. The highest
level descriptors do not imply faultless performance.
Where there are two or more marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper mark if the
student’s work largely satisfies the qualities described; the work may be close to achieving marks in the
level above. Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work demonstrates the qualities
described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in the level below.
Only whole numbers must be recorded; partial marks (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.
The criteria should be considered independently. A student who attains a high achievement level in
relation to one criterion will not necessarily attain high achievement levels in relation to the other criteria.
Similarly, a student who attains a low achievement level for one criterion will not necessarily attain low
achievement levels for the other criteria. Teachers should not assume that the overall assessment of the
students will produce any particular distribution of marks.
Where command terms are used in the level descriptors, they are to be interpreted as indicated in the
“Glossary of command terms” section of this guide. These command terms indicate the depth of treatment
required. Command terms used within the descriptors are provided in the following table.

Referencing and academic integrity
Appropriate referencing to sourced information used in the report of the scientific investigation is
expected. Omitted or improper referencing will be considered to be academic malpractice.
Students must ensure their assessment work adheres to the IB’s academic integrity policy and that all
sources are appropriately referenced. A student’s failure to appropriately acknowledge a source will be
investigated by the IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB
Final Award Committee. See the “Academic integrity” section of this guide for full details.

This section outlines the updates made to this publication over the past two years. The changes are ordered
from the most recent to the oldest updates. Minor spelling and typographical corrections are not listed.
Changes for May 2023 “A4.2 Conservation of biodiversity”
Introduction of revised or improved content. For A4.2.3, the phrasing of the understanding was updated
and now reads:
“To give a range of causes, carry out three or more brief case studies of species extinction: North Island
giant moas (Dinornis novaezealandiae) should be used as an example of the loss of terrestrial megafauna,
Caribbean monk seals (Neomonachus tropicalis) should be used as an example of the loss of a marine
species, and include one other species that has gone extinct from an area that is familiar to students.” “B4.2 Ecological niches”
Introduction of revised or improved content. For B4.2.7, the understanding was rephrased so it is more general and now reads:
“Students should understand that archaea are one of the three domains of life and appreciate that they are
very varied in how they obtain energy for ATP production. Students are not required to name examples.” “D4.3 Climate change”
Correction of error in the previous version.
For D4.3.1, the NOS statement has been removed.
For D4.3.8, the term “NOS” was removed from the understanding.
