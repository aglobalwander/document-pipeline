## Metaphors for Coaching

You don't see something until you have the right metaphor to let you perceive it.

-Thomas Kuhn

Think of the term coaching , and you may envision an athletic coach. We like to use quite a different metaphor. To us, coaching is a means of conveyance. Kocs is a village in Hungary from which the word coach is derived; they are pronounced the same way. The village is the birthplace of the horse-drawn vehicle called a coach in the 15th century. 'To coach means to convey a valued colleague from where he or she is to where he or she wants to be' (Evered and Selman 1989, 116-32). Skillful Cognitive Coaches apply specific strategies to enhance another person's perceptions, decisions, and intellectual functions. The ultimate purpose is to enhance

this person's self-directedness: the ability to be self-managing, selfmonitoring, and self-modifying. Within this metaphor, the act of coaching itself, not the coach, is the conveyance.
