## Glossary of Terms

Agile organization: In the context of this book, refers to the current revolution in organizations from a top-down, authoritarian, rule-bound structure to one of trust, collaboration, networking, and of relationships and the intellect, placing a premium on our greatest resource: human minds in relationship with one another.

Autobiographical listening : Occurs when the listener associates a colleague's story with his or her own experiences. This kind of listening includes making judgments and comparisons. (See also Setasides .)

Calibrating conversation: Uses an externally generated, locally adopted third-point description of teaching excellence with the purpose of supporting the capacities and practice of self-directed learning and instructional improvement. It draws on a teacher's drive for craftsmanship and their disposition of continuous learning.

Capabilities: These are the metacognitive maps, models, and skills that individuals use to guide behavioral choices. For the coach, these metacognitive functions include knowing one's intentions and choosing congruent behaviors, setting aside unproductive patterns of listening and responding, adjusting personal style preferences, and navigating within and among various coaching maps and support functions.

Coaching cycle: Describes how a coach uses both the planning and reflective maps before and after an event in which the coach will be present as observer and data collector.

Cognitive Coaching: A nonjudgmental, interactive strategy focused on developing and utilizing cognitive processes, liberating internal resources, and accessing the five states of mind as a means of more effectively achieving goals while enhancing self-directed learning.

Collaborating: Providing support in a mentoring or collegial relationship in which coach and colleague share and test ideas, determine focus for inquiry, and gather and interpret data to inform collaborative practice.

Consulting: A support service in which the colleague develops teaching effectiveness by drawing on the more extensive experience of the consulting educator.

Consciousness: The human capacity to represent information about what

is happening outside and inside the body in such a way that it can be evaluated and acted upon by the body. To be conscious is to be aware of one's thoughts, feelings, points of view, and behaviors and the effect they have on the self and others. (See also States of mind .)

Constructivism: A theory of learning based on a belief that human beings have an innate quest to make meaning from their experiences. When humans are perplexed by anomalies, discrepancies, or new information, they have a natural inclination to make sense of it. This theory is used to guide pedagogy, curriculum, and assessment of learning.

Craftsmanship: The human drive to hone, refine, and constantly work for improvement. Includes striving for precision, elegance, refinement, and fidelity. (See also States of mind .)

Cultural Proficiency: A model for individual transformation and organizational change. It is the policies and practices of an organization, and the values and behaviors of an individual, that enable that organization and person to interact effectively with one's clients, colleagues, and community in a culturally diverse environment (Lindsey, et al. 2009).

Efficacy: Engaging in cause-and-effect thinking, spending energy on tasks, setting challenging goals, persevering in the face of barriers and occasional failure, and forecasting future performances accurately. Efficacy is linked to a belief that one's work will make a difference and is related to being optimistic, confident, and knowledgeable. Efficacy is also linked to having an internal locus of control. (See also States of mind .)

Evaluation: Measurement of and judgment about performance, based on external criteria or standards.

Flexibility: The human capacity to perceive from multiple perspectives and to endeavor to change, adapt, and expand the repertoire of response patterns. Involves humor, creativity, risk taking, and adaptability. (See also States of mind .)

Holonomy: An individual's cognitive capacity to be autonomous and interdependent at the same time. The ability to function as a member of the whole while still maintaining separateness. A person's cognitive capacity to accept the concept that he or she is whole in terms of self and yet subordinate to a higher system. The idea of holonomy is based on Arthur Koestler's work.

Identity: A mental model we construct of ourselves as unique individuals constructed from the meanings we make of our interactions with others

and how we perceive that others see us.

Interdependence: The human need for reciprocity, belonging, and connectedness; the inclination to become one with the larger system and community. (See also States of mind .)

Inquisitive listening: Occurs when the listener becomes curious about portions of a colleague's story that are not relevant to the problem at hand. Inquisitive listening sometimes involves mind reading and scrutinizing. (See also Set-asides .)

Leader: A role, not a position. In agile organizations, each person, regardless of position, provides leadership. Leaders advocate ongoing examination of decisions consistent with mission and vision. Teachers, principals, secretaries, and students contribute leadership. Asking the difficult question is an example of leadership. Modeling empathy, curiosity, craftsmanship, and consciousness are acts of leadership. Acts that focus collective energy on the important (not the urgent), on asking 'Why are we doing things this way?' are examples of leadership. Engaged participants (Garmston and Wellman 2013) are group members who are metacognitively alert. All members of a school community engage in school reform (Lambert, Walker, Zimmerman, and Cooper 2002).

Limbic system: The limbic system comprises several brain structures associated with memory and emotion.

Mediate: To be the medium of bringing about a result. Literally, it means 'middle.'

Mediator: One who interposes himself or herself in the middle between a person and some event, problem, conflict, or other perplexing situation and intervenes in such a way as to enhance meaning and self-directed learning. Based on Feueuerstein's 'Mediated Learning Experience' (MLE).

Mental map: A pathway held in the mind and used by a coach as a guide to interaction; a scaffold for a conversation. For example, Bloom's taxonomy is a mental map guiding a sequence of cognitive tasks.

Neurotransmitters: These are chemical messengers that carry, boost, or modulate signals between neurons and other cells in the body. They are related to mood, concentration, learning, capacity to attend, to think, and to have organs like heart and lungs functioning. Excitatory neurotransmitters stimulate the brain, inhibitory neurotransmitters calm the brain and balance mood. Over 100 have been discovered so far.

- Dopamine (both excitatory and inhibitory) has a number of important

- functions in the brain; this includes regulation of motor behavior, pleasures related to motivation, and also emotional arousal. It plays a critical role in the reward system.
- Glutamate (excitatory) is the body's most prominent neurotransmitter. It is important for neural communication, memory formation, learning, and regulation.
- Serotonin (inhibitory) is produced by and found in the intestine (approximately 90 percent) and the remainder in central nervous system neurons. It functions to regulate appetite, sleep, memory and learning, temperature, mood, behavior, muscle contraction, and function of the cardiovascular system and endocrine system.

Pace and lead: A coaching map used to restore a colleague's resourcefulness. Pacing and leading validates perceptions of a problematic state and helps the person envision a desired state. (See also Problem-resolving conversation .)

Paralanguage: Describes what is communicated and understood by the qualities of voice, body, gestures, and other nonverbal behaviors that exist alongside the words we speak. (The prefix para means 'alongside.')

Planning conversation: A structured interaction conducted before participating in an event, resolving a challenge, or attempting some task. The intent is to mediate the cognitive processes of planning. The coach may or may not be present during the event or available for a follow-up conversation. (See also Coaching cycle .)

Problem-resolving conversation: A conversation conducted when a colleague feels stuck, helpless, unclear, or lacking in resourcefulness; experiences a crisis; or requests assistance. The coach's aim is to have the colleague access the necessary internal resources for resolution. (See also Pace and lead .)

Reflecting conversation: A structured interaction conducted after participating in an event or completing a task, the intent of which is to mediate the cognitive processes of reflection. The coach may or may not have participated in or witnessed the conversation. (See also Coaching cycle .)

Resources: Internal elements used for decision making, problem solving, and effective action. Resources include electrochemical energy released by neurotransmitters and peptides related to accessing states of efficacy, flexibility, craftsmanship, consciousness, and interdependence.
