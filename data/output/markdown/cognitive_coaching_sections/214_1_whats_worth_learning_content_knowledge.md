## 1. What's Worth Learning? (Content Knowledge)

Expert teachers have a deep reservoir of knowledge about, and continue their learning of, the subject matter they teach. They know the structure of their discipline-its organizing principles and concepts. The greater their subject-matter knowledge, the more flexible and student-oriented they are in their teaching.

For example, when a biology teacher presents a lesson about which she has deep personal knowledge, she places fewer boundaries on class discussion and how lab work proceeds. She encourages students to explore more freely. She knows which significant questions to ask, and she knows which problems to pose so that students will inquire into and synthesize the most salient concepts of the discipline.

Teachers have always faced the problem of having more content to teach than they have time. Teachers who know the organizing principles of a discipline make better decisions about what to teach and what to omit. They also make better decisions about how to develop instruction, which effectively serves both short- and long-term learning goals.

For example, some organizing principles of literature are characterization, plot, setting, rising action, and falling action. Many forms of literature can be examined for these dimensions, such as plays, novels, or short stories. An example of an organizing principle in science instruction is the interaction of cycles. Rather than teach about butterflies in one unit, frogs in another, and weather in yet another, a teacher can use her understanding of cycles as an organizing theme to invite learning about comparisons, causal relations, and interactions among the cycles of many living organisms and environmental conditions. This provides the greater possibility of connecting to student interests, past knowledge, and learning styles.

Skillful teachers see their content not as an end but as a vehicle for fostering life skills. They use, for example, the teaching of calculus (or social studies or art) as a means of helping students learn to solve problems, to strive for accuracy, as a creative tool, or as a way to create intrigue, wonderment, and awe (Costa and Kallick 2014). One professor of mathematics considers his purpose is to have students 'fall in love' with math (Suri 2013).
