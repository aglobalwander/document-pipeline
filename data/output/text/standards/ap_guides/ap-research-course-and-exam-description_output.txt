About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students to
pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to
earn college credit, advanced placement, or both—while
still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects,
each culminating in a challenging exam, students learn
to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see
many sides of an issue—skills that prepare them for
college and beyond. Taking AP courses demonstrates
to college admission officers that students have sought
the most challenging curriculum available to them, and
research indicates that students who score a 3 or higher
on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic
success in college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s
syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some
of the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and AP
Exams are developed and scored by college faculty and
experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges and
universities in the United States grant credit, advanced
placement, or both on the basis of successful AP Exam
scores; more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and
exams emphasize challenging, research-based curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources. This
course and exam description presents the content and
skills that are assessed in the AP Research course.
Enrolling Students: Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically
challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to equitable preparation and
access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses: The AP
Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that
will enable students to develop the understandings and skills described in the course framework.
The AP Program has a short list of curricular and
resource requirements that must be fulfilled before a
school can label a course “Advanced Placement” or “AP.”
Schools wishing to offer AP courses must participate
in the AP Course Audit, a process through which AP
teachers’ course materials are reviewed by college
faculty. The AP Course Audit was created to provide
teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on
curricular and resource requirements for AP courses
and to help colleges and universities validate courses
marked “AP” on students’ transcripts. This process
ensures that AP teachers’ courses meet or exceed the
curricular and resource expectations that college and
secondary school faculty have established for college level courses.
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the AP teacher
and the school principal (or designated administrator) to
confirm awareness and understanding of the curricular
and resource requirements. A syllabus or course outline,
detailing how course requirements are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.

How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The AP
Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor; all
AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision, piloting,
and analysis to ensure that questions are accurate, fair,
and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development, College
Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher education
institutions. This feedback is carefully considered to
ensure that AP courses and exams are able to provide
students with a college-level learning experience and
the opportunity to demonstrate their qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
Please note: The information below is a general overview of how AP Exams are scored. For course specific information, please visit apcentral.
collegeboard.org/courses.
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam development process, relies on the expertise of both AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course
performance assessments, as applicable, are scored by
thousands of college faculty and expert AP teachers.
Most are scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small
portion is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly
trained, and their work is monitored throughout the
Reading for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves
as Chief Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP
Readers in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy
of the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a
curve. Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which
means that every student who meets the criteria for
an AP score of 2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no
matter how many students that is. The criteria for the number of points students must earn on the AP
Exam to receive scores of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that
research consistently validates for credit and placement
purposes—include:
§§ The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
§§ The number of points researchers have found to
be predictive that an AP student will succeed when
placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
§§ Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting
AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP
scores as follows:
AP
Score
Credit
Recommendation
College Grade
Equivalent 5
Extremely well qualified
A 4

B–, C+, C 2
Possibly qualified n/a 1
No recommendation n/a 2

While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and
universities. To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/ placement policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/creditpolicies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college
faculty members from around the world gather for seven
days in multiple locations to evaluate and score the
free-response sections of the AP Exams. Ninety-eight
percent of surveyed educators who took part in the AP
Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an AP
Reader, including opportunities to:
§§ Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning AP
Readers—both high school and college educators— make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the AP Reading.
§§ Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP
scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure to the
quality and depth of the responses from the entire
pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
§§ Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
§§ Score from home: AP Readers have online distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects. Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
§§ Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs): AP
Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.

AP Classroom,
Digital Activation, and AP Digital Portfolio
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students throughout
their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and students.
REQUIRED ONLINE SCORING TRAINING
Each year, AP Capstone teachers must take and pass certification tests in order to submit scores for
the presentation components of the performance tasks. This annual training is found in the Professional
Learning section of AP Classroom. Optional training modules are also available for other components of the assessment.
Digital Activation
AP teachers, students and coordinators must complete the digital activation process at the start of
the school year, which provides access to all AP resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and AP Coordinators to
complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following additional benefits:
§§ Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically designed to
support instruction throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
§§ Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will receive a set
of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student pack. The AP ID connects
a student’s exam materials with the registration information they provided during digital activation,
eliminating the need for preadministration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
§§ Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning Reports (IPRs)
that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.
Note: New AP Capstone teachers must attend required summer professional development and have their
AP Course Audit form approved in order to start the digital activation process and gain access to AP
Classroom and the AP Digital Portfolio.

About the AP Capstone™
Program
AP Capstone™ is an innovative diploma program from College Board that equips students with the independent
research, collaborative teamwork, and communication skills that are increasingly valued by colleges. AP Capstone
is built on the foundation of two AP® courses—AP Seminar and AP Research—and is designed to complement and
enhance the in-depth, discipline-specific study experienced in other AP courses.
In AP Seminar, students investigate real-world issues from multiple perspectives, gathering and analyzing information
from various sources in order to develop credible and valid evidence-based arguments. AP Seminar is a prerequisite
for AP Research. Completing AP Seminar and all its required assessment components is necessary for students
to develop the skills to be successful in AP Research. In AP Research, students cultivate the skills and discipline
necessary to conduct independent research and inquiry in order to produce and defend their scholarly work.
The AP Capstone program aims to empower students by:
§§ engaging them with rigorous college-level curricula focused on the skills necessary for successful college completion;
§§ extending their abilities to synthesize information from multiple perspectives and apply skills in new situations and cross-curricular contexts;
§§ enabling them to collect and analyze information with accuracy and precision;
§§ cultivating their abilities to craft, communicate, and defend evidence-based arguments; and
§§ providing opportunities for them to practice disciplined and scholarly research skills while exploring relevant
topics that appeal to their interests and curiosity.
Research Base
The big ideas and learning objectives in the AP Capstone program reflect the core academic skills needed for college,
career, and life readiness identified by leading educational organizations and College Board membership, including
the following:
§§ The American Association of Colleges and Universities (AAC&U), College Learning for the New Global Century,
Essential Learning Outcomes
§§ Advanced Placement Program, skills and practices identified in AP courses
§§ The Partnership for 21st Century Skills (P21), A Framework for 21st Century Learning

AP Capstone Pedagogical
Framework
Overview of the Pedagogical Framework
Throughout the program, students consider and evaluate multiple points of view to develop their own perspectives
on complex issues and topics through inquiry and investigation. The AP Capstone program provides students with
a framework that allows them to develop, practice, and hone their critical and creative thinking skills as they make
connections between various issues and their own lives. Teachers should help students understand that this process
is recursive, not linear. The recursive nature of this process allows students to go back and forth between the different
stages of inquiry as they encounter new information.

AP Capstone Reasoning Processes
The AP Capstone program allows students to develop and practice reasoning processes that help them to make
intentional, strategic decisions. It is important for teachers to understand these reasoning processes, which are embedded within the learning objectives:
§§ Situating — being aware of the context of one’s own as well as others’ perspectives, realizing that individual bias can lead to assumptions;
§§ Choosing — making intentional and purposeful choices, realizing that choices have both intended and unintended consequences;
§§ Defending — being able to explain and justify personal choices, logic, line of reasoning, and conclusions; and
§§ Connecting — seeing intersections within and/or across concepts, disciplines, and cultures.
AP Research Course Transferable Skills and Proficiencies
The AP Capstone reasoning processes are also embedded in the AP Research course transferable skills and
proficiencies. The transferable skills and proficiencies are high-level descriptions of the understanding, knowledge,
and skills that students should be able to apply in novel situations long after completing the AP Research course.

AP Research Course Description
(Note: AP Seminar is a prerequisite for AP Research. Completing AP Seminar and all its required assessment
components is necessary for students to develop the skills to be successful in AP Research.)
AP Research, the second course in the AP Capstone experience, allows students to deeply explore an academic
topic, problem, issue, or idea of individual interest. Students design, plan, and implement a yearlong investigation to
address a research question. Through this inquiry, they further the skills they acquired in the AP Seminar course by
learning research methodology, employing ethical research practices, and accessing, analyzing, and synthesizing
information. Students reflect on their skill development, document their processes, and curate the artifacts of
their scholarly work through a process and reflection portfolio. The course culminates in an academic paper of
4,000–5,000 words (accompanied by a performance, exhibit, or product where applicable) and a presentation with an oral defense.

AP Research Curricular
Requirements
The curricular requirements are the core elements of an AP course. The curriculum framework and supporting
documents provided during professional development serve as resources to assist teachers in determining the
appropriate level of evidence to include within their syllabi to meet or exceed the requirements. (All AP Research
teachers must attend College Board AP Research intensive training prior to their first year of teaching the AP
Research course.)
Evidence of the following curricular requirements should be included in the course syllabus developed by the
teacher and submitted to College Board for review and approval.
§§ Students develop and apply discrete skills identified in the learning objectives of the enduring understandings within the following five big ideas:
››
Question and Explore ››
Understand and Analyze ››
Evaluate Multiple Perspectives ››
Synthesize Ideas ››
Team, Transform, and Transmit
§§ Students develop an understanding of ethical research practices and the AP Capstone™ Policy on Plagiarism and Falsification or Fabrication of Information.
§§ In the classroom and independently (while possibly consulting any expert advisers), students learn and employ
research and inquiry methods to develop, manage, and conduct an in-depth investigation of an area of personal
interest, culminating in an academic paper of 4,000–5,000 words that includes the following elements:
››
Introduction and Literature Review ››
Method, Process, or Approach ››
Results, Product, or Findings ››
Discussion, Analysis, and/or Evaluation ››
Conclusion and Future Directions ››
Bibliography
§§ Using a process and reflection portfolio (PREP), students document their inquiry processes, communication with
their teachers and any expert advisers as needed, and reflections on their thought processes. Students have
regular work-in-progress interviews with their teachers to review their progress and to receive feedback on their scholarly work.
§§ Students develop and deliver a presentation (using an appropriate medium) and an oral defense to a panel on their research processes, method, and findings.

AP Research Curriculum
Framework
Overview of the Curriculum Framework
Based on the Understanding by Design (Wiggins and McTighe) model, this curriculum framework is intended
to provide a clear and detailed description of the course requirements necessary for student success. This
conceptualization will guide the development and organization of learning outcomes from general to specific,
resulting in focused statements about content knowledge and skills needed for success in the course. The
curriculum framework contains the following structural components:
§§ The course is organized around five big ideas. Tied to each big idea are several essential questions. These
are open-ended questions that encourage students to think deeply about a topic, ask additional questions and
investigate solutions, and develop the deeper conceptual understanding that the course seeks to foster. Teachers
should communicate to students that these big ideas are not meant to represent a linear progression of research
processes but instead are a recursive set of ideas and skills that the student researcher will strengthen by the end of the research process.
§§ Within each big idea are several enduring understandings. These are the long-term takeaways related to the
big ideas that a student should have after exploring the content and skills. These understandings are expressed
as generalizations that specify what students will come to understand about the key concepts in the course.
Enduring understandings are numbered to correspond to each big idea. The enduring understandings for the
AP Seminar and AP Research courses are the same.
§§ Linked to each enduring understanding are the corresponding learning objectives. The learning objectives
articulate what students need to be able to do in order to develop the enduring understandings. The learning
objectives will become targets of assessment for the course. Learning objectives are numbered to correspond
with the appropriate big ideas and enduring understandings.

Big Idea 1: Question and Explore
Inquiry and investigation begin when students encounter information about ideas, complex issues, and problems
that stimulates their intellectual curiosity. They then continue the research process by developing a critical question
about one or more of those complex issues or ideas. Seeking answers to such questions requires exploration of
numerous, often competing perspectives; the context surrounding those perspectives; and the reliability and
credibility of the perspectives. Through this exploration, students begin to develop their own perspectives, rather
than simply accepting those of others. They consider the purpose of their research — what is supposed to be
achieved and why. Ideally, they also develop additional questions that lead to further inquiry. The intrinsic value of
asking and answering questions cannot be overstated. Giving students the opportunity to dig deeper and feed their
curiosity makes for meaningful discoveries and discussions.
ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS §§ What do I want to know, learn, or understand?
§§ What questions have yet to be asked?
§§ How does my research question shape how I go about trying to answer it?
§§ How does my project goal shape the research or inquiry I engage in to achieve it?
§§ What information/evidence do I need to answer my research question?

Big Idea 2: Understand and Analyze
Developing understanding starts with comprehension of the concepts and perspectives under examination. Being
able to summarize by identifying and explaining the salient ideas in a text is foundational. When students summarize
and explain an author’s perspective to others, they are building understanding. Students must comprehend a
perspective or argument in order to be able to analyze it. That analysis — including consideration of the author’s
point of view and purpose, the reasoning and details the author selects, develops, and conveys, and the way the
author chooses to situate those details — in turn leads to greater understanding of the topic or concept being
explored. Students evaluate the validity of an argument by examining the strength of the line of reasoning and the
quality of the evidence the author uses. This level of understanding allows students to recognize the implications and predict the consequences of an argument.
ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS
§§ What strategies will help me comprehend a text?
§§ What is the main idea of the argument or artistic work and what reasoning does the author use to develop it?
§§ What biases may the author have that influence his or her perspective?
§§ Does this argument acknowledge other perspectives?
§§ How can I assess the quality or strength of others’ research, products, or artistic works?

Big Idea 3: Evaluate Multiple Perspectives
Understanding the complexity of an issue, idea, or problem requires students to compare and contrast different
perspectives. These multiple perspectives, which may support, oppose, compete with, or otherwise vary from
one another, come together to create the conversation on the issue. Students must consider the biases and
assumptions behind those perspectives in order to evaluate their relevance and importance in the conversation.
Evaluating multiple perspectives and arguments allows students to better understand the complexities of an issue or topic.
ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS
§§ How might others see a problem or issue differently?
§§ What patterns or trends can be identified among the arguments about this issue?
§§ What are the implications and/or consequences of accepting or rejecting a particular argument?
§§ How can I connect the multiple arguments? What other issues, questions, or topics do they relate to?
§§ How can I explain contradictions within or between arguments?
§§ From whose perspective is this information being presented, and how does that affect my evaluation?

Big Idea 4: Synthesize Ideas
Once enough information is gathered and evaluated, students synthesize their accumulated knowledge, emerging
ideas, and perspectives to form conclusions of their own. Students must consider other points of view but also
analyze material to develop their own perspectives and scholarly works. The goal is for students to think critically
about the information and then add to, not simply repeat, the ideas of others. In this way, students establish a
unique, creative voice within the larger conversation.
ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS
§§ How do I connect and analyze the evidence in order to develop an argument and support a conclusion?
§§ Are there other conclusions I should consider?
§§ How does my scholarly work emerge from my perspective, design choices, or aesthetic rationale?
§§ How do I acknowledge and account for my own biases and assumptions?
§§ What is the most appropriate way to acknowledge and attribute the work of others that was used to support my
argument? How do I ensure the conclusions I present are my own?

Big Idea 5: Team, Transform, and Transmit
Collaboration, communication, and reflection are skills that provide opportunities for students to develop their
learning. When collaborating, students draw upon their own strengths and the strengths of a team of peers, expert
advisers, and teachers to achieve their best possible work. Students should engage in peer review and personal revision to refine and tailor their arguments.
An argument is effectively communicated when its purpose is clear, it is tailored to a specific audience and context,
and it is conveyed through a medium appropriate and appealing to the intended audience. Adhering to standard
language conventions and engaging delivery techniques establishes a writer’s or speaker’s credibility with his or her
audience. Sometimes arguments or perspectives are associated with and accompanied by an innovation or artistic
work. These works should make clear the artistic choices for the aesthetic rationale or focus on one perspective over another.
Whether working alone or in a group, students reflect on their work and learning processes, which can lead to
personal growth as well as even more effective inquiry, learning, and collaboration.
ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS
§§ How can I best appeal to and engage my audience?
§§ What is the best medium or genre through which to reach my audience?
§§ How might I adapt my written and oral presentations for different audiences and situations?
§§ How might my communication choices affect my credibility with my audience?
§§ Which revision strategies are most appropriate to developing and refining my project at different stages?
§§ How do I provide feedback that is valuable to others? How do I act upon feedback I have received?
§§ How can I benefit from reflecting on my own work?

AP Research Instructional
Approaches
Organizing the Course
INQUIRY AND THE ACADEMIC CONVERSATION
Critical inquiry focuses on the creation of new ideas, perspectives, and arguments. Teachers must help students
understand that the research process is not simply about collecting evidence or facts and then piecing them
together. Instead, the research process is about inquiry — asking questions and coming to solutions and
conclusions through serious thinking and reflection. The researcher seeks relevant information in articles, books,
and other sources and develops an informed perspective built upon, but not merely derivative of, the ideas in the
examined material. As a result, the research process is recursive, meaning that the researcher regularly revisits
ideas, seeks new information when necessary, and reconsiders and refines the research questions, topic, and/or
approach. Additionally, students should understand that sometimes the inquiry leads to the development of an
additional piece of scholarly work (e.g., product, exhibit, performance).
Facilitating students’ entrance into academic or real-world conversations about complex issues is a key goal
of both the AP Seminar and AP Research courses. The AP Seminar course aims to build independent, critical
thinkers by empowering students to develop the skills and traits necessary for future academic study through the
examination of multiple perspectives, evaluation of credibility of sources, and construction of arguments. The AP
Research course provides students the opportunity to build upon these skills by choosing and deeply exploring
a topic or question of personal interest and developing and defending a more comprehensive argument and
conclusion. Throughout the research or inquiry process, students document and reflect on feedback received and
on their own thinking, writing, and creative processes through a process and reflection portfolio. The AP Research
course culminates in the students’ presentation and oral defense of their academic paper.
ORGANIZATIONAL MODELS
AP Research can be organized in a variety of ways to best address student interests, state and/or country and
district goals and requirements, and local school traditions and culture. Four examples are illustrated in the table on the next page.

Model
Description
Example Courses
Disciplinary Focus
The course content is grounded in a specific discipline.
AP Research: STEM Inquiries
This course is offered as an elective in science or math. The units of study focus on developing students’ understanding and implementation of research methods in STEM fields for an inquiry investigation of the students’ choice.
AP Research: Performing and Visual Arts
This course is offered as an elective for students with an interest in the various arts disciplines.
The units of study focus on developing students’ understanding and implementation of inquiry in the arts with an emphasis on developing a product, performance, or exhibit alongside the academic paper, presentation, and oral defense.
Internship
The course provides a framework for students in extracurricular internships of any discipline to receive credit for their research as long as it adheres to the AP
Research course assessment task descriptions and scoring guidelines.
AP Research: Independent Study
This course is intended for students who are already working with a discipline-specific expert adviser to conduct independent study in research of the student’s choosing. The teacher must act as the course facilitator in ensuring the expert adviser and student are aware of the course curricula, assessments, and timeline. The teacher
of record will still be responsible for scoring and uploading the students’ work.
Thematic Survey
Linked to AP Course
AP Research students are concurrently enrolled in another common AP course, allowing for team teaching and connecting of AP course-specific content with AP
Research skills and culminating in an academic paper, presentation, and oral defense.
AP Research: Biology
Students are concurrently enrolled in AP Biology allowing for cross-curricular connections between the two courses. Inquiry topics chosen by students are researched using the methods common to the field of biology.
General
The course focuses on research methods of two or more disciplines rather than any one specific field.
Research Methods
Students develop an understanding of the different disciplines’ paradigms, ways of knowing, and inquiry methods for the purpose of determining which method best fits their chosen topic of inquiry/research question. Each student then uses a selected method to complete his or her investigation.

BRIDGING FROM THE AP SEMINAR COURSE TO THE AP RESEARCH COURSE
To prepare AP Seminar students to enter AP Research, the next course in the AP Capstone program, teachers
should provide students with a preview of the skills, goals, and timelines of the AP Research course and how it
builds upon yet differs from AP Seminar. In AP Research, students further the skills they acquired in AP Seminar by
learning research methodology, employing ethical research practices, and generating, analyzing, and synthesizing evidence to come to a new understanding.
Upon completion of the AP Seminar End-of-Course Exam, students who will continue on to the AP Research course may also be given the opportunity to:
§§ Consider potential topics and questions to spark their interest in engaging in an individual research project
§§ Research potential expert advisers to guide them in the planning and development of their research project
§§ Engage in summer experiences that provide exposure to their research interests
In schools that permit students to begin the AP Research course in the summer, the AP Seminar and AP Research
course instructors should provide AP Research students with additional instruction, assignments, and avenues for
continued communication to guide them through the research planning process during the summer months.
A SAMPLE TIMELINE
Students’ online proposal forms for the Academic Paper must be approved by the course instructor by November 30.
The scores for the AP Research Academic Paper and Presentation and Oral Defense must be uploaded by April 30,
11:59 p. m., ET. AP Research teachers should devise a timeline to ensure adherence to these due dates and to
reflect the needs of the students, the culture of the school, and students who may begin research in the summer via
internships. A sample timeline follows on the next page.

Selecting and Accessing Resources
When selecting texts for study, teachers should challenge students to engage with and analyze complex and
scholarly sources. Helping students with the identification of scholarly materials requires a discussion of peer review,
which differentiates scholarly from nonscholarly sources in an academic research community. Students should be
invited to find and contribute texts for study, providing them opportunities to make connections of their own.
Access to a variety of print and online style guides, writing and argumentation handbooks, databases, and
other reference materials is essential to equip students and teachers with the tools necessary for research and
communication. To supplement the access to scholarly source databases that teachers provide to students,
College Board will provide both teachers and students free access to EBSCOhost. More information about
gaining access will be given to teachers during the mandatory professional development.
AP Capstone™ Policy on Plagiarism and Falsification or Fabrication of Information
Participating teachers shall inform students of the consequences of plagiarism and instruct students to ethically
use and acknowledge the ideas and work of others throughout their course work. The student’s individual voice
should be clearly evident, and the ideas of others must be acknowledged, attributed, and/or cited.
A student who fails to acknowledge the source or author of any and all information or evidence taken from the work
of someone else through citation, attribution or reference in the body of the work, or through a bibliographic entry,
will receive a score of 0 on that particular component of the AP Seminar and/or AP Research Performance Task.
In AP Seminar, a team of students that fails to properly acknowledge sources or authors on the Team Multimedia
Presentation will receive a group score of 0 for that component of the Team Project and Presentation.
A student who incorporates falsified or fabricated information (e.g. evidence, data, sources, and/or authors) will
receive a score of 0 on that particular component of the AP Seminar and/or AP Research Performance Task.
In AP Seminar, a team of students that incorporates falsified or fabricated information in the Team Multimedia
Presentation will receive a group score of 0 for that component of the Team Project and Presentation.
Engaging Community Members
Community members can play an integral role in students’ experiences with scholarly research. Discipline-specific
expert advisers can guide students’ formulation of research questions, interpretation of data, and the academic
paper or presentation revision process as well as provide critical, constructive feedback to strengthen students’
voices in the academic conversation. Institutional review boards can provide guidance on students’ designs and
approve students’ implementation of ethical research practices. Additional resources for training external expert
advisers on the assessment tasks and timeline for the AP Research course will be provided to teachers during the mandatory professional development.
A designated staff member may also coordinate a pool of expert advisers for the AP Research course and assist in
matching students with outside experts. AP Research teachers and school administrators should identify school
and district policies pertaining to students engaging virtually or face-to-face with external expert advisers and
communicate such policies to parents, students, and potential expert advisers.

Reviewing Student Research Proposals for Ethical Considerations
All research proposals should be reviewed by the classroom teacher for ethical considerations prior to data
collection. Multiple student revisions may be required before teacher approval is granted. In particular, research
with human subjects, animal subjects, harmful microorganisms, or hazardous materials requires special consideration by the teacher.
Research involving human subjects must be evaluated for:
a.	 potential harm to subjects that may result from their participation;
b.	 potential benefits of the research for the subject and the community as a whole;
c.	 procedures used to ensure the informed and voluntary participation of research subjects;
d.	 procedures used to ensure the confidentiality of research subjects.
Accordingly, the teacher must review any surveys, interview questions, questionnaires, or other interventions to
be used in a project, as well as student plans for protecting animal and human subjects’ well-being and human
subjects’ anonymity and/or confidentiality. Proposals that pose more than minimal risk to participants cannot be approved.
If students do not plan to present their findings on human subject research in a competition setting, and/or
disseminate their findings by publishing or publicly presenting their findings, teacher approval is sufficient.
However, there are two general circumstances in which additional review is necessary:
1.	 Students whose projects involve animal subjects, harmful microorganisms, or hazardous materials may require
additional review or approval by school or district processes.
2.	 Students who want to publish and/or publicly present their findings regarding human subjects research will
require an additional review and approval process by a federally registered Institutional Review Board (IRB).
Many communities have IRBs in local organizations such as high schools, science and engineering competition
organizations, community colleges, universities, and medical centers.
Teachers may work with school administrators to establish and register an IRB to evaluate research projects using
human subjects. The IRB registration process can be found at the link below or by searching “IRB registration instructions on hhs.gov:
https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/forms/irb-registration-instructions/index.html.
Participating in External Research Presentations and Competition Platforms
Students who choose to participate in any high school academic competitions (e.g., Regeneron Science Talent
Search, National History Day, Davidson Fellows, Stemanities Competition), should ensure that they, their faculty
advisers, and, if applicable, their external expert advisers are familiar with the rules and timetables for both the
relevant competition and the AP Research course. If students are submitting their AP Research work to competitions
prior to submitting to the AP Digital Portfolio for scoring, teachers should work with students on strategies on how to
receive feedback from competition judges without violating the AP Research rules on engaging with expert advisers
outlined on page 52. Specifically, students must make sure judges are aware that students are not allowed to receive
specific, directive feedback about their work prior to the final AP Digital Portfolio submission.

Preparing the Process and Reflection Portfolio (PREP)
The primary purpose of the process and reflection portfolio (PREP) is to inspire, support, and document the
students’ development throughout their research process. This portfolio should be reviewed throughout the year
as a formative assessment component of the course and should be maintained by the student as evidence of
participating in research to show to academic counselors, college admission officers, and faculty members.
Throughout the inquiry process, students will document their research and/or artistic processes and
communications with their expert advisers, pose questions they want to explore, and reflect on the decisions made
throughout the iterative research process. Students should also examine their strengths and weaknesses with
regard to implementing such processes and developing their arguments or aesthetic rationales.
Through the professional development experience, teachers will be provided with a list of optional questions and
tasks to help them guide students through the inquiry process. These questions help students in the early months
of the academic year as they begin the inquiry process and throughout the year as they examine, and reexamine,
their chosen areas of study and the process by which they engage in research. Teachers can also design their own questions and tasks.
The combined group of questions and tasks in the PREP document should address all five big ideas in the
curriculum framework (QUEST), with specific attention paid to the following:
§§ Choice of the research question and interest in the subject matter
§§ Directions in which the inquiry or project seemed to lead and changes to initial topic, question, assumptions, and research method
§§ Research method, including resources used (documents, people, multimedia, measurement instruments etc.) §§ Compilation and analysis of evidence
§§ Ways in which students have worked both on their own and as part of a larger scholarly community
§§ Challenges and solutions encountered throughout the research process
Teachers should regularly engage students in individual discussions or interviews to help them reflect on and
document their work, organize their time, and reach appropriate milestones. Teachers should also use these
discussions as opportunities to formatively assess students’ progress. The PREP should be used to inform regular
progress reviews throughout the year. Teacher and student preference can determine the format of the portfolio (electronic or hard copy).
In addition to responses to questions and tasks provided by teachers, the final form of the PREP should have a clear organizational structure and include:
§§ Annotated bibliography of any source important to the student’s work §§ A completed and approved Inquiry Proposal Form
§§ Documentation of permission(s) and approval(s), if required — for example, permission(s) from an IRB or
other agreements with individuals, institutions, or organizations that provide primary and private data such as interviews, surveys, or investigations
§§ Documentation or log of the student’s interaction with expert adviser(s) and the role the expert adviser(s) played in the student’s learning and inquiry process 45

§§ Feedback from peer and adult reviewers both in the initial stages and at key points in the research process;
reflection on whether or not this feedback was accepted or rejected and why
§§ Photographs, charts, spreadsheets, and/or links to videos or other relevant visual research/project artifacts
§§ Draft versions of selected sections of the academic paper
§§ Specific pieces of work selected by the student to represent what they consider to be the best showcase for their work
§§ Notes taken in preparation for presentation and oral defense
§§ Attestation signed by the student which states, “I hereby affirm that the work contained in this Process and
Reflection Portfolio is my own and that I have read and understand the AP Capstone™ Policy on Plagiarism and Falsification or Fabrication of Information” 46

AP Research Assessment
Overview
Students are assessed with one through-course performance task consisting of two distinct components. Both
components will be included in the calculation of students’ final AP scores.
§§ Academic Paper — 75% §§ Presentation and Oral Defense — 25%
AP Research Through-Course Performance Task
Weight: 100% of the AP Research score
Recommended Completion Date for Both Components: April 15
Submission Deadline: April 30, 11:59 p.m. ET
For this task, by April 30, 11:59 PM ET, teachers must:
§§ ensure each student has submitted their Academic Paper (AP) as final in the AP Digital Portfolio
§§ submit scores for the Presentation and Oral Defense (POD) in the AP Digital Portfolio
Note: Teachers must carefully plan a calendar that provides time for the task to be completed, scored (POD only),
and uploaded by April 30, 11:59 p.m. ET. Only the Academic Paper is uploaded to the AP Digital Portfolio.
RETENTION OF PERFORMANCE TASK PRESENTATION AND ORAL DEFENSE VIDEOS
AP Research teachers are required to keep video files of all performance task presentations and oral defenses
for a minimum of one academic year because College Board may request to review the scoring for these
components to identify samples for scoring training and to ensure scoring quality.
TASK OVERVIEW
Students design, plan, and implement a yearlong, in-depth study or investigation in an area of personal interest through
a chosen or designed inquiry method and develop a well-reasoned argument based on the evidence collected in an
academic paper of 4,000–5,000 words. As a culmination of their research, students deliver (using appropriate media) a
presentation and orally defend their research design, approach, and findings. Students whose academic paper
is accompanied by an additional piece of scholarly work (e.g., performance, exhibit, product) must arrange for the
teacher and panelists to view this work prior to the presentation and oral defense. Throughout the inquiry process,
students communicate regularly with their teacher and, when appropriate, consult with an internal or external expert.
COMPONENTS
The following components are formally assessed:

TASK GUIDELINES
Students develop a research question/project goal on a topic of their own choosing in an area of personal interest.
They submit an inquiry proposal (see Inquiry Proposal Form, p. 54) for the teacher’s approval, and teachers provide
feedback that helps students refine their research question/project goals.
With assistance from the teacher, students may identify one or more expert adviser(s) — internal or external to the
school — to serve as an additional resource. These individuals should be experts in the chosen discipline or field
that the student is investigating or in the research method that the student chooses to employ.
Under the teacher’s guidance — and using the expert advisers’ knowledge base as needed — students design
or choose a method to collect data and information and then analyze, evaluate, and select relevant and credible
evidence to develop a logical, well-reasoned argument or aesthetic rationale that results in an academic paper
of 4,000–5,000 words. The argument or aesthetic rationale must directly address the research question/project
goal. Upon completion of the academic paper, students will present their research question/project goal, method/
process, and conclusions to an oral defense panel. If the academic paper is accompanied by an additional piece of
scholarly work (e.g., performance, exhibit, product), this work is not formally assessed but is viewed by the teacher
and oral defense panelists to contextualize the student’s research.
Academic Paper (AP)
The body of the academic paper must contain the elements listed in the following table. These elements should be
presented in a style and structure appropriate to the discipline in which the topic resides (e.g., psychology, science,
music). Abstracts, if included, are not considered part of the body of the academic paper and are not assessed. The
academic paper must be written for an educated, non-expert audience.
Required Element
Description
Introduction and Literature Review
Introduces research question/project goal and reviews previous work in the field.
Synthesizes the varying perspectives in the scholarly literature to situate the research
question/project goal within a gap in the current field of knowledge.
Method, Process, or Approach
Explains and provides justification for the chosen method, process, or approach and its alignment with the research question.
Results, Product, or Findings
Presents the findings, evidence, results, or performance/exhibit/product generated by the research method.
Discussion, Analysis, and/or Evaluation
Interprets the significance of the results, performance/exhibit/product, or findings; explores
connections to original research question/project goal.
Conclusion and Future
Directions
Articulates the new understanding generated through the research process and the limitations of the conclusion or creative work.
Discusses the implications to the community of practice.
Identifies areas for future research.
Bibliography
Provides a complete list of sources cited and consulted in the appropriate disciplinary style.
The nature of students’ inquiries is open-ended in that students’ approaches to their investigations and the
type of research they conduct may vary widely. Students must avoid plagiarism by acknowledging, attributing,
and/or citing sources throughout the paper and by including a bibliography. Throughout the year and prior to
submission, teachers and students should constantly check work for plagiarism. Students must also observe
ethical practices when gathering information through means such as surveys, interviews, or focus groups, and
be prepared to sign agreements with individuals, institutions, or organizations that provide primary and private
data. Students should also be prepared to obtain Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval if engaging in research 48

involving human subjects when required. Graphs, figures, data tables, images, footnoted citations, appendices,
abstract, and the bibliography are not part of the total word count for the academic paper. Word count does include titles, sub-headings, and in-text citations.
Presentation and Oral Defense (POD)
All students will develop a 15–20 minute presentation (using appropriate media) and deliver it to an oral defense
panel of three evaluators. It is suggested that students’ oral presentation be no longer than 15 minutes to ensure at
least 5 minutes for the oral defense. The presentation and oral defense should take no longer than 15–20 minutes
total. Like the academic paper, the presentation provides an opportunity for students to showcase their research
by communicating effectively and succinctly to an audience of educated, non-experts. Students whose academic
paper is accompanied by an additional piece of scholarly work (e.g., performance, exhibit, product) must arrange for
the teacher and panelists to view this work prior to the presentation and oral defense.
The presentation should distill the student’s argument by:
§§ identifying the research question/project goal
§§ describing and explaining initial assumptions and hypotheses/ideas and their relation to the student’s personal conclusion
§§ providing the rationale for choices made during the research process (cite or attribute sources or evidence as needed)
§§ explaining the research process/method, evidence generated, conclusions, and implications
§§ engaging the audience through a dynamic use of design, delivery, and performance techniques
Following the presentation, an oral defense panel will ask three questions of the student. The panel must consist
of the AP Research teacher and two additional adult panel members (preferably expert advisers or discipline specific experts) chosen by the AP Research teacher. This evaluative component is designed to assess a student’s
articulation of the inquiry process, understanding of results and conclusions, and reflection on the research experience.
Three of these questions must be chosen from the oral defense question list, which is provided to students in
advance. The oral defense panel should ask one question pertaining to the student’s research or inquiry process,
one question focused on the student’s depth of understanding, and one question about the student’s reflection
throughout the inquiry process as evidenced in their process and reflection portfolio (PREP). The wording of the
questions may be tailored to a student’s specific project. In addition, a fourth question is permitted to clarify one
of the student’s answers to a previous question. Any additional questions beyond the fourth question are at the
discretion of the teacher but should not be used in scoring the oral defense.
Teachers should offer students presentation guidelines including best practices for delivering information (e.g.,
vocal and movement techniques, use of multimedia or visual aids). It is strongly suggested that students be given
opportunities to practice in front of their peers to gather feedback and learn how to respond succinctly to questions
and critiques. Such practice is important to assist students in preparing for their presentations and oral defense.
Oral Defense Questions
Research/Inquiry Process [choices made throughout the research process]
1.	 How did your initial exploration of the scholarly conversation lead to your final research question/project goal?
2.	 How did your review of the methods used by scholars in the field inform your selection of a research method/
process that is aligned with your research question/project goal?
3.	 How did the choices you made when designing or implementing your research method impact your research process?
4.	 How did you determine which results generated by your research method were most important in informing your new understanding?

AP Research Performance
Task: Academic Paper and Presentation and Oral Defense
Task Overview
In AP Research, you will further the skills you acquired in the AP Seminar course by learning
research methodology, employing ethical research practices, and accessing, analyzing, and
synthesizing information as you address a research question/project goal. To that end, you will
develop a research question/project goal on a topic of your choosing in an area of personal
interest. You will submit an inquiry proposal (see Inquiry Proposal Form, pp. 54-55) for the
teacher’s feedback to help you refine your research question/project goal/method and ultimately
approve your proposal prior to you engaging in the work.
With assistance from the teacher, you may identify one or more expert adviser(s) — internal or
external to the school — to serve as an additional resource. These individuals should be experts
in the chosen discipline or field that you are investigating or in the research method that you choose to employ.
Under the teacher’s guidance — and using the expert advisers’ knowledge base as needed —
you will design or choose a method to collect data and information and then analyze, evaluate,
and select relevant and credible evidence to develop a logical, well-reasoned argument or
aesthetic rationale (directly addressing your research question/project goal) that results in an academic paper of 4,000–5,000 words.
In addition to completing your research paper, you will:
§§ arrange for a viewing of additional scholarly work (where applicable)
§§ deliver a presentation (using appropriate media)
§§ defend your research design, approach, and findings to an oral defense panel

3.	 Presentation and Oral Defense (25% of the AP Research score)
Upon completion of your Academic Paper, you will develop a 15–20 minute presentation
(using appropriate media) and deliver it to an oral defense panel of three evaluators. Like the
academic paper, the presentation provides an opportunity for you to showcase your research
by communicating effectively and succinctly to an audience of educated, non-experts. If your
academic paper is accompanied by an additional piece of scholarly work (e.g., performance,
exhibit, product), you must arrange for the teacher and panelists to view this work prior to the
presentation and oral defense. Your oral presentation should be no longer than 15 minutes to ensure at least 5 minutes for your oral defense.
The presentation should distill your research by:
›› Identifying your research question/project goal
›› describing and explaining initial assumptions and hypotheses/ideas and their relation to the your personal conclusion
›› providing the rationale for choices made during the research process (cite or attribute sources or evidence as needed)
›› explaining the research process/method, evidence generated, conclusions, and implications
›› engaging the audience through a dynamic use of design, delivery, and performance techniques
›› using a medium and design specifically tailored to engage your audience and illustrate your points
Following the presentation, an oral defense panel will ask three questions of the student.
The panel will consist of the AP Research teacher and two additional adult panel members
(preferably expert advisers or discipline-specific experts) chosen by the AP Research
teacher. This evaluative component is designed to assess your articulation of the inquiry
process, understanding of your results and conclusions, and reflection on your research experience.
Three of these questions will be chosen from the following oral defense question list. The
oral defense panel will ask one question pertaining to your research or inquiry process, one
question focused on your depth of understanding, and one question about your reflection
throughout the inquiry process as evidenced in your process and reflection portfolio (PREP).
The wording of the questions may be tailored to your specific project. In addition, a fourth
question is permitted if a panel member wants you to clarify one of your answers to a
previous question. Any additional questions beyond the fourth question are at the discretion
of the teacher but will not be used in scoring the oral defense.

AP Capstone Tips for Students
1.	 Be prepared to perform your best on your assessment! Your academic performance provides
evidence of your academic achievements as a result of hard work in AP.
2.	 Send your AP scores! During AP Exam registration, be sure to indicate the code for the
colleges you want to receive your scores. This alerts them of your interest as a potential
applicant and invites college recruiters to reach out to you to learn more about your AP
Capstone experience and future research interests. The volume of AP scores received by
postsecondary campuses helps drive support for credit and placement policies.
3.	 Indicate your participation in AP Capstone and your future research interests in college
applications. It might prompt further consideration of your application and may even yield a scholarship possibility.
4.	 Be prepared to succinctly describe your AP Capstone experience and give a summary of
your research and findings. This brief conceptual summary will help you advocate for college
credit/placement and allow you to capture the attention of colleges offering undergraduate
research opportunities that you may want to explore.
5.	 Check the AP Capstone website for more information about the colleges and universities
that support the AP Capstone program and offer credit/placement for qualifying scores in AP Seminar and AP Research.
