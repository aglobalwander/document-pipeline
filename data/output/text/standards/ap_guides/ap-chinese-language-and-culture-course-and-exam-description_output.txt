For further information, visit collegeboard.org.
AP Equity and Access Policy
College Board strongly encourages educators to make equitable access a guiding
principle for their AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared
students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination
of barriers that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and
socioeconomic groups that have been traditionally underserved. Schools should
make every effort to ensure their AP classes reflect the diversity of their student
population. College Board also believes that all students should have access to
academically challenging course work before they enroll in AP classes, which
can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to equitable
preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.

About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills
that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking AP
courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and AP
Exams are developed and scored by college faculty and
experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges and
universities in the United States grant credit, advanced placement, or both on the basis of successful AP
Exam scores—more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources. This
course and exam description presents the content and
skills that are the focus of the corresponding college
course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also organizes
the content and skills into a series of units that represent
a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks
and that many AP teachers have told us they follow in
order to focus their instruction. The intention of this
publication is to respect teachers’ time and expertise
by providing a roadmap that they can modify and adapt
to their local priorities and preferences. Moreover, by
organizing the AP course content and skills into units,
the AP Program is able to provide teachers and students with free formative assessments—Personal Progress
Checks—that teachers can assign throughout the year
to measure student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students: Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically challenging coursework before they enroll in AP
classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is
only through a commitment to equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses: The AP
Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP
courses must participate in the AP Course Audit, a
process through which AP teachers’ course materials
are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.

=== Page 9 ===
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the AP teacher and the school principal (or designated
administrator) to confirm awareness and understanding
of the curricular and resource requirements. A syllabus
or course outline, detailing how course requirements
are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The AP
Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor; all
AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision, piloting,
and analysis to ensure that questions are accurate, fair,
and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development, College
Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher education
institutions. This feedback is carefully considered to
ensure that AP courses and exams are able to provide
students with a college-level learning experience and
the opportunity to demonstrate their qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam
development process, relies on the expertise of both
AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice
questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course performance
assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands
of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are
scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion
is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained,
and their work is monitored throughout the Reading
for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief
Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers
in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of
the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a
curve. Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which
means that every student who meets the criteria for
an AP score of 2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no
matter how many students that is. The criteria for the
number of points students must earn on the AP Exam
to receive scores of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently validates for credit and placement
purposes—include:
§Bullet The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
§Bullet The number of points researchers have found to
be predictive that an AP student will succeed when
placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
§Bullet Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP scores as follows:
AP Score

While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and
universities. To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/ placement policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/creditpolicies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for
seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score
the free-response sections of the AP Exams. Ninety eight percent of surveyed educators who took part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an AP
Reader, including opportunities to:§
Bullet Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading. §
Bullet Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP
scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure to the quality and depth of the responses from the
entire pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.§
Bullet Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel. §
Bullet Score from home: AP Readers have online distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects. Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details. §
Bullet Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs): AP
Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all assessed
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide scaffolds
skill instruction across units and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course themes and skills, create
customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.
* To report misuses, please call 877-274-6474 (International: +1-212-632-1781).

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:§
Bullet Teachers and students sign in to, or create, their College Board accounts.§
Bullet Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator. §
Bullet Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
Bullet Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP coordinator.§
Bullet Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and
AP coordinators to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following
additional benefits:§
Bullet Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
Bullet Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.§
Bullet Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student
pack. The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.§
Bullet Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

About the AP Chinese
Language and Culture Course
The AP Chinese Language and Culture course in Mandarin Chinese emphasizes communication (understanding and being understood by others) by
applying interpersonal, interpretive, and presentational
skills in real-life situations. This includes vocabulary
usage, language control, communication strategies, and cultural awareness. The AP Chinese Language and Culture course strives not to overemphasize
grammatical accuracy at the expense of communication.
To best facilitate the study of language and culture, the course is taught almost exclusively in Chinese.
The AP Chinese Language and Culture course
engages students in an exploration of culture in both contemporary and historical contexts. The course develops students’ awareness and appreciation
of cultural products (e.g., tools, books, music, laws,
conventions, institutions); practices (patterns of social
interactions within a culture); and perspectives (values, attitudes, and assumptions).
College Course Equivalent
The AP Chinese Language and Culture course is designed to be comparable to fourth semester (or the equivalent) college/university courses in Mandarin Chinese.
Prerequisites
There are no prerequisite courses; however, students
are typically in their fourth year of high school–level
study. In the case of native or heritage speakers,
there may be a different pathway of study leading to this course.﻿

AP CHINESE LANGUAGE AND CULTURE

Introduction
In today’s global community, competence in more than one language is
an essential part of communication and cultural understanding. Study of
another language not only provides individuals with the ability to express
thoughts and ideas for their own purposes but also gives them access to
perspectives and knowledge that are only available through the language
and culture. Advanced language learning offers social, cultural, academic,
and workplace benefits that will serve students throughout their lives. The
proficiencies acquired through the study of languages and literatures endow
language learners with cognitive, analytical, and communication skills that
carry over into many other areas of their academic studies.
The three modes of communication—interpersonal, interpretive, and presentational—defined in the
World Readiness Standards for Learning Languages are foundational to the AP Chinese Language and Culture course. The AP course provides students
with opportunities to demonstrate their proficiency in each of the three modes in the Intermediate to Pre-Advanced range as described in the ACTFL
Performance Descriptors for Language Learners. Its
aim is to provide students with ongoing and varied
opportunities to further develop their proficiencies
across the full range of language skills within a cultural frame of reference reflective of the richness of Chinese language and culture.
The AP Chinese Language and Culture course takes a holistic approach to language proficiency and recognizes the complex interrelatedness of comprehension and comprehensibility, vocabulary
usage, language control, communication strategies, and cultural awareness. Students should learn language structures in context and use them to convey meaning. In standards-based world language
classrooms, the instructional focus is on function
and not the examination of irregularity and complex grammatical paradigms about the target language.
Language structures should be addressed inasmuch
as they serve the communicative task and not as an end goal unto themselves. The AP Chinese Language
and Culture course strives to promote both fluency
and accuracy in language use and avoid overemphasis on grammatical accuracy at the expense of
communication. In order to best facilitate the study
of language and culture, the course is taught in the target language.

Course Framework
Components
Overview
This course framework provides a description of the course requirements necessary for student success.
The framework specifies what students must know, be able to do, and understand to qualify for college credit or placement.
The course framework includes the following essential components:
1
At the core of the AP Chinese Language and Culture course are course skills identifying what students
should know and be able to do to succeed in the course. Students should develop and apply the
described skills on a regular basis over the span of the course.
2   THEMES
The course is based on six recommended course themes that help teachers integrate language,
content, and culture into a series of lessons and activities. Within each theme are recommended
contexts and overarching essential questions that engage students, guide their classroom
investigations, and promote the use of language in a variety of contexts.
3
Foundational to the course are the three modes of communication: interpretive, interpersonal, and
presentational, as defined in ACTFL’s World Readiness Standards for Learning Languages. Throughout
the course, students demonstrate their abilities in the interpretive mode by engaging with written, print,
visual, audiovisual, and audio texts; in the interpersonal mode by speaking with and writing for others;
and in the presentational mode by speaking to and writing for an audience.
4   TASK MODELS
Each unit in the course features several of the task models that students will encounter on the exam,
which build in difficulty and complexity over time to the level that matches the exam’s expectations.
These task models include seventeen different types of activities (stimuli with questions) that
address interpretive communication and four free-response tasks that address the interpersonal and presentational modes.
Course Skills
The following table lays out the basic language and communication skills that students are expected to develop in
the course. As shown later, each skill is further broken out into concrete learning objectives, which are described in the section on Unit Guides on p. 17.

Course Themes
To provide context and content for students to develop their skills in the modes of communication, the course
takes a thematic approach. There are six suggested course themes: Families and Communities, Personal and
Public Identities, Beauty and Aesthetics, Science and Technology, Contemporary Life, and Global Challenges.
Families and Communities
Science and Technology
Contemporary
Life
Global
Challenges
Beauty and Aesthetics
Personal and Public Identities
Within each of these themes, there are five to seven recommended contexts. The course is organized thematically
into six units. Each unit targets a primary theme, but also connects to additional recommended contexts for
those themes. Teaching to multiple themes in every unit ensures a rich curriculum that will spiral, as the themes
are revisited through a variety of lenses throughout the course. This allows students to experience the study of
language and culture in a variety of authentic and engaging ways and provides teachers with the opportunity to
consider the interests and needs of their students when designing instruction. While teachers may organize the
course thematically in any way they choose, adhering to the recommended course design provided by the unit
guides that follow ensures that all the required courses themes are addressed multiple times in a scaffolded manner.
▪ National and Ethnic Identities ▪ Heroes and National Figures, Pop Culture Icons ▪ Gender and Gender Roles ▪ Personal Interests
▪ Self-image and the Role of the Individual in Society ▪ Nationalism, Patriotism, Global Identity and Responsibility ▪ Technology and Access to Technology ▪ Health Care and Medicine ▪ Climate and the Physical World ▪ Innovations and Inventions ▪ Effects of  Science and Technology on Self and Society ▪ Science and Ethics ▪ Architecture

ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS
Related to the themes are essential questions designed to spark curiosity and encourage students to investigate
and express different views on real-world issues, make connections to other disciplines, and compare aspects of
the target culture(s) to their own. Essential questions also lend themselves well to interdisciplinary inquiry, asking
students to apply skills and perspectives across content areas while working with content from language, literature,
and cultures of the Chinese-speaking world. Examples of essential questions appear in the Unit Guide openers.
Course Modes
As students work with course themes and consider essential questions, they do so while engaging in the three modes
of communication—interpretive, interpersonal, and presentational. The development of skills in each of these modes
forms the core of the units, as students build skills in listening, reading, speaking, and writing tasks of increasing levels
of complexity as they work through the course. Students are expected to build skills in the following areas:
Bullet Spoken Interpersonal Communication
Bullet Written Interpersonal Communication
Bullet Audio, Visual, and Audiovisual Interpretive Communication
Bullet Written and Print Interpretive Communication §Bullet Spoken Presentational Communication §Bullet Written Presentational Communication
Course Task Models
As students work with the modes of communication listed above, they practice various task models that
familiarize them with what will be on the exam while helping them build linguistic skills and cultural competencies.

Guides
Introduction
This course is organized into six units that are based on the recommended
themes. This creates an interesting, meaningful context in which to
explore a variety of language and cultural concepts in the interpretive,
interpersonal, and presentational modes. The themes in each unit help
teachers integrate language, content, and culture into an interrelated
series of lessons and activities that promote the use of the language in a variety of contexts.
This unit structure respects new AP teachers’ time by providing one possible
sequence they can adopt or modify rather than having to build from scratch.
An additional benefit is that these units enable the AP Program to provide
interested teachers with formative assessments—the Personal Progress
Checks—that they can assign their students at the end of each unit to
gauge progress toward success on the AP exam. However, experienced
AP teachers who are satisfied with their current course organization and
exam results should feel no pressure to adopt these units, which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

Skill Categories and Learning Objectives
At the core of the AP Chinese Language and Culture course are learning objectives that identify what
students should know and be able to do across the three modes of communication. The interpretive
mode is divided into four skill categories with underlying learning objectives. There are two skill
categories associated with the interpersonal mode and two with the presentational mode.
The table that follows on pages 19–21 shows all eight skills categories with their associated skills
and the learning objectives that will help students develop those skills.

UNIT 1
Developing Understanding
Unit 1 explores themes related to families in Chinese-speaking communities that provide a
meaningful context for students to acquire and develop a variety of language and cultural
concepts. While the primary focus will be on the theme of Families and Communities,
teachers should interweave the themes of Personal and Public Identifies, Contemporary Life,
and Global Challenges with the recommended contexts suggested below. Through exploring these relevant themes, students can:
§ discuss how families shape values and traditions as well as personal beliefs and personal interests.
§ examine challenges faced by families, such as access to education and jobs.
§ express their own understanding of the evolving concept and role of families in contemporary societies.
Using a thematic approach helps teachers to integrate language, content, and culture into
lessons that build skills in the three modes of communication—interpretive, interpersonal, and
presentational. The development of skills in each of these modes forms the core of this and all subsequent units.

Preparing for the AP Exam provides helpful tips and common
student challenges identified from prior exam data.
Families in Different Societies
UNIT 1
Building Course Skills
Students build skills in interpreting audio and written texts by
working on various listening and reading tasks. The listening
task models addressed in this unit include transportation
announcements, school conversations, and instructions.
Reading task models include emails describing a location,
poster announcements, public signs, notes, and short stories.
In performing these tasks, students learn to:
§ identify main ideas, details, audience, purpose, and point of view.
§ infer implied meanings through context.
§ explain how a text connects to the target culture.
Listening to, reading, and discussing audio and written texts in
the interpretive mode in this unit prepares students to engage
in the interpersonal and presentational modes as they:
§ participate in oral and written exchanges of information,
opinions, and ideas on aspects of family life in a Chinese speaking culture and another culture.
§ write formal and informal correspondence using the
appropriate style and a consistent writing system.
§ narrate a complete and coherent story consistent with the
pictures in sequence and demonstrate a clear progression
of ideas, using appropriate transitional expressions.
§ create a short written and oral presentation discussing
an aspect of a target community’s culture, using an
outline and cultural information acquired in Unit 1 through various sources.
Preparing for the AP Exam
This unit includes multiple-choice questions presented in
the format in which they appear on the AP Exam. Consistent
exposure to the exam’s format in all units helps prepare
students for the exam. As the units progress, the level of
complexity of selected materials and expectations for students’ performance increase.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE: MULTIPLE-CHOICE
In a school conversation, students may struggle to capture details. To address this challenge:
§ teachers can offer guided questions and explanations of
key words prior to listening to the conversation to help students target details as they listen.
§ students can respond to these guided questions to capture details during and after listening.
§ students and teachers can develop a class vocabulary
bank with key words and explanations. Students and
teachers can then add to this vocabulary bank throughout the course.
In notes, students may have difficulty identifying the purpose.
To address this challenge:
§ before reading, teachers can provide essential vocabulary
related to the note and add these terms to the class vocabulary bank.
§ students can then summarize or paraphrase the note after reading.
In short stories, students may struggle to identify the theme or
main idea. They may also find it challenging to make inferences
about the message of the story. To address these challenges:
§ in early course units, teachers can select brief stories that
have a simple storyline and ask students to identify the
theme and main idea. The short stories can increase in complexity in later units.
§ teachers can ask students to predict what may happen
next or how the story may finish during group reading of
short stories. This practice enhances students’ ability to make inferences.
This unit and those that follow include information about all
four free-response questions that align with the format and
instructions students will see on the AP Exam. Students
practice free-response questions with story narration, email
response, conversation, and cultural presentation task
models, with gradually increasing levels of complexity.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE: FREE-RESPONSE
Students may have difficulty typing characters correctly due
to mistakes in character selection or phonetic transcription.
§ To improve students’ accuracy, teachers can assign daily
practice in typing Chinese characters and identifying the desired characters.
§ With this practice, word(s) typed with the selected input
method will display multiple Chinese character options
on the screen. Students must identify and then select the
correct character(s), instead of choosing the one that is displayed first in the sequence.
In story narrations, students struggle to provide an
organized story with a beginning, middle, and end. To address this challenge, teachers can:
§ provide examples of stories in class outlining the beginning, middle, and end of the story.
§ ask students to brainstorm vocabulary and explanations and add to the class vocabulary bank.
§ ask students to describe the events in each picture.
Teachers can then suggest some transitional expressions that will link their ideas.
In email responses, students sometimes find it difficult to
understand the incoming email and may therefore provide a limited response. To address this challenge:

QUESTIONS §Bullet How does one’s identity evolve over time?
§Bullet How does language shape our cultural identity?
§Bullet How does technology influence the development of personal and public identity?
§Bullet How does the art of a community reflect its public identify?
Developing Understanding
Unit 2 looks at how language and culture influence identity in Chinese-speaking societies.
This relevant and engaging theme provides a meaningful context for students to acquire and
develop a variety of more nuanced linguistic and cultural concepts as well as vocabulary.
While the primary focus will be on the theme of Personal and Public Identities, teachers are
encouraged to interweave the themes of Beauty and Aesthetics, Contemporary Life, and
Science and Technology. For example, students could:
§Bullet explore how developments in science and technology impact language and the ways we
communicate and, ultimately, how we see ourselves.
§Bullet examine how social media impacts personal image and identity.
§Bullet consider the role of advertising in shaping personal and public identity.
§Bullet explore how a community’s identity is reflected in its art.

UNIT 2
The Influence of Language and Culture on Identity
Building Course Skills
In Unit 2, students build skills in interpreting audio and
written texts by engaging with various listening and reading
tasks. The listening task models addressed in this unit are
rejoinders, radio reports, and uncontextualized dialogues.
Reading task models include emails about a sequence of
events, advertisements, journalistic articles, event brochures,
and pen pal letters. Building on skills developed in Unit 1, in
this unit, students:
§Bullet identify perspectives, tone or attitude, main ideas, purpose, details, supporting ideas, and sequence of events.
§Bullet use context to deduce the meaning of unfamiliar words and explain or use idiomatic and culturally authentic expressions.
§Bullet use provided cultural and/or interdisciplinary information to determine the meaning of a text.
Practicing with task models in the interpretive mode prepares
students to engage in the interpersonal and presentational
modes as they:
§Bullet initiate, sustain, and close oral conversations and written
communications using simple and compound sentences
and a varied vocabulary that includes idiomatic and culturally appropriate expressions.
§Bullet continue to develop visual literacy through narrating
stories based on pictures with a clear progression
of ideas, including a beginning, a middle, and an end using transitions.
§Bullet deliver a short oral cultural presentation to explain ideas
and opinions with examples using the sources provided in this unit.
§Bullet write and respond to emails and letters using appropriate
register and a selected writing system consistently.
Preparing for the AP Exam
AREAS OF CHALLENGE: MULTIPLE-CHOICE
In uncontextualized dialogue, students find inferring implied
meanings challenging. Teachers can help students with
this challenge by exposing them to dialogues on a variety
of topics throughout the course with a gradual increase
in complexity:
§Bullet Early in the course, consider topics related to Families and Communities and Personal and Public Identities.
§Bullet As the course continues, increase the complexity of the
dialogues by selecting topics related to more unfamiliar course themes.
§Bullet As students listen to these dialogues, teachers can
discuss with students the main idea and the implied meaning of the dialogue.
In the pen pal letter, students have difficulty with comprehension. To address this challenge:
§Bullet early in the course, students can chunk the text into
small segments and work in small groups discussing and summarizing each chunk of text.
§Bullet students can identify and explain challenging vocabulary and add to the class vocabulary bank.
§Bullet students can also create questions and ask other
small groups to respond. These groups can review the responses together.
§Bullet as students’ skills improve, ask students to discuss,
summarize, and respond to larger portions of the text,
working their way to responding to the full letter.
In rejoinder questions, students often struggle to
understand the context and unfamiliar idiomatic and culturally
authentic expressions used. Teachers can address this struggle by asking students to work in pairs to:
§Bullet discuss the context of the conversation.
§Bullet list and deduce unknown words and add these words to the class vocabulary word bank.
§Bullet identify and explain idiomatic and culturally authentic expressions.
§Bullet review the four possible answers, select the best answer, and explain why the other three are incorrect.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE: STORY NARRATION
As mentioned in Unit 1, in story narration, students struggle
to provide an organized story. In addition to this challenge,
students struggle to apply a variety of vocabulary and
sentence structures to describe the pictures. As a result, they
fail to provide a full story with details and elaboration.
To address these challenges:
§Bullet students should build vocabulary in contexts related to
course themes. Instead of relying on isolated vocabulary
lists, teachers should focus on students’ acquisition
of contextualized vocabulary through authentic and
pedagogical sources. One way to build this contextual
vocabulary is through the building of, and continued
reference to, the class vocabulary bank that teachers and students began at the start of the course.
§Bullet teachers can provide scenarios of everyday life that
require students to use new vocabulary and sentence
structures to solve daily problems in the target language.

UNIT 2

The Influence of Language and Culture on Identity § § 49
One other challenge with story narration is in the effective
use of cohesive devices and transitional expressions when
narrating the story. Students may also list information with
little narration in fragmented sentences instead of providing
a well-connected paragraph-length discourse. To address
these challenges:
Bullet teachers should work with students to develop a robust
variety of transitional expressions and cohesive devices that go beyond the commonly used ”and,” ”but,” and “because.”
Bullet teachers can encourage students to frequently use these
expressions and cohesive devices by requiring their use in student work.

Developing Understanding
This unit explores themes related to the influences of beauty and art in Chinese-speaking
communities. While the primary focus will be on the theme of Beauty and Aesthetics,
teachers should incorporate the themes of Personal and Public Identities, Contemporary Life,
and Families and Communities by integrating recommended contexts from these themes. For example, students could:
§Bullet explore how art influences the quality of life and values in a community.
§Bullet consider the role/importance of art in Chinese-speaking communities.
§Bullet discover how the arts capture and reflect the history of a community.
§Bullet investigate how the concept of beauty is defined within a culture.

UNIT 3
Building Course Skills
This unit features listening task models that include
rejoinders, transportation announcements, and school
conversations. Reading task models include public signs,
poster announcements, emails describing location, and short
stories. As students’ skills increase, so should the complexity
of the content of the task models. Students build and refine
skills in interpreting audio and written texts by engaging with texts of increasing complexity as they:
§Bullet infer the meaning of a text, idiomatic and culturally authentic expressions, and unfamiliar words using
provided cultural and interdisciplinary information.
§Bullet identify the main idea, details, intended audience, point of view, tone, purpose, theme.
§Bullet identify and explain the significance, moral, or theme in short stories.
Practice in the interpretive mode prepares students to
engage in the interpersonal and presentational modes.
Building on skills developed in Unit 2, they:
§Bullet build the academic vocabulary needed for carrying out speaking and writing tasks.
§Bullet comprehend the speaker’s and writer’s messages and respond in a culturally appropriate manner.
§Bullet exchange information, ideas, and opinions on this unit’s themes using a variety of vocabulary and sentence
structures, standard conventions, and the appropriate
register for written language in emails and letters.
§Bullet identify, compare, and explain the relationships between
products, practices, and perspectives on beauty and aesthetics in the target culture.
Preparing for the AP Exam
As the primary theme for this unit is Beauty and Aesthetics,
students begin to move away from talking about topics
with which they have direct personal experience, such as
Family and Communities and Personal and Public Identities,
to talking about topics with which they may be less familiar.
These more complex topics require students to acquire more
information about their external world—introducing them to
unfamiliar and challenging vocabulary and requiring students
to make cultural and interdisciplinary connections. Teachers
can help students with this transition by providing exposure to more varied content about this theme.
In addition to moving toward more complex themes, teachers
should also work with students to develop strategies that
help them address challenging content with less teacher
assistance. This gradual release of control allows students
to continue to work through course challenges, even when
they make an error or are not completely certain of their
responses. Some examples of strategies for increasing
complexity and empowering students to identify and address challenges are shared below.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE: MULTIPLE-CHOICE
In transportation announcements, students may find it
difficult to understand details. To address this challenge:
§Bullet teachers should provide opportunities for students to
practice strategies for taking notes while listening to the
transportation announcements. Teachers can initially
provide a graphic organizer with key words and questions
that help students identify main ideas and relevant
details. As students’ skills increase, teachers can remove
the graphic organizer, and before students listen to the
announcement, have them list questions that will need to
be answered by the announcement so that they are able to identify main ideas and relevant details.
§Bullet teachers should encourage students to take notes as they listen, especially looking for key words.
§Bullet students can listen to the source multiple times, with
the teacher pausing occasionally to check for students’
understanding. Teachers can reduce the number of times
the recording is played as students’ skills increase.
In public signs, students may have difficulty making meaning
from words and expressions with no visual images. To address this challenge:
§Bullet teachers can select and introduce some commonly used
phrases and expressions that might be seen on signs.
§Bullet teachers can create assignments with words, commonly
used phrases, and expressions that students match to
the visual image that contains no phrases or expressions.
Students may enjoy completing this formative assignment in a class competition format.
§Bullet students can locate signs and create flash cards that
contain the phrases and expression and no visual images.
Students can practice in pairs with the flash cards.

UNIT 3
In poster announcements, students may struggle to identify
the distinguishing features such as purpose and/or intended audience. Teachers can address this challenge by:
§Bullet guiding students to discover these features by actively
deconstructing the text—stating its purpose, intended audience, and cultural connections.
§Bullet asking students to develop discussion questions based on
the purpose, audience, and cultural connections identified.
§Bullet asking students to work in pairs using the poster
announcement to answer the student-developed questions.
AREA OF CHALLENGE: EMAIL RESPONSE
As mentioned earlier in this guide, in the email responses,
students may find it difficult to understand the incoming email
and their responses might be limited, off topic, or inaccurate.
Students also often struggle with showing a progression of
ideas and addressing all the questions asked in the incoming email. To address these challenges:
§Bullet teachers can provide a sample email task from the
AP Central website and model how to identify each
question asked in the stimulus. Teachers can ask students
to brainstorm possible responses to the questions and
then lead the class in constructing a fully organized,
detailed email response that includes a greeting, closing, use of appropriate register, and responses to the questions.
§Bullet teachers can remind students to read the prompt
carefully and identify all the elements that must be
addressed in their response. When they finish their work,
students should review to make sure they have included all the required elements.
§Bullet students can then review a different email stimulus
and independently identify each question being asked.
Students can provide responses to the questions.
§Bullet students can practice using the prompt they used
to independently identify the questions and provide
responses. They can organize their responses into a
paragraph-length email response using expressions and
cohesive devices that have been discussed up to this point in the course.
§Bullet as students’ skills progress, before asking students
to respond to the incoming email, teachers can have
students work in pairs or small groups to discuss possible
responses with explanations without teacher input.
An additional area of challenge with the email response is
that students struggle to use standard conventions (e.g.,
punctuation) and appropriate register, word choice, and
sentence structures in the email response. To address
this challenge:
§Bullet teachers can provide a checklist of items for students to review after they have written their response.
§Bullet as students practice more and their skills improve,
teachers can remove the checklist and remind students to independently review their work based on their knowledge of items to look for in their review.
§Bullet as students revise their writing, students can develop
a habit of monitoring language production, recognizing errors, and self-correcting. Teachers should also encourage students to use the vocabulary, idioms, and sentence structures they are familiar with to answer questions.
As the course progresses and students independently write
longer, more organized, and more complex responses, it is
important to remind students to continue practicing typing
and identifying the desired characters or phonetic spellings.

How Science and Technology
Affect Our Lives
Developing Understanding
Unit 4 explores the effects of science and technology on people’s lives in Chinese-speaking
communities. This theme encourages students to work with more complex and academic
vocabulary and content as they continue to develop linguistic and cultural concepts from
previous units. Students continue to interact with more complex topics as they broaden their
vocabulary and communication skills by learning more about science and technology in the
target culture. While Science and Technology is the primary thematic focus of the unit, it is
possible to integrate the additional themes of Global Challenges, Contemporary Life, and
Personal and Public Identities. For example, students could:
Bullet explore how developments in science can both create and resolve challenges in contemporary society.
Bullet investigate how technology creates new ways for us to connect with others and how it
impacts and shapes our personal and public identities.
Bullet consider ways access to technology affects society and the quality of life.
§Bullet examine how science and technology affect the values and ethics of a community.

UNIT 4
How Science and Technology Affect Our Lives
Building Course Skills
In this unit, students continue working in the interpretive mode with audio and written sources of increasing
complexity. The listening task models for the unit include
rejoinders, voice messages, and uncontextualized dialogue.
Reading task models include event brochures, emails about
sequence of events, advertisements, journalistic articles, and
pen pal letters. Building on skills developed in Unit 3, students continue to use context to:
§Bullet deduce the meaning of unfamiliar words and infer the mplied meanings of a text.
i
§Bullet identify and describe features of sources, including intended audience, purpose, point of view, tone or attitude.
§Bullet identify sequence of events, main ideas, and details.
Practice in the interpretive mode prepares students to
engage in the interpersonal and presentational modes.
Students:
§Bullet provide and obtain information on the impact of the
development of science and technology on people’s lives
In the event brochure, students struggle to interpret the
text if they are unfamiliar with the event topic. To address
this challenge:
in written and spoken exchanges.
Bullet use standard conventions, a consistent writing system,
and appropriate register for written language in emails, letters, and narratives.
Bullet select resources and gather needed information for
preparing a short cultural presentation on the topics
addressed in this unit, including viewpoints, supporting evidence, and elaboration.
§Bullet apply appropriate and varied vocabulary and sentence patterns to create written presentations with an
introduction, development of topic, and conclusion.
Preparing for the AP Exam
As students prepare for the AP Exam, teachers should
encourage them to work more independently and develop
strategies to address content they find challenging.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE: MULTIPLE-CHOICE
In the voice message, the speaker’s speed of delivery and
presentational style may interfere with students’ understanding.
The content of the message may also be challenging if the topic
is unfamiliar to students. To address these challenges:
Bullet as students develop their skills, they can listen to
the source multiple times, with the teacher pausing
occasionally to check for students’ understanding. As
students improve their skills, teachers can decrease the number of times that a source is played.
Bullet students can become comfortable listening to the native
speakers’ speech by listening to various authentic audio
or audiovisual teacher-provided sources throughout the course.
§Bullet prior to listening to the messages, students can develop
a graphic organizer listing questions such as, who is the
speaker? what is the purpose of the message? that will likely be answered by the voicemail message.
In journalistic articles, students often have difficulty making
connections among cultural and interdisciplinary information provided. To address this challenge:
§Bullet teachers and students can continue to add challenging words and phrases to the course word bank.
§Bullet using their understanding of vocabulary, students can
predict and analyze the possible content of the text before reading.
§Bullet once the challenging vocabulary is identified and explained,
students can research cultural and interdisciplinary information provided in the news article and make
connections to content they have previously studied.
§Bullet teachers can introduce a variety of cultural event topics
with discussion questions throughout the course to help
students learn more relevant content related to the topics.
§Bullet as students’ skills progress, they can research cultural
event topics and develop questions while reading the
content. Students can then provide the text to their classmates and have them answer the questions.
AREA OF CHALLENGE: CONVERSATION
In the conversation free-response question, the challenge
of not fully understanding the interlocutor was shared earlier
in this guide. An additional struggle is speech delivery.
Excessive hesitation, vague pronunciation, and inconsistent
pace and intonation all affect comprehensibility in the conversation. To address these challenges:
Bullet students can listen to various authentic audio sources,
including conversations to get exposure to the flow of conversations.
§Bullet students can record and compare their own recorded speeches with exemplar samples available on the
AP Central website so as to identify and self-correct for
hesitations, pronunciation, pace, and intonation errors.
§Bullet students can also practice pronunciation and speed of delivery with a partner or teacher.

UNIT 4
How Science and Technology Affect Our Lives
An additional struggle with conversation free-response
question is that students sometimes provide irrelevant or
off-topic answers due to the misinterpretation of questions.
To address this challenge:
Bullet teachers should encourage students to listen and
carefully read and follow the directions in English.
§Bullet Teacher should encourage students who misunderstand
a turn in the conversation to do their best and continue to the next prompt.
§Bullet during classroom practice, teachers can have students repeat or rephrase questions to increase their understanding.
§Bullet ask students to work on speaking activities that require
them to provide answers with examples or justifications such as role-playing or holding a debate.
§Bullet teachers can invite native speakers from the local community with whom students can engage in spontaneous conversations.

UNIT 5
Building Course Skills
In this unit, students continue working in the interpretive
mode with audio sources, including rejoinders, school
conversations, and instructions; and written sources,
including notes, poster announcements, public signs, emails
describing location, and short stories. Sources in this unit are
equivalent in complexity to what students can expect to see on the AP Exam.
Students develop their ability to comprehend and interpret
information through audio and written sources of increasing
complexity as they:
Bullet acquire a variety of vocabulary from authentic sources related to the topics and themes in this unit.
Bullet identify or describe the main ideas, details, perspectives,
and connections among cultural and interdisciplinary topics.
Bullet use cultural or interdisciplinary information to infer meaning from a text and deduce the meaning of unfamiliar words through context.
§Bullet summarize and sequence information in narrative form.
Building on skills developed in previous units and practice
in the interpretive mode, students further engage in the interpersonal and presentational modes as they:
Bullet apply analytic skills, vocabulary, and sentence structures
gained from working with and deconstructing authentic
sources to prepare for speaking and writing tasks.
§Bullet converse on the topics in this unit using communication
strategies such as requesting clarification, asking for
repetition, and paraphrasing to maintain spoken and written exchanges.
§Bullet exchange viewpoints on cultural perspectives and
traditions and use cultural information acquired from
sources to prepare and deliver an organized cultural presentation.
§Bullet use appropriate register, standard conventions, and the
selected writing system consistently to work on writing
tasks such as an email response and story narration.
Preparing for the AP Exam
AREAS OF CHALLENGE: MULTIPLE-CHOICE
In multiple-choice questions for the instructions stimulus,
students sometimes find it difficult to identify the purpose
and details presented in this type of audio text. To address
this challenge:
§Bullet teachers should provide opportunities for students
to identify and explain unknown information based on
the context of the source, adding cultural background as appropriate.
§Bullet teachers can provide instructions written in Chinese.
Students can then explain the details included in the instructions.
In the email describing location, students may struggle to
completely understand details in the text about locations or direction.  To address this challenge:
Bullet teachers can provide a prereading warm-up exercise
(e.g., reviewing vocabulary and sentence structures for
giving directions, visiting places, and locating objects)
that can help students connect previous learning to
new knowledge and apply this knowledge to interpreting the text.
Bullet students can craft an email that gives directions from the
classroom to various points in the school (cafeteria, gym,
restroom, front office, etc.) and have a partner draw a map
summarizing how to get to the described locations.
In this unit, students continue to practice the four free response questions. Like the multiple-choice questions in the
personal progress check for this unit, these questions mirror
the complexity students can expect to see on the AP Exam.

UNIT 5
Factors That Impact the Quality of Life
AREAS OF CHALLENGE: Cultural Presentation
In the cultural presentation, students give an oral
presentation in which they demonstrate cultural knowledge
and linguistic accuracy as they describe a cultural practice,
product, phenomenon, or perspective and explain its
significance. Students can describe the selected cultural
topic; however, they struggle to explain why this topic is
significant. To help improve student performance on this task,
teachers can:
§Bullet explain what makes the cultural topic significant and
demonstrate for students how to explain the significance in their presentation.
§Bullet ask students to describe a cultural topic such as Chinese
myths or legends, historic figures, or new cultural
phenomena/changes to Chinese society. Then provide
guided practice in addressing the significance of the selected cultural topic.
§Bullet provide students with targeted vocabulary and
grammatical structures to be able to discuss these topics in Chinese.
Bullet provide sample student responses from the AP Central
website and the scoring guidelines for this task to
familiarize students with expectations for performance on
this task. Discuss low-, mid-, and high-level performances
and have students identify aspects of each one using the scoring guidelines.
Students do not always manage their time well when presenting. To address this challenge:
Bullet teachers can use a previous year’s cultural presentation
prompt from AP Central and have students brainstorm
how to respond and organize their presentation by writing
down key words or ideas in the order they want to include
them in their presentation. Students can then complete
this same activity individually using another prompt.
§Bullet students can listen critically to a wide variety of
audio presentations throughout the year, noting the organization of those presentations.
The cultural presentation question is one of the more
challenging questions on the AP Exam.  Successful students
generally have had significant classroom practice and have
received targeted and directed feedback from teachers.
Some strategies teachers can implement to help students build their presentation skills include:
Bullet
Bullet breaking skills down incrementally.
providing practice over time to develop each skill.
Bullet providing timely and focused feedback. Let students
know where they have done well and where they need to
improve. Watch for improvement in individual students’
skills and provide encouragement as students practice and improve.
§Bullet providing opportunities for students to practice
with a partner and receive feedback to improve their
delivery. Practicing with a partner not only improves the
presenter’s presentation, but also provides an opportunity
for the student providing feedback to reflect on areas where their own presentation skills can improve.
§Bullet ensuring that students understand the scoring guidelines.
As discussed above, the scoring samples on AP Central
can provide a wealth of knowledge for students on how
the question is scored and, therefore, how students can organize and present their cultural presentation.

QUESTIONS §Bullet How do environmental, political, and societal challenges positively and negatively impact communities?

§Bullet What are possible solutions to those challenges?
§Bullet What role do individuals play in addressing complex societal issues?
Environmental,
Political, and Societal Challenges
Developing Understanding
This final unit explores themes related to how complex issues and phenomena affect
people’s lives in Chinese-speaking communities. Engaging with the primary theme of Global
Challenges encourages students to use more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence
structure as they continue to refine their knowledge of linguistic and cultural concepts. This
unit presents one of the most challenging and abstract themes in that the content requires
students to understand information about economic, environmental, population, and
demographic issues in the target language. These topics require sophisticated vocabulary
and linguistic concepts. The unit also connects to the themes of Contemporary Life, Science
and Technology, and Families and Communities. For example, students could:
§Bullet investigate how economic developments and environmental challenges often impact
society and politics on a larger scale, which in turn affects individual families and communities.
§Bullet explore how individuals can positively or negatively influence the world around them.
§Bullet develop possible solutions that address contemporary global challenges.

UNIT 6
Building Course Skills
In this last unit, students practice multiple-choice questions
related to the following task types: rejoinders, voice
messages, uncontextualized dialogue, radio reports,
advertisements, event brochures, emails about sequence
of events, and journalistic articles. Students develop their
ability to comprehend and interpret information at the same
level of complexity they can expect to see on the AP Exam as
they describe the factual meaning of the text and identify its
features. Students:
§Bullet discuss and compare environmental, political, and
societal challenges between the target community and their own community.
§Bullet describe and explain cultural practices and perspectives related to the unit’s theme.
Building on skills developed in previous units and practicing
in the interpretive mode, students continue engaging in the interpersonal and presentational modes as they:
§Bullet carry out conversations or interviews on the topics addressed in this unit.
Bullet use cultural information acquired from sources in Unit 6
to prepare and deliver an organized cultural presentation related to this unit’s theme.
§Bullet provide and explain viewpoints with supporting details and elaboration.
Bullet compose replies to emails by providing suggestions
with justifications on the specific topic addressed by the other party.
§Bullet develop visual literacy by narrating stories (based on
visuals) that reflect a clear progression of ideas, including a beginning, a middle, and a conclusion.
Preparing for the AP Exam
In this final unit, students continue to apply their growing
knowledge and competencies in a variety of contexts and real world scenarios. Listening and reading examples are equal in
complexity and difficulty to what students will experience on
the AP exam and should be performed under exam conditions.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE: MULTIPLE-CHOICE
In radio reports, students may struggle to identify relevant details.
§Bullet In earlier units, teachers may have anticipated which
interdisciplinary information or vocabulary would be
challenging to students and provided explanations. This strategy can be used throughout the units.
§Bullet As students are coming to the end of the course and
preparing for the exam, ask them to predict relevant
vocabulary related to the theme of the unit that may be
used in the radio report. Then ask students to decode the
vocabulary as best as they can using tools as needed,
including the context and any prior knowledge about the content to identify relevant details.
In advertisements, students may not recognize unfamiliar
terms, professional phrases, or cultural elements. To address
this challenge:
§Bullet Teachers can select some authentic advertisement
resources on familiar topics and have students work in pairs to identify relevant details.
§Bullet When encountering unknown information, teachers can
encourage students to make educated guesses using cues from the sources.
Bullet Students should use the class vocabulary bank and their
prior knowledge to understand the content and answer the questions.
In emails about sequence of events, students may feel
confused about various details that appear in the text. To address this challenge:
§Bullet students can list each event or activity presented in the
text in order, and then look for key words such as time
adverbs, dates, and transitional phrases to describe the
literal meaning and interpret features of the text.
§Bullet students can use the context of the email to eliminate
incorrect responses and select the best answer choice.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE: FREE-RESPONSE
Students have been practicing the writing tasks for the free response questions throughout the year. As students prepare
for the AP Exam, on both writing tasks, email response and story narration, encourage them to:
§Bullet create an outline to organize their ideas before writing
Bullet Determine what information needs to be included based on the information in the prompt.
◆
Bullet Determine what information should come at the beginning, middle, and end of their response.
◆
Bullet Determine transitional and cohesive devices that will communicate the organization of their response.
§Bullet remind students to use standard conventions for written
language and consistently use the selected writing system while writing.
§Bullet remind students to leave time to review and revise after
they have written their response. Ask them to list what
they should be checking in their writing essay review.

§Bullet monitor their language production and try to self-correct
when they make a mistake, as they are not penalized for doing so on the exam.
§Bullet continue with the conversation even if they realize they
misunderstood one of the turns in the conversation, and
listen carefully to the next prompt from the interlocutor to get back on track.
§Bullet use communication strategies such as circumlocution and paraphrasing to maintain spoken exchanges and presentations.
For both writing and speaking tasks, students need to:
§Bullet pay attention to register and try to avoid shifting register during their responses.
§Bullet continue to focus on completing each task by addressing all aspects of each prompt.
By this point in the course, students should be very familiar
with the instructions, formats, and expectations for each
of the free-response questions and know how to follow
directions on the exam. Successful students generally
provide their own viewpoints, supporting evidence,
elaboration, and significant details in organized responses.

Selecting and Using Course Materials
As the course develops real-world communicative and
cultural competencies, it is critical to integrate a variety
of authentic materials into instruction and assessment.
Authentic materials are texts or resources designed for
native speakers of the language and not created for the
language classroom. Such authentic materials include, but are not limited to:
§Bullet websites
§Bullet newspapers, magazines, and other printed sources §Bullet short stories §Bullet blogs and other social media §Bullet podcasts §Bullet music
§Bullet videos: films, advertisements, news programs,
TV shows §Bullet radio broadcasts
There are several textbooks designed for AP Chinese
Language and Culture. Some provide ways to organize the
course, as well as instructional and assessment strategies,
while others specifically focus on preparing students
for the AP Exam. As textbooks that use a variety of
authentic materials are limited, teachers can assemble
materials selected from different texts or resources with
modified pedagogical materials that broaden or deepen each theme and are appropriate to their students’ cognitive level and needs.
Teachers can find multifunctional learning tools that teach Chinese pronunciation, characters,
and grammar as well as culture at chinese-tools.com.
This resource also has annotation tools, dictionaries,
and converters for Pinyin, Unicode, and simplified and
traditional Chinese, as well as information on Chinese
Input Method Editor.
zhongwen.com is a useful site that contains a comprehensive and easy to use Chinese dictionary
searchable by pronunciation, radical, stroke count, or English word.
approach for instruction, performance and assessment are foundational to AP world language and culture courses and exams.
The American Council on the Teaching of Foreign
Languages (ACTFL) is the largest organization of world
language educators in the USA. ACTFL’s standards and actfl.org
ACTFL offers many documents that inform instruction
and assessment:
§Bullet World‑Readiness Standards for Learning
Languages This document provides “a roadmap to guide learners to develop competence to communicate effectively and interact with
cultural competence to participate in multilingual communities at home and around the world.”
The five goal areas (Communication, Culture,
Connections, Comparisons, Communities) of language constitute the standards for language acquisition. This document is foundational for AP world language and culture courses.
§Bullet Performance Descriptors for Language Learners
This document defines and describes the levels of language performance (Novice, Intermediate,
Advanced) in each of the modes of communication
that result from explicit instruction in a classroom
setting. It explains the difference between proficiency and performance. AP world language courses base expectations for performance on this document.
§Bullet ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines 2012 This site defines
and describes the levels of proficiency in speaking, writing, listening, and reading that result from language learned within and beyond the classroom.
§Bullet
This document guides language learners to identify, set learning goals, and chart their progress
toward language and intercultural proficiency. The statements are organized according to the modes
of communication. This resource helps students and teachers establish reasonable goals for progress.
§Bullet The Language Educator This publication for ACTFL members (four issues per year) provides educators of all languages and at all levels with a single, comprehensive source of news and information
§Bullet Foreign Language Annals This official refereed
journal of current scholarly research in languages is
published by ACTFL and available to ACTFL members.

teachers should incorporate a variety of instructional
approaches into their daily lessons and activities.
Teachers can help students develop the skills by

engaging them in learning activities that allow them to apply their understanding of course concepts.
Teachers may consider the following strategies as they
plan instruction.  In the skills tables that follow these
instructional strategies, we provide some selected
strategies to show how they might be used to develop specific skills.
Receptive Skills: Interpretive Mode: (making meaning of written, print, visual, audiovisual, and audio texts)

Developing Course Skills
Throughout the AP Chinese Language and Culture course, students develop skills that are fundamental to the
learning of a language and culture and to communicating effectively across the three modes of communication.
Since these disciplinary practices represent the complex language and communication skills that adept
language-learners need to develop, students will benefit from multiple opportunities to develop and practice these skills in a scaffolded manner.
Skill Category 1: Comprehend Written, Audio, Audiovisual, and Visual Text
The comprehension of texts is essential to learning a language and culture because it represents foundational input that is necessary to produce
language.  Much of the course content is delivered
through print, written, visual, audiovisual, and audio
texts; therefore, students must be able to engage with
and comprehend information conveyed in a wide variety of interdisciplinary texts.
Comprehending texts requires students to be
skilled at decoding unfamiliar language, understand
vocabulary in context, and use contextual clues when
dealing with challenging text. Teachers can encourage students to persevere and practice, and they can
address issues by the careful selection of texts and by designing carefully scaffolded instruction.
Below are some suggested strategies for instruction.
Skill Category 1: Comprehend written, audio, audiovisual, and visual text

Skill Category 2: Make Cultural and Interdisciplinary Connections
One of the “5Cs” (Communication, Culture,
Connections, Comparisons, and Communities) that is foundational to ACTFL’s standards for language
learning is “connections,” i.e., making connections
among interdisciplinary and/or cultural topics. In AP world language classrooms, the content is
interdisciplinary and culturally oriented by nature and
what is studied is related to other disciplines that go well beyond the language classroom.
Teachers can work with students to develop their
ability to make cultural connections by helping them to recognize and understand cultural references
in texts. When working with interdisciplinary texts
teachers can provide opportunities for students to
make connections with prior learning. They can help
students understand the context of a text and teach
strategies for students to use context to understand
the text. Teachers can also keep students’ interests in
mind as they choose texts and materials to work with,
as students are more likely to persevere with a text that engages them.
It’s a good idea to actively encourage students to make
cross-disciplinary and cultural connections by using
activating strategies, such as advance organizers or
anticipatory sets of questions. Consistent exposure to
interdisciplinary and cultural topics will build confidence and competence in the skill of making connections during the course.
Below are some suggested strategies for instruction.

its literal meaning. It requires students to identify
distinguishing textual features (purpose, audience, point of view, style, theme, moral, tone), infer implied meanings, and identify and understand cultural nuances. Students also need to recognize relationships between texts.
In interpreting content, students will need to employ
the same skills they use for comprehending and making
interdisciplinary or cultural connections—decoding unfamiliar language, working on understanding
vocabulary in context, using contextual clues, and
persevering with challenging text. Teachers can help
students by selecting texts that incrementally introduce
challenging content, designing appropriately scaffolded
instruction and providing well-crafted guiding questions
that will lead students to discover the more abstract elements of a text.
Below are some suggested strategies for instruction.

Skill Category 4: Make Meanings from Words and Expressions
Making meaning from unfamiliar words or expressions is essential to demonstrate comprehension of any text. While students do not
have to understand every word to understand a text, they need to become adept at decoding unfamiliar vocabulary by using context clues that appear.
Students need encouragement to persist and take risks when engaging with a source. This may mean
withholding correction as students make a few errors
when they encounter unfamiliar words or expressions.
Teachers can encourage students’ growth in making meanings from words and expressions through
consistent practice with texts that contain unknown
vocabulary and have rich examples of idiomatic and
cultural expressions. Teachers can guide students to
decode words by looking at prefixes, suffixes, word
stems, and radicals; as well as looking for context clues, word derivations and cultural concepts.
Below are some suggested strategies for instruction.

Skill Category 5: Communicate Interpersonally by Speaking with Others
Learning to speak with others constitutes a main reason
why students enroll in language and culture courses.
Spontaneous speech is one of the most difficult skills
for students to achieve. Therefore, it is critical to provide
students with multiple and ongoing opportunities to speak with each other.
The more students practice this skill, the more likely students will produce language that is comprehensible to native speakers of the target
language. Students need opportunities to speak the
language in authentic situations in order to progress beyond using memorized words and phrases.
They need to work on communicating messages effectively, practice listening to the spoken language to increase comprehension, and become comfortable speaking spontaneously.
Teachers can establish a classroom culture where
students feel comfortable taking risks by providing
timely and directed feedback that encourages students to continue to practice for improvement.
Below are some suggested strategies for instruction.

Skill Category 6: Communicate Interpersonally by Writing to Others
Being able to communicate with others through writing
constitutes another main reason why students enroll
in language and culture courses. Written interpersonal communication is an important real-life skill to
develop within the language classroom. Therefore, it
is critical to provide students with multiple and ongoing
opportunities to write to others in both the formal and informal registers.
The more students practice writing texts, notes, emails,
and letters, the more likely they will produce written
language that is comprehensible to native speakers of the target language.
In order to communicate successfully in writing in the interpersonal mode, students need to practice §Bullet building their vocabulary §Bullet
and identifying the correct characters from a list of available characters displayed on the computer screen typing accurate phonetic spellings, recognizing
§Bullet communicating their message using accurate grammatical and syntactic structures
§Bullet working to comprehend the incoming message
§Bullet consistently using the appropriate register
§Bullet providing sufficient information, elaboration, and details §Bullet developing an organized, cohesive message
Teachers can help students by actively teaching all
aspects of successful interpersonal writing, breaking
down the writing task into a step-by-step process, and
providing timely and directed feedback that encourages students to continue to practice for improvement.

Skill Category 7: Communicate Through Spoken Presentations
Presenting information orally is an important way that students demonstrate their ability to communicate
effectively in the language. Spoken presentations can be
challenging to students, as they need to communicate
ideas related to a variety of interdisciplinary and
cultural topics in an organized and engaging manner.
Many students find speaking in front of a group to be
challenging and stressful. They are apprehensive about
making mistakes and effectively communicating their
message. The ability to carefully plan and outline key
ideas and main points is critical so that students will
present information without relying on memorizing or
reading their presentations. Therefore, teachers should
give students multiple and ongoing opportunities to give oral presentations.
In order to be successful in their oral presentations,
students need to:
§Bullet employ vocabulary and grammatical and syntactical structures to effectively convey their thoughts.
§Bullet organize their information to deliver an effective presentation
§Bullet use strong transitional expressions and cohesive devices that guide the listener’s understanding.
Students should also be encouraged to take risks, as
they will likely make errors in their presentations. By
practicing this skill regularly, students will become more
comfortable and confident in presenting orally. Students
should receive feedback that helps them improve not
only the content and accuracy of their presentation but also their confidence in their presentational
skills.  As the year progresses, they will acquire more
interdisciplinary vocabulary and more complex language
structures to support longer and more sophisticated oral presentations.

Skill Category 8: Communicate Through Written Presentations
Presenting information in writing is an important way
that students demonstrate their ability to communicate
effectively in the language. Presentational writing can be
challenging to students, as students are often required
to effectively express and explain complex ideas and
support them with evidence from sources. The ability
to conduct research, evaluate sources, and then extract
relevant information from sources is an important part
of creating effective written presentations. Therefore, it
is critical to provide students with multiple and ongoing
opportunities to present their ideas in written form.
In order to be successful in their written presentations, students need to §Bullet employ academic vocabulary
§Bullet type accurate phonetic spellings, and recognize
and identify the correct characters from a list of available characters displayed on the computer screen §Bullet use effective grammatical and syntactical structures §Bullet develop organizational skills
§Bullet use effective transitional expressions and cohesive devices to guide the reader’s understanding §Bullet include relevant evidence from sources.
Teachers can address these struggles by actively teaching a writing process. Teach students how
to create a step-by-step plan to produce a written
presentation to help them create well-organized written
work that has a logical flow. Make sure that students
know the importance of taking time to proofread their
work to correct errors in structure and mechanics.
Teachers can provide targeted feedback on grammatical and syntactical errors to improve the
comprehensibility of students’ work. The more students
practice these skills, the more likely it is that they will become effective in communicating their ideas in
writing. With practice and feedback, they will acquire
the academic vocabulary, organizational skills, and
appropriate conventions of written language to create effective written presentations.
