## How Mediation Affects the Brain

[The] talking cure can physically change the brain and . . . anytime you have a change in behavior you have a change in the brain.

-Lewis Baxter, psychiatrist, UCLA

Feuerstein (1999, 276) believes that mediation produces new connections in the brain. He states:

One of the most interesting and exciting aspects of mediated learning . . . is that the quality of interaction not only changes the structure of behavior of the individual, not only changes the amount and quality of his repertoire, but-according to increasingly powerful sources of evidence from fields of neurophysiology and biochemistry-changes the structure and functioning of the brain itself in very meaningful ways.

This idea finds support from many quarters. Neuroscientist Gerald Edelman proposes that the brain reconstructs itself from experience. One commonly understood example of this is the neural pruning that occurs within the first two years of life (Shonkoff and Phillips 2000), cauterizing neural capacities for distinguishing sounds outside one's own language group. Ornstein (1991) claims, 'To make a personal change, we have to be able to observe the automatic workings inside ourselves.' This requires the kind of consciousness evoked by mediation. He describes the brain as having a neural selection system that wires up the nervous system differently, depending on the demands on the organism. Managing and

developing the mind is to bring automatic processes into consciousness. From another quarter, neuroscientists have found that the flashes of insight that precede 'Aha!' moments are accompanied by a large burst of neural activity in the brain's right hemisphere (Pink 2006). Furthermore, Damasio (2010, 271) reports that constant practice produces a skill set that become 'second natured' into the cognitive unconscious. Consciously the mediator pays attention to the goal, allowing more automatic skills held at unconscious levels of competence to manage other aspects of the conversation. While this is true about developing as a mediator, it is also true that the person being coached, over repeated events, begins to internalize the coaching maps used by the mediator as his/her own approach to planning and examining his/her teaching.
