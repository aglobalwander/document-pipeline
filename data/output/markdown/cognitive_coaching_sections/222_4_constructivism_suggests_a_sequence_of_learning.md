## 4. Constructivism Suggests a Sequence of Learning

Constructivists such as Taba (1965), Bruner (1960), Piaget (1950) and Feuerstein, Falik, and Feuerstein (2015) believe that there is a sequence to concept formation in which learning begins with gathering sensory data, then making sense of the data (elaborating) by finding patterns and relationships, and then applying those concepts to new problems.

The first stage is the input or 'discovery' stage in which data are taken in through the senses and drawn from memory. It is an open-ended opportunity to 'mess around' and become familiar with materials and to generate questions and hypotheses.

Next is the processing stage in which patterns are found, meaningful relationships are elaborated, and concepts are constructed from those data. New labels for concepts are formed, hypotheses are drawn, and inferences are made.

The third step, the output or 'concept application' stage, is when further iterations of the discovery are made, generalizations and principles are formed, and these are then used as models to explain problems and predict consequences in settings beyond the one in which it was formed (see chapter 8).
