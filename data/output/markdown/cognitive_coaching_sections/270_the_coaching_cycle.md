## THE COACHING CYCLE

This is a combination of the planning and the reflecting maps, and it is conducted before, during, and after some goal-directed event or while attempting some task. Figure 11.3 presents a diagram of a coaching cycle. It depicts a continuous process of learning in which goals are set, actions are taken, and data are monitored, collected, and interpreted, leading to a revision in actions from which new goals are set. It is intended to illustrate that coaching is a continual process and, though mediated by a coach, is intended to help another person internalize this cycle of learning and become self-coaching.

Table 11.1 is a basic map of the steps in a typical coaching cycle: the

planning conversation, observation of the event, and the reflecting conversation. A planning conversation differs slightly when the coach will not be present for the event. The coach may serve as a data collector for the planner by serving as another set of eyes monitoring the performance of either the participants (students) in the event or the planner. The coach may collect data and mediate the planner's thinking by establishing mental mechanisms for self-observation or self-monitoring as well.

For example, the coach might say, 'Okay. Now, you mentioned earlier that there was something you'd like me to look for. What is it that you'd like me to observe today when I'm in your classroom? How would you like me to collect and record that data?' The goal is to have the planner identify a personal learning focus and processes for self-assessment. The coach might ask, 'In addition to paying attention to evidence of student learning, how might you use this lesson for your own growth? What might you focus on, and gather data about, to support your own continuing growth as a teacher?'
