## DISCUSS THE STANDARDS IN SMALL GROUPS, GRADE LEVELS, OR DEPARTMENTS

Talk about what it means to align one's teaching practices with what is known about effective instruction in subject matter for your students. Invite groups to select one standard to work on. Define the standard operationally: What would it look and sound like? For example, what

would the standard look and sound like in a third-grade class of mainly bilingual students while teaching reading? How would a standard look and sound in an 11th-grade honors physics class?
