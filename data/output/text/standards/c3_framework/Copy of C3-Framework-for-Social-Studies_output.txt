INTRODUCTION
IN THE COLLEGE, CAREER, AND CIVIC LIFE (C3) FRAMEWORK FOR
SOCIAL STUDIES STATE STANDARDS, THE CALL FOR STUDENTS TO
BECOME MORE PREPARED FOR THE CHALLENGES OF COLLEGE
AND CAREER IS UNITED WITH A THIRD CRITICAL ELEMENT:
PREPARATION FOR CIVIC LIFE. ADVOCATES OF CITIZENSHIP
EDUCATION CROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM, BUT THEY ARE
BOUND BY A COMMON BELIEF THAT OUR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
WILL NOT SUSTAIN UNLESS STUDENTS ARE AWARE OF THEIR
CHANGING CULTURAL AND PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS; KNOW
THE PAST; READ, WRITE, AND THINK DEEPLY; AND ACT IN WAYS
THAT PROMOTE THE COMMON GOOD. THERE WILL ALWAYS BE
DIFFERING PERSPECTIVES ON THESE OBJECTIVES. THE GOAL
OF KNOWLEDGEABLE, THINKING, AND ACTIVE CITIZENS,
HOWEVER, IS UNIVERSAL.

6 • C3 Framework
Representatives from a group of state education
agencies and from the leading organizations in social
studies and its individual disciplines collaborated to
create a Framework to provide states with voluntary
guidance for upgrading existing social studies stan­
dards. This Framework does not include all that can
or should be included in a set of robust social studies
standards, and intentionally preserves the critical
choices around the selection of curricular content
taught at each grade level as a decision best made by
each state. The Framework aims to support states in
creating standards that prepare young people for ef­
fective and successful participation in college, careers, and civic life.
The C3 Framework1 is centered on an Inquiry Arc—a
set of interlocking and mutually supportive ideas that
frame the ways students learn social studies content. By
focusing on inquiry, the framework emphasizes the dis­
ciplinary concepts and practices that support students
as they develop the capacity to know, analyze, explain,
and argue about interdisciplinary challenges in our
social world. It includes descriptions of the structure
and tools of the disciplines, as well as the habits of mind
common in those disciplines. Taken together, the C3
Fra­mework provides guidance to states on upgrading
state social studies standards to include the application
of knowledge within the disciplines of civics, econom­
ics, geography, and history as students develop ques­
tions and plan inquiries; apply disciplinary concepts
and tools; evaluate and use evidence; and communicate conclusions and take informed action.
The C3 Framework focuses on inquiry skills and key concepts, and guides—not prescribes—the choice
of curricular content necessary for a rigorous social
studies program. Content is critically important to the
disciplines within social studies, and individual state
leadership will be required to select appropriate and
relevant content. States that decide to incorporate the
Inquiry Arc and concepts of the C3 Framework into
their state standards will then need to engage in a rig­
orous local process of selecting the appropriate content
to be taught at each grade level to ensure that students
develop the knowledge and skills to be civic-ready
before graduation. The concepts expressed in the C3
Framework illustrate the disciplinary ideas, such as
political structures, economic decision making, spatial patterns, and chronological sequencing, that help
organize the curriculum and content states select.
As a core area in the K-12 curriculum, social studies
prepares students for their postsecondary futures, in­
cluding the disciplinary practices and literacies needed
for college-level work in social studies academic cours­
es, and the critical thinking, problem solving, and
collaborative skills needed for the workplace. The C3
Framework encourages the development of state social
studies standards that support students in learning to
be actively engaged in civic life. Engagement in civic
life requires knowledge and experience; children learn
to be citizens by working individually and together as
citizens. An essential element of social studies educa­
tion, therefore, is experiential—practicing the arts and habits of civic life.
NOW MORE THAN EVER, students need the intellectual power to recognize
societal problems; ask good questions and develop robust investigations into them;
consider possible solutions and consequences; separate evidence-based claims from
parochial opinions; and communicate and act upon what they learn. And most
importantly, they must possess the capability and commitment to repeat that process
as long as is necessary. Young people need strong tools for, and methods of, clear and
disciplined thinking in order to traverse successfully the worlds of college, career, and civic life.

Introduction • 7
Reflecting the shared responsibility for literacy learn­
ing put forward by the Common Core State Standards
for English Language Arts and Literacy in History/
Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a),2 the C3 Framework fully incor­
porates and extends the expectations from the grades
K–5 English Language Arts standards and the grades
6–12 standards for Literacy in History/Social Studies,
Science, and Technical Subjects. The C3 Framework
also recognizes the importance of literacy within the
Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (NGA and CCSSO, 2010b), and acknowledges mathematical
practices as they apply to social studies inquiry.
National Council for the Social Studies, one of fifteen collaborating organizations, is publishing the C3
Framework to provide this significant resource for all
states to consider in their local processes for upgrad­ ing state social studies standards.
The Process of Developing the College,
Career, and Civic Life (C3) Framework for Social Studies State Standards
The College, Career, and Civic Life (C3) Framework
for Social Studies State Standards was conceptualized
by individual state leaders in social studies education
and supported by fifteen professional organizations
representing four core social studies content areas:
civics, economics, geography, and history. The C3
Framework was written by experts in the academic
disciplines and social studies education in collabo­
ration with classroom teachers, state social studies
education leaders, and representatives of professional organizations.
Work on the C3 Framework began in 2010 with the de­
velopment of an initial conceptual guidance document
written by individuals from the Council of Chief State
School Officers (CCSSO) Social Studies Assessment,
Curriculum, and Instruction state collaborative and by
representatives from the professional associations. The
framework writers were selected in consultation with
the participating professional associations. Feedback
was solicited throughout the process from stakehold­
ers, including invitational reviews with professional organizations, teachers, and critical friends.

Inquiry Arc. The Inquiry Arc highlights the structure
of and rationale for the organization of the Frame work’s four Dimensions. The Arc focuses on the nature
of inquiry in general and the pursuit of knowledge through questions in particular.
Overview of the Connections with the ELA/
Literacy Common Core Standards. The C3
Framework recognizes the important role that the
Common Core State Standards for ELA/Literacy play
in defining K-12 literacy expectations in most states.
This overview outlines how the C3 Framework con­
nects to and elaborates on the ELA/Literacy Common
Core Standards for social studies inquiry.
In addition to the overview of Common Core connec­
tions, each of the four Dimensions includes graphical
and narrative descriptions of how the C3 Framework
connects with the standards to guide states and local
jurisdictions in incorporating these expectations as
they upgrade their state social studies standards.
Dimensions and Subsections. The C3 Framework
is organized into the four Dimensions, which support
a robust social studies program rooted in inquiry.
Dimensions 2, 3 and 4 are further broken down into subsections. For example, Dimension 2, Applying
Disciplinary Concepts and Tools, includes four subsections—civics, economics, geography, and
history—which include descriptions of the structure
and tools of the disciplines as well as the habits of
mind common in those disciplines. See Table 1 for a
graphical representation of the organization of the C3
Framework.
Unique Structure of Dimension 2. Dimension
2 has an additional layer of three to four categories
OVERALL DOCUMENT ORGANIZATION  The C3 Framework begins with
two narrative explanations: the Inquiry Arc, which provides the organizing structure
for the document; and the Overview of English Language Arts/Literacy Common Core
Connections, which highlights the important relationship between the C3 Framework
and the Common Core State Standards for ELA/Literacy. Next, the C3 Framework
presents the following four Dimensions: 1 Developing questions and planning
inquiries; 2 Applying disciplinary concepts and tools; 3 Evaluating sources and
using evidence; and 4 Communicating conclusions and taking informed action.
The C3 Framework closes with five appendices.
DIMENSION 1:
DEVELOPING QUESTIONS
AND PLANNING INQUIRIES
DIMENSION 2:
APPLYING DISCIPLINARY
TOOLS AND CONCEPTS
DIMENSION 3:
EVALUATING SOURCES
AND USING EVIDENCE
DIMENSION 4:
COMMUNICATING
CONCLUSIONS AND
TAKING INFORMED
ACTION
Developing Questions and Planning Inquiries
Civics
Gathering and Evaluating
Sources
Communicating and Critiquing Conclusions
Economics
Geography
Developing Claims and Using
Evidence
Taking Informed Action

within each disciplinary subsection. These categories provide an organizing mechanism for the founda­
tional content and skills within each discipline. For
example, within the subsection of economics, there
are four categories: (1) Economic Decision Making;
(2) Exchange and Markets; (3) The National Economy;
and (4) The Global Economy. See Table 2 for a graph­
ical representation of the categories within the four disciplinary subsections in Dimension 2.
C3 Framework Indicators and K-12 Pathways.
Within each subsection or category is a set of College,
Career, and Civic Readiness Indicators for the end of
grade 12. For each C3 Indicator, there is a suggested
K-12 Pathway for how students might develop profi­
ciency for a particular skill or concept. These Pathways acknowledge students’ developing capacity for un­
derstanding more sophisticated ideas and completing
more demanding inquiries across the grade bands of
K–2, 3–5, 6–8, and 9–12. Each Pathway includes three developmental Indicators and the culminating C3
Indicator. The Indicators suggest student proficiency
by the end of grades 2, 5, 8, and 12 with an under­
standing that these skills and concepts will be taught within and throughout the grade band. States will decide how these suggested Pathways inform their
processes for developing and upgrading state social studies standards.
Appendices. The C3 Framework concludes with five
appendices:
•	 Appendix A: C3 Framework Disciplinary
Inquiry Matrix. The Disciplinary Inquiry Matrix articulates how the four Dimensions of the C3
Framework connect to and build upon one another through the use of a content-specific example.
•	 Appendix B: Psychology Companion Document for the C3 Framework. The Psychology
Companion Document was created by the
American Psychological Association and articu­
lates the key disciplinary tools and concepts central to the discipline of psychology. C3 Indicators
are listed for the 9-12 grade band, a corollary for Dimension 2. Psychology adds its unique and important perspective to the content-specific example presented in Appendix A: C3 Framework
Disciplinary Inquiry Matrix.
•	 Appendix C: Sociology Companion Document for the C3 Framework. The Sociology Companion
Document was created by the American
Sociological Association and articulates the key disciplinary tools and concepts central to the
discipline of sociology. C3 Indicators are listed for the 9-12 grade band, a corollary for Dimension 2.

concepts central to the discipline of anthropology.
Anthropology adds its unique and important per­
spective to the content-specific example in Appendix
A: C3 Framework Disciplinary Inquiry Matrix.
•	 Appendix E: Scholarly Rationale for the C3
Framework. This appendix articulates the reason­ ing behind the creation of the C3 Framework and
addresses the research base that supports the ideas represented. Now more than ever, students need
the intellectual power to recognize societal prob­ lems; ask good questions and develop robust in­
vestigations into them; consider possible solutions and consequences; separate evidence-based claims from parochial opinions; and communicate and act upon what they learn. And most importantly, they must possess the capability and commitment
to repeat that process as long as is necessary. Young people need strong tools for, and methods of,
clear and disciplined thinking in order to traverse
successfully the worlds of college, career, and civic life. The C3 Framework and its Inquiry Arc mark a
significant departure from past attempts to devel­ op a robust social studies program. The scholarly argument supports and underpins the funda­
mental shift in direction and practice that the C3
Framework embodies.
The appendices are followed by references and two concluding sections.
•	 Glossary of Key Terms in the C3 Framework.
The glossary defines and provides examples of key concepts and terms. The examples are illustrative but are not exhaustive. The definitions and exam­
ples are intended to encourage a broad exchange of
ideas about social studies content, and should con­
tribute to a coherent vision of how social studies might be enlivened and enriched by the use of the
C3 Framework.
•	 C3 Framework Writing Team Biographical
Sketches. The writing team includes members who
have expertise in K-12 social studies education and
the academic disciplines of civics, economics, geog­
raphy, and history. The selection of individuals was based on recommendations from the professional associations and state education agencies engaged in the process of developing the C3 Framework.
What Is Not Covered in the C3 Framework
The C3 Framework is intended to serve as a resource
for states to consider as they upgrade their existing
state social studies standards. The Framework pro­
vides guidance on the key concepts and skills students
should develop through a robust social studies pro­
gram of study, but intentionally does not address all of
the elements states will need to consider in developing
and upgrading standards. There are three main areas not addressed by the framework:
•	 Content Necessary for a Rigorous Social Studies
Program. The C3 Framework focuses on the concepts that underlie a rich program of social studies education. The foundational concepts in Dimension 2 outline the scope of the disciplinary knowledge and tools associated with civics, economics, geography, and history. References are made to a range of ideas, such as the U.S.
Constitution, economic scarcity, geographical modeling, and chronological sequences. However, the particulars of curriculum and instructional content—such as how a bill becomes a law or the difference between a map and a globe—are im­ portant decisions each state needs to make in the development of local social studies standards.
•	 Other Disciplines Beyond Civics, Economics,
Geography, and History  The disciplines repre­ sented in the C3 Framework are not the only ones
relevant to a rich social studies curriculum. Other
disciplines, such as anthropology, psychology, and sociology, while not covered in the main body of the C3 Framework, are important lenses for under­ standing the human experience (see Appendices
B, C, and D). Anthropology is the scientific study of humans, past and present; psychology is the scientific study of the mind and behavior; and
sociology is the scientific study of the social lives of
people, groups and societies. All have countless ap­
plications to everyday life. Indeed, the study of the behavioral and social sciences enhances student
preparation for college, careers, and civic life by
promoting critical thinking, inquiry, problem-solv­ ing, evidence-based reasoning and communication

skills, as well as multi-cultural and global under­
standings, the ability to work with diverse groups, and a deep sense of personal and social respon­ sibility (American Anthropological Association, 2013; American Psychological Association, 2011;
American Sociological Association 2009). 3

The behavioral and social sciences align well to the C3 Framework, which focuses on the four core
social studies disciplines, but some are not includ­ ed in the body of the framework. These behavioral and social sciences are most frequently taught at
the high school level, though efforts are underway to better integrate behavioral and social science concepts in the K-8 age bands. The C3 Framework has been constructed as a K-12 Framework offering specific guidance across the grade bands of K-2, 3-5, 6-8, and 9-12. The tough decision was made early in the development of this framework to
focus only on the four federally defined core social
studies areas (i.e., civics, economics, geography,
and history) to streamline the development process and produce a concise document.

The exclusion of some behavioral and social sci­ ences from the main body of this document should not be seen as minimizing the importance of these
other disciplines in a robust social studies curric­ ulum. To that extent, professional organizations affiliated with these areas have been consulted and have created discipline-specific resources to align to this framework document. For example,
Appendices B and C were created by the American
Psychological Association and American
Sociological Association to align with Dimension 2 as well as other aspects of the C3 Framework.
Appendix D is a parallel companion document cre­ ated by the American Anthropological Association.
These supporting documents should be seen as an extension of this framework, as complementary
materials that will further the intention of prepar­
ing students for civic life. We encourage all readers to refer to and use these additional resources.
•	 The Different Abilities Children Bring to their
Schooling. The C3 Framework is largely silent on
the different abilities children bring to their school­
ing.  The C3 Indicators and K-12 Pathways individ­
ually and together describe the concepts and skills students develop in a rich, ambitious program of studies. Some students will need far more assis­ tance and support than others in reaching the aims of each Dimension. All children deserve the opportunity to learn. To be successful, students
will need varying degrees of scaffolding to support
their learning. Smart, thoughtful, and imaginative teachers are widely recognized as key to powerful learning experiences; for English language learn­ ers, students with special needs, and struggling
readers and writers, such teachers are invaluable.
YOUNG PEOPLE need strong tools for, and methods of, clear and disciplined thinking in order to traverse successfully the worlds of college, career, and civic life.

THE PRIMARY PURPOSE of the College, Career, and Civic Life (C3) Framework
for Social Studies State Standards is to provide guidance to states on the concepts,
skills, and disciplinary tools necessary to prepare students for college, career, and
civic life. In doing so, the C3 Framework offers guidance and support for rigorous
student learning. That guidance and support takes form in an Inquiry Arc—a set
of interlocking and mutually reinforcing ideas that feature the four Dimensions of
informed inquiry in social studies: 1 Developing questions and planning inquiries;
2 Applying disciplinary concepts and tools; 3 Evaluating sources and using evidence;
and 4 Communicating conclusions and taking informed action.
Dimension 1 features the development of questions
and the planning of inquiries. With the entire scope
of human experience as its backdrop, the content of
social studies consists of a rich array of facts, concepts,
and generalizations. The way to tie all of this content
together is through the use of compelling and support­ ing questions.
Questioning is key to student learning. The C3
Framework encourages the use of compelling and
supporting questions, both teacher- and student-gen­ erated, as a central element of the teaching and
learning process. For example, a compelling question
like “Was the American Revolution revolutionary?” is
both intriguing to students and intellectually honest.
Such a question can be vigorously explored through
the disciplines of civics, economics, geography, and
history. It is also sensitive to the idea that students are
interested in how and why events are characterized
as they are. Supporting questions assist students in
addressing their compelling questions. For example,
questions like “What were the regulations imposed on
the colonists under the Townshend Acts?” will help
students understand the many dimensions of the war
as they form their conclusions about the magnitude of change associated with those Acts.
Developing compelling and supporting questions is challenging, and teachers will need to provide guidance and support in crafting them, especially
for young learners. The Indicators for Dimension 1
present a developmentally appropriate, scalable, and
assessable set of ideas through which students can
demonstrate their increasingly independent facility
with recognizing, developing, and articulating power­ ful questions.
Dimension 2, Applying Disciplinary Concepts and Tools, provides the backbone for the Inquiry Arc.
Working with a robust compelling question and a set
of discrete supporting questions, teachers and students
determine the kind of content they need in order to
develop their inquiries. This process is an artful bal­
ancing act because the interplay between Dimensions
1 and 2 is dynamic: students access disciplinary knowledge both to develop questions and to pursue
those questions using disciplinary concepts and tools.
Children typically begin proposing solutions to com­
pelling questions based on their experiences. Because
social studies content is based in human experience,
students will have hunches about the questions under
study. Rich social studies teaching, however, offers
students opportunities to investigate those questions
more thoroughly through disciplinary (civic, econom­
ic, geographical, or historical) and multi-disciplinary
means. Dimension 2 sets forth the conceptual content
that defines the disciplines, such as the historian’s
habit of describing how the perspectives of people in
the present shape their interpretations of the past. This
practice, along with the curricular content and the
distinctive habits of mind from the other social science
disciplines, informs students’ investigations and con­
tributes to an inquiry process for social studies.
In some cases, the compelling questions posed will draw on content largely from a single discipline.
Teachers and students may pull primarily from

economics, for example, to answer the compelling question, “How will an increase in the minimum wage affect local job opportunities for teens?”
“Why are there rules?” invites inquiry into key civics concepts. Many compelling questions, however, can best be explored through the use of multiple dis­ ciplines. Recall the question, “Was the American
Revolution revolutionary?” Students will need to
examine a range of economic, geographic, historical,
and civic concepts in order to craft a full-bodied,
evidence-based response to this question. In similar fashion, a contemporary environmental question such as “What path should a new transcontinental
pipeline take?” or “Should the pipeline be built at all?”
demands the use of economic, historical, and civic as well as spatial concepts and tools.
With compelling and supporting questions in hand
and a sense of the relevant concepts and ideas, the
Inquiry Arc of the C3 Framework turns toward the
matter of sources and evidence. Social studies is an evidence-based field. The disciplinary concepts represented in Dimension 2 provide a solid base
from which students can begin constructing answers
to their questions. Equally important, however, is
knowing how to fill in the gaps in their knowledge
by learning how to work from sources and evidence in order to develop claims and counter-claims.
HELPING STUDENTS DEVELOP a capacity for gathering and evaluating sources and then using evidence in disciplinary ways is a central feature of the Inquiry Arc represented by Dimension 3, Evaluating Sources and Using
Evidence.
Sources come in many forms, including historical and contemporary documents, data from direct observa­
tion, graphics, economic statistics, maps, legislative
actions, objects, and court rulings. Access to these
and other digital sources is now more readily available
than ever. The availability of source materials, how­
ever, does not translate automatically into their wise
use. Students must be mindful that not all sources
are equal in value and use and that sources do not, by
themselves, constitute evidence. Rather, evidence con­
sists of the material students select to support claims
and counter-claims in order to construct accounts,
explanations, and arguments. Helping students devel­
op a capacity for gathering and evaluating sources and
then using evidence in disciplinary ways is a central
feature of the Inquiry Arc represented by Dimension 3,
Evaluating Sources and Using Evidence.
A compelling question such as “Was the Civil Rights
Movement of the 1960s a success?” demands that students draw evidence from more than one or two
sources. A wide range of perspectives is available in both primary and secondary form. Having students
gather, evaluate, and use a rich subset of those sourc­
es offers them opportunities to identify claims and counter-claims and to support those claims with evidence. Making and supporting evidence-based
claims and counter-claims is key to student capacity to construct explanations and arguments.
18 • C3 Framework

=== Page 19 ===
Developing explanations and making and supporting
arguments can take form in individual essays, group
projects, and other classroom-based written assess­
ments, both formal and informal. But students need
not be limited to those avenues. Although there is
no substitute for thoughtful and persuasive writing, the Framework advocates expanding the means by which students communicate their preliminary and
final conclusions. As the Indicators for Dimension 4 (Communicating Conclusions and Taking Informed
Action) demonstrate, those means include a range of
venues and a variety of forms (e.g., discussions, de­
bates, policy analyses, video productions, and portfo­
lios). Moreover, the manner in which students work to
create their solutions can differ. Students need oppor­
tunities to work individually, with partners, in small
groups, and within whole class settings. Readiness
for college, career, and civic life is as much about the
experiences students have as it is about learning any
particular set of concepts or tools. Thus, the learning environments that teachers create are critical
to student success. Students will flourish to the extent
that their independent and collaborative efforts are guided, supported, and honored.
Active and responsible citizens identify and analyze
public problems; deliberate with other people about
how to define and address issues; take constructive,
collaborative action; reflect on their actions; create
and sustain groups; and influence institutions both
large and small. They vote, serve on juries, follow the
news and current events, and participate in voluntary
groups and efforts. Teaching students to act in these
ways—as citizens—significantly enhances preparation
for college and career. Many of the same skills that are
needed for active and responsible citizenship—work­
ing effectively with other people, deliberating and
reasoning quantitatively about issues, following the news, and forming and sustaining groups—are also
crucial to success in the 21st century workplace and in
college. Individual mastery of content often no longer
suffices; students should also develop the capacity to
work together to apply knowledge to real problems.
Thus, a rich social studies education is an education for college, career, and civic life.
In one sense, Dimension 4 closes the Inquiry Arc.
But learning is reflexive and recursive—new disci­ plinary knowledge can be the source of new ques­
tions, communicating ideas in one setting can lead to
new ideas about evidence, and new historical sources
can lead to new disciplinary and interdisciplinary concepts. The Inquiry Arc of the C3 Framework
offers states guidance for developing standards with multiple opportunities for students to develop as thoughtful, engaged citizens.
ACTIVE AND RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS identify and analyze public problems; deliberate with other people about how to define and address issues; take constructive, collaborative action; reflect on their actions; create and sustain groups; and influence institutions both large and small.

The Common Core State Standards for English
Language Arts and Literacy in History/Social Studies,
Science, and the Technical Subjects call on social
studies teachers to share in the responsibilities for literacy instruction in K-12 education (NGA and
CCSSO, 2010a). The expectations for literacy learn­
ing in grades K–5 are established through the four
strands of Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Language. For grades 6–12, the ELA/Literacy
Common Core Standards provide specific literacy
standards for Reading and Writing in History/Social
Studies. The C3 Framework fully incorporates and
extends the expectations for literacy learning put forward in the Common Core Standards for ELA/
Literacy on three levels (Table 3).
Connections between the C3 Framework and the College and Career Readiness (CCR)
Anchor Standards. Each strand of the Common
Core State Standards for English Language Arts/
Literacy is headed by a set of College and Career
Readiness (CCR) Anchor Standards that are identical
across all grades and content areas, including social studies. The authors of the C3 Framework view the
literacy skills detailed in the ELA/Literacy Common
Core College and Career Readiness (CCR) Anchor
Standards as establishing a foundation for inquiry in
social studies, and as such all CCR Anchor Standards
should be an indispensable part of any state’s so­ cial studies standards. Many specific CCR Anchor
Standards are directly supportive of the C3 Framework,

while three of these CCR Anchor Standards are vital to social studies inquiry.
The connections between the C3 Framework and the
ELA/Literacy Common Core Standards are compre­ hensive and consistent. The CCR Anchor Standards for the ELA/Literacy Common Core Standards, par­
ticularly those in the Reading, Writing, and Speaking
and Listening strands, provide a useful context for
illustrating the broader connections across and within each Dimension. These supportive connections are detailed for each of the Dimensions in Table 4.4
The CCR Anchor Standards in Table 4 focus on a wide
range of inquiry practices that contribute to the litera­
cy foundations in social studies. Social studies students
should use and attend to the skills described in these
standards to assist them in focusing their inquiries
and research practices. The C3 Framework emphasizes and elaborates on those skills in the Common Core
Standards that explicitly connect to inquiry, and rec­
ognizes the shared responsibility social studies plays in honing key literacy skills.
Three CCR Anchor Standards (and their correspond­
ing grade-specific standards) are particularly vital to social studies inquiry. Common Core Anchor
Standard for Reading 1 asks students to read texts closely to both determine “explicit” information
lodged within the body of the text as well as draw “logical inferences” based on the text (NGA and
CCSSO, 2010a, p. 10). Students are also expected to
“cite specific textual evidence when writing or speak­
ing to support conclusions drawn from the text” (NGA
and CCSSO, 2010a, p. 10). The C3 Framework stresses
the role evidence plays in the four Dimensions: ex­
plicitly in Dimension 3, which focuses on developing
claims and using evidence, and inferentially in devel­
oping questions answered with evidence in Dimension 1 or communicating conclusions supported by evi­
dence in Dimension 4. The emphasis on evidence also connects the disciplines in Dimension 2.
Additionally, Common Core Anchor Standard for
Writing 7 is broadly relevant for inquiry in social stud­
ies. Writing Standard 7 calls on students to “conduct
short as well as more sustained research projects based on focused questions, demonstrating understanding
of the subject under investigation” (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p. 18). The C3 Framework elevates research
as a process of inquiry that informs the Indicators
in all four Dimensions. Dimension 2 establishes the
tools and concepts from the social studies disciplines
that are relevant for inquiry. Dimensions 1, 3, and 4
describe the general social studies inquiry skills and
processes that support argumentation, explanation, and taking informed action.
Finally, Common Core Anchor Standard for Speaking
and Listening 1 has broad application across the four
Dimensions. Speaking and Listening Standard 1 calls
on students to “prepare for and participate effectively
in a range of conversations and collaborations with
diverse partners, building on others’ ideas and ex­
pressing their own clearly and persuasively” (NGA and
CCSSO, 2010a, p. 22). Indicators in the C3 Framework
describe the types of collaboration needed for specific
skills and understandings. For example, a Dimension
1 Indicator states, “By the end of grade 2, individually
and with others, students construct compelling ques­ tions….” The C3 Framework acknowledges civil and
democratic discourse within a diverse, collaborative
context as both a purpose and outcome of a strong,
meaningful, and substantive social studies education.
Shared Language. Language and concepts from the ELA/Literacy Common Core Standards were
deliberately used in specific Indicators across the
C3 Framework Dimensions. For example, the terms
argument and explanation; claim and counterclaim; in­
formation and evidence; and point of view and opinion appear regularly in the ELA/Literacy Common Core
Standards and throughout the Dimensions of the C3
Framework.5
4	 As Common Core states upgrade their social studies standards, they
will want to incorporate the grade-specific standards for K-5 and the
grade-band specific standards for literacy in social studies for grades
6-12 that correspond to the CCR anchor standard with the same number.
5	 Although the ELA/Literacy Common Core Standards and the C3
Framework both emphasize the unique skill of constructing evidence based arguments, different terms are used: opinion in the ELA/
Literacy Common Core Standards for grades K–5 and argument throughout the C3 Framework.

Developing
Questions
& PLANNING
INQUIRIES
QUESTIONS AND THE DESIRE TO ANSWER THEM give life to inquiry
and thus to the C3 Framework. Questions arise from students’ innate curiosity about
the world and from their efforts to make sense of how that world works.
Central to a rich social studies experience is the
capability for developing questions that can frame and advance an inquiry. Those questions come in
two forms: compelling and supporting questions.
Compelling questions focus on enduring issues and
concerns. They deal with curiosities about how things
work; interpretations and applications of disciplinary
concepts; and unresolved issues that require students
to construct arguments in response. In contrast, sup­
porting questions focus on descriptions, definitions, and processes on which there is general agreement
within the social studies disciplines, and require stu­
dents to construct explanations that advance claims of understanding in response.
Consider an example relevant to early elementary
students. A compelling question that students might
generate is, “Why do we need rules?” This question
reflects the two primary qualities of a compelling
question: (1) It reflects a social concern that students
find engaging; and (2) It reflects an enduring issue in
the field of civics. A teacher and her students might
take such a question in a number of directions, but
for curricular purposes, it makes sense to define some
parameters that give shape to the inquiry. Supporting
questions help define those curriculum parameters.
Examples of supporting questions include, “What
are some rules that families follow?” “What are some school rules?” or “What classroom rules have you

The development of compelling and supporting ques­
tions is a sophisticated intellectual activity. Students,
particularly before middle school, will need consid­
erable guidance and support from adults to construct
questions that are suitable for inquiry. Beginning in
grade 6, students should be able to take increasing
responsibility for their learning so that by grade 12
they are able to construct questions and plan inquiries more independently.
Questions are just the starting point for an inquiry.
To develop an inquiry, students will also determine the data sources needed to help answer compelling and supporting questions. The five indicators in Dimension 1 describe the questioning and planning skills needed to initiate inquiry.

ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS/LITERACY COMMON CORE
CONNECTIONS: DIMENSION 1
Questioning plays an important role in social stud­ ies as well as in the ELA/Literacy Common Core
Standards. Expectations for using questions to interro­
gate texts are consistently communicated in the ELA/
Literacy Common Core Standards. One of the key design features of the ELA/Literacy Common Core
Standards is to emphasize research skills through­ out the standards. Specifically, the Common Core
Standards argue, “to be ready for college, workforce
training, and life in a technological society, students
need the ability to gather, comprehend, evaluate, syn­
thesize, and report on information and ideas, to con­
duct original research in order to answer questions” (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p. 4). The C3 Framework elaborates on the emphasis of the ELA/Literacy
Common Core Standards on answering questions
by establishing specific Indicators for students con­
structing compelling questions to initiate inquiry and supporting questions to sustain that inquiry.
Table 8 details connections between Dimension 1 and the College and Career Readiness Anchor Standards in the ELA/Literacy Common Core Standards. These connections are further elaborated with examples.
Connections between the C3 Framework and the College and Career Readiness Anchor
Standards. While the connections between the C3
Framework and the ELA/Literacy Common Core
Standards are comprehensive and consistent, three
CCR Anchor Standards (and their corresponding grade-specific standards) within the ELA/Literacy
Common Core Standards have deeper connections within Dimension 1.
Common Core Anchor Reading Standard 1 clearly in­
dicates the importance of evidence in framing and an­
swering questions about the texts students are reading
and researching. This crucial standard asks students
to look for “explicit” information lodged within the
body of the text as well as to draw “logical inferences” based on what they read (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p.
10). Reading Standard 1 also expects students to “cite
specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text” (NGA
and CCSSO, 2010a, p. 10). The C3 Framework stresses
this focus on evidence by prioritizing a wide range
of inquiry-based activities that result in information
gathering on the part of students in response to plan­ ning and developing lines of inquiry.
Common Core Anchor Writing Standard 7 is particu­
larly relevant for posing questions as an initial activity
in research and inquiry in social studies. Writing
Standard 7 calls on students to base their research on
“focused questions, demonstrating understanding of the subject under investigation” (NGA and CCSSO,
2010a, p. 18). The C3 Framework elaborates on the pro­
cess of developing questions by making distinctions
about the types of questions useful for initiating and
sustaining an inquiry, and by having students explain how the construction of compelling and supporting
questions is connected to the disciplinary process of inquiry.

Standard 1 also has broad application for Dimension 1.
Speaking and Listening Standard 1 calls on students to
“prepare for and participate effectively in a range of
conversations and collaborations with diverse part­
ners, building on others’ ideas and expressing their own clearly and persuasively” (NGA and CCSSO,
2010a, p. 22). Dimension 1 asks students to engage in
the sophisticated intellectual activity of constructing compelling and supporting questions. Students,
particularly before middle school, will need consider­
able guidance and support from adults and peers to
construct suitable questions for inquiry. Such guidance
and support will play out through conversations and
collaboration. Learning in social studies is an inher­ ently collaborative activity, and Speaking and
Listening Standard 1 is thus especially relevant in Dimension 1.
A student’s ability to ask and answer questions when
reading, writing, and speaking and listening is an
important part of literacy and represents a founda­
tion for learning in social studies. Throughout the
C3 Framework, students are expected to practice and
improve the questioning skills specified in the ELA/
Literacy Common Core Standards. In Dimension 1 of
the C3 Framework, students turn to questions as a way
to initiate and sustain inquiry, and connect these ques­
tioning literacies to those suggested by ELA/Literacy
Common Core Writing Standard 7. In alignment with the Common Core Standards, the C3 Framework
views the skill of asking questions and the desire to
answer them as being so fundamental to the inquiry
process that inquiry cannot begin until students have developed questioning skills.
The questioning skills emphasized in the C3
Framework reflect the academic intentions of the
disciplines that make up social studies and the special
purposes of social studies as preparation for civic life.
Social studies teachers have an important role to play
in supporting students as they develop the literacy
questioning skills found in the ELA/Literacy Common
Core Standards, and can do this most effectively
through helping their students learn the habits and
skills needed to conduct inquiry in social studies and to live productively as democratic citizens.
Shared Language. The ELA/Literacy Common
Core Standards closely align with the Indicators in
Dimension 1. In places, the connections between the
Common Core Standards and the C3 Framework
Indicators are so close that the same language is used.
The concept of questioning is part of this shared
language, but in addition, the terms argument, ex­
planation, and point of view are consistently used in both the ELA/Literacy Common Core Standards and Dimension 1.
The ELA/Literacy Common Core Standards em­ phasize questioning as a mechanism for supporting reading and as a tool to prompt research. The C3
Framework emphasizes the use of questioning as a
prompt for disciplinary inquiry. A unique distinction
is made in the C3 Framework between compelling and
supporting questions. This distinction is closely tied
to the types of thinking and student-generated prod­
ucts that result from inquiry. In distinguishing these
products, the C3 Framework utilizes the distinction
between argumentation and explanation as described in ELA/Literacy Common Core Writing Anchor
Standards 1 and 2. Thus, by design, compelling ques­
tions lead to arguments, and supporting questions lead to explanations.

Dimension 2
Applying
Disciplinary
Concepts
& TOOLS
THE FOUR CORE DISCIPLINES within social studies provide the intellectual
context for studying how humans have interacted with each other and with the
environment over time. Each of these disciplines—civics, economics, geography, and
history—offers a unique way of thinking and organizing knowledge as well as systems
for verifying knowledge. Dimension 2 focuses on the disciplinary concepts and tools
students need to understand and apply as they study the specific content typically
described in state standards. These disciplinary ideas are the lenses students use in their
inquiries, and the consistent and coherent application of these lenses throughout the
grades should lead to deep and enduring understanding.
A key distinction between a framework and a set of
content standards is the difference between conceptual
and curricular content. Curricular content specifies
the particular ideas to be taught and the grade levels at
which to teach them; conceptual content is the big­
ger set of ideas that frame the curricular content. For
example, rather than identify every form of govern­
mental power, the C3 Framework expects students in
grades 6–8 to “explain the powers and limits of the
three branches of government, public officials, and bu­
reaucracies at different levels in the United States and
in other countries.” Similarly, rather than delineate
every kind of map, the C3 Framework expects students
in grades 3–5 to “create maps and other graphic repre­
sentations of both familiar and unfamiliar places.”
The C3 Framework takes this approach of describing
concepts and skills rather than curricular content
because there are significant differences among states
in terms of what is taught and when. If and when the
Irish potato famine might be taught, for example, is
a decision best left to state and local decision makers.
The C3 Framework in general, and Dimension 2 in
particular, is intended to serve as a frame for organiz­
ing curricular content, rather than a prescription for the specific content to be taught.

CIVICS
IN A CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY, productive civic
engagement requires knowledge of the history, principles, and
foundations of our American democracy, and the ability to participate
in civic and democratic processes. People demonstrate civic engagement
when they address public problems individually and collaboratively
and when they maintain, strengthen, and improve communities and
societies. Thus, civics is, in part, the study of how people participate in governing society.
Because government is a means for addressing common or public
problems, the political system established by the U.S. Constitution is an
important subject of study within civics. Civics requires other knowledge
too; students should also learn about state and local governments;
markets; courts and legal systems; civil society; other nations’ systems
and practices; international institutions; and the techniques available to citizens for preserving and changing a society.
Civics is not limited to the study of politics and society; it also
encompasses participation in classrooms and schools, neighborhoods,
groups, and organizations. Not all participation is beneficial. This
framework makes frequent reference to civic virtues and principles
that guide participation and to the norm of deliberation (which means
discussing issues and making choices and judgments with information
and evidence, civility and respect, and concern for fair procedures).
What defines civic virtue, which democratic principles apply in given
situations, and when discussions are deliberative are not easy questions,
but they are topics for inquiry and reflection. In civics, students learn
to contribute appropriately to public processes and discussions of real
issues. Their contributions to public discussions may take many forms,
ranging from personal testimony to abstract arguments. They will also
learn civic practices such as voting, volunteering, jury service, and
joining with others to improve society. Civics enables students not only
to study how others participate, but also to practice participating and taking informed action themselves.

Participation and Deliberation: Applying Civic Virtues and Democratic Principles
Civics teaches the principles—such as adherence to
the social contract, consent of the governed, limited government, legitimate authority, federalism, and
separation of powers—that are meant to guide official
institutions such as legislatures, courts, and govern­
ment agencies. It also teaches the virtues—such as
honesty, mutual respect, cooperation, and attentive­
ness to multiple perspectives—that citizens should use
when they interact with each other on public matters.
Principles such as equality, freedom, liberty, respect for
individual rights, and deliberation apply to both official
institutions and informal interactions among citizens.
Learning these virtues and principles requires obtain­
ing factual knowledge of written provisions found in important texts such as the founding documents of
the United States. It also means coming to understand the diverse arguments that have been made about
these documents and their meanings. Finally, students understand virtues and principles by applying and
reflecting on them through actual civic engagement— their own and that of other people from the past and present.

Processes, Rules, and Laws
Civics is the discipline of the social studies most
directly concerned with the processes and rules by
which groups of people make decisions, govern them­
selves, and address public problems. People address
problems at all scales, from a classroom to the agree­
ments among nations. Public policies are among the
tools that governments use to address public problems.
Students must learn how various rules, processes, laws,
and policies actually work, which requires factual
understanding of political systems and is the focus
of this section. They must also obtain experience in
defining and addressing public problems, as prompted in Dimension 4—Taking Informed Action.

ECONOMICS
EFFECTIVE ECONOMIC DECISION making requires
that students have a keen understanding of the ways in which
individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make decisions
to allocate human capital, physical capital, and natural resources
among alternative uses. This economic reasoning process involves the
consideration of costs and benefits with the ultimate goal of making
decisions that will enable individuals and societies to be as well off as
possible. The study of economics provides students with the concepts
and tools necessary for an economic way of thinking and helps students
understand the interaction of buyers and sellers in markets, workings of
the national economy, and interactions within the global marketplace.
Economics is grounded in knowledge about how people choose to use
resources. Economic understanding helps individuals, businesses,
governments, and societies choose what resources to devote to work,
to school, and to leisure; how many dollars to spend, and how many to
save; and how to make informed decisions in a wide variety of contexts.
Economic reasoning and skillful use of economic tools draw upon
a strong base of knowledge about human capital, land, investments,
money, income and production, taxes, and government expenditures.
Dimension 2: Applying Disciplinary Concepts and Tools • 35

Economic Decision Making
People make decisions about how to use scarce resources to maximize the well-being of individu­
als and society. Economic decision making involves
setting goals and identifying the resources available
to achieve those goals. Alternative ways to use the
resources are investigated in terms of their advantages
and disadvantages. Since most choices involve a little
more of one thing and a little less of something else, economic decision making includes weighing the
additional benefit of an action against the additional
cost. Investigating the incentives that motivate people
is an essential part of analyzing economic decision making.

Making—are detailed in the suggested K-12 Pathway

Dimension 2, Exchange and Markets
Exchange and Markets
People voluntarily exchange goods and services when
both parties expect to gain as a result of the trade.
Markets exist to facilitate the exchange of goods and services. When buyers and sellers interact in
well-functioning, competitive markets, prices are de­
termined that reflect the relative scarcity of the goods
and services in the market. The principles of markets
apply to markets for goods and services, labor, credit, foreign exchange, and others. Comparison of bene­
fits and costs helps identify the circumstances under which government action in markets is in the best interest of society and when it is not.

The National Economy
Changes in the amounts and qualities of human cap­
ital, physical capital, and natural resources influence
current and future economic conditions and standards of living. All markets working together influence economic growth and fluctuations in well-being.
Monetary and fiscal policies are often designed and
used in attempts to moderate fluctuations and encour­ age growth under a wide variety of circumstances.
Policies changing the growth in the money supply and
overall levels of spending in the economy are aimed
at reducing inflationary or deflationary pressures;
increasing employment or decreasing unemployment levels; and increasing economic growth over time.
Policies designed to achieve alternative goals often
have unintended effects on levels of inflation, employ­ ment, and growth.

GEOGRAPHY
EACH PLACE ON EARTH has a unique set of local conditions and
connections to other places. Some activities are appropriate in a given
place and other activities are not. Events in one place influence events in
other places. Geographic knowledge helps people to make decisions about
“Where can I be safe, successful, and happy in my daily activities?” and
“How can my community create and sustain a healthy environment?”
Such knowledge is critically important to understanding what activities
might be harmful to a place or what hazards might be encountered there.
Geographic inquiry helps people understand and appreciate their own
place in the world, and fosters curiosity about Earth’s wide diversity of environments and cultures.
Geographic reasoning rests on deep knowledge of Earth’s physical
and human features, including the locations of places and regions, the
distribution of landforms and water bodies, and historic changes in
political boundaries, economic activities, and cultures.
Geographic reasoning requires using spatial and environmental perspec­
tives, skills in asking and answering questions, and being able to apply
geographic representations including maps, imagery, and geospatial tech­
nologies. A spatial perspective is about whereness. Where are people and
things located? Why there? What are the consequences? An environmental
perspective views people as living in interdependent relationships within
diverse environments. Thinking geographically requires knowing that
the world is a set of complex ecosystems interacting at multiple scales that
structure the spatial patterns and processes that influence our daily lives.
Geographic reasoning brings societies and nature under the lens of
spatial analysis, and aids in personal and societal decision making and problem solving.

Geographic Representations: Spatial Views of the World
Creating maps and using geospatial technologies
requires a process of answering geographic questions by gathering relevant information; organizing and
analyzing the information; and using effective means to communicate the findings. Once a map or oth­
er representation is created, it prompts new ques­
tions concerning the locations, spaces, and patterns portrayed. Creating maps and other geographical
representations is an essential and enduring part of
seeking new geographic knowledge that is personally
and socially useful and that can be applied in making decisions and solving problems.

Human-Environment Interaction: Place, Regions, and Culture
Human-environment interactions are essential as­
pects of human life in all societies and they occur at
local-to-global scales. Human-environment interac­
tions happen both in specific places and across broad
regions. Culture influences the locations and the types of interactions that occur. Earth’s human systems
and physical systems are in constant interaction and
have reciprocal influences flowing among them. These
interactions result in a variety of spatial patterns that
require careful observation, investigation, analysis, and explanation.

Human Population: Spatial Patterns and Movements
The size, composition, distribution, and move­ ment of human populations are fundamental and active features on Earth’s surface. The expansion
and redistribution of the human population affects
patterns of settlement, environmental changes, and
resource use. The spatial patterns and movements of
population also relate to physical phenomena includ­
ing climate variability, landforms, and locations of
various natural hazards. Further, political, economic, and technological changes sometimes have dramatic
effects on population size, composition, and distribu­
tion. Past, present, and future conditions on Earth’s surface cannot be fully understood without asking

Global Interconnections: Changing Spatial Patterns
Global interconnections occur in both human and physical systems. Earth is a set of interconnect­ ed ecosystems of which humans are an influential part. Many natural phenomena have no perceptible
boundaries. For example, the oceans are one dynamic
system. The atmosphere covers the entire planet. Land
and water forms shift over geological eons. Many life forms diffuse from place to place and bring envi­ ronmental changes with them. Humans have spread
across the planet, along with their cultural practices,
artifacts, languages, diseases, and other attributes.
All of these interconnections create complex spatial
patterns at multiple scales that continue to change
over time. Global-scale issues and problems cannot be
resolved without extensive collaboration among the
world’s peoples, nations, and economic organizations.
Asking and answering questions about global inter­
connections and spatial patterns are a necessary part of geographic reasoning.

HISTORY
HISTORICAL THINKING REQUIRES understanding and
evaluating change and continuity over time, and making appropriate use
of historical evidence in answering questions and developing arguments
about the past. It involves going beyond simply asking, “What happened
when?” to evaluating why and how events occurred and developments
unfolded. It involves locating and assessing historical sources of many
different types to understand the contexts of given historical eras and the
perspectives of different individuals and groups within geographic units
that range from the local to the global. Historical thinking is a process of
chronological reasoning, which means wrestling with issues of causality,
connections, significance, and context with the goal of developing
credible explanations of historical events and developments based on reasoned interpretation of evidence.
Historical inquiry involves acquiring knowledge about significant
events, developments, individuals, groups, documents, places, and ideas
to support investigations about the past. Acquiring relevant knowledge
requires assembling information from a wide variety of sources in an
integrative process. Students might begin with key events or individuals
introduced by the teacher or identified by educational leaders at the state
level, and then investigate them further. Or they might take a source from
a seemingly insignificant individual and make connections between that
person and larger events, or trace the person’s contributions to a major
development. Scholars, teachers, and students form an understanding
of what is and what is not significant from the emergence of new sources,
from current events, from their locale, and from asking questions about
changes that affected large numbers of people in the past or had enduring
consequences. Developing historical knowledge in connection with
historical investigations not only helps students remember the content
better because it has meaning, but also allows students to become better thinkers.

Change, Continuity, and Context
At its heart, chronological reasoning requires un­
derstanding processes of change and continuity over
time, which means assessing similarities and differ­
ences between historical periods and between the past
and present. It also involves coming to understand
how a change in one area of life relates to a change in
other areas, thus bringing together political, eco­
nomic, intellectual, social, cultural, and other factors.
Understanding the interrelation of patterns of change
requires evaluating the context within which events
unfolded in order not to view events in isolation, and
to be able to assess the significance of specific individ­ uals, groups, and developments.nts.
Indicators of Dimension 2—Change, Continuity and
Context—are detailed in the suggested K-12 Pathway

Perspectives
History is interpretive. Even if they are eyewitness­
es, people construct different accounts of the same
event, which are shaped by their perspectives—their
ideas, attitudes, and beliefs. Historical understanding
requires recognizing this multiplicity of points of
view in the past, which makes it important to seek out a range of sources on any historical question
rather than simply use those that are easiest to find.
It also requires recognizing that perspectives change
over time, so that historical understanding requires
developing a sense of empathy with people in the past
whose perspectives might be very different from those of today.

Historical Sources and Evidence
Historical inquiry is based on materials left from the
past that can be studied and analyzed. Such materials,
referred to as historical sources or primary sources,
include written documents, but also objects, artistic works, oral accounts, landscapes that humans have modified, or even materials contained within the human body, such as DNA. These sources become
evidence once they are selected to answer a historical
question, a process that involves taking into account
features of the source itself, such as its maker or date.
The selection process also requires paying attention to
the wider historical context in order to choose sources that are relevant and credible. Examining sources
often leads to further questions as well as answers in a spiraling process of inquiry.

Evidence—are detailed in the suggested K-12 Pathway

Causation and Argumentation
No historical event or development occurs in a vac­
uum; each one has prior conditions and causes, and
each one has consequences. Historical thinking in­
volves using evidence and reasoning to draw conclu­
sions about probable causes and effects, recognizing
that these are multiple and complex. It requires un­
derstanding that the outcome of any historical event may not be what those who engaged in it intended
or predicted, so that chains of cause and effect in the
past are unexpected and contingent, not pre-deter­
mined. Along with claims about causes and effects,
historical arguments can also address issues of change
over time, the relevance of sources, the perspectives
of those involved, and many other topics, but must be
based on evidence that is used in a critical, coherent, and logical manner.

ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS/LITERACY COMMON CORE
CONNECTIONS: DIMENSION 2
The ELA/Literacy Common Core Standards empha­
size analysis, argumentation, and the use of evidence throughout the standards. As noted in the ELA/
Literacy Common Core Standards, students who are
college and career ready can independently “construct
effective arguments and convey intricate or multifac­
eted information” and “use relevant evidence” when making arguments (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p. 7).
Dimension 2 in the C3 Framework describes the
concepts and tools in civics, economics, geography,
and history that are needed to use evidence to make disciplinary arguments. The ELA/Literacy Common
Core Standards also describe how students develop language skills and build vocabulary. College and
career readiness requires the ability to independently “use a wide-ranging vocabulary” (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p. 7). The C3 framework emphasizes disci­
plinary vocabulary through the introduction of new concepts and the language of the disciplines.
Table 24 details connections between Dimension 2 and the College and Career Readiness Anchor
Standards in the ELA/Literacy Common Core
Standards. These connections are further elaborated with examples.
Connections between the C3 Framework and the College and Career Readiness Anchor
Standards. While the connections between the C3
Framework and the ELA/Literacy Common Core
Standards are comprehensive and consistent, thirteen
CCR Anchor Standards within the ELA/Literacy
Common Core Standards have broader connections within Dimension 2.
Anchor Reading Standards 1–10 are closely aligned
with Dimension 2. As students use the disciplinary
tools and develop knowledge about the disciplinary
concepts highlighted in Dimension 2, they will engage
with a variety of sources requiring a wide range of
reading skills. During these experiences, students will
need to use the full complement of skills highlight­
ed in the reading standards. They will need to read
closely for meaning, while determining main ideas,
details, structure, purpose, source type, and claims emitting from the sources, and comparing multiple
sources. All of these reading activities are regulated by
the clear expectations of Anchor Reading Standards
1-10: the demand that answers to questions be backed
up by evidence either explicitly drawn from the text
or inferred from it, and the requirement that the text
under study be of the appropriate level of complexity for the grade band in question.
Anchor Writing Standard 7 is focused on the research
process. All four social studies disciplines represented
in Dimension 2, as well as the behavioral and social
sciences of psychology, sociology, and anthropology,
emphasize research-based analytical skills using dis­ ciplinary concepts and tools.

Anchor Speaking and Listening Standard 1 calls on
students to “prepare for and participate effectively in
a range of conversations and collaborations with di­
verse partners, building on others’ ideas and express­ ing their own clearly and persuasively” (NGA and
CCSSO, 2010a, p. 22). Dimension 2 asks students to
engage disciplinary tools and concepts in collabora­
tive settings working “individually and with others.”
Anchor Language Standard 6 requires that students
“acquire and use accurately a range of general ac­ ademic and domain-specific words and phrases” (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p. 51). The C3 Framework supports this language standard by setting forth
expectations that students will develop conceptual knowledge within the disciplines. The development
and expansion of vocabulary is an important part of the ELA/Literacy Common Core Standards and the
C3 Framework; Language Standard 6 requires that students acquire and use academic and domain-spe­
cific words and phrases—words such as virtue, fiscal, spatial, and perspective that are included in the
Indicators of Dimension 2.

Evaluating

USING
EVIDENCE
DIMENSION 3 INCLUDES the skills students need to analyze information and
come to conclusions in an inquiry. These skills focus on gathering and evaluating
sources, and then developing claims and using evidence to support those claims.
Students should use various technologies and skills
to find information and to express their responses to compelling and supporting questions through well-reasoned explanations and evidence-based
arguments. Through the rigorous analysis of sources
and application of information from those sources,
students should make the evidence-based claims that will form the basis for their conclusions.
Although Dimension 3 includes a sophisticated set
of skills, even the youngest children understand the
need to give reasons for their ideas. As they progress through the grades, students learn more advanced
approaches related to these skills. In the subsec­ tion Developing Claims and Using Evidence below, students generate claims and identify evidence to support those claims.
The specific skills described in Dimension 3 support
the examination of content using concepts and tools from the social studies disciplines.

Gathering and Evaluating Sources
Whether students are constructing opinions, expla­
nation, or arguments, they will gather information
from a variety of sources and evaluate the relevance
of that information. In this section, students are
asked to work with the sources that they gather and/
or are provided for them. It is important for students
to use online and print sources, and they need to be
mindful that not all sources are relevant to their task.
They also need to understand that there are general
Common Core literacy skills, such as identifying an
author’s purpose, main idea, and point of view, that
will help in evaluating the usefulness of a source.
Indicators of Dimension 3—Gathering and Evaluating

Developing Claims and Using Evidence
This subsection focuses on argumentation. In con­ trast to opinions and explanations, argumentation
involves the ability to understand the source-to-evi­
dence relationship. That relationship emphasizes the development of claims and counterclaims and the
purposeful selection of evidence in support of those claims and counterclaims. Students will learn to
develop claims using evidence, but their initial claims
will often be tentative and probing. As students delve
deeper into the available sources, they construct more sophisticated claims and counterclaims that draw on evidence from multiple sources. Whether those
claims are implicitly or explicitly stated in student
products, they will reflect the evidence students have selected from the sources they have consulted.
Indicators of Dimension 3—Developing Claims and Using Evidence—are detailed in the suggested K-12

ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS/LITERACY COMMON CORE
CONNECTIONS: DIMENSION 3
The ELA/Literacy Common Core Standards focus broadly on evaluating sources and using evidence as skills that are fundamental to success in col­ lege and career. According to the Common Core
Standards,“students need the ability to gather, com­
prehend, evaluate, synthesize, and report on infor­ mation and ideas” (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p. 4).
Students are expected to “use relevant evidence when
supporting their own points in writing and speaking,
making their reasoning clear to the reader or listen­
er, and they constructively evaluate others’ use of evidence” (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p. 7). The ELA/
Literacy Common Core Standards also make clear
that these skills connect to civic life, arguing that students must “reflexively demonstrate the cogent
reasoning and use of evidence that is essential to both
private deliberation and responsible citizenship in a
democratic republic” (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p. 3).
Through research, students hone their ability to gath­
er and evaluate information and then use that infor­
mation as evidence in a wide range of endeavors. The
ELA/Literacy Common Core Standards emphasize
these skills as key to an integrated model of literacy.
The C3 Framework and the Indicators in Dimension 3 apply this model to social studies inquiry.
Table 27 details connections between Dimension 3 and the College and Career Readiness Anchor
Standards in the ELA/Literacy Common Core
Standards. These connections are further elaborated with examples.
Connections between the C3 Framework and the College and Career Readiness Anchor
Standards. While the connections between the C3
Framework and the ELA/Literacy Common Core
Standards are comprehensive and consistent, seven­ teen CCR Anchor Standards within the ELA/Literacy
Common Core Standards have broader connections within Dimension 3.
Anchor Reading Standards 1–10 are closely aligned with Dimension 3. As students gather and evalu­
ate information, develop claims, and use evidence,
they will engage with a variety of sources requiring
a wide range of reading skills. During these experi­
ences, students will need to use the full complement of skills highlighted in the Reading Standards by
reading closely for meaning, while determining main
ideas, details, structure, purpose, source type, and claims emitting from the sources, and comparing among multiple sources. The ten Anchor Reading
Standards offer a foundation for social studies in­
quiry. Together, the standards offer a comprehensive
picture of a skilled reader who is prepared to engage
sources during the process of inquiry. For example,
Reading Standard 1 requires students to “cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking” (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p. 10).
This skill is an important part of evaluating the cred­
ibility of a source, something that the C3 Framework
calls on students to do in Dimension 3. Additionally, in Reading Standard 8, students are expected to

evaluate arguments and claims in a text, given the “relevance and sufficiency of the evidence” (NGA
and CCSSO, 2010a, p. 8). By developing these skills, students become familiar with how others use evi­
dence and understand the importance of evidence in
arguments. The C3 Framework asks students to apply
these skills in the process of inquiry, so they are able
to construct disciplinary explanations and arguments.
Students evaluate sources and use evidence regularly when conducting inquiry. Anchor Writing Standard
1 sets an expectation that students will use “val­
id reasoning and relevant and sufficient evidence” when writing arguments (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a,
p. 18). Standard 2 for writing requires students to
“write informative/explanatory texts to examine and convey complex ideas” (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p.
18). Writing Standards 7-9 offer a range of specific
activities that undergird student expectations for this
Dimension of the C3 Framework: Writing Standard
7 focuses on “short as well as more sustained research projects based on focused questions” (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p. 18); Writing Standard 8 calls on
students to “gather relevant information” and “assess the credibility and accuracy of each source” (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p. 18); and Writing Standard 9
asks students to draw evidence from (in this case) in­
formational texts “to support analysis, reflection, and research” (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p. 18). The C3
Framework extends all of these skills for the purpose of disciplinary inquiry and civic engagement.
Inquiry in social studies is an inherently collaborative activity, and thus, Anchor Speaking and Listening
Standard 1 is particularly relevant in Dimension 3.
Speaking and Listening Standard 1 calls on students
to “prepare for and participate effectively in a range of
conversations and collaborations with diverse part­
ners, building on others’ ideas and expressing their own clearly and persuasively” (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p. 22). The C3 Framework assumes a collab­
orative environment as students work through their
inquiries. As students gather and evaluate sources for
relevant information and determine credibility to­
ward building claims with evidence, they should have
multiple opportunities to practice civil, democratic discourse with diverse partners.
Shared Language. The ELA/Literacy Common
Core Standards closely align with Indicators in Dimension 3. In places, the connections between the Common Core Standards and C3 Framework
Indicators are so close that we used the same lan­ guage. For example, the terms argument, sources,
evidence, claims, counterclaims, and gather are used consistently in both the ELA/Literacy Common Core
Standards and the C3 Framework.
It is important to note that the ELA/Literacy
Common Core Standards emphasize the unique skill
of argumentation in preparing students for college
and career. The disciplines that make up the social
studies, including the behavioral and social sciences,
stress the importance of arguments, and in particular,
the necessity of constructing them in ways that make
use of sources and data as evidence. While in grades
K–5, the ELA/Literacy Common Core Standards em­
ploy the term opinion to refer to a developing form of argument, the C3 Framework uses the term argument consistently throughout the K-12 grade bands.
The Common Core Standards use the terms sources
and gather regularly with regard to locating, evaluat­
ing, making claims, and using evidence. In places, the
ELA/Literacy Common Core Standards distinguish
sources as print or digital, as visual, quantitative and/or
textual sources, and as primary or secondary sources.
In social studies these distinctions are made man­
ifest in spatial sources such as maps, quantitative information reflecting economic data and trends,
and even physical sources such as historical artifacts.
Dimension 3 explicitly references the distinction
between primary and secondary sources, based on the intended use by students.
Lastly, it is important to note that Anchor Writing
Standard 8 of the Common Core Standards calls at­
tention to the issue of plagiarism and proper citation of sources—a key concern for the C3 Framework and for social studies teachers.

Communicating
Conclusions &
Taking INFORMED
ACTION
THE C3 FRAMEWORK PROVIDES GUIDANCE to states on framing social
studies standards that ask students to develop questions, apply disciplinary knowledge
and concepts, gather and evaluate sources, and then develop claims and use evidence
to support those claims. In addition, state social studies standards should consider
including expectations for students to collaborate with others as they communicate and critique their conclusions in public venues.
These venues may range from the school classroom
to the larger public community. Collaborative efforts may range from teaming up to work on a group
presentation with classmates to actual work on a local
issue that could involve addressing real-world prob­
lems that students analyze through the methods and
concepts informed by their work in the disciplines that constitute the social studies.
Most inquiries will culminate in a range of activities and assessments that support the goals of college
and career readiness. They should also support the
third feature of the C3 Framework: readiness for civic
life. Civic engagement in the social studies may take many forms, from making independent and collab­
orative decisions within the classroom, to starting
and leading student organizations within schools, to conducting community-based research and present­
ing findings to external stakeholders. The subsection
on page 62 below, Taking Informed Action, provides
students opportunities to adapt and apply their work
in the disciplines that constitute the social studies in
order to develop the skills and dispositions necessary
for an active civic life. In this respect, civic engage­
ment is both a means of learning and applying social studies knowledge.

Communicating and Critiquing Conclusions
Having worked independently and collaboratively
through the development of questions, the application
of disciplinary knowledge and concepts, and the gath­
ering of sources and use of evidence and information,
students formalize their arguments and explanations.
Products such as essays, reports, and multimedia
presentations offer students opportunities to represent their ideas in a variety of forms and communicate
their conclusions to a range of audiences. Students’
primary audiences will likely be their teachers and
classmates, but even young children benefit from op­
portunities to share their conclusions with audiences outside their classroom doors.

for students to critique their work as well as the work
of others. Critiquing conclusions requires an exam­
ination of sources, consideration of how evidence is
being used to support claims, and an appraisal of the structure and form of arguments and explanations.
The critiquing of arguments and explanations deep­
ens students’ understanding of concepts and tools in
the disciplines, and helps students strengthen their
conclusions. While the two indicators for critiquing
conclusions appear in Dimension 4, students should
begin the process of critiquing their emerging conclu­
sions early in the inquiry process, and continue that process even after communicating conclusions.
Indicators of Dimension 4-Critiquing Conclusions are
detailed in the suggested K-12 Pathway for College,
Career, and Civic Readiness in Table 29.

Taking Informed Action
Social studies is the ideal staging ground for taking
informed action because of its unique role in prepar­
ing students for civic life. In social studies, students
use disciplinary knowledge, skills, and perspectives
to inquire about problems involved in public issues;
deliberate with other people about how to define
and address issues; take constructive, independent,
and collaborative action; reflect on their actions; and
create and sustain groups. It is important to note that
taking informed action intentionally comes at the end
of Dimension 4, as student action should be grounded
in and informed by the inquiries initiated and sus­
tained within and among the disciplines. In that way,
action is then a purposeful, informed, and reflective experience.
Indicators of Dimension 4—Taking Informed Action—

CONNECTIONS: DIMENSION 4
The ELA/Literacy Common Core Standards empha­ size products of learning and communication in a
variety of ways. As noted in the introduction to the
ELA/Literacy Common Core Standards, “the need to conduct research and to produce and consume media
is embedded into every aspect of today’s curriculum” (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p. 4). The production and
presentation of knowledge is central to the design of the ELA/Literacy Common Core Standards.
Production and Distribution of Writing is one of four
categories in the Writing strand of the standards, and Presentation of Knowledge and Ideas is one of
three categories in the Speaking and Listening strand.
Through Communicating Conclusions and Taking
Informed Action, Dimension 4 in the C3 Framework extends the notion of publishing the products of
students’ inquiry for disciplinary and civic purposes in social studies.
Table 31 details connections between Dimension 4 and the College and Career Readiness Anchor
Standards in the ELA/Literacy Common Core
Standards. These connections are further elaborated with examples.
Connections between the C3 Framework and the College and Career Readiness Anchor
Standards. While the connections between the C3
Framework and the ELA/Literacy Common Core
Standards are comprehensive and consistent, fifteen
CCR Anchor Standards within the ELA/Literacy
Common Core Standards have broader connections within Dimension 4.
Anchor Reading Standard 1 indicates the importance of employing evidence when communicating con­
clusions as well as forming a plan of action based on information and data. Both making decisions and
presenting results stem from students being able to
both identify and use “explicit” information found within texts, as well as draw and act upon “logi­ cal inferences” made from what they read (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p. 10). Reading Standard 1 also
expects students to “cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text”  (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p.
10). The C3 Framework utilizes this focus on evidence by emphasizing that conclusions based on evidence should be framed and communicated using informa­ tion gathered while students read. The Framework also views informed decision making and action
stemming from those decisions as driven by data and
information that flows from evidence that has been collected by students.
Anchor Writing Standards 1–8 describe skills stu­
dents need to construct arguments, explanations, and
narratives. Writing Standards 4–6 focus on the pro­
duction and distribution of student writing. Standard
4 describes skills related to the production of “clear
and coherent writing” that is “appropriate to task, purpose, and audience” (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p.
✪
The Inquiry Arc of the C3 Framework • 63

18). Standard 5 explains the process writing skills that
students should develop. Standard 6 establishes that
students should use technology to publish and distrib­
ute their writing. Standard 7 focuses on “short as well
as more sustained research projects based on focused
questions” (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p. 18). Standard
8 calls on students to “gather relevant information,”
“assess the credibility and accuracy of each source,”
and “integrate the information” into the text while “avoiding plagiarism” (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p.
18). The C3 Framework builds on these anchor stan­
dards by setting forth expectations that students will construct disciplinary arguments and explanations
for a variety of audiences both inside and outside of school, and then plan how to take informed action given the products of their inquiry.
Anchor Speaking and Listening Standards 1-6 require
that students engage one another strategically us­
ing different forms of media in a variety of contexts
in order to present their knowledge and ideas. For
example:
•	 Standard 1 requires that students prepare and participate in a “range of conversations and collaborations with diverse partners” (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p. 22).
•	 Standard 2 focuses on student use of diverse types of media to enhance communication.
•	 Standard 3 expects that students will evaluate speakers’ points of view, reasoning, and use of evidence.
•	 Standard 4 expects that students will present “information, findings, and supporting evidence,” with consideration of “task, purpose, and audi­ ence” (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p. 22).
•	 Standard 5 asks students to make strategic use of “media and visual displays” when presenting (NGA and CCSSO, 2010a, p. 22).
•	 Standard 6 requires that students take into con­ sideration the context of their engagement.
The C3 Framework incorporates these skills through the expectations of Dimension 4, Communicating
Conclusions, that students will present the products of
their inquiries as well as adaptations of these products
using a variety of technologies. When preparing to
take informed action, students engage with one an­
other in a productive manner using the skills set forth in the Speaking and Listening Standards.
Shared Language. The ELA/Literacy Common
Core Standards closely align with Indicators in Dimension 4. In places, the connections between
Common Core Standards and C3 Framework
Indicators are so close that the same language is used.
Dimension 4 and the ELA/Literacy Common Core
Standards regularly use terms such as argument,
explanation, sources, evidence, claims, counterclaims, visually/visualize, and credibility.
The ELA/Literacy Common Core Standards use the
terms visual and visually to refer to presentation for­
mats. The terms are often used in contrast to quan­
titative formats and as modifiers for a type of data display. The C3 Framework uses the terms writing,
visualizing, and speaking in describing expectations
for students for all of the Indicators in Table 28,
Communicating Conclusions, on page 60. The uses of
visual, visually, and visualizing are similar in referring
to ways of presenting information that would other­ wise be limited or even impossible using words.
Within the Common Core Standards, important lit­
eracy conventions are defined (e.g., citations, spelling,
plagiarism) with regard to the presentation of conclu­
sions, and these literacy conventions are integral to social studies inquiry.

Disciplinary Inquiry
Matrix
THE HEART OF THE C3 FRAMEWORK lies in the Inquiry Arc and the four
Dimensions that define it. But no inquiry is generic; each takes root in a compelling
question that draws from one or more of the disciplines of civics, economics, geography, and history.
The C3 Framework Disciplinary Inquiry Matrix
articulates how each of the four Dimensions of the C3
Framework builds upon one another through the use
of a content-specific example: how bad was the recent
Great Recession?
The Disciplinary Inquiry Matrix describes what experts
think and do. It is a four-part target example to which
students should aspire. The matrix develops through
the construction of disciplinary compelling and sup­
porting questions (Dimension 1); the data sources, key
concepts, and key strategies specific to each discipline (Dimension 2); the development of evidence-based claims (Dimension 3); and the means of expression
(Dimension 4). The examples in the boxes are illustra­ tive rather than exhaustive.

Introduction to the Disciplinary Concepts and Skills of Psychology
As the scientific study of behavior and mental processes,
psychology examines all aspects of the human expe­
rience. Many of society’s challenging issues involve
human behavior, such as environmental change and the
problems of violence, bullying, prejudice, and discrim­
ination. Psychology contributes to the understanding
of these issues, and promotes improvement in health
and wellbeing. Psychological literacy is a foundation for
civic engagement and is necessary for citizens to make informed decisions about their daily lives.
Psychology incorporates a variety of tools and knowl­ edge to further the understanding of behavior and mental processes. Scientific inquiry and research
methods are at the center of the discipline. Psychology
promotes the measurement and explication of behav­
ior in a variety of levels of study, ranging from genetic
and brain-based influences on behavior to cultural and
social influences. Psychological knowledge enhances our understanding of human development, emotion
and motivation, cognition, learning processes, percep­
tual systems and sociocultural interactions. Psychology
prepares students to enter the workforce or college by
promoting skills such as critical thinking, problem
solving, and teamwork. Students benefit from learn­
ing and applying psychological perspectives on per­
sonal and contemporary issues and learn the rules of
evidence and theoretical frameworks of the discipline.
The National Standards for High School Psychology
Curricula offers learning benchmarks for the high school psychology course (APA, 2011).2
Psychological Perspectives and Methods of Inquiry3
Psychological knowledge is based on scientific method­
ology, the systematic, empirically-based investigation of phenomena through observations and measurements.
Psychologists use scientific methods to establish knowl­ edge and explain phenomena, and employ a variety of methods to observe and measure behavior. Broad psychological perspectives describe ways in which
psychologists classify their ideas, and are employed to understand behavior and mental processes.

Psychology offers a unique way of thinking and or­
ganizing knowledge and provides students with tools
and concepts that can prepare them for college, ca­
reer, and civic life. The indicators that follow align with Dimension 2 of the C3 Framework (Applying
Disciplinary Concepts and Tools), provide a conceptual
set of skills related to psychological knowledge, and
serve as a frame for organizing curricular content in psychology.
College, Career, and Civic ready students:
•
D2.Psy.1.9-12. Demonstrate a basic understand­
ing of the scientific methods that are at the core of psychology.

answer a psychological question using basic descrip­ tive and inferential statistics.
•
D2.Psy.7.9-12. Explore multicultural and global
perspectives that recognize how diversity is import­ ant to explaining human behavior.
Influences on Thought and Behavior
There is no simple answer to the question, “What deter­
mines or constrains human behavior?” Psychologists have long considered the extent to which human
behavior is malleable and the degree to which it varies
between people and populations. Psychologists exam­
ine genetic predispositions to behavioral patterns, but
human behavior is also influenced by the environment.
Research has shown that biological, psychological, and
sociocultural factors play important roles in shaping the way we see and react to the world around us.
College, Career, and Civic ready students:
•
D2.Psy.8.9-12. Explain the complexities of human
thought and behavior, as well as the factors related to the individual differences among people.
•
D2.Psy.9.9-12. Describe biological, psychological,
and sociocultural factors that influence individuals’ cognition, perception, and behavior.
•

ence can play in helping us understand differences in individual cognitive and physical abilities.
•
D2.Psy.12.9-12. Explain how social, cultural, gen­ der, and economic factors influence behavior and human interactions in societies around the world.
Critical Thinking: Themes, Sources, and Evidence
Psychological inquiry is based on a variety of sources
and materials that students can read and analyze. The study of psychology brings together common themes
that include ethics, diversity, scientific attitudes,
and skills (e.g., critical thinking, problem solving).
Informed by these themes and supported by sources,
students can make evidence-based conclusions which
in turn can lead to further questions and answers.
College, Career, and Civic ready students:
•
D2.Psy.13.9-12. Explain common themes across
the field of psychological science, including ethical
issues, diversity, developmental issues, and concerns about health and wellbeing.
•

Applications of Psychological Knowledge
Psychological knowledge can be useful in addressing
a wide array of issues, from individual to global levels.
In order to understand behavior and mental processes,
students should apply psychological knowledge to the
world around them. Psychological knowledge directly
relates to everyday and civic life, and its application can benefit society and improve people’s lives.
College, Career, and Civic ready students:
•
D2.Psy.18.9-12. Apply psychological knowledge to their daily lives.
•
D2.Psy.19.9-12. Apply the major theoretical approaches in psychology to educational, emotion­
al, political, ethical, motivational, organizational, personal, and social issues.
•
D2.Psy.20.9-12. Suggest psychologically based eth­
ical solutions to actual problems including, but not
limited to, those encountered in education, business and industry, and the environment.
•
D2.Psy.21.9-12. Discuss ways in which the applica­
tions of psychological science can address domestic and global issues.
•
D2.Psy.22.9-12. Use psychological knowledge to promote healthy lifestyle choices.
•
D2.Psy.23.9-12. Apply psychological knowledge to civic engagement.

More detailed curricular recommendations are found
in the National Standards for High School Psychology
Curricula (APA, 2011). Although psychological science
can be found in science and social studies lessons for
students in grades K-8, the first formal introduction to
psychological science often occurs during grades 9-12.
Learning the theories, methodologies, and practices of
psychological science provides students with knowl­

Introduction to Disciplinary Concepts and Skills in Sociology
Sociology is the study of social life, social change, and
the social causes and consequences of human behavior.
Sociologists investigate the structure of groups, orga­
nizations, and societies and how people interact within
these contexts. Since all human behavior is social, the
subject matter of sociology ranges from the intimate
family to the hostile mob; from organized crime to
religious traditions; and from the divisions of race, gen­
der, and social class to the shared beliefs of a common culture.2
Sociology is a science that uses research methods to in­
vestigate the social world. The scientific process ensures
that the knowledge produced is more representative,
objective, trustworthy, and useful for explaining social
phenomena than personal opinions or individual ex­
periences. Social phenomena are constructed through
human interaction. Thus, sociological inquiry must
examine what meanings people give to the behaviors,
objects, and interactions that are present in each culture
and society. It utilizes the scientific method, is based
on critical thinking, and requires students to examine
how they are influenced by their social positions. In this
way, students learn how to effectively participate in a
diverse and multicultural society, and develop a sense of personal and social responsibility.
This Appendix outlines four fundamental disciplinary
learning goals for College, Career, and Civic ready
students in sociology. These goals highlight key areas
for student learning and instructional focus in K-12
sociology units and courses. Each of the four learning
goals is accompanied by a set of assessable competen­
cies. These learning goals align with Dimension 2 of the
C3 Framework (Applying Disciplinary Concepts and Tools).
The Sociological Perspective and Methods of Inquiry
Sociology provides a unique perspective by focusing on
the groups to which individuals belong rather than only
on the individual. It deeply considers how social con­
texts influence both individuals and groups. In this way,
it helps students to see the world through others’ eyes,
to increase their understanding of group dynamics,
and to develop tolerance of differences. Sociology uses
objective and data-driven scientific methods to study

D2.Soc.5.9-12. Give examples of the strengths and weaknesses of four main methods of sociological
research: surveys, experiments, observations, and content analysis.
Social Structure: Culture, Institutions, and Society
Sociology studies the social structure and culture of
societies in order to understand how social patterns are
created and maintained over time; examples of these
might include persistent violence or long-standing dis­
parities in school achievement. Important components
of social structures are institutions such as the economy,
government and politics, the educational system, the
family, religion, and the health care system. Culture
includes the language, norms, values, and material
goods of a society. Social structure and culture work in
tandem to shape societies, but are not completely rigid.
All individuals are impacted by social change, which re­
fers to the transformation of culture, social institutions, and social structure over time.
College, Career, and Civic ready students:
•
D2.Soc.6.9-12. Identify the major components of culture.

•
D2.Soc.9.9-12. Explain the role of social institu­ tions in society.
•
D2.Soc.10.9-12. Analyze how social structures and cultures change.
Social Relationships: Self, Groups, and Socialization
A fundamental insight of sociology is that individual
and group identity is socially constructed through
relationships with significant individuals, groups, and
society as a whole. Socialization is a life-long process of
learning how to function in society. Important social­
izing agents include family, peers, the media, schools,
and religion. Major social and historical events can be a
force in socializing entire generational groups. Groups form when individuals share common interests and/
or goals, and often become a point of comparison for
individuals as they evaluate themselves and others.
College, Career, and Civic ready students:
•
D2.Soc.11.9-12. Analyze the influence of the primary agents of socialization and why they are influential.
•
D2.Soc.12.9-12. Explain the social construction of self and groups.

as well as the effects groups have on individuals and
society, and the effects of individuals and societies on groups.
•
D2.Soc.14.9-12. Explain how in-group and out group membership influences the life chances of individuals and shapes societal norms and values.
Stratification and Inequality
Sociology helps students to understand their own and
others’ social problems. Group memberships and iden­
tities provide or deny certain opportunities and power.
They also create and reinforce social stratification. This
can result in conflict between groups for scarce or
valued resources, and in diminished access for some in 74 • C3 Framework

society as others control these resources. Disadvantaged
groups experience social problems such as poverty,
unemployment, poor education, lack of access to health
care, and inequality in obtaining rights and privileges.

Brief Overview of Connections between
Sociology and the English Language
Arts/Literacy Common Core Standards
Connections with the College and Career
Readiness (CCR) Anchor Standards. Students
in sociology develop and use skills that are central to the Common Core College and Career Readiness
Anchor Standards. Learning the theories, methodolo­
gies, and practices of sociology provides students with
the knowledge and skills they need to think critically
about the world they live in, themselves, and how they
are influenced by their social positions. By studying
sociology, students learn how to effectively participate
in a diverse and multi-cultural society, and develop a
sense of personal and social responsibility. Students
in sociology integrate and evaluate multiple sources of
information presented in diverse formats and media in
order to address questions or solve complex problems.
They are required to integrate data and information
from diverse sources, both primary and secondary, in
order to form a coherent and empirically- based under­
standing of an idea or social event, noting discrepancies
among sources. Students learn how to propose, plan,
and conduct simple research and action projects as well
as read, discuss, and critique research findings in ways
that apply their acquired content knowledge and hone
the skills discussed in the Anchor Standards in Reading,
Writing, Speaking and Listening, and Language.
More detailed curricular recommendations for so­
ciology can be found on the website of the American
Sociological Association (www.asanet.org/highschool).
Although concepts from sociology are frequently seen
in science and social studies lessons for students in grades K-8, more commonly the first formal intro­
duction to sociology occurs in grades 9-12. Learning
the theories, methodologies, and practices of sociol­
ogy provides students with the knowledge and skills
they need to think critically about sources of evidence,
address issues using a systematic Arc of Inquiry based
on the scientific method, and understand relationships
among variables in complex social contexts. In this way,
sociology supports students’ successful entry into the world of work or post-secondary education.

Introduction to the Disciplinary Concepts and Skills of Anthropology
Anthropology is the study of human beings, past and
present, in societies around the world. To understand
the full sweep and complexity of cultures across all of human history, anthropology draws and builds
upon knowledge from the social, natural, and physical
sciences as well as the humanities. Anthropology is a
comparative discipline; it assumes basic human con­
tinuities over time and place, but also recognizes that
every society is the product of its own particular history,
and that within every society one finds variation as
well as commonalities. Anthropologists are centrally
concerned with applying their research findings to the solution of human problems.
Anthropology includes four subfields. Physical anthro­
pologists study human biological origins, evolution
and variation, how humans adapt to diverse environ­
ments, primatology, and how biological and cultural
processes work together to shape growth, development,
and behavior. Archaeologists study past peoples and
cultures, from the deepest prehistory to the recent past.
Sociocultural anthropologists observe social patterns
and practices across cultures, with a special interest
in how people live in particular places and how they
organize, govern, and create meaning. Linguistic an­
thropology is the comparative study of language systems
and the ways in which language reflects and influences
social life. Each of the subfields teaches distinctive
skills. However, the subfields also have a number of
similarities. For example, each subfield applies theories,
employs systematic research methodologies, formulates
and tests hypotheses, and develops extensive sets of data.
Concept 1. What It Means to be Human:
Unity and Diversity
Anthropologists study what people have in common,
and also how we differ with respect to physical and so­
ciocultural characteristics. Importantly, they examine
human physical variability and also the social reality
of racial categorization and racism. Variable physical
features like skin color and blood type do not cluster
into clear-cut biologically defined races. At the same
time, categorization into socially defined races is a real
phenomenon with real consequences in societies like
the United States. Race then is socially “real” even if biologically it has no grounding.
Appendices • 77

=== Page 78 ===
Anthropologists emphasize the importance of culture—
patterns and processes of meaning expressed through language and other symbols. Anthropologists study all kinds of human groups, from small villages to
transnational corporations, from large U.S. cities to remote Arctic and desert groups; even schools and
classrooms can be subjects of anthropological inquiry.
Anthropologists examine how societies change; how
a society’s beliefs, institutions, and ways of making a
living are related to one another; and how individuals
are shaped by their cultures and also agents of their
own lives. A central anthropological insight is the
notion of cultural relativism—that no cultural group
is inherently “superior” or “inferior” to any other, and
that all human behaviors are understandable in their
cultural context even if humans may ultimately aspire to certain universal standards.
College, Career, and Civic ready students:
•
Understand patterns of human physical variability and the evidence for arguing that humans cannot be sorted into distinct biological races.
•
Develop through comparison awareness of human
unity and cultural diversity, and of the connections among peoples from around the world.
•
Understand the reasons for and development of human and societal endeavors, such as small-scale
societies and civilizations, across time and place.
•
Use anthropological concepts and practice to reflect
on representations of “otherness” and consider criti­ cally students’ own cultural assumptions.
•
Apply anthropological concepts and theories to the
study of contemporary social change, conflict, and
other important local, national, and international problems.
Concept 2. Methods and Ethics of Inquiry
Anthropologists take a scientific approach to collecting
empirical information, seeking to be systematic, trans­
parent, and trustworthy in conducting and reporting
research. For example, archaeologists study past peo­
ples and cultures through the analysis of carefully exca­
vated material remains, while physical anthropologists
analyze evidence ranging from fossils to the DNA of
living people. Sociocultural and linguistic anthropol­
ogists often rely on direct participation in and obser­
vation of a group’s daily life, interpreting meanings constructed by people in the group and sometimes
collaborating with them as active participants in the
research. When analyzing their findings, anthropolo­
gists often seek to understand particular local situations
in the context of larger social forces, and in great depth.
At the same time, comparison across places and times is a hallmark of anthropological study.
Because the study of people, past and present, requires
respect for the diversity of individuals, cultures, so­
cieties, and knowledge systems, anthropologists are
expected to adhere to a strong code of professional eth­
ics. In addition, an engaged anthropology is committed
to supporting social change efforts that arise from the interaction between community goals and anthropo­ logical research.
College, Career, and Civic ready students:
•
Identify and critically assess the opportunities to
use anthropological knowledge in a variety of work
settings and in everyday experience, as well as issues
of description and representation in anthropology.
•
Develop an understanding of the methods by which anthropologists collect data on cultural patterns
and processes, and of ways of interpreting and pre­ senting these data in writing and other media.
•
Identify and critically assess ethical issues that arise
in the practice of anthropological research, includ­ ing issues of informed consent.
•
Under the guidance of teachers, design, undertake,
and report on personal research on an anthropolog­
ical topic of interest, such as a limited ethnographic
study of a local culture or a visit to an archaeologi­ cal site.
Concept 3. Becoming a Person: Processes,
Practices, and Consequences
Anthropologists examine what it means to be human
by observing and recording the processes, practic­
es, and consequences involved in becoming a person.
78 • C3 Framework

=== Page 79 ===
They explore what it means to be a person in different
cultural contexts and the dynamic nature of identities
on an individual level; on a larger scale, they explore the
nature of boundaries between human groups. They ask,
for example, what it means to be a full-fledged adult in
different societies and through what rites of passage or
other processes people become adults. They ask how
people use symbols or other tools to draw boundar­
ies based upon language, religion, gender, ethnicity,
nationality, territory, or history, and they ask about the consequences of boundaries within and between
societies, including exclusion and differences of power
or status, racism and ethnic conflict, class conflict, and
religious conflict. Throughout such discussions, they
consider the relative importance of individual autono­ my versus structural forces.
College, Career, and Civic ready students:
•
Understand the variety of gendered, racialized, or
other identities individuals take on over the life
course, and identify the social and cultural process­
es through which those identities are constructed.
•
Apply anthropological concepts of boundaries to
the analysis of current ethnic, racial, or religious conflicts in the world—or in a local setting.
Concept 4. Global and Local: Societies,
Environments, and Globalization
Because anthropology examines human experience
around the world, it is attuned to global connections as
well as local perspectives. Anthropologists examine the
extent of globalization and its causes and consequences.
For example, they study the movement of people, ideas
and objects, and the causes and consequences of such movement, from the first human migration “out of
Africa” to current diasporas. They consider the degree
to which the global affects the local and vice versa,
including debates about cultural homogenization and
standardization. They bring together the global and
local to consider perspectives on important world is­
sues, including environmental conflict, global warming,
wars, and nationalism. They consider human rights and
the global justice movement and issues of cultural rela­
tivism, such as whether human rights should supersede local cultural rights.
College, Career, and Civic ready students:
•
Understand and appreciate cultural and social difference, and how human diversity is produced
and shaped by local, national, regional, and global patterns.
•
Understand how one’s local actions can have global
consequences, and how global patterns and process­ es can affect seemingly unrelated local actions.
•
Become critically aware of ethnocentrism, its
manifestations, and consequences in a world that is progressively interconnected.
•
Apply anthropological concepts to current global
issues such as migrations across national borders or environmental degradation.
Connections to the College and Career
Readiness (CCR) Anchor Standards. Students in
anthropology develop and use skills that are included throughout the Common Core Anchor Standards in Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, and
Language. As students learn to describe current and
past cultures and societies, they use vocabulary that is
new or employed in a new way. These descriptions often
require students to compare the point of view of a local
inhabitant with their own perspective, which may be
quite different, or with the perspective of a Western vis­
itor or colonizer. Anthropology students formulate and
test hypotheses by conducting small-scale ethnographic
studies and related observational research in biological
anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and archaeology.
Students learn to write ethnographic field notes mod­
eled on those of professional anthropologists, which
is excellent practice for writing routinely on a daily or
weekly basis. These field notes require disciplining the
memory while learning to distinguish between descrip­ tion and interpretation.
More detailed curricular recommendations are found on the AAA website (http://www.aaanet.org); see
especially the section “For Teachers” and the Teaching
Materials Exchange (additional resources are listed
on page 80). Anthropological concepts and ideas are
important for social studies students in all grades, but
the first formal introduction to anthropology typically
Appendices • 79

=== Page 80 ===
occurs during grades 9-12. In these grades, students
will regularly use Common Core ELA/Literacy skills as they understand and apply anthropological con­
cepts, theories, and methods. Students who successfully
develop their inquiry skills in anthropology classes will
fulfill goals of the Common Core Standards for College and Career readiness.

How have different groups of people in the United States experienced the recession? Remembering
anthropology’s commitment to holism, is the nation the most helpful scale at which to study the Great

metropolitan area (e.g., Orlando)? A neighborhood (e.g., Hyde Park in Chicago)? Something smaller,
like a mobile home court or school attendance area? How can studies at one scale be useful for under­ standing what is happening at another?
Is the “Great Recession” an event unique to the United States? How do groups of people outside the

Scholarly
Rationale for the
C3 Framework
IN THE C3 FRAMEWORK, the call for students to become more prepared for
the challenges of college and career (Bellanca and Brandt, 2010; Di Giacomo, Linn,
Monthey, Pack, and Wyatt, 2013; Partnership for 21st Century Schools, 2011)1 is united
with a third element: preparation for civic life. Advocates of citizenship education cross
the political spectrum, but they are bound by a common belief that our democratic
republic will not sustain unless students are aware of their changing cultural and
physical environments; know the past; read, write, and think deeply; and act in ways
that promote the common good. There will always be differing perspectives on these
objectives. The goal of knowledgeable, thinking, and active citizens, however, is universal.
The need for strong preparation in social studies is
as apparent today as it has been in the past. In their
Framework for 21st Century Learning (2011), the
Partnership for 21st Century Skills identified govern­
ment and civics, economics, geography, and history
among the nine core subjects. Moreover, civic literacy,
global awareness, and financial, economic, business,
and entrepreneurial literacy are identified among the
21st century interdisciplinary themes. Finally, sever­
al of the key life and career skills listed fall firmly if
not exclusively in the social studies: students must be
able to work independently, be self-directed learners,
interact effectively with others, and work effectively in
diverse teams. The push for college and career readi­
ness, so evident in the Common Core State Standards,
is important, but as the Framework for 21st Century
Learning makes clear, equally important is the need to
help students ready themselves for their roles as citizens.
The rationale for social studies as one of the core school
subjects is compelling. Unfortunately, that rationale has
not always translated into the kinds of coherent and
ambitious teaching and learning that enable students to
achieve the promise of calls like the Framework for 21st
Century Learning.
The C3 Framework and its Inquiry Arc mark a signifi­
cant departure from past attempts to develop a robust
social studies program. Some of the most compelling
reasons for this departure are the remarkably flat scores
on the National Assessment of Educational Progress
(NAEP) in Civics/Government, Economics, Geography,
and U.S. History (search “The Nation’s Report Card” by
these subjects to study the results). As the gold stan­
dard of national assessment, the NAEP results have
1	 The references in this Appendix are to works cited in the References section that follows.

=== Page 83 ===
been telling us for close to 20 years that our efforts to
improve learning in key social studies subjects have
not resulted in increased student achievement. Far
too many 12th graders leave school with below-basic understandings.
A second reason why the C3 Framework represents a
profound change is rooted in the research on teaching
and learning in social studies that has drawn a remark­
ably consistent picture of what typically happens in
schools. Too many social studies teachers—driven by
content coverage demands, growing accountability re­
quirements, and an all-too-crowded school day—spend
much of their time talking at students (e.g., Brophy
and Alleman, 2008; Cuban, 1991). Instead of building
understandings in a robust learning environment, stu­
dents too often spend their time simply trying to keep
track of all the ideas flowing at them from their teach­ ers and their textbooks.
This research, like the findings from the NAEP assess­
ments, paints a remarkably consistent portrait of the
consequences of such efforts: students learn too little.
They develop precious few deep understandings of what they are called upon to learn in social studies.
We also know from other research that what students
do retain from their studies is often wildly distorted
and riddled with all manner of naïve conceptions about
the past and the way the sociocultural world works (e.g.,
Frisch, 1989; Wineburg, Mosberg, Porat, and Duncan,
2007). They are also alienated by the social studies
experience they receive in school, which is particularly
the case among students of color (e.g., Epstein, 2009).
Students are asked to be good consumers of other
people’s knowledge and ideas, but they rarely get a
chance to build their own deeper understandings, to
learn to give up their naïve ideas, and to construct more powerful forms of knowledge. The outcome shows us
that little change in learning can be wrested from doing more of the same.
A growing body of research on how students learn
school subjects such as social studies repeatedly teaches
us that students need opportunities to ask questions,
pursue answers to those questions under the tutelage of
expert teachers who can show them how to discipline
their thinking processes, and take part in opportunities to communicate and act on their understandings
(Torney-Purta, Hahn, and Amadeo, 2001). Much of this
work is cited in this Appendix, as it forms the basis for the scholarly rationale for the C3 Framework.
The C3 Framework signals a significant departure from
past practices because it seeks to take advantage of this
research and address the messages sent by NAEP tests.
The Framework’s four Dimensions build directly from
the findings laid out in research on how students learn;
they seek to redress the limits on learning repeatedly
noted by NAEP tests. In what follows, we identify how
this research supports and underpins the fundamen­
tal shift in direction and practice the C3 Framework
embodies. If we are serious about wanting students who
are civic-minded and adequately prepared for both col­
lege and careers, we can no longer ignore the prospect of making good on this new direction.
The Importance of Questions
Children and adolescents are naturally curious, and
they are especially curious about the complex and mul­
tifaceted world they inhabit. Whether they articulate
them to adults or not, they harbor an almost bottomless
well of questions about how to understand that world.
Sometimes children’s and adolescents’ silence around
the questions in their heads leads adults to assume that
they are empty vessels waiting passively for adults to fill
them with their knowledge. This assumption could not be more mistaken.
Children’s and adolescents’ curiosity is deeply rooted
in an unceasing desire to make sense of what goes on
around them—through their language development; in
their social interactions with parents, siblings, friends, and community members; and through what they see
on television, in the movie theater, on YouTube, or on
the Internet. Perhaps little signals the intensity of this
socio-cultural curiosity so much as the wild popularity of social networking sites such as Facebook.
So what should a sound social studies education en­
tail? The C3 Framework provides a plan that is deeply
rooted in recent research on thinking, learning, and understanding.
For the reasons outlined above, a social studies educa­
tion must begin with the kinds of compelling questions
Appendices • 83

=== Page 84 ===
and investigations described in Dimension 1. Young
students will need help in framing useful questions
and planning their inquiries, but even the youngest
children want to make sense of the social and cultur­ al environments around them (Brophy and Alleman, 2008). For example, students want to know what to
make of the geographical spaces they inhabit whether
their local community lies on the banks of a large river,
on the high plain where the wind blows constantly, or
in the shadows of snow-covered mountains. They are
curious about the “olden days” Grandma always talks about. They wonder how money works as a means of
purchasing things at stores. And they are fascinated by
questions of who gets to make rules and whether those
rules are fair. As they develop, and with the guidance
of adults and peers, these questions give way to more
sophisticated variants (Hess, 2008; Rogoff, 1994).
For too many years, however, a social studies education
has meant a didactic, unidirectional process. Teachers
have tried to instill ideas directly from adults’ social
worlds into children’s minds on the assumption that, if
there was enough telling, imploring, and demanding
done, children would acquire those discipline-relat­ ed ideas (Brophy and Alleman, 2008; Cuban, 1991).
Researchers who have studied how children learn
repeatedly confirm that young people learn by framing
their own questions, with or without adult help (Bruner, 1960, 1996; Piaget, 1929/2007; Vosniadou, 2008;
Vygotsky, 1986). Young people also construct their own
problem-solving strategies, again with or without adult
assistance. Those questions and problem-solving strat­
egies, and the conclusions that young people reach, can
remain naïve, ill-structured, undisciplined, and mis­
leading without intervention by adults (Barton, 2008;
Brophy and Alleman, 2006; Hahn and Alviar-Martin,
2008; Hicks, van Hover, Doolittle, and VanFossen, 2012;
Miller and VanFossen, 2008; Segall and Helfenbein, 2008; VanSledright and Limon, 2006).
Challenging those nascent and often ill-formed ques­
tions, strategies, and conclusions can be very difficult,
particularly if teachers are unaware of them. Young
children, for example, often persist in the idea that
banks exist only to give people money (Berti, 1995). It is
not an unreasonable conclusion: they watch as parents get money from a bank’s ATM simply by inserting a
plastic card and punching a key or two. This process of “banks giving people money on command” answers the child’s crucial economic question—where does
money come from? Similarly, some young people insist
on believing that developments in the past add together
in such a way as to indicate a steady, if overgeneral­
ized, march forward; this is reflected in the notion that
things always and only get better (Barton, 1996; Brophy
and VanSledright, 1997). This perspective helps chil­
dren tell a story about why Grandpa is always talking
about how lucky kids are today, or why Mom tells them
about the childhood diseases she endured that they will not.
Children and adolescents are not empty vessels into
which we pour our adult ideas and knowledge. Decades
of research on how young people learn have repeat­
edly reinforced the view of students as active sense
makers, who rely heavily on language to mediate their
worlds and who are deeply enmeshed in investigating
their social worlds in search of better ways to navi­
gate it (Brophy, 1990; Bruner, 1996; Cole, 1995; Piaget, 1929/2007; Vygotsky, 1986).
Questions as Problem-Solving Spaces
The C3 Framework begins at the intersection of student
and discipline-based questions, those that concern the socio-cultural worlds that human beings have long
desired to understand (Dimension 1). Many of those
questions are discipline-specific, but others transcend
individual disciplinary categories and are multidimen­
sional in nature. For example, consider the question, how bad was the economic recession that began in 2007?
At first glance, this question seems to fall squarely
within the discipline of economics. It demarcates a clear economic problem space—the period of recent
economic struggle that saw incomes freeze or decline,
unemployment increase, and capital markets contract.
At the same time, it implies a set of supporting ques­
tions around spatial proportion: was the impact of this
recession felt equally across the country? Or were cer­
tain geographic regions less severely affected and, if so,
which ones and why? It also suggests additional ques­
tions involving history, politics and government. To ask
how bad this recession is, we need to have some sort of
historical reference point, such as the Great Depression,
from which to gauge its impact. And we need to know 84 • C3 Framework

=== Page 85 ===
what role government and political decision making
played in its inception, duration, and resolution.
A compelling question, then, demands that students
think and reason economically, geographically, histor­
ically, and politically (Dimension 2) in order to fully
address the issue. Along with the behavioral and social
sciences, these disciplinary lenses help students think
broadly; separately, these lenses enable students to set
up and pursue their investigations in different ways.
Investigative Practices and Problem-
Solving Strategies
To ask questions implies the desire to answer them.
Learning to investigate questions through the
thinking and problem-solving strategies offered by
the disciplines results in deeper understandings of the socio-cultural phenomena being investigated
(Brophy, 1990; Donovan and Bransford, 2005). Doing
so requires practicing those strategies until students
become skilled and achieve automaticity.2  Researchers
have found that learning new ways of thinking can be
slow because students often are reluctant to give up
intuitive but naïve ideas that seem to work for them
(e.g., Brophy, 1990; Piaget, 1929/2007). Persistence and
repeated opportunities for students to practice differ­
ent ways of thinking become the pedagogical order of the day.
So, what does thinking in the different disciplines look
like? What do the experts do and how do school-aged
students learn to accomplish it by comparison? What
sorts of changes in thinking practices do learners need
to undertake in order to become more knowledgeable about and proficient at understanding the world?
What follows is a brief review of the last five decades of research on these questions.
Economic Thinking
Economic investigators are interested in the compari­
son of marginal costs and marginal benefits to allocate resources in a manner that maximizes well-being.
Although not all economic investigators share the same assumptions about how markets and economies work,
they typically believe that economic actors—individ­
uals and/or organizations such as corporations—are
rational beings or entities focused on satisfying their
own self-interests. Because economic investigators are
interested in marketplace activity, patterns become
deeply important. Therefore, the language of numbers
plays a decisive role in the ways in which they conduct their investigations.
To understand the depth of the recent recession, for
example, economic investigators gather data about un­
employment patterns; corporate assets, liabilities, and
the changing patterns between them; government mon­
etary and fiscal policy roles; and the like. Investigators
use the patterns they glean from such data to assess
the depths of up-and-down turns in the economy, to
evaluate current states, to predict likely directions, and to offer recommendations. The ways that economic
investigators employ economic models and gather data
that offer evidence in support of those models provide
justification for their explanations and claims of under­ standing (Miller and VanFossen, 1994).
Such practices, if engaged in well, require a form of
economic literacy that depends on understanding and employing key concepts such as supply and demand,
market liquidity, business cycles, labor practices, con­
sumption, trade policies, and economic efficiencies
(Dahl, 1998; Greenspan, 2005; Morton, 2005; Saunders
and Gilliard, 1995; Council for Economic Education,
2010). That literacy also entails the application of theo­
ries that describe the interconnections among concepts and how they play out within economic structures.
These theories or models of economic activity (and they
can vary based on assumptions) allow investigators to
attempt predictive solutions for economic problems (Miller and VanFossen, 1994).
Children, however, draw from simple everyday experi­
ences to shape their views of how economies work, and
those everyday ideas, while seeming to make intuitive
sense, are decidedly naive (Berti, 1995; Berti and Bombi,
2	 Automaticity is a term that means exercising a complex, problem solving, cognitive operation without needing to devote conscious
energy to thinking through its specific requirements and processes. An
example from history might involve being able to read, analyze, and
synthesize a cluster of difficult and conflicting accounts on the way to
arriving at a defensible, evidence-based interpretation/understanding,
all without much apparent effort. Automaticity in some disciplinary
operations can take years to build. It is sometimes characterized as
a hallmark of cognitive, problem-solving expertise. It is certainly a symbol of competence and proficiency.

1988; Laney, 2001). Children frequently harbor a variety
of ill-structured and incomplete economic ideas, such
as the difference between buying and renting (Brophy
and Alleman, 2006), the size of a price tag determining
how much a good costs, and that pieces of property are
owned by the people who live around them (Laney and Schug, 1998).
These sorts of ideas held by children (and even some
adolescents) significantly limit their capability to think
economically and solve economic problems (Miller and
VanFossen, 2008). As Alice Rivlin (1999) once observed, “without a basic understanding of how the economy
works, what the…terms and concepts are, the average
citizen is likely to be left out of any conversation…about
what is happening in the economy and what to do about it.”
If students are to address a compelling question such
as measuring the impact of the recent recession, they
need opportunities to engage in investigations of such economic questions (Dimension 1), use economic
reasoning and problem-solving strategies (Dimension
2), gather data that address those questions (Dimension
3), and do all of this collaboratively inside and outside
the classroom context (Dimension 4). By engaging in
this process, students can become more economically
literate—able to use key economic concepts and da­
ta-gathering and analytic tools to solve problems. Doing
so requires the educational assistance of knowledgeable
social studies teachers, who know how to construct and
conduct such investigations, and within them, shape naïve ideas into more sophisticated ones.
Geographic Thinking
Geographic inquiry focuses attention on place and
space and seeks to understand why humans deal with
them in ways that they do and with what consequences.
Whereas to economists the recent recession is about
causes, effects, and solutions to slowing economic activ­
ity, to geographic investigators it is about understanding
and representing the spatial expressions of the events.
Maps and other graphics showing changes in spatial patterns of human and physical environments pro­
vide a geographic language that aids in analyzing and
understanding issues while stimulating new questions to investigate.
To investigate the causes and consequences of economic
and political events, geographers ask questions about the changing landscape of human activity—who was
affected, where, and how? For example, did the recent
global recession cause observable population shifts,
changes in landscape uses, or spatial re-patterning
of human activity across the United States and other
countries? To answer such questions requires prob­
lem-solving strategies that entail spatial thinking, data
gathering, and spatial analysis using geospatial data, maps, and other graphics.
Research on geographic thinking suggests that chil­
dren learn how to navigate spatial relationships early on. Even very young children develop mental maps of environments they experience and can manage to
work with simple directional maps (Bednarz, Acheson,
and Bednarz, 2010; Blades and Spencer, 1987) and they become somewhat adept at using map symbol systems
(Boardman, 1989). However, children may persist in
some naive understandings they initially develop such
as consistently misreading adult mapmakers’ represen­
tations of city populations by the use of different sizes of map dots.
Other map symbols are also misunderstood without
opportunities to investigate how they can be used to
convey spatial ideas (Bednarz et al., 2010; Hickey and
Bein, 1996; Liben and Downs, 1989). These misunder­
standings may arise repeatedly because the everyday
understandings children develop early on make good
intuitive sense to them. Geographic investigations that
involve more advanced forms of spatial reasoning help
learners reconstruct their misleading understandings
(Gregg, 1997). Simply telling children to change their
intuitive, but counter-productive spatial ideas does
little good. They need opportunities in the presence of
knowledgeable others to engage in spatial-reasoning
investigations (e.g., drawing and describing their own mental maps and making map representations based
on data collected or personal field observations) in
which they confront cognitive impasses created by their
naive everyday ideas. This kind of activity gives them
a chance to restructure what they believe and know in more productive ways.
Changes in geospatial technologies have extended and
amplified the reach and importance of the applications 86 • C3 Framework

=== Page 87 ===
of geographic knowledge, skills and perspectives.
Learning to employ technologies such as GIS and
Google Earth during their inquiries can serve ably in
providing students with opportunities to restructure
their knowledge, gain new skills, and change their per­
spectives. Students may engage in this process individu­
ally or collectively and collaboratively with the assis­
tance and guidance of the more knowledgeable teacher.
Geographic thinking entails representing complex
ideas about place. In many respects, places are created
through human activity as people adapt to and mod­
ify the spaces they occupy. Ways of representing such
activities are nearly always laden with the personal and
cultural perspectives of the representers (Harley, 1994;
Segall and Helfenbein, 2008). Without considerable
prompting, students typically do not think much about
who created the maps (i.e., cartographers), preferring instead to imagine that maps come ready-made and
are thus always accurate. Yet, the sorts of political and
socio-cultural distortions that may creep into such
representations and into geographic narratives are
crucial for students to understand if they are to achieve
the type of geographic literacy and capable thinking re­
quired of citizens in democracies (Bednarz et al., 2010).
How we come to understand and represent our global
and interconnected world has important consequences for our lives (Segall and Helfenbein, 2008).
If investigating and understanding how people make
economic choices, and with what consequences, helps
us better make sense of who we are and why we do what we do, then investigating how we come to know and
represent the world through geographic reasoning and
tools helps us understand even more fully who we are
and how we adapt to and modify a changing world. If taught in the research-based way the C3 Framework
suggests, economic and geographic understandings will
become less parochial and provincial as learners devel­ op into more sophisticated and incisive thinkers.
For a comprehensive review of geography education re­
search studies that examine how geographic knowledge,
skills, and practices develop across diverse individuals,
in a variety of settings, and over time, see Bednarz,
Heffron, and Huynh (2013).
Historical Thinking
In effect, posing historical questions involves asking what the past means, what people in the past were
thinking and talking about, and how that thinking and
language caused them to behave in the ways they did
(Collingwood, 1946/1993). Expert historical investi­
gators rely on residue from the past—both original accounts and testimonials and synthetic sources
constructed by previous investigators—to address those
questions. These sources demand extensive reading, de­
fined very broadly to include texts, cartoons, paintings, maps, charts, photographs, and the like.
In order to address their questions and develop deeper
understandings of how people acted in the past, histori­
ans read in particular ways (Lee, 2005; Wineburg, 2001).
This way of reading is a type of thinking that involves
strategies and skills, ones that lead to historical under­
standing. If we wish our students to ask more profound
questions of the past as well as construct deeper un­
derstandings of it, we need to teach them to think and
reason in the ways demonstrated by those with greater expertise (VanSledright, 2011).
Historical questions, then, demand that students search
out relevant accounts; identify what types of accounts
they are; attribute them to authors; assess the authors’
perspectives, language, motives, and agendas; and judge
the reliability of those texts for addressing the questions
posed (VanSledright and Afflerbach, 2005; Wineburg,
2001). They also do whatever they can to read these
authors slowly, closely, and within the historical con­
text of the period in which they lived (Reisman, 2012;
Wineburg, 2001). Students then convert those accounts
into forms of evidence for making claims about what
occurred and why (Lee, 2005; Lee and Shemilt, 2003).
These claims are justified through a process of evidence
corroboration in which the way the evidence prepon­
derates or comes together supports certain claims over
others. Collectively, the evidence-justified claims serve as a form of historical understanding.
In history, there is often a dispute over what the past
means. Investigators wrestle over what counts as justi­
fied understandings because evidence can sometimes
be applied to make multiple and different claims. It will
come as no surprise, then, that students investigating
the recent recession may arrive at varied conclusions.

For better or worse, historical reading and thinking,
and the specific strategies they require, seldom pro­
vide a single, definitive answer to the questions posed.
Children and adolescents can come to make sense of
this problem, since most of them have undergone expe­
riences in which differing perspectives (e.g., she said/he
said during a playground spat) prevented closure on a given issue.
Young people, the research studies suggest, do not nec­
essarily come to these forms of historical reading and
thinking on their own (Donovan and Bransford, 2005;
Levstik and Barton, 1997; VanSledright and Brophy,
1992; Wineburg, 2001). Their naïve, everyday ideas
formed through lived experience tend to interfere with richer understandings (Lee, 2005).
For example, children learn early on about the differ­
ence between telling the truth and telling a lie, since
uttering the latter is often met with punishment. They
quickly develop the idea that people can engage in only
these two dichotomous possibilities, and they bring this
social understanding to the social studies classroom.
When reading accounts about events during the
American Revolution—for example, one by a British
soldier and a contradictory one by a colonial min­
uteman concerning who was at fault during a bloody
skirmish, children (and even some adolescents) insist
that one or the other must be lying. In a complex world,
this dichotomous thinking can arrest understanding
because it becomes difficult to determine which is
which without corroborating evidence. Moreover, the
notion of differing (and often conflicting) perspectives
offers a more useful idea in that it helps explain why
historical actors may have interpreted what appears to
be the same situation in vastly different ways (Lee, 2005;
VanSledright, 2011; Wineburg, 2001). Helping students achieve such understandings can take a number of
different forms. Classroom discussions of emerging un­
derstandings based on analyses of sources and the evi­
dence they produce can be crucial (Hess, 2009). Writing
is also critical: recent studies have demonstrated that
students who write about their historical understand­
ings and are coached on how to gradually build sound
evidence-based arguments, demonstrate a deeper grasp
of how to address the questions posed (Monte-Sano, 2008; Monte-Sano, 2011).
This is but one additional example that explains why the
C3 Framework stresses the Inquiry Arc of developing
questions; applying disciplinary concepts; gathering
sources and using evidence; and working collaborative­
ly to develop conclusions and take action. Learning to
think historically (or economically, or geographically,
or politically) helps children and adolescents let go of
some of their less-productive ideas and develop richer
ones that aid in their understandings of the social and cultural world (Donovan and Bransford, 2005).
Civic-Minded Thinking
If economic investigators primarily explore questions
about how resources move to produce goods and ser­
vices and how, in turn, those products flow to consum­
ers, investigators who study politics and government
primarily examine questions about how power flows.
They are interested in understanding the political and
civic actions of individuals and organizations and how
they influence one another (Budano, 2012). Returning
to the question about the recent recession, civic-minded
investigators would trace how people’s political behav­
ior (e.g., voting practices, campaign donations) shapes
the policies of elected officials in government and/or the
converse. Those investigations would produce data that
could be used to identify the role different policies (e.g.,
federal and local taxation, fiscal and monetary, discre­
tionary and entitlement spending), or the lack thereof, play in creating a growth-recession cycle.
Analyzing how bad the recession was might be gauged
by investigators of the civil polity through surveys of
people’s attitudes toward governmental organizations
during this recession compared to other recessions, and
how citizens deliberated about it and responded in the
voting booth. These investigators might also survey the
movement and efficacy of repair policies (e.g., stimulus
packages, bail outs) through governmental organiza­
tions. Policy developments, their sources, and conse­
quences as exercises in power shape the vocabulary of
politics and government investigators. Their efforts are animated by asking questions about how power
flows through cultures, resulting in policies and laws
that regulate how citizens interact to solve dilemmas
and conflicts between and among different interests.
These investigators borrow a number of concepts and
models from economists and historians. Because their
questions focus on different kinds of problems (e.g., the 88 • C3 Framework

=== Page 89 ===
nature of civic behavior, or the effects of government
policies), they use the concepts and models differently in order to address those problems.
Young social studies students typically have rather lim­
ited understandings of the internal workings of politics
and civic behavior, both among individuals and within and across governmental bodies. They learn about
voting as a decision-making strategy and can engage
in simple forms of it, but they can have quite naïve
understandings about it and they often overgeneralize
the circumstances in which it can be applied (e.g., that
all decisions should be subjected to a vote). Students of
all ages are very curious about how decisions get made, and show interest in participating.
Early on, children rely heavily on their families for ideas
about civic participation and how it works (Hess and
Torney, 1967/2009). In order to learn how to participate
effectively within deliberative and policymaking con­
texts, students need considerable guidance and contin­
ual practice in order to modify their naïve political and
civic ideas. Students who are encouraged to ask ques­
tions, debate alternative actions, and gather evidence
about the likely consequences of choosing one direction
over others are typically less cynical than peers who do
not have those experiences (Haas, 2004; Torney-Purta,
Hahn, and Amadeo, 2001). Opportunities to engage in
service-learning experiences also help prepare students
for their adult responsibilities in participatory demo­
cratic cultures (Hahn and Alviar-Martin, 2008; Hess
and Torney, 1967/2009; Kahne and Sporte, 2008; Metz and Youniss, 2005; Parker, 2008).
Evidence as Understanding
If one goal of education is to improve students’ deci­
sion-making judgment and to prepare them for college,
careers, and civic life, there is no substitute for deep knowledge and understanding of the socio-cultural
world offered through the four forms of disciplinary
thinking described above. Along with the behavioral
and social sciences, each offers powerful strategies
and tools for exploring and answering compelling and
supporting questions. In their different ways, they pro­
vide time-honored means of turning source data into
evidence for the conclusions one reaches (Dimension 3).
One of the central principles in the C3 Framework rests
on the concept of evidence. Anyone can ask a question about the social world and come to some answer or
another, no matter how wildly speculative or opinionat­
ed. Human minds have great capacity for imagination.
A wildly speculative answer or an imaginative conjec­
ture, however, is not the same thing as understanding.
Understanding is achieved by the careful investigation
of questions, data collection, reading, analysis, and
synthesis; in effect, data are transformed into evi­
dence-based claims that separate opinions and conjec­ ture from justifiable understandings.
In a digital world filled with fact and speculation,
that difference is a crucial contribution social studies teachers who follow the C3 Framework can offer to
their students. This claim is no more evident than in
the research done on teaching and learning in history
education (see reviews by Barton, 2008; Grant, 2006;
Lee, 2005; VanSledright and Limon, 2006; Voss, 1998;
Wineburg, 2001).
In our rapidly-changing world where ideas, informa­
tion, and opinions are but mouse-clicks away, students
more than ever need to learn how to keep learning in
order to cultivate sound understandings (Lee, 2010). As
a result, they need a deep well of powerful and disci­
plined strategies for answering their questions and for
gathering data that can be evaluated and transformed into evidence for justifiable decisions.
The days are long past when it was sufficient to compel
students to memorize other people’s ideas and to hope
that they would act on what they had memorized. If 20
years of National Assessment of Educational Progress
report cards on youth civic, economic, geographical,
and historical understanding mean anything, they re­
peatedly tell us that the success of that telling-and-com­
pelling effort no longer works in the 21st century, if it ever did (Smith and Niemi, 2001).
Working Collaboratively to Show
Understanding
The research on how people learn makes clear how
important collaborations are to deeper understand­
ing (Brown and Campione, 2002; Brown, Collins, and
Duguid, 1998; Palinscar, 1998). Businesses in Silicon
Valley, for example, picked up on this idea long ago:

collaborative developmental teams designed the means
of bringing the Internet to people in ways reminiscent
of early 20th century efforts toward mass electrification.
Researchers have long stressed the insights John Dewey
(1902) offered about how important our shared language
and vocabularies are to thinking and problem solving
(Bruner, 1960; Rogoff, 1994 Vygotsky, 1986). In short,
much of our best thinking occurs when we build and
express ideas in collaborative settings (Dimension 4).
Teachers work to bridge student experience-based ques­
tions with disciplinary ones. Collaborative inquiries de­
signed to address those questions are then launched in
classrooms. Teachers act as guides, facilitators, and dis­
ciplinary ambassadors. Students are, however, engaged
in the actual investigative work (for detailed examples
of how this can play out in history classrooms, see Bain
[2000] at the secondary level and VanSledright [2002] at
the elementary level). Working together, students learn
how to think more clearly and powerfully by employing
disciplinary knowledge and methods. In doing so, they
transform data they gather into evidence for the conclu­ sions—explanations and arguments—they reach.
These explanations and arguments need to be com­
municated, for it is in this communication practice
that teachers obtain evidence of growth in students’
understandings (or the lack thereof). The process can
take many collaborative forms. Students can read, an­
alyze, and discuss data sources and accounts together;
design websites or wikis; create digital documentary
presentations; discuss and debate claims orally in the
classroom; and engage in writing collective essays (Hess, 2002; Klingner, Vaughn, and Schumm, 1998; Soller,
2001; Monte-Sano, 2008; Swan and Hofer, 2008; Swan
and Hofer, 2013). It is here, in particular, that the C3
Framework dovetails closely with the types of com­
munication practices expected of students within the
Common Core State Standards for English Language
Arts and Literacy in History/Social Studies.
The aforementioned research speaks compellingly:
While it is important for students to demonstrate their
individual progress, they make more rapid progress
in building their social studies understandings when working together.
Furthermore, collaborative opportunities to inquire into and then communicate understandings support
students’ informed civic engagement, a principal goal of
a rich social studies education. Researchers have found
that (a) investigating how governments operate, (b)
engaging in opportunities to discuss and debate current
social problems and issues, (c) being involved in ser­
vice-learning and related activities, (d) participating in
high-impact decision-making, and (e) participating in
simulations of politically related activities all increase
the likelihood of students attaining higher levels of
political understanding, commitment, and action (Hess,
2002; Torney-Purta, 2005). As the Inquiry Arc of the C3
Framework culminates in Dimension 4, so too does the
preparation for student success in college, career, and civic life.
Progressions in Socio-Cultural
Understanding
The C3 Framework is organized by grade bands because
researchers have long demonstrated that disciplinary
ideas and understandings show progression in their
development (Piaget, 1929/2007; Vygotsky, 1986). Some
of the early work suggested that progression tended
to form in lock step. That is, children and adolescents
needed to attain a certain cluster of understandings
before they could move to the next stage. This set of
claims has given way to the idea that progression can be
bumpy and uneven, and that children and adolescents
may move back and forth across developmental levels.
Therefore, students need repeated opportunities to work
in investigative contexts with disciplinary concepts,
strategies, and ideas (Lee and Ashby, 2000; Ashby, Lee, and Shemilt, 2005; VanSledright, 2002).
Students’ capability to ask rich questions within disci­
plinary-based inquiries grows rather slowly. They need
considerable guidance from more knowledgeable adults
and peers in asking the meaty questions that prompt
the development of deeper socio-cultural understand­
ings useful to adults in democracies. This is not to say
that the questions students ask are irrelevant. Rather,
teachers will find the task of assisting their students in
constructing questions and developing inquiries more
challenging than, say, teaching students to consider
an author’s perspectives when reading a history text (Reisman, 2012).

Student progress can also be uneven in using evidence
to draw conclusions (VanSledright, 2002; Wineburg,
2001). Researchers find that even some college students
think that unsupported opinions are sufficient to claim
understanding, and they can struggle to distinguish them from evidence-backed arguments (Maggioni,
2010; Maggioni, VanSledright, and Reddy, 2009; Seixas,
1993). Helping students make better distinctions and
build criteria for judging the difference takes time and demands multiple opportunities to practice.
What then can social studies teachers reasonably expect
as students progress through the social studies pro­
gram? As the foregoing implies, researchers suggest
that they will see relatively slow growth in children’s
and adolescents’ disciplinary thinking and understand­
ing. This finding makes sense. Because children’s early
learning experiences so often result in tightly-held
intuitive, but often naïve understandings, children
find those understandings difficult to give up and/or reconstruct.
It is just this kind of research finding that undergirds
the importance of helping students develop questions
and inquiries into the world. Merely telling students how the economy works or what the past means
requires that they accept the teacher’s word on faith.
Researchers make it clear that this approach is insuf­
ficient. Students need repeated opportunities to prac­
tice asking questions, investigating phenomena, and
gathering the necessary evidence if they are to progress
in building explanations and arguments that illustrate their knowledge and understandings.
Furthermore, it is important to understand that stu­
dents are quite capable of thinking in the ways that the
Inquiry Arc indicates. The research base here is pointed:
students are more than able to think deeply and richly about the world around them. They simply grow at
different rates and need many and varied opportunities
to engage with ideas (Donovan and Bransford, 2005). It
is important to hold high, but reachable expectations
for student learning progressions. Grade banding plus
repetition is a way to suggest how the repeated opportu­
nity to practice evolves across broad grade clusters.
Understanding as Civic Engagement
The C3 Framework and the embedded Inquiry Arc are
underpinned by decades of research on how children
and adolescents learn about and operate in the world.
They begin with those young people’s questions, inter­
sect them with the social studies disciplines, and broach
investigations into the world that are designed to
address those questions. This approach is not willy-nilly.
The research base demonstrates that the contributions
disciplinary thinking can make to deepen young peo­
ple’s understandings of the world are indeed profound.
These disciplined ways of thinking are also ways of
learning. As such, they are crucial in preparing young
people for lives as engaged and active citizens. Now
more than ever, students need the intellectual power to
recognize societal problems; ask good questions and de­
velop robust investigations into them; consider possible
solutions and consequences; separate evidence-based
claims from parochial opinions; and communicate and
act upon what they learn. And most importantly, they
must possess the capability and commitment to repeat
that process as long as is necessary. Young people need
strong tools for, and methods of, clear and disciplined
thinking in order to traverse successfully the worlds of
college, career, and civic life. The research that un­ derpins the C3 Framework offers much to move our children precisely in that direction.

GLOSSARY
KEY TERMS IN THE C3 FRAMEWORK
The College, Career and Civic Life (C3) Framework for Social Studies State Standards sets forth learning
expectations and an inquiry arc that will be useful in guiding the development of state and local social
studies standards and curriculum documents. This glossary defines and provides examples of key
concepts and terms used in the C3 Framework. The examples are illustrative but are not exhaustive.
Adapt to an environment: People adapt to the opportunities and
constraints of their environment, making relevant decisions based on their state of knowledge and technology.
Example: People settle in regions that provide resources needed for
daily living. Settlement location choices are influenced by various
factors, including climate and changes in technology. One example
is the influence of air conditioning systems on where people choose to live.
Argument (coherent, reasoned): In the C3 Framework, an argu­
ment is a claim or collection of claims supported by relevant evidence,
which can be considered an answer to the question investigated by the
research. In historical research, a coherent argument is one in which
the evidence cited supports the claim; a reasoned argument is one in
which the evidence is used in a logical and critical way.
Example: In Freedom From Fear: The American People in Depres­
sion and War, 1929-1945, the historian David Kennedy develops the
reasoned argument that U.S. isolation from the principal theaters
of battle and the nation’s superior economic ability allowed it to emerge successfully from World War II.
Authority (authoritative source): The legitimate power to
influence or compel thoughts and actions. An authoritative source is a
source acknowledged to be an accurate and reliable basis for identify­ ing facts and constructing interpretations.
Example: The United States Constitution is an authoritative source
on the structure of federal government in the United States.
Banks: Businesses that accept deposits and make loans.
Example: Family members or neighbors probably have checking
or saving accounts at banks in the community. They deposit their
money in these accounts to keep it safe. Banks offer ease of use
through ATM cards, debit cards, and checks. Banks often pay inter­
est on the money in these accounts. Banks use the deposits to make
loans to other customers. Students may know friends or family who
have obtained a loan from a bank to buy a house or a car.
Barriers to trade: Laws that limit imports or place taxes on
imported goods and services in order to discourage imports and pro­ tect domestic profits and jobs.
Example: A tariff is a tax on imports that results in fewer imports
being purchased. One consequence is that more domestic substi­ tutes will likely be consumed.
Benefits: The gains from consuming and producing goods and ser­
vices and making personal, business, and public choices. Benefits may
be financial, or they may consist of other types of satisfaction.
Example: The purchase of a new bicycle results in increased satisfac­ tion and enjoyment.
Borrowing: Taking money with a promise to repay the money in the future.
Example: Perhaps a brother, sister, or parent has borrowed money
from a student and later repaid the money. Maybe a student has bor­
rowed money from a brother, sister, friend, or parent. In commercial
lending, the promise to repay includes the amount borrowed plus
some interest—a payment for using the borrowed money.
Capital goods: Goods that have been produced and are used over
and over again in the production process to produce other goods and
services. Capital goods can also be called capital resources or physical capital.
Example: Tools, equipment, factories, office buildings, machines,
desks in schools, interactive whiteboards, computers, and projectors are all examples of capital goods.
Causes and effects (probable, multiple, complex, unex­
pected): No historical event or development occurs in a vacuum;
every one has prior conditions, and every one has consequences. His­
torians cannot test these in laboratories the way scientists can, but they
can use historical evidence and reasoning to determine probable causes
and effects. Events and processes often result from developments in
many realms of life, including the social, political, economic, and
cultural realms, and may have consequences that are broad, intercon­
nected, and far-reaching, so that causes and effects are multiple and
complex. The outcome of any historical event may not be what those
who engaged in it intended or predicted, so that chains of cause and
effect in the past have often been unexpected, not pre-determined.
Example of probable causes: Probable causes of the voyages of
Columbus include Columbus’s desire to reach the riches of Asia by
sailing westward and the aims of the Spanish monarchs Ferdinand
and Isabella to continue the expansion of Christianity, as well as other reasons listed as multiple causes below.
Example of multiple causes: Multiple causes of the voyages of
Columbus include Columbus’s personal ambition and desire to
reach the riches of Asia by sailing westward; the aims of the Spanish 96 • C3 Framework

=== Page 97 ===
monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella to compete with Portugal in the
race for direct access to spices and to continue the expansion of
Christianity; the expansion of the Ottoman Empire that disrupted
old trade routes and lessened the direct access of Western Euro­
peans to silk, spices, and other Asian products; improvements in
ship designs, including the adoption of new kinds of sails; and the
development of the printing press, which allowed works by earlier
geographers and travelers to be cheap and accessible to ship captains
and merchants. Other factors also played a role, because no single cause led to Columbus’s voyages.
Example of complex effects: Complex effects of the voyages of
Columbus include all the developments that resulted from them,
which have influenced nearly every aspect of today’s globalized world.
Example of unexpected effects: The voyages of Columbus resulted
in the widespread exchange of animals, plants, human popula­
tions, and diseases across the Atlantic in both directions, including
corn, wheat, potatoes, tomatoes, coffee, cows, horses, turkeys,
measles, and smallpox. Many results of the Columbian Exchange
were unexpected effects, and some of the exchange was completely
unintentional, such as the movement of invasive plant species that became pests.
Change and Continuity: The study of the past shows that some ele­
ments remained continuous or steady, while others changed. Thinking
about change and continuity requires us to compare different points in
time—either two points in time from the past with each other, or one
from the past with the present. Sometimes the factors that change and
those that stay the same are surprising or hidden. Change may bring progress, but it can also result in decline.
Example: The advent of electricity and household technology
brought major changes to family life in the United States, but there
were continuities as well. Doing laundry was much easier and less
physically strenuous with washing machines, but laundry remained
a household task that was almost always done by women, and the
amount of clothing most people owned increased, so that the time
taken to do laundry did not decrease significantly.
Choice: A decision made between two or more possibilities or alter­ natives.
Example: People make choices every day. They choose what to wear, what to eat, and what to do in their free time.
Chronological sequence: A list of historical events organized
by the time and date of their occurrence. Ordering events in time is
important to identifying relationships between events and historical
context, and to understanding the development of processes across time in order not to view events in isolation.
Example: A chronological sequence of major events in African
American history is: the 14th Amendment, Reconstruction, Jim
Crow laws, rise of the Ku Klux Klan, World War II, and the Mont­ gomery Bus Boycott.
Civic virtues: Principles and traits of character that enable citizens
to contribute to the common good by engaging in political and civil society.
Example: Tolerance, adherence to law, opposition to tyranny, stand­
ing up for others’ rights, and active participation in the community are civic virtues.
Civil society: The entire array of nongovernmental groups, associ­
ations, and institutions that citizens form and join, along with norms
and values that underlie participation, such as cooperation, trust, and civility.
Example: The Parent Teachers Association in a school is part of civil society.
Claims and counterclaims: In the C3 Framework, claims are state­
ments of belief or opinion rooted in factual knowledge and evidence
that result from the analysis of sources in an inquiry. Counterclaims
are statements that challenge or respond to claims, using evidence that contradicts a claim.
Example: Some economists claim that central government banks
can effectively control economic growth by injecting capital into
financial markets through buying and selling in bond markets. A
counterclaim suggests that such interventions prevent capital mar­
kets from functioning properly and thus slow economic growth.
Climate change: Long-term significant variations in average weather
conditions on Earth, particularly in temperatures and precipitation,
that are caused by either natural or human induced processes.
Example: Alterations in the physical dynamics of Earth’s atmo­
sphere that affect the climate may result from natural phenomena,
such as extensive volcanic eruptions, or human practices, such as burning fossil fuels.
Climate variability: Changes over time in patterns of weather and
climate either globally or in a specific region of the world.
Example: Precipitation and temperature may change for varying
times, resulting in dry and wet periods that influence the timing of
planting and harvesting of food crops in specific regions affected.
Collective action: Activities undertaken by a group of people with a
shared interest in promoting or encouraging change or progress on an issue about which members of the group agree.
Example: The Tea Party movement began as a collective action
to limit government expenditures and taxes, and to oppose the
expansion of the role of the federal government in areas such as health care.
Communication network: A pattern of links among points and
pathways along which the movement and exchange of information takes place.
Example: Cell phone towers are located at sites chosen to facilitate
the movement and reception of signals within areas served by the system.
Comparative advantage: The ability to produce at a lower oppor­ tunity cost than another producer.
Example: A producer with a comparative advantage in the produc­
tion of wheat may have to give up less corn to produce wheat than other producers.
Compelling question: Compelling questions address problems and
issues found in and across the academic disciplines that make up social
studies. They require students to apply disciplinary concepts and to
construct arguments and interpretations. Compelling questions often
emerge from the interests of students and their curiosity about how
things work, but they are also grounded in curriculum and content with which students might have little experience.
Example: Was the American Revolution revolutionary?

Competition: The ability of businesses and individuals to enter a
market in an effort to compete to sell or buy a product. Competition
results in attempts by two or more individuals or organizations to
acquire the same goods, services, or productive and financial resources,
or else to sell them. Consumers compete with other consumers for
goods and services. Producers compete with other producers for sales to consumers.
Example: New cell phones are produced on a regular basis by a wide variety of firms.
Complex causal reasoning: A type of logical thinking that
explains how multiple events, ideas, or activities contribute to one another.
Example: An understanding of human migration patterns in
the world today requires complex causal reasoning that takes into
account local politics, economic factors, geographical conditions, climate, and social and cultural influences.
Context: The ideas, events, or related content that situate a concept,
event, person, or idea in a relevant time, place, or intellectual sphere.
Example: The theory of communism emerged in the context of
rapid industrialization and changing economic conditions in 19th century Western Europe.
Core principles (in U.S. founding documents): Fundamental
ideas and ideals expressed in the Declaration of Independence, the
Constitution, and other early and influential documents.
Example: Government by the consent of the governed, equality
under law, and freedom of the press are core principles in the found­ ing documents of the United States.
Correct sequence (linear or non-linear): The notion that a text
(written or multimodal) has a recognizable path for readers to follow.
These paths may be linear, as are most written print texts, or non-linear, as are most web-based texts with hyperlinks
Example: A conventional essay would likely have a linear reading
path. Websites that represent the same essay text on multiple web­
pages, and can be accessed in a variety of different sequences, would be non-linear.
Corroborative value: The extent to which information from one
source that is used as evidence to support a claim supports information from another source.
Example: Economic data offers corroborative value in support of
claims drawn from personal correspondence about the social impact
of the Great Migration of African Americans from Southern cities
and towns to Northern industrial areas in the early 20th century.
Costs: What an individual, business, organization, or government
gives up when a choice is made. Costs may be financial or nonfinancial.
Example: When a person decides to go to a movie, the cost of that
choice is what could have been done with the money spent and how the time could have otherwise been used.
Credibility: The degree to which a source can be trusted or believed
to represent what it purports to represent. The concept of credibility
does not necessarily correspond to that of truth; a source can be credi­ ble and contain factual inaccuracies.
Example: The credibility of personal accounts of the Civil War bat­
tles from politicians in Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Virginia,
is limited, in view of the fact that their accounts were second-hand.
Credit: The granting of money or something else of value in exchange for a promise of future repayment.
Example: A bank or other financial institution may give people
credit; that is, the bank or financial institution gives people money
to buy cars or houses. The borrowers agree to repay the money borrowed plus interest over the time of the loan.
Cultural characteristics: The specific ideas, belief systems, or
patterns of behavior that characterize a society or a culturally distinct social group.
Example: Cultural characteristics are expressed in housing types,
food preferences, spatial patterns of settlements, and beliefs about
appropriate relationships between people and nature.
Cultural pattern: Culture may be manifested in repeated behavior
shown in social conventions, customs, and adherence to rules or habits
that are based on values and beliefs about the attributes of society and nature.
Example: Cultural patterns may be seen in the tools and artifacts
produced in different societies or in food-growing techniques shared among members of a group.
Cultural preference: A culturally-based preference for one thing
rather than available alternatives. The choice to engage in some
practices rather than others may be grounded in cultural habits or
may reflect deeply-held cultural beliefs about appropriate behavior in certain settings or situations.
Example: Choices of favored spectator sports vary from place to
place. Some regions have avid soccer fans, while others favor ice
hockey or baseball. Food preferences also vary widely from place to
place and may be based on religious beliefs, the history of available
foods, or health concerns. Cultural preferences may range from
seemingly trivial topics to issues of life-changing importance.
Culture: Culture is a human institution manifested in the learned
behavior of people, including their specific belief systems, language(s),
social relations, technologies, institutions, organizations, and systems for using and developing resources.
Example: Various cultures emerged on Earth in dispersed locations
and within different environments. Long periods of isolation and
limited interaction contributed to cultural diversity and distinc­
tive habits and beliefs. Language-based communication is a clear
example of a learned behavior that influences the development and interactions of human groups.
Deflation: A general sustained downward movement of prices for goods and services in an economy.
Example: The Japanese economy began to experience deflation
during the 1990s. The United States experienced deflation during the Great Depression.
Deliberation: Discussing issues and making choices and judgments
in a group, with information and evidence, civility and respect, and concern for fair procedures.
Example: The class deliberated and decided to conduct a service project at the senior center.
Deliberative and democratic strategies: A way to accomplish a
goal that includes the input of those involved at all stages of the process.
Example: The United Nations seeks to utilize deliberative and demo­ cratic strategies to address global issues.
98 • C3 Framework

=== Page 99 ===
Demand: The quantity of a good or service that buyers are willing
and able to buy at all possible prices during a certain time period. In
general, people are willing and able to buy more units of a good or
service at a lower price than they are at a higher price.
Example: Ellie opened a lemonade stand. She discovered that her
customers were willing and able to buy more cups of lemonade at $.50 per cup than they would at $1.00 a cup.
Democratic principle: A principle that should guide the behavior
and values of institutions and citizens in a democracy.
Example: It is a democratic principle that everyone is equal before the law.
Development: A historical event or set of events that is regarded as significant.
Example: The invention of the cotton gin was a development that significantly changed people’s lives.
Disincentive or negative incentive: Perceived costs that discour­ age certain behaviors.
Example: Detention or suspension are costs imposed on students to
deter behaviors such as skipping school or being disruptive. Fines for
speeding are disincentives designed to discourage reckless driving.
Economic globalization: An international economic system for the
production and exchange of goods and services that creates interde­
pendence among the economies of the world’s nations.
Example: Global trade in wheat and other grains fluctuates accord­
ing to the predicted future supplies and actual reserves in grain
growing countries. Prices and availability are influenced by climate
events, transportation costs, population size, and changing food habits in various places.
Economic growth: A sustained rise over time in a nation’s produc­ tion of goods and services.
Example: The U.S. economy, as measured by real GDP, grew at an
average of slightly more than 3% per year over the 60 years from 1953 to 2012.
Economic Interdependence: The dependence of people who spe­
cialize in producing one particular good or service upon other people
or institutions to provide additional goods and services that they desire.
Example: A secondary social studies teacher specializes in pro­
ducing learning among secondary students and is dependent upon
others to provide clothing and food for her family.
Effects: See Causes and Effects.
Entrepreneurs: Individuals who are willing to take risks in order to
develop new products and start new businesses. They recognize oppor­
tunities, enjoy working for themselves, and accept challenges.
Example: A person who opens a new restaurant, dry cleaning store,
or other business in the community is an entrepreneur. People who
have already started businesses, such as Bill Gates, are also entrepre­ neurs.
Entrepreneurship: A characteristic of people who assume the risk of
organizing productive resources to produce goods and services.
Example: People who own and operate local businesses in the com­
munity (e.g., auto body repair shops, or restaurants) demonstrate entrepreneurship.
Environmental characteristics: Aspects of a place or area shaped
by Earth’s physical processes or derived from the physical environ­ ment.
Example: Across the Earth, there are variations in vegetative cover
related to climate conditions and differences in landforms shaped by
processes of volcanism, glaciations, and erosion and deposition.
Environmental problem: Any threat to nature or to human beings’ dependence on nature.
Example: Acid rain is an environmental problem.
Event: An occasion, occurrence, or incident that takes place in the past. Events can be of various lengths.
Example: Nat Turner’s rebellion was an event that took place in
1831, and is often seen as one of the many events leading up to the
American Civil War, which is also a historical event.
Evidence: In the C3 Framework, evidence is information taken
during an analysis of a source that is then used to support a claim made in response to an inquiry question.
Example: Temperature data might be used along with information
about the invention and implementation of air conditioning as evi­
dence to support a claim about urban development in the American
South.
Exchange: The trading of goods, services, and resources with people
for other goods, services, and resources, or for money.
Example: People exchange their human resource (labor) for
payment in the form of income (wages or salaries). In turn they
exchange part of their income with businesses to buy goods and
services. They exchange part of their income in the form of taxes
and government fees for goods and services that the government provides.
External benefits: The benefits of production or consumption that
are received by persons other than the producer or consumer of the good or service.
Example: The benefits of the increased quality of secondary educa­
tion are received by students. Others also benefit from the students’
eventual higher production and taxes. The benefits received by the others are external benefits.
External costs: Costs of production or consumption that are borne
by persons other than the producer or consumer of the good or service.
Example: A power plant produces electricity that it sells to its cus­
tomers. The process of production results in polluted air that causes
institutions and individuals other than customers to pay higher
health care costs. Those higher health care costs are external costs.

Fiscal policy: Policies that affect the level of government spending on goods and services, taxes, and transfer payments.
Example: A government reduction in tax rates may encourage
people to increase spending and the amount of time they are willing to work.
Freedom: The lack of coercion or limitation of a person’s thoughts or
actions; some definitions include the actual ability of an individual to do what he or she wishes.
Example: In the United States, Freedom of speech is one of the Five
Freedoms in the First Amendment of the United States Constitu­
tion. In his Four Freedoms speech, President Franklin Roosevelt
Glossary • 99

=== Page 100 ===
proposed that Freedom from Fear and Freedom from Want were also important freedoms.
Geographic context: The location in which an event occurred.
Example: The Bureau of Reclamation oversaw the building of
Hoover Dam between 1931 and 1936 within the immediate geo­
graphic context of the arid and physically taxing Black Canyon and
the broader geographic context of the Colorado River watershed.
Geographic data: Facts and statistics about spatial and environ­ mental phenomena gathered for analysis.
Example: Geographic or geospatial data may be gathered about
physical and human processes on Earth’s surface to analyze a range
of problems, such as air and water pollution, urban sprawl, traffic
congestion, or other problems arising from human-environment interactions.
Geographic model: An idealized and simplified representation
of reality depicting a spatial concept or a tool for predicting specific outcomes in geography.
Example: Globes are scale models of Earth that correctly represent
area, relative size and shape, physical features, distance between
points, and true compass direction. A gravity model may be used to
describe and predict flows from one place to another based on the
distances between them and the size of their populations.
Geography: The study of physical and human systems and their
changing spatial relationships across the surface of the Earth. Human
systems and physical systems constantly interact with reciprocal
influences flowing between and among them, creating a wide variety of spatial patterns.
Example: Humans plant crops in response to soil characteristics
and climate variables that include temperature ranges and amounts
of precipitation. When heat rises and rain fails, farmers may
intervene with irrigation systems to sustain growing until harvest
time. When soils are depleted from constant plantings, farmers may
extend productivity by using no-till methods and adding fertilizers.
Geospatial technologies: Computer hardware and software used
to produce and evaluate geographic data at infinitely varied levels;
these technologies include technologies related to mapping and inter­
preting physical and human features on Earth’s surface.
Example: Geospatial technologies include global positioning systems
[GPS], geographic information systems [GIS], remote sensing [RS],
and geospatial visualizations that allow the viewing of data associ­ ated with specific locations.
Globalization (see also Economic Globalization): The increas­
ing interconnectedness of different parts of the world resulting from
common worldwide cultural, economic, and political activities, and
the impact of technological advances in communication and transpor­ tation.
Example: Communications technologies provide nearly instant
transmission of news about widely dispersed events across Earth’s
surface. The increase in the speed of information flows from place
to place influences the timing and nature of reactions to events and
problems by governments, economic organizations, and the general
public. As an example, international responses to natural and tech­
nological disasters are faster and more widespread than in the past.
Goods: Objects that satisfy people’s wants.
Example: People buy and use a variety of goods, such as clothing,
food, cars, houses, household appliances, bicycles, toys, books, computers, and tablets.
Governmental context: A setting in which citizens exercise rights
and responsibilities through government or in response to government.
Example: Citizens act in a governmental context when they vote,
serve on juries, enlist in the military, or seek to influence the govern­ ment through protest and activism.
Historical context: The setting, background, or environment in
which a specific historical event or process occurred, which can include
cultural, political, social, intellectual, economic, and other factors.
Example: The Chicago Haymarket affair of 1886 occurred within
the context of rapid industrialization, massive immigration of East­
ern and Southern Europeans to the United States, and the formation of labor organizations.
Historical time period (historical era): A distinct segment of
time whose beginning and end are marked in some way by significant
developments or events. Different historians segment historical events
and processes into periods or eras differently, depending on what
they see as important. This segmentation can also be referred to as “periodization.”
Example: The Civil War time period is typically studied in U.S. his­
tory classes, but the determination of its starting and ending dates
depends on which events seem most significant. The typical starting
date in historical accounts is the bombardment of Fort Sumter on
April 12, 1861, and the typical ending date is April 9, 1865, when
General Robert E. Lee surrendered. On the other hand, Southern
states had already established the Confederacy in February 1861,
and the surrender of other Confederate forces took place later than
the surrender of Lee. In addition to examining these potential
starting and ending points, an inquiry into longer-term causes can
be launched by asking the compelling question, “When did the Civil
War Begin?” (The Missouri Compromise? The 3/5 Compromise in
the writing of the U.S. Constitution?) Another compelling ques­
tion—“When Did the Civil War End?”—could examine interpre­
tations of the point at which the Civil War can truly be said to have
ended, the determination of which depends on a judgment about the resolution of its most significant issues.
Human capital: The knowledge and skills that people obtain through education, experience, and training.
Example: Human capital includes reading, computation, and other
skills acquired through education, as well as physical and intellec­
tual abilities required for work, and on-the-job training.
Human-induced environmental change: Environmental
changes brought about by human activities on scales that can range from the local to the global.
Example: Human activities involve many actions and processes that
result in environmental changes. These may include urban sprawl,
deforestation, agricultural development, industrialization, water
control structures, energy production, and the extraction of natural resources.
Human problem: Any serious problem facing human beings.
Example: War is a human problem.
100 • C3 Framework

=== Page 101 ===
Human rights: Rights or freedoms possessed by all people by virtue of their being human.
Example: If freedom of speech is a human right, then no human being should be denied freedom of speech.
Human settlement: A location where people have built structures to use as permanent or temporary living areas.
Example: A human settlement or populated place may range in size
from a few dwellings located together at a rural crossroads to large
cities with surrounding urbanized areas, such as Mexico City or Toronto.
Human system: A system for organizing human behavior through
linked and interrelated processes and structures. Demographic, eco­
nomic, political, social, and cultural structures are examples of major
human systems. Through these systems, humans interact to acquire
and allocate needed resources for sustaining life within and among various societies in different regions on Earth.
Example: Human population dynamics are influenced by cultural
beliefs about the roles of men, women, and children in society.
Similarly, economic structures allocating resources and the political
rules governing decision making have effects on the population and
the quality of life of a society. Individuals learn from, respond to, and influence the human systems they inhabit.
Incentive: Perceived benefit that encourages certain behaviors.
Example: Profits are incentives to start business. Wages are incen­ tives to work.
Income distribution: The way in which the nation’s income is
divided among families, individuals, or other designated groups.
Example: In 2009, the share of aggregate income earned by house­
holds in the United States ranged from 3.2 percent for the lowest
fifth of households to 50.3 percent for the highest fifth of households.
Inflation: A general, sustained upward movement of prices for goods and services in an economy.
Example: Prices paid by the typical consumer increased by an aver­ age of 2.5% annually from 2003 to 2012.
Institution: A formal structure or organization that is based on a
strong set of norms and interests and governs people’s behavior.
Example: Both the United States Congress and the family are institutions.
Intended audience (of a historical source): The desired recipi­
ent(s) of a historical source. This is sometimes clear, as in a letter writ­
ten to a particular person or a speech given to a particular audience,
but it is sometimes necessary to infer the desired recipient from the source and its context.
Example: Because of the ways in which the 1936 film Modern Times
uses characters and techniques from his earlier, successful films, we
can tell that Charlie Chaplin intended a large, movie-going audience to view it.
Interest: The price of using someone else’s money. When people
place their money in a bank, the bank uses the money to make loans to
others. In return, the bank pays interest to the account holder. Those
who borrow from banks or other organizations pay interest for the use of the money borrowed.
Example: Banks pay savers interest because banks use savers’ money
to make loans to other customers. Borrowers pay banks interest on
loans because the borrowers are using others’ money.
Investment in human capital: The efforts of people to acquire or
increase human capital. These efforts include education, training, and practice.
Example: Attending trade school after high school, going to college,
obtaining on-the-job training, and the provision of economics
workshops by a school district for its teachers are all examples of
investment in human capital. Learning to read, write, compute,
and think are investments in human capital. Practicing a sport or
improving the ability to play a musical instrument are investments in human capital.
Investment in physical capital: An addition or additions to the
stock of equipment and structures that are used to produce goods and services.
Example: Examples of an investment in physical capital include a
firm building a new manufacturing plant, a grocery store adding a
new wing for its produce department, and an insurance company purchasing new computers for its offices.
Key constitutional provisions: Fundamental ideas included in a constitution.
Example: The separation of powers, federalism, and the right to a
speedy trial are all key constitutional provisions of the U.S. Consti­ tution.
Laws: Rules enacted by a legislature.
Example: By law in a number of states, a person cannot hold an adult driver’s license until the age of 18.
Limitations in the historical record: Gaps or inadequacies in the
evidence available for examining a historical event or development that
result from the loss or destruction of evidence, or from evidence never having been created in the first place.
Example: Although we know the names of a few Roman gladiators
from mosaics and written accounts, most of them have been lost. No
one thought to record details about them as a group at the time, nor
did anyone interview them to get their opinions. Because of these
limitations in the historical record we will never be able to know
how many of the gladiators were slaves, or what they thought about fighting.
Limits (of government): Actions a government may not take. The
concept of limits is based on the idea that the government should have
a limited role and is not supposed to interfere in all aspects of life. Stu­
dents should be aware that reasonable people disagree about what the
government may and may not do in the United States.
Example: The United States government may not establish a religion
because of a limitation contained in the First Amendment.
Glossary • 101

=== Page 102 ===
Location: The position of a place, defined in terms of features such as
site characteristics, accessibility, and connectivity.
Example: The position of a point on Earth’s surface may be absolute,
as expressed by means of a grid showing latitude and longitude, or
relative, as shown by its location related to other points or places.
Long-term cause: Long-term causes are the factors, often inter­
twined, that result in the occurrence of a historical event or process.
Example: The long-term causes of World War I included the growth
of nationalism in Europe, a series of alliances and treaties in which
countries agreed to support one another, disputes over territory, a
build-up of military forces on all sides, and rivalries for colonies and imperial trade.
Maker (of a historical source): The creator of a historical source.
For written accounts, the maker is also often described as the author,
although it can sometimes be complicated to determine the true maker of a document.
Example: In 1354, the Berber Muslim explorer Ibn Battuta began to
dictate the story of the extensive travels he had made in Africa, Asia,
and Europe over the previous twenty years to the scholar Ibn Juzaay,
who wrote them down in a book generally called Rihla (the journey).
Both Ibn Battuta and Ibn Juzaay can be seen as the makers of this historical source.
Map: A map is a representation of an area and is usually depicted on a
flat surface. Maps describe spatial relationships of the specific features represented.
Example: Maps are made and used for different purposes. Refer­
ence maps such as topographic maps, may depict a wide variety of
features on Earth’s surface, including landforms, water bodies, and
buildings. Thematic maps are topical and show the distribution of
features and conditions based on data such as income levels, health,
or incidence of diseases in various locations. Mental maps are the
maps we have in our minds of places we have experienced.
Marginal Principle: Marginal means extra, additional, or incre­
mental. People make decisions by comparing the marginal (extra)
benefits of their options to the marginal (extra) costs of their options.
One example would be comparing the marginal cost of hiring another
worker with the marginal revenue that the worker provides. Alterna­
tively, it might include decisions to work an hour of overtime versus spending that hour on a home project.
Example: I can spend one more hour studying for a final exam in
English literature. I know that the hour might help me earn a 90%
rather than an 80% grade. I also know that to earn an A, I must
score 100% on the final. On the other hand, I could spend an extra
hour studying for my mathematics final. This will result in a 90%
on my mathematics final, and a 90% on my math final will improve
my overall grade from a B to an A. For me, a marginal hour spent
preparing for my math final affords a higher marginal benefit.
In deciding whether to hire another worker who earns $35 per hour,
I have to know whether or not hiring that worker will result in at least $35 of additional revenue.
Markets: Buyers and sellers of a particular good, service, or resource.
Example: Markets exist for goods and services, such as hamburgers,
lettuce, auto mechanics, engineers, stocks, and commodities.
Megacity: As defined by the United Nations, a megacity is an exten­
sive urban area with a large and dense population that exceeds ten
million people and 2,000 persons per square kilometer. The number
of megacities is increasing as the human population expands and
millions of people migrate from rural to urban locations.
Example: Contemporary megacities include Tokyo, New York, São
Paolo, Seoul, Mexico City, Mumbai, Lagos, and Shanghai.
Modify an environment: Human actions that change natural elements and/or physical systems.
Example: Historically, humans have modified environments by
selecting certain plants and animals to domesticate, clearing land
for agriculture, building dams to impound water for later uses,
erecting small and large settlements, and extracting resources for energy and the production of goods.
Monetary policy: Federal Reserve System policies that affect the supply of money and credit in the U.S. economy.
Example: In 2012, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee
announced that the Federal Reserve would continue to purchase
bonds in order to expand the money supply, keep interest rates low, and encourage spending in the economy.
Money: Anything widely accepted in exchange for goods, services, and resources.
Example: Historically, food, products, and resources such as silver
and gold have been used as money. Today, countries use fiat money—
money that is useful because it is backed by a country’s government
and because people are willing to accept it in exchange for goods, services, and resources.
Movement: Over time, physical and human phenomena change locations on Earth’s surface.
Example: Physical phenomena, including ocean currents and air
masses, continually move across Earth’s surface. Humans move
themselves by traveling from place to place, move ideas by commu­
nicating across long distances, and move goods by land, water, and
air transportation. Enduring patterns of movement may be formed
when people in different places interact frequently using the same
methods of transportation or modes of communication.
Multi-tiered timeline: A timeline with multiple layers, each of
which includes a different set of related events. A multi-tiered timeline
allows students to see the complex context and causes of historical
events and to recognize that the different topics they study happen
contemporaneously, and may influence one another or be inextricably related.
Example: In portraying the causes of World War I, a timeline
might include multiple tiers with each tier representing a different
set of causes. One tier might include events related to nationalism.
Another tier might include events related to industrialization. Yet
another tier might include events related to imperialism.
Natural disaster: An event in the physical environment that is destructive to human life and property.
Examples: Natural disasters occur in Earth’s environmental hazard
zones as a result of floods, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, earth­
quakes, droughts, tornados, landslides, and other destructive events
that alter ecosystems and dislocate human populations and their
activities. These events may devastate large regions, causing many
deaths and lasting damage to ecosystems and human communities.

=== Page 103 ===
Natural hazard: A risk situation occurring in nature that may cause
harm to humans and ecosystems. Most places are vulnerable to one or more natural hazards.
Example: Natural hazards occur in many forms. In some instances,
these are geological, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and
massive landslides. They may also be climate-related, such as torna­ dos, hurricanes, droughts, and climate change.
Natural resources (land): Components of the natural environment
that can be used to produce goods to meet the material needs of a population.
Example: Natural resources include water, trees, coal, minerals, soil, and natural gas.
Nongovernmental context: A setting in which citizens may act
that is not created, managed, or owned by a government.
Example: Nongovernmental contexts in which citizens exercise
rights and responsibilities include their families, neighborhoods and
communities, religious congregations, associations, and communi­
cations media, such as newspapers or the Internet.
Origin: The point of origination of an original social studies source,
which can include its cultural or historical context.
Example:The origin of the Waldseemuller map was early 16th cen­
tury Europe. Martin Waldseemuller and his associates created the
map in 1507 while Waldseemuller was working in the Gymnasium
Vosagense, located in St. Dié in Lorraine (at that time part of the
Holy Roman Empire).
Personal values: Ethical and moral commitments that guide indi­ viduals’ actions and interpersonal relationships.
Example: Personal values include empathy, integrity, self-reliance, generosity, trustworthiness, and creativity.
Perspective: The ideas, attitudes, and beliefs of people at a given time
in the past or present, also called point of view.
Example: A belief in racial hierarchy was one element of the per­
spective of European imperialists in the nineteenth century, which
influenced their interactions with indigenous populations around the world.
Physical system: A collection of entities that are linked and inter­
related in a stable structure. In geography, an ecosystem is a physical
system of major interest. An ecosystem is made up of living organisms
and other components, along with their environment, including air, water and soils.
Example: As physical systems, ecosystems vary in scale but usually
occupy limited spaces. Networks of interactions among organisms
and between organisms and their environment define ecosystems. A
tidal pool is a single ecosystem. Sometimes the entire Earth may be considered one ecosystem.
Place: A location having distinctive features that give it meaning and
character and distinguish it from other locations.
Example: People who build and inhabit a place give it many layers of
personal and social meaning. Humans develop strong attachments
to their homes and home places, and identify with the people and environment of those locations.
Political institution: An institution that exercises or seeks to exer­ cise governmental power.
Example: Political parties and school boards are political institu­ tions.
Political problem: Any problem facing a political institution, includ­
ing an unresolved disagreement or a failure to govern effectively.
Example: The failure of the state legislature to pass a budget this year is a political problem.
Political system: The form of a government.
Example: A democratic republic, a monarchy, and a dictatorship are different political systems.
Population: A group of individuals that may change over time in its
numerical size, age structure, gender structure, ethnic composition, and spatial distribution.
Example: Each country has a population distributed over its
territory. Human populations vary in their settlement history and
methods of interacting with the environment. Changes in the
composition and structure of population may affect political and
economic relationships within a country and beyond.
Powers (exercised by governments): Actions a government may
legally take to compel citizens, organizations, or others to comply with government instructions and orders.
Example: The powers of government generally include taxing, reg­
ulating industry, prosecuting crimes, and declaring war, although
there can be considerable disagreement over how far these powers should extend.
Price: The amount a seller receives and a buyer pays for a good or service.
Example: Stores place price tags on products or place signs near
products indicating their price. Restaurants list prices in menus.
Wages and salaries are also prices; businesses tell people what their
hourly wage will be or what their annual salary will be.
Procedural: A procedural text or product describes a specific process
with attention to the proper sequence and relationship among steps or parts in the process.
Example: A description of how a bill becomes a law is a procedural description.
Process: A series of related events or developments that unfold in time. Processes may also be of various lengths.
Example: Industrialization is a process that began in the eighteenth
century, involving technological, economic, and other factors, and leading to changes in every aspect of life.
Productivity: The ratio of output per worker per unit of time.
Example: Bonnie owns a bakery. Her employees are able to produce
48 chocolate chip cookies each per hour. She purchases a new oven
that bakes cookies in half the time. As a result, her workers’ produc­
tivity increases to 96 chocolate chip cookies per worker per hour.
Profit: The amount of revenue that remains after a business pays the costs of producing a good or service.
Example: It costs Bonnie 42 cents (wages, ingredients, electricity,
water, sewer, and other overhead) to produce 1 chocolate chip cookie.
She is able to sell each cookie for 50 cents. Her profit per cookie is 8 cents.

=== Page 104 ===
Property rights: The ability of an individual to own and exercise control over a resource.
Example: People are able to own and exercise control over land, cat­
tle, chickens, factories, and other resources and means of production
Purpose (of a historical source): The reason a historical source
was produced. The maker of the source may state an explicit purpose,
or analysts of the source may later infer its purpose. Sometimes the
purposes stated by the maker and those inferred by later historians are
very different from each other; historians may also disagree with each other about the purpose of a source.
Example: During the Renaissance, European city governments
issued laws limiting what people could spend on weddings, stating
that the purpose of these laws was to restrict wasteful spending. Later
historians studying these laws have also determined that their pur­
pose was to prohibit people from buying products made outside the
city and so promote local industries, and also to make distinctions
between social classes sharper. Some historians assert that a purpose
of these laws was to control spending by women that the city leaders
saw as frivolous, while other historians assert that men made most
of the decisions regarding spending on weddings, so that limiting
women’s spending was not one of the purposes of these laws.
Real interest rate: The nominal or stated interest rate adjusted for inflation.
Example: If the nominal interest rate on a loan is 2% and inflation
for the year is 2%, the real interest rate is zero. If the nominal interest
rate is 5% and the inflation rate is 2%, the real interest rate is 3%.
Region: An area with one or more common physical or cultural
features that give it a measure of homogeneity and distinguish it from surrounding areas.
Example: A region may be considered formal, functional, or vernac­
ular. A formal region is homogeneous in certain characteristics, such
as having the same vegetative cover or soil type. A functional region
is characterized by a center of population or activity interacting with
a surrounding area. A vernacular region may emerge out a people’s
sense of belonging and identity, and may be expressed by popular regional terms, such as Dixie or Appalachia.
Resources: Resources, sometimes called productive resources, are
factors of production or inputs used to produce goods and services.
Resources fall into four broad categories: natural (e.g., land), human (labor), capital, and entrepreneurial ability.
Example: Natural resources include water, trees, coal, minerals, soil,
and natural gas. Examples of human resources include engineers,
mechanics, nurses, doctors, lawyers, teachers, and plumbers. Capital
resources include tools, buildings, equipment, and machines.
Responsibilities (of citizens in the U.S.): The obligations that a
person must fulfill to be a good citizen. There can be disagreements about these obligations.
Example: It is commonly believed in the United States that citizens
have the responsibility to vote, to serve on a jury when called, to obey
a just law, to serve in the military when drafted or needed, and to protest unjust laws.
Rights (of citizens in the U.S.): These rights include those enu­
merated in the Bill of Rights as well as other rights not listed there.
Example: Rights protected under federal and state laws today
include the rights to vote, to receive an adequate education, to bear
arms, and not to be assigned to racially segregated schools.
Role (of citizens): The categories of actions taken by citizens to fulfill
their responsibilities to their political community.
Example: Citizens play an important role by educating young peo­ ple to promote the common good.
Rules: Regulations or norms governing actions or procedures.
Example: A rule in our classroom is: “You can’t say, ‘You can’t play!’”
Rural: A geographic area that is less densely settled than cities or
towns, and has less intensive land use. Agriculture is a common form of land use in rural areas.
Example: Landscape nurseries and local organic farms are often
located where land is available in sparsely settled areas outside of cities.
Satellite images: Images produced by a variety of sensors including
radar, microwave detectors, and scanners that measure and record electromagnetic radiation.
Example: Data from satellite images may be turned into digital or
electronic forms that can be reconverted into imagery resembling a
photograph. The digital data may then be used to create maps and other visualizations.
Scale: The relationship between distance on a map and the corre­ sponding distance on Earth’s surface.
Example: The scale 1:1,000,000 means that one unit on the map
represents 1,000,000 similar units on Earth’s surface.
Scarcity: The condition that exists because there are insufficient
resources to produce goods and services to meet everybody’s wants.
Example: Most of us would like to have more goods and services
for ourselves and for our community; however, given our current
resources, we cannot have all of the goods and services we want. As a result, we must make choices.
Secondary interpretation (or secondary work or secondary
source): An analysis of a historical event or process, or of a historical
figure, that uses historical sources and is usually produced after the
event or process. The line between a primary source and a secondary work is not always sharp.
Example: The textbook for any course is a secondary interpretation,
as are most published works of history, biographies, and encyclo­
pedias. Former British prime minister Winston Churchill’s history
of World War II is both a primary source, because he was directly
involved in some of the events he describes, and a secondary work,
because he uses historical sources of many different types to tell the
story of developments in which he was not directly involved.
Services: Actions that can satisfy people’s wants.
Example: Transportation provided by bus drivers, car repair
provided by mechanics, and haircuts provided by barbers and hair stylists are examples of services.
104 • C3 Framework

=== Page 105 ===
Source: The materials from human and natural activities that can be
studied and analyzed. Sources can be written, visual, oral, or material.
Historians often also use the terms accounts and documents to refer to sources.
Example: The sources that can be used to study the powered flight
experiments of Orville and Wilbur Wright in North Carolina in
December of 1903 include Orville Wright’s diary, a telegram sent by
the Wright brothers to their father immediately after the flight, Vir­
ginia and Ohio newspaper articles on the flight, and a letter written by Orville three weeks after the flight.
Spatial: Pertains to space and spatial relationships on Earth’s surface.
Example: The scale, organization, and uses of spaces on Earth vary.
A neighborhood occupies and uses a small space in a nation’s entire collection of settlements.
Spatial connection: Contact over space resulting in flows of ideas, information, people, or products among places.
Example: People in many parts of the world are linked together
by communications technology moving information over vast
distances in a short time via cell phones, the Internet, and radio and television transmissions.
Spatial diffusion: The spread over space and through time of natural
phenomena, people, ideas, technology, languages, innovations, and products.
Example: Infectious diseases may spread in human populations
through direct contact with infected persons, food, or insects, or
through airborne and waterborne methods. Use of the automobile
spread throughout the United States and many other parts of the
world during the 20th century as people adopted it for daily trans­
portation. Numerous languages and religions spread to different
world regions during past land and water explorations by members of different national groups.
Spatial distribution: The spread and arrangement of physical and human phenomena on Earth’s surface.
Example: A large number of service stations, restaurants, and hotels
are found along interstate highways in the United States. Extensive
wheat and corn farming areas may be developed in locations with good soils and sparse population.
Spatial pattern: Objects and phenomena on Earth’s surface are
often arranged in lines, areas, or clusters of points that are related to
the locations and placements of other phenomena. These arrangements may occur in an orderly and observable manner.
Example: Productive agriculture is likely to occur where soils are
fertile and sufficient water is available. In such cases, the spatial pat­
tern displayed in productive agriculture is connected to the spatial patterns of soil fertility and water supplies.
Specialization: The production of a single good or service or a lim­
ited number of goods and services in order to increase productivity.
Example: Elementary educators, pediatricians, nurse practitioners,
electricians, plumbers, patent lawyers, and economics professors all
specialize in the production of a particular good or service.
Spending: The expenditure by people of some or all of their income to purchase goods and services.
Example: All people spend some of their income on goods and
services, such as food, clothing, housing, insurance, transportation, appliances, and entertainment.
Suburbs: Suburbs are less intensively developed areas than central
cities. They contain residential developments that may be an outlying
part of a city or a separate community located within commuting distance of a central city.
Example: Suburbs are located adjacent to cities in many regions of
the world. Transportation technology, especially railways and the
automobile, helped to extend suburbs ever farther out from central
cities. Over time, many centers for goods and services have been located in rapidly growing suburbs.
Supply: The quantity of a good or service that producers are willing
and able to sell at all possible prices during a certain time period.
Generally, producers are willing to produce and sell more of a product at higher prices than they are at lower prices.
Example: An automobile repair shop is willing to produce more
brake repairs and oil changes at a higher price than at a lower price.
If the owner receives a higher price for each brake repair, she can
stay open an hour later and pay mechanics to do the work. At the
lower price for brake repair, she is unwilling to provide additional brake repair service by doing so.
Supporting question: Supporting questions are intended to
contribute knowledge and insights to the inquiry behind a compelling
question. Supporting questions focus on descriptions, definitions, and
processes about which there is general agreement within the social
studies disciplines, which will assist students to construct explanations that advance claims of understanding in response.
Example: What were the regulations imposed on the colonists under the Townsend Acts?
System of government: The combination of all the branches of
government (legislative, executive, and judicial), other important
political institutions, and the customs, laws, and rules that are the basis for the government of a society.
Example: Although not mentioned in the Constitution, political
parties are now part of the U.S. system of government.
Technical: A technical explanation is one that describes the mechan­ ics of an activity or process.
Example: A description of the geographic term plate tectonics would require a technical explanation.
Technological disaster: An event that results from the failure of
a human built system and is destructive to human life, property, and community well-being.
Example: The April 1986 nuclear incident at Chernobyl in Ukraine
resulted in nuclear contamination in varying intensities over large
areas of Earth’s surface. This event caused numerous human deaths and many long-term, life-threatening illnesses.
Technological hazard: A risk situation resulting from human activ­
ity that may cause harm to humans and ecosystems. The construction
and use of some technologies may pose serious threats to the well-be­ ing of humans and ecosystems.
Example: Energy production involves technologies that include
nuclear power and the extensive extraction of energy resources
such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas. The physical plants and
processes involved in energy production pose risks of industrial
accidents and pollution that may cause harmful effects on ecosys­ tems and human settlements.
Glossary • 105

=== Page 106 ===
Time periods of different lengths (see also Historical time
period): Time can be segmented into periods of different lengths,
depending upon the scale and meaning of events, and the relationships between them.
Example: The history of the women’s suffrage movement in the
United States might focus on the time period from the 1840s to
the 1920s, beginning with the time at which advocates of women’s
suffrage first began to organize and ending with the ratification of
the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote; or it might
focus on a longer time period starting with colonial times, when a
few female property owners voted, and continuing beyond the 1920s
to include the women’s movements of the later twentieth century.
Trade: The exchange of goods, services, or resources for other goods, services, or resources, or for money.
Example: Workers normally trade their labor for wages and then use that income to purchase goods and services.
Transportation network: A pattern of links that connect roads,
rails, pipelines, aqueducts, power lines, or other structures that permit vehicular movement or the flow of a commodity.
Example: A transportation network may combine different modes of
transport, such as walking, cars, trains, ships, and aircraft, creating
multi-modal trips for people or goods. Trucks on interstate high­
ways in the United States may carry goods from ocean-going vessels to freight trains and to various market centers.
Triggering event: A triggering event is an event, sometimes unex­
pected, that has an immediate consequence, causing another event or
process. Not every event or development has a single triggering event.
Example: The triggering event for World War I was the assassination
of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the heir to the throne of
Austria-Hungary, by a Serbian nationalist in Sarajevo in June 1914.
One month later, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, and
declarations of war by other countries quickly followed.
Unemployment: A condition where people at least 16 years old are without jobs and actively seeking work.
Example: The number of unemployed people in the U.S. reached 15,382,000 in October 2009.
Unintended consequences: Unforeseen costs or benefits.
Examples: In 1867 Secretary of State William Seward purchased
Alaska from Russia for $7 million, which was roughly 2 cents per
acre. The purchase was ridiculed in Congress as Seward’s folly. An
unintended consequence of the purchase was the later benefit of gold deposits and oil supplies.
We impose minimum wage laws in this country to afford low skilled workers a better income. An unintended consequence of this
policy may be higher unemployment rates for young minorities, as
employers restrict their hiring to cover their higher labor costs.
Urban: An urban region is a built-up region characterized by a higher
population density and more buildings, transportation systems, and
other human-built features than in surrounding areas.
Example: Urban places offer a greater variety of goods, services, and
activities than less densely populated surrounding regions. Megac­
ities such as New York, Moscow, Cairo, Nairobi, Tokyo and many smaller cities are all defined as urban places.
Values: Ethical or moral standards for evaluating attitudes and behavior.
Example: The values associated with open discussion of a contro­
versial issue should include the demonstration of equal respect to
all participants and the possibility of reaching a consensus through listening and negotiation.
Wages: Income earned for providing human resources (labor) in the
market. Wages are usually computed by multiplying an hourly pay rate by the number of hours worked.
Example: Plumbers, electricians, carpenters, store clerks, and car
assembly workers earn an hourly wage for work that they perform.
