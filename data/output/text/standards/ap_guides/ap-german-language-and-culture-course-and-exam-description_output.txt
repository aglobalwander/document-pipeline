AP Equity and Access Policy
College Board strongly encourages educators to make equitable access a guiding
principle for their AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared
students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination
of barriers that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and
socioeconomic groups that have been traditionally underserved. Schools should
make every effort to ensure their AP classes reflect the diversity of their student
population. College Board also believes that all students should have access to
academically challenging course work before they enroll in AP classes, which
can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to equitable
preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.

About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills
that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking AP
courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and AP
Exams are developed and scored by college faculty and
experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges and
universities in the United States grant credit, advanced placement, or both on the basis of successful AP
Exam scores—more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the content
and skills that are the focus of the corresponding
college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also
organizes the content and skills into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many AP teachers have
told us they follow in order to focus their instruction.
The intention of this publication is to respect teachers’
time and expertise by providing a roadmap that they
can modify and adapt to their local priorities and
preferences. Moreover, by organizing the AP course
content and skills into units, the AP Program is able
to provide teachers and students with free formative assessments—Personal Progress Checks—that
teachers can assign throughout the year to measure
student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students: Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP success.
It is only through a commitment to equitable
preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses: The AP
Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP
courses must participate in the AP Course Audit, a
process through which AP teachers’ course materials
are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.

=== Page 9 ===
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the AP teacher
and the school principal (or designated administrator) to
confirm awareness and understanding of the curricular
and resource requirements. A syllabus or course outline,
detailing how course requirements are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The AP
Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor; all
AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision, piloting,
and analysis to ensure that questions are accurate, fair,
and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development, College
Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher education
institutions. This feedback is carefully considered to
ensure that AP courses and exams are able to provide
students with a college-level learning experience and
the opportunity to demonstrate their qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam
development process, relies on the expertise of both
AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice
questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course performance
assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands
of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are
scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion
is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained,
and their work is monitored throughout the Reading
for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief
Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers
in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of
the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a
curve. Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which
means that every student who meets the criteria for
an AP score of 2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no
matter how many students that is. The criteria for the
number of points students must earn on the AP Exam
to receive scores of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently validates for credit and placement
purposes—include:

Bullet The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
Bullet The number of points researchers have found to
be predictive that an AP student will succeed when
placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
Bullet Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP scores as follows:
AP Score

College Grade
Equivalent 5
Extremely well qualified
A 4

While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for
scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and universities.
To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/placement
policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/ creditpolicies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for
seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score
the free-response sections of the AP Exams. Ninety eight percent of surveyed educators who took part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an AP
Reader, including opportunities to:
Bullet Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
Bullet Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP
scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure to the quality and depth of the responses from the entire pool of AP Exam takers and are thus better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
Bullet Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
Bullet Score from home: AP Readers have online distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects. Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
Bullet Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs): AP
Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all assessed
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide scaffolds
skill instruction across units and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course themes and skills, create
customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.
* To report misuses, please call 877-274-6474 (International: +1-212-632-1781).

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
Bullet Teachers and students sign in to, or create, their College Board accounts.
§Bullet Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
Bullet Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
Bullet Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP coordinator.
Bullet Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and
AP coordinators to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following
additional benefits:
Bullet Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
Bullet Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
Bullet Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student pack.
The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
Bullet Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

Instructional
Model
Integrating AP resources throughout the course can help students develop skills and
conceptual understandings. The instructional model outlined below shows possible ways to incorporate AP resources into the classroom.
Plan
Teachers may consider the following approaches as they plan their instruction before teaching each unit.
Bullet Review the overview at the start of each unit guide to identify essential questions,
conceptual understandings, and skills for each unit.
§Bullet Use the Unit Planning section to identify German-language task models to use in class to
familiarize students with expectations for the exam while building language skills as well as cultural and interdisciplinary competencies.
Bullet Identify useful strategies in the Instructional Approaches section to help teach the concepts and skills.
Teach
When teaching, supporting resources could be used to build students’ conceptual understanding and mastery of skills.
Bullet Use the suggested task model and skill pairings.
Bullet Integrate thematic content with skills, considering any appropriate scaffolding.
Bullet Employ any of the instructional strategies previously identified.
Bullet Use the suggested resources in the Unit Planning sections to enrich your classroom
instruction and get ideas about how to integrate authentic materials into your instruction.
Assess
Teachers can measure student understanding of the content and skills covered in the unit and provide actionable feedback to students.
Bullet At the end of each unit, use AP Classroom to assign students the online Personal
Progress Checks, as homework or an in-class task.
Bullet Provide question-level feedback to students through answer rationales; provide unit- and
skill-level feedback using the progress dashboard.
Bullet Create additional practice opportunities using the AP Question Bank and assign them through AP Classroom.

About the AP German
Language and Culture Course
The AP German Language and Culture course emphasizes communication (understanding and being understood by others) by applying interpersonal,
interpretive, and presentational skills in real-life
situations. This includes vocabulary usage, language control, communication strategies, and cultural awareness. The AP German Language and Culture course strives not to overemphasize grammatical accuracy at the expense of communication. To best
facilitate the study of language and culture, the course is taught almost exclusively in German.
The AP German Language and Culture course
engages students in an exploration of culture in both contemporary and historical contexts. The course develops students’ awareness and appreciation
of cultural products (e.g., tools, books, music, laws,
conventions, institutions); practices (patterns of social
interactions within a culture); and perspectives (values, attitudes, and assumptions).
College Course Equivalent
The AP German Language and Culture Course is approximately equivalent to an upper-intermediate college or university course in German language and culture.
Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites; however, students are
typically in their fourth year of high school–level
German language study. In the case of native or
heritage speakers, there may be a different pathway of study leading to this course.

AP GERMAN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE

=== Page 18 ===
Introduction
In today’s global community, competence in more than one language is an
essential part of communication and cultural understanding. Study of another
language not only provides individuals with the ability to express thoughts
and ideas for their own purposes but also provides them with access to
perspectives and knowledge that are only available through the language
and culture. Advanced language learning offers social, cultural, academic,
and workplace benefits that will serve students throughout their lives. The
proficiencies acquired through the study of languages and literatures endow
language learners with cognitive, analytical, and communication skills that
carry over into many other areas of their academic studies.
The three modes of communication—Interpretive,
Interpersonal, and Presentational—defined in the
World Readiness Standards for Learning Languages, are foundational to the AP German Language and
Culture course. The AP course provides students with
opportunities to demonstrate their proficiency in each
of the three modes in the Intermediate to Advanced range, as described in the ACTFL Performance
Descriptors for Language Learners. As such, the course has been designed to provide advanced high
school students with a rich and rigorous opportunity to study the language and culture of the German speaking world.
The AP German Language and Culture course takes a holistic approach to language proficiency and recognizes the complex interrelatedness of comprehension and comprehensibility, vocabulary
usage, language control, communication strategies, and cultural awareness. Students should learn language structures in context and use them to convey meaning. In standards-based world language
classrooms, the instructional focus is on function
and not the examination of irregularity and complex grammatical paradigms about the target language.
Language structures should be addressed in as much
as they serve the communicative task and not as an end goal unto themselves. The AP German Language
and Culture course strives to promote both fluency
and accuracy in language use and avoid overemphasis on grammatical accuracy at the expense of
communication. In order to best facilitate the study
of language and culture, the course should be taught primarily in the target language.

Course Framework
Components
Overview
This course framework provides a clear and detailed description of the course requirements necessary for
student success. The framework specifies what students must know, be able to do, and understand to qualify for college credit or placement.
The course framework includes the following essential components:
1  SKILLS
At the core of the AP German Language and Culture course are course skills identifying what students
should know and be able to do to succeed in the course. Students should develop and apply the
described skills on a regular basis over the span of the course.
2  THEMES
The course is based on six required course themes that help teachers integrate language, content,
and culture into a series of lessons and activities. Within each theme are recommended contexts
and overarching essential questions that engage students, guide their classroom investigations, and
promote the use of language in a variety of contexts.
3  MODES
Foundational to the course are the three modes of communication: Interpretive, Interpersonal, and
Presentational, as defined in ACTFL’s World Readiness Standards for Learning Languages. Throughout
the course, students demonstrate their abilities in the interpretive mode by engaging with written, print,
visual, audiovisual, and audio texts; in the interpersonal mode by speaking with and writing to others; and
in the presentational mode by speaking to and writing for an audience.
4  TASK MODELS
Each unit in the course features several of the task models that students will encounter on the exam,
which build in difficulty and complexity over time to the level that matches the exam’s expectations. These
task models include nine different types of stimuli with questions that address interpretive print and audio
communication, and four free-response tasks that address the interpersonal and presentational modes.
Course Skills
The following table lays out the basic language and communication skills that students are expected to develop in the
course. As shown later, each skill is further broken out into concrete learning objectives, which are described in the section on Unit Guides on p. 17.

Course Themes
To provide context and content for students to develop their skills in the modes of communication, the course
takes a thematic approach. There are six required course themes: Families and Communities, Personal and Public
Identities, Beauty and Aesthetics, Science and Technology, Contemporary Life, and Global Challenges.
Families and Communities
Science and Technology
Contemporary
Life
Global
Challenges
Beauty and Aesthetics
Personal and Public Identities
Within each of these themes, there are five to seven recommended contexts. The course is organized
thematically into six units. Each unit targets a primary theme but also connects to additional recommended
contexts for those themes. Teaching to multiple themes in every unit ensures a rich curriculum that will spiral, as
the themes are revisited through a variety of lenses throughout the course. This allows students to experience
the study of language and culture in a variety of authentic and engaging ways and allows teachers to consider the
interests and needs of their students when designing instruction. While teachers may organize the course
thematically in any way they choose, following the recommended course design provided by the unit guides that
follow ensures that all the required courses themes are addressed multiple times in a scaffolded manner.

ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS
Related to the themes are essential questions designed to spark curiosity and encourage students to investigate
and express different views on real-world issues, make connections to other disciplines, and compare aspects of
the target culture(s) to their own. Essential questions also lend themselves well to interdisciplinary inquiry, asking
students to apply skills and perspectives across interdisciplinary content areas while working with content from
language, literature, and cultures of the German-speaking world. Examples of essential questions appear in the
Unit Guide openers.
Course Modes
As students work with course themes and consider essential questions, they do so while engaging in the three modes
of communication—Interpretive, Interpersonal, and Presentational. The development of skills in each of these modes
forms the core of the units, as students build skills in listening, reading, speaking, and writing tasks of increasing levels
of complexity as they work through the course. Students are expected to build skills in the following areas:
Bullet Audio, Visual, and Audiovisual Interpretive Communication
Bullet Written and Print Interpretive Communication
Bullet Spoken Interpersonal Communication
Bullet Written Interpersonal Communication
Bullet Spoken Presentational Communication
Bullet Written Presentational Communication
Course Task Models
As students work with the modes of communication listed above, they practice various task models that
familiarize them with what will be on the exam while helping them build linguistic skills and cultural competencies.

Introduction
This course is organized into six units that are based on the required
themes. This creates an interesting, meaningful context in which to
explore a variety of language and cultural concepts in the interpretive,
interpersonal, and presentational modes. The themes in each unit help
teachers integrate language, content, and culture into an interrelated series
of lessons and activities that promote the use of the language in a variety of contexts.
The objective in providing this unit structure is to respect new AP
teachers’ time by providing one possible sequence they can adopt or
modify, rather than having to build from scratch. An additional benefit is
that these units enable the AP Program to provide interested teachers
with formative assessments—the Personal Progress Checks—that they
can assign their students at the end of each unit to gauge progress
toward success on the AP Exam. However, experienced AP teachers
who are satisfied with their current course organization and exam results
should feel no pressure to adopt these units, which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

Skill Categories and Learning Objectives
At the core of the AP German Language and Culture course are learning objectives that identify
what students should know and be able to do across the three modes of communication. The
interpretive mode is divided into four skill categories with underlying learning objectives. There are
two skill categories associated with the interpersonal mode and two with the presentational mode.
There are also Achievement Level Descriptions (ALDs), which describe the degree to which student
performance meets the skill categories articulated for the course and exam. For a comprehensive
look at the course ALDS, see the section “AP German Language and Culture Achievement Level
Descriptions” on p. 105.
The table that follows on pp. 19–21 shows all eight skill categories with their associated skills and
the learning objectives that will help students develop those skills.

Developing Understanding
Unit 2 looks at ho language and culture influence identity in German-speaking societies. This
relevant and engaging theme provides a meaningful context in which students can acquire
and develop a variety of more nuanced linguistic and cultural concepts as well as vocabulary.
While the primary focus will be on the theme of Personal and Public Identities, teachers are
encouraged to interweave the themes of Beauty and Aesthetics, Contemporary Life, and
Science and Technology. For example, students could
Bullet explore how developments in science and technology impact language and the ways we
communicate and, ultimately, how we see ourselves.
Bullet examine how social media affects personal image and identity.
Bullet consider the role of advertising in shaping personal and public identity.
Bullet explore how a community’s identity is reflected in its art.

UNIT 2
The Influence of Language and Culture on Identity
Building Course Skills
Students continue to build interpretive skills through
engaging with literary texts, articles, charts, and audio
reports. Building on skills developed in Unit 1, students enhance their skills in:
Bullet identifying perspectives
Bullet comprehending vocabulary in context
Bullet summarizing content in narrative form
§Bullet making interdisciplinary and cultural connections
Practice in the interpretive mode prepares students to engage in the presentational mode:
Bullet Students build skills in understanding content and
building academic vocabulary needed for writing an
argumentative essay by listening to and discussing audio
reports, interpreting data and cultural trends from a visual text, and reading and discussing articles.
Bullet Students demonstrate their ability to express their own
viewpoints and support them with textual evidence by
writing a thesis statement and selecting relevant evidence.
§Bullet By interacting with sources provided in this unit, students
acquire cultural information to present a one-minute oral
cultural comparison between their own community and a target community.
Preparing for the AP Exam
In this unit, students encounter some multiple-choice tasks
similar to what they will see on the AP Exam and presented in
the same format, but not yet at the level they will see on the
exam. These include literary texts, articles and charts, and audio reports and articles.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE - MULTIPLE CHOICE
Bullet Literary texts often prove challenging to students,
particularly in regard to understanding vocabulary that
make inferences based on tone, attitude, or perspective.
Teachers should anticipate which vocabulary words
may be challenging to students and help them define them. Presenting some background on the literary
text, including its context, may also help students with
comprehension. After students read a little of the text,
teachers should stop and ask them to predict what may
happen next or how the story may finish. This will enhance their ability to make inferences.
§Bullet Multiple-choice task models containing two sources, such
as an audio report and an article, can be challenging for
students; they may need specific help from the teacher
identifying how the two sources are related and also in
what ways they are similar and different. Teachers could
introduce the use of graphic organizers to assist students
in organizing information found in the two sources.
Because students find the argumentative essay and the
cultural comparison tasks challenging, in this unit they
complete a modified version to build skills needed to
complete the full versions of these tasks in later units.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE – FREE RESPONSE
Bullet Students find writing an argumentative essay based on
three sources to be challenging. To build skills toward this
task in this unit, students write an essay based on just
two sources, focusing on creating their thesis/argument
and on including relevant evidence from the sources to
support their argument. Teacher feedback is most helpful
if it focuses solely on the essay’s argument and how it is supported by evidence from the sources.
§Bullet Exam performance data indicate that students struggle
to create effective cultural comparisons, so a gradual
building of skills for success on this task is needed.
For this unit, students develop a one-minute spoken presentation that compares a cultural aspect of a
German-speaking community that they have learned
about in this unit to the same cultural aspect in their own community. Students may benefit from the use
of a graphic organizer such as a T-note chart or a
Venn diagram to organize their thoughts for this task.
Successful responses will:
Bullet contain an effective introduction.
Bullet define the two communities.
Bullet be well organized.
Bullet include a clear comparison.
◆
Bullet provide details and elaboration.

Developing Understanding
This unit explores themes related to the influences of beauty and art in German-speaking
communities, which provides a meaningful context for students in which to acquire and
develop a variety of linguistic and cultural concepts. The primary focus will be on the theme
of Beauty and Aesthetics, however, teachers should incorporate the themes of Personal
and Public Identities, Contemporary Life, and Families and Communities by integrating
recommended contexts from these themes. For example, students could
Bullet explore how art influences the quality of life and values in a community.
§Bullet consider the role/importance of art in German-speaking communities.
§Bullet discover how the arts capture and reflect the history of a community.
§Bullet investigate how the concept of beauty is defined within a culture.

UNIT 3
Influences of Beauty and Art
Building Course Skills
Students continue to build interpretive communication
skills by engaging with promotional materials, literary
texts, and letters of increasing complexity. Students also
practice interpreting audio and visual sources by listening
to conversations and viewing charts. Building on skills from previous units, students:
Bullet identify point of view and purpose.
§Bullet infer meanings.
§Bullet summarize content.
Bullet identify themes or morals.
§Bullet explain and compare cultural products, practices, and perspectives.
Practice in the interpretive mode prepares students to
engage in the interpersonal and presentational modes.
Bullet Reading and deconstructing letters informs
students about the features of written interpersonal
communication, building skills in reading and responding to emails.
§Bullet Sources provide cultural perspectives for students to incorporate in cultural comparisons.
Bullet To prepare students to present a two-minute comparison between their community and a German speaking community, students practice delivering an
organized presentation with a thesis statement and supporting evidence.
Bullet Students build their repertoire of transitional and cohesive expressions to make more effective comparisons.
Preparing for the AP Exam
In this unit, students practice and receive feedback on
multiple-choice questions based on promotional materials,
letters, literary texts, and conversations and charts. The
questions in this unit begin to approach the complexity of the
AP Exam.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE – MULTIPLE CHOICE
§Bullet Students sometimes struggle to understand vocabulary
in context, especially idiomatic expressions. Teachers can
provide opportunities for students to identify and explain
vocabulary based on the context of a source, adding cultural background as appropriate.
§Bullet Students also struggle to identify distinguishing features
of a text such as purpose, point of view, and/or intended
audience. During instruction, teachers can guide students
to discover these features by actively deconstructing a text in class.
§Bullet Students may also struggle when asked to explain how
data from a graph, chart, or table relate to a cultural
topic. They may need support in interpreting information presented graphically.
§Bullet Students may find it difficult to understand details
and nuance while listening to audio and audiovisual
sources. It’s a good idea to frequently check students’
comprehension during a listening activity. One way to do
this is to pause a recording at several key points to ask
students to identify specific details and inferences.
In this unit, students practice three free-response task
models: email reply, conversation, and cultural comparison to develop their skills.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE – FREE RESPONSE
Bullet Successful responses to all free-response tasks are well
organized and provide significant detail and elaboration.
Teachers can support students in building these skills
by providing and reviewing examples of well-organized
responses from AP Central that contain robust details and elaboration.
Bullet Students often do not effectively use cohesive devices
and transitional expressions when writing or speaking.
Across all free-response tasks, teachers should work
with students to develop a robust variety of transitional
expressions and cohesive devices that go beyond the
commonly used ”and,” ”but,” and “because.” Students can
build a list of these expressions throughout the course,
and teachers can check for their use in student work. In
this unit, students complete a full, two-minute cultural
comparison, so teachers can look for opportunities to help students make comparisons between German speaking communities and their own. Teachers can
remind students to connect their ideas with effective transitional expressions.
Bullet Students often use sweeping generalizations and
stereotypes when completing the cultural comparison,
which can sometimes lead to ineffective and inaccurate
comparisons. Teachers should guide their students to set
up equal comparisons as much as possible. For example,
students should compare communities of similar scope
(e.g., a city to a city, a nation to a nation, a continent to a continent).

Developing Understanding
Unit 4 explores the effects of science and technology on people’s lives in German-speaking
communities. This theme encourages students to work with more complex academic
vocabulary and content as they continue to develop linguistic and cultural concepts from
previous units. While Science and Technology is the primary thematic focus of the unit, it
is possible to integrate the additional themes of Global Challenges, Contemporary Life, and
Personal and Public Identities. For example, students could
Bullet explore how developments in science can both create and resolve challenges in contemporary society.

UNIT 4
How Science and Technology Affect Our Lives
Building Course Skills
In this unit, students comprehend and interpret information
of increasing complexity as they read articles and charts
and listen to audio sources. Building on skills developed in previous units, students:
Bullet identify purpose, perspectives, and point of view.
§Bullet relate a source to another stimulus.
Bullet make connections within and across disciplines.
Bullet identify and explain cultural products, practices, and perspectives.
Bullet continue to develop visual literacy by identifying and describing patterns and trends in data.
Practice in the interpretive mode prepares students to engage in the presentational mode:
Bullet Identifying main ideas, supporting details, and points of
view in written and audio sources builds skills in selecting evidence for writing an argumentative essay.
Bullet Reading and discussing articles and interpreting data
from charts related to articles build students’ skills in
selecting evidence for writing an argumentative essay.
Bullet Applying their cultural understanding by explaining
cultural products, practices, and perspectives builds students’ skills in making comparisons.
Preparing for the AP Exam
In this unit, students complete multiple-choice questions
based on instructions, articles, charts, and presentations,
giving them the opportunity to practice working with varied
texts and to receive feedback on their comprehension of items of increasing complexity.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE – MULTIPLE CHOICE
Bullet Students find listening to authentic instructions and
presentations challenging: the speed of delivery by
native speakers, the speaker’s presentational style or dialect, and background sounds may interfere
with understanding. The content itself may also be
challenging. Teachers can prepare students by providing
numerous opportunities to listen to a wide variety of
audio sources from the German-speaking world, ideally
providing key interdisciplinary vocabulary ahead of time.
Teachers should teach strategies for taking notes while
listening and encourage students to identify main ideas
and supporting details. Students can listen to the source
multiple times, with the teacher pausing occasionally to check for students’ understanding.
Bullet As previously stated in Unit 2, students find tasks with
two sources challenging. Students can continue to make
connections between sources using graphic organizers.
Students also complete cultural comparison and
argumentative essay free-response questions. In Unit 2,
students developed a thesis statement for their written
argument. In Unit 4, the essay task is further scaffolded to the
complexity students can expect on the AP Exam. Students
are given 40 minutes to write an organized essay in response to a prompt. In their essay, students should:
§Bullet provide their own viewpoint.
Bullet support their viewpoint by integrating evidence from all three sources.
Bullet cite the sources appropriately.
§Bullet apply their knowledge of academic vocabulary.
§Bullet write paragraph-length discourse.
Bullet guide the reader by using effective transitions.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE – FREE RESPONSE
Argumentative Essay:
Bullet Students sometimes focus on summarizing the sources
instead of integrating evidence from all the sources to
support their argument. Teachers can show examples
from AP Central of effective essays that successfully
integrate the sources. Teachers can show ineffective sample essays to demonstrate how not integrating evidence detracts from the argument.
Bullet Students often struggle to effectively organize their ideas.
Teachers can guide students to
Bullet clearly state their argument in the opening paragraph.
Bullet develop their argument in subsequent paragraphs by integrating evidence from the sources.
Bullet enhance the reader’s understanding by using effective transitions and cohesive devices.
Bullet bring the essay to an appropriate conclusion in which they do not simply restate their argument.
Bullet Students sometimes forget to cite sources used in
their essays. While using formal style guidelines is not
expected on the AP Exam, students should acknowledge
a source each time it is referenced, by giving the source
name, author, or number (Source 1, Source 2, Source 3),
or by stating the type of source (article, chart, audio).
Bullet Students don’t always proofread and revise their work,
so teachers should remind students that reviewing their
work for spelling, grammar, and mechanics is part of the writing process.
Cultural Comparison:
Bullet Students tend to focus too much on discussing one
community or the other instead of making an effective
comparison. It’s important that students demonstrate
what they have learned about the target culture. A good
strategy to ensure that students discuss and compare the
two communities is to have them start their presentation
by talking about the target language community and then transition to their own.

Developing Understanding
This unit explores themes related to the quality of life in German-speaking communities,
which provides a meaningful context for students in which to work on increasingly nuanced
linguistic and cultural concepts as they expand their academic vocabulary. While the unit’s
primary thematic focus is Contemporary Life, the themes of Global Challenges, Science and
Technology, and Beauty and Aesthetics may also be incorporated. For example, students could
§Bullet explore how one’s social status influences one’s quality of life.
§Bullet investigate how cultural perspectives and traditions relate to the quality of life.
Bullet consider how access to education, health care, justice, food, and water impact the quality of life.
Bullet explore how geography influences the quality of life.

UNIT 5
Building Course Skills
Students read literary texts and interpret information in
interviews, instructions, and conversations. Building on skills developed in previous units, students
Bullet identify point of view, purpose, perspectives, and intended audience.
Bullet summarize content.
Bullet identify theme or moral.
§Bullet infer meanings based on context.
Bullet connect content to interdisciplinary themes.
Students engage in the interpersonal and presentational modes in the following ways:
Bullet They apply appropriate register, elaboration, and
communication strategies to interpersonal speaking and writing.
Bullet They apply skills and vocabulary gained from reading
and deconstructing authentic sources while writing and speaking.
Bullet They continue to build their repertoire of transitions and cohesive devices to enhance their presentational speaking.
Bullet They deliver organized spoken presentations with a thesis statement and supporting evidence.
Preparing for the AP Exam
In this unit, students complete multiple-choice questions
with literary texts, interviews, instructions, and conversations
and charts. These questions closely align to the level of complexity students can expect on the AP Exam.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE – MULTIPLE CHOICE
Bullet Students may have difficulty differentiating among
speakers while listening to interviews. Therefore, it
is important for teachers to offer many examples of
recorded interviews. Students should listen to sources
with interviews multiple times in order to clearly
distinguish the different speakers. After listening, teachers can provide excerpts and ask students to identify each speaker.
Bullet Students often neglect to read the advance organizers hat precede each source. These organizers provide
context and essential information about the sources that
follow, so teachers need to encourage their students to read them.
t
Students also complete the conversation, email, and cultural
comparison free-response questions, which align to the format students will see on the AP Exam.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE – FREE RESPONSE
Bullet In the conversation task, students do not always follow
what they are directed to do in the provided outline.
When they do not follow directions, they are in danger of
going off task and will not be able to receive a high score.
Teachers need to make sure students read and adhere to the outline.
Bullet During the conversation, students should not stop if they
realize they misunderstood one of the turns, but rather
continue to do their best and listen carefully to the next prompt from the interlocutor.
Bullet Students should not overuse memorized stock phrases.
For example, “What a good question,” “Let me think for
a minute,” and “Just a second” may be appropriate to
use occasionally, but such phrases should not be relied
on for each turn in the conversation. Students should be encouraged to use the full 20 seconds to respond.
Bullet In both the conversation and the email tasks, students
need to pay attention to register and avoid shifting registers during their responses.
Bullet For both speaking tasks, students should monitor their
language production and be encouraged to self-correct
if they realize that they have made a mistake. They are not penalized for doing so on the exam.
Bullet For all tasks in this unit, students need to continue to focus on providing details and elaboration.
Bullet Teachers should provide examples of effective student responses to conversations, emails, and cultural
comparisons from AP Central as models for students.

This final unit explores themes related to how complex issues and phenomena affect
people’s lives in German-speaking communities. Engaging with the primary theme of Global
Challenges encourages students to use more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence
structure as they continue to refine their knowledge of linguistic and cultural concepts.
The unit also connects to the themes of Contemporary Life, Science and Technology, and
Families and Communities. For example, students could
Bullet investigate how economic developments and environmental challenges often impact society
and politics on a larger scale, which in turn affects individual families and communities.

UNIT 6
Building Course Skills
At this point in the course, students are preparing for the
exam in earnest; reading articles, viewing charts, and listening
to audio reports and presentations of increasing length and
complexity, and building on skills from previous units. During
the unit, students engage with all four skill categories in the
interpretive mode to comprehend text, make connections, interpret text, and make meanings.
In Units 2 and 4, students developed skills for creating
effective argumentative essays, and in Unit 6 they will write
an essay using three sources, similar to the one that they
will be asked to complete on the exam. Writing the essay
is supported by the work students perform in this unit’s interpretive mode activities, such as:
Bullet listening to and discussing audio reports and presentations, which prepares students to engage with the audio source associated with the argumentative essay.
Bullet identifying main ideas, supporting details, and other
distinguishing features in articles, which builds skills for students in selecting evidence for an argumentative essay.
Bullet viewing charts related to articles, which builds students’
skills in interpreting data and cultural trends related to the visuals associated with the argumentative essay.
Students continue to refine their skills in presenting
effective cultural comparisons. They will demonstrate their
understanding of culture as learned in this unit by comparing
one cultural aspect of German-speaking communities with that aspect in their own community.
Preparing for the AP Exam
In this final unit, students complete multiple-choice questions
in the interpretive mode, using articles and charts, audio
reports and articles, and presentations. Many skills acquired
through the multiple-choice questions are transferrable to other interpretive-mode exam task models.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE – MULTIPLE CHOICE
Bullet The article and chart task model has the most multiple choice items on the exam, and students find working
with two sources challenging. Students need to deeply
engage with the content of both sources, so teachers
can help by working with students to unpack all the information provided in the two sources and guide
students’ understanding with leading questions. Students
could also engage with the sources by using a think-pair share activity.
Bullet Students also find both the audio report and article
task model difficult because there are two sources.
Teachers should guide students in making connections
and understanding the content of both sources and also
remind students to take good notes as they listen to the audio report.
Students demonstrate presentational writing and speaking
skills by completing full argumentative essay and cultural
comparison free-response questions. They apply their
understanding of academic vocabulary in both written and
oral presentations and enhance clarity by using effective
transitions. Many skills developed in the presentational mode
are transferrable to the interpersonal communication tasks on the AP Exam.
AREAS OF CHALLENGE – FREE RESPONSE
For the essay task, students need to remember to:
Bullet provide a thesis statement that clearly defines their argument.
Bullet integrate relevant evidence from all three sources in support of their argument.
Bullet leave time to review and revise their work, paying careful
attention to mechanics. Teachers can provide a checklist
of basic punctuation, spelling, and grammatical issues.
Bullet write legibly so that the reader does not have to interpret their handwriting.
For the cultural comparison task:
Bullet students sometimes do not state a clear thesis as a basis
for their presentation. Students need to establish a strong
thesis for their cultural comparison and ensure that they
address a cultural aspect in both their community and a
German-speaking community.
Bullet many students do not respond fully to the prompt of the
cultural comparison but rather give generalities about the
topic. Teachers can remind students to read the prompt
carefully and make sure to address the role, influence,
attitude, perspective, or significance of the topic.
Bullet Students need to pay careful attention to the pace of their
delivery, so that they can deliver a maximum amount of information in two minutes.
Bullet Students should resist the temptation to write out their
cultural comparison before delivering it. Instead, teachers
can encourage students to write down key words or ideas that they want to include in their presentation.

ACHIEVEMENT LEVEL DESCRIPTIONS
AP GERMAN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
Achievement
Level Descriptions

=== Page 114 ===
Introduction
The degree to which student performance meets the
learning objectives in each skill category is articulated in
the Achievement Level Descriptions, which define how well
students at each level perform. Due to the interrelated nature
of the modes of communication, all the achievement level
descriptions work in concert with one another and should be
consider holistically. While references to levels 1–5 cannot
precisely predict a student’s ultimate score on the AP Exam,
AP teachers can use this information to develop better
insight into individual student performance and adjust their curriculum and instruction accordingly.
The AP German Language and Culture course and exam target a range of student performance
so that all students can experience success in some or most skills. The Achievement Level
Descriptions (ALDs) provide detailed expectations for performance in each skill at each level
so both students and teachers can understand what typical performance is required for skills
at each different level. Teachers and students can use them to develop strategies for moving
to the next level of performance. It is important to remember that students’ ability to function
in each skill may be different; for example, a student may perform at an ALD skill level of 4 in
interpretive communication but may be at the 3 level in interpersonal communication.
Across the spectrum of the course’s skills, we have also defined each skill in the range of three skill levels:
§ E: Emerging. Students are generally performing at ALD level 2.
Bullet P: Proficient. Students are generally performing in the range of ALD levels 3–4.
Bullet A: Advanced. Students are generally performing in the range of ALD levels 4–5.

Selecting and Using Course Materials
There are several textbooks designed for AP German
Language and Culture. Some provide ways to organize
the course, as well as instructional and assessment
strategies, while others specifically focus on preparing students for the exam.
As the course develops real-world communicative and
cultural competencies, it is critical to integrate a variety
of authentic materials into instruction and assessment.
Authentic materials are texts or resources designed for
native speakers of the language and not created for the
language classroom. Such authentic materials include, but are not limited to:
Bullet

websites
Bullet newspapers, magazines, and other printed sources
Bullet short stories
Bullet blogs and other social media
Bullet podcasts
Bullet music
Bullet videos: films, advertisements, news programs,
TV shows
Bullet radio broadcasts
Teachers can gain insights on teaching German and
network with other German educators by joining the
American Association of Teachers of German
(AATG). There are state chapters of this organization.
aatg.org
The American Council on the Teaching of Foreign
Languages (ACTFL) is the largest organization of world language educators in the United States. ACTFL’s
standards and approach to instruction, performance,
and assessment are foundational to AP world language and culture courses and exams. actfl.org
ACTFL offers many documents that inform instruction
and assessment:
Bullet communicate effectively and interact with
cultural competence to participate in multilingual communities at home and around the world.”
The five goal areas (Communication, Culture,
Connections, Comparisons, Communities) of language constitute the standards for language acquisition. This document is foundational for AP world language and culture courses.

Instructional Strategies
The AP German Language and Culture course
framework outlines the concepts and skills students must master to be successful on the AP Exam. To
address those concepts and skills effectively, teachers
should incorporate a variety of instructional approaches
and best practices into their daily lessons and activities.
Teachers can help students develop mastery of these
skills by engaging them in learning activities that allow
them to apply their understanding of course concepts.
Teachers may consider the following strategies as they
plan instruction. In the skills tables that follow these
instructional strategies, we provide some selected
strategies to show how they might be used to develop specific skills.

Developing Course Skills
Throughout the AP German Language and Culture course, students develop skills that are fundamental to the
learning of a language and culture and to communicating effectively across the three modes of communication.
Since these are the complex language and communication skills that adept language-learners need to develop,
students will benefit from multiple opportunities to develop and practice them in a scaffolded manner.
The degree to which student performance meets the learning objectives in each skill category is articulated in the
Achievement Level Descriptions, which define how well students at each level perform. See the section “AP German
Language and Culture Achievement Level Descriptions” on p. 105.
Skill Category 1: Comprehend Written, Audio, Audiovisual, and Visual Text
The comprehension of texts is essential to learning a language and culture because it represents foundational input that is necessary to produce language. Much of the course content is delivered
through print, written, visual, audiovisual, and audio
texts; therefore, students must be able to engage with
and comprehend information conveyed in a wide variety of interdisciplinary texts.
Comprehending text requires students to be skilled at
decoding unfamiliar language, understand vocabulary
in context, and use contextual clues when dealing with
challenging text. Teachers can encourage students to
persevere and practice, and they can address issues
by the careful selection of texts and by designing appropriately scaffolded instruction.
Below are some suggested strategies for instruction.
Skill Category 1: Comprehend written, audio, audiovisual, and visual text

Skill Category 2: Make Interdisciplinary and Cultural Connections
One of the “5Cs” (Communication, Culture,
Connections, Comparisons, and Communities) that is foundational to ACTFL’s standards for language
learning is “connections,” that is, making connections
among interdisciplinary and/or cultural topics. In AP world language classrooms, the content is
interdisciplinary and culturally oriented by nature, and
what is studied is related to other disciplines that go well beyond the language classroom.
Teachers can work with students to develop their
ability to make cultural connections by helping them to recognize and understand cultural references
in texts. When working with interdisciplinary texts
teachers can provide opportunities for students to
make connections with prior learning. They can help
students understand the context of a text and teach
strategies for students to use context to understand
the text. Teachers can also keep students’ interests
in mind as they choose texts and materials to work
with, as students are more likely to persevere with a
text that engages them. It’s a good idea to actively encourage students to make cross-disciplinary and
cultural connections by using activating strategies such as advance organizers or guiding questions.
Consistent exposure to interdisciplinary and cultural
topics will build confidence and competence in the skill of making connections during the course.
Below are some suggested strategies for instruction.

Skill Category 3: Interpret the Content of Written or Audio Text
Interpreting a text goes beyond comprehending
its literal meaning. It requires students to identify
distinguishing textual features (purpose, audience,
point of view, style, theme, moral, tone), infer implied meanings, and identify and understand cultural
nuances. Students also need to recognize relationships between texts.
In interpreting content, students will need to employ
the same skills they use for comprehending and making
interdisciplinary or cultural connections—decoding unfamiliar language, working on understanding
vocabulary in context, using contextual clues, and
persevering with challenging text. Teachers can help
students by selecting texts that incrementally introduce
challenging content, designing appropriately scaffolded
instruction and providing well-crafted guiding questions
that will lead students to discover the more abstract elements of a text.
Below are some suggested strategies for instruction.

Skill Category 4: Make Meanings from Words and Expressions
Making meaning from unfamiliar words or expressions
is essential to demonstrating comprehension of any
text. While students do not have to understand every
word to understand a text, they need to become adept
at decoding unfamiliar vocabulary by using context clues that appear. Students need encouragement to
persist and take risks when engaging with a source. This may mean withholding correction as students make a few errors when they encounter unfamiliar words or expressions.
Teachers can encourage students’ growth in making meanings from words and expressions through
consistent practice with texts that contain unknown
vocabulary and have rich examples of idiomatic and
cultural expressions. Teachers can guide students to
decode words by looking at prefixes, suffixes, word
stems, and radicals; as well as looking for context clues, word derivations, and cultural concepts.
Below are some suggested strategies for instruction.

Skill Category 5: Communicate Interpersonally by Speaking with Others
Learning to speak with others constitutes the main
reason students enroll in language and culture courses.
Spontaneous speech is one of the most difficult skills
for students to achieve. Therefore, it is critical to provide
students with multiple and ongoing opportunities to speak with each other.
The more students practice this skill, the more likely
students will produce language that is comprehensible
to native speakers of the target language. Students need opportunities to speak the language in authentic situations in order to progress beyond using memorized words and phrases. They need to work on communicating messages effectively,
practice listening to the spoken language to increase comprehension, and become comfortable speaking spontaneously.
Teachers can establish a classroom culture in which
students feel comfortable taking risks, providing timely and directed feedback that encourages students to continue to practice for improvement.
Below are some suggested strategies for instruction.

Skill Category 6: Communicate Interpersonally by Writing to Others
Being able to communicate with others through writing
constitutes another main reason why students enroll
in language and culture courses. Written interpersonal
communication is an important real-life skill to develop
within the language classroom. Therefore, it is critical to
provide students with multiple and ongoing opportunities
to write to others in both the formal and informal registers.
The more students practice writing texts, notes, emails,
and letters, the more likely they will produce written
language that is comprehensible to native speakers of the target language.
In order to communicate successfully in writing in the interpersonal mode, students need to practice:
Bullet building their vocabulary
Bullet communicating their message using accurate grammatical and syntactic structures
Bullet §
Bullet using the appropriate register
Bullet providing relevant and sufficient information, elaboration, and details
Bullet developing an organized, cohesive message
Teachers can help students by actively teaching all
aspects of successful interpersonal writing, breaking
down the writing task into a step-by-step process, and
providing timely and directed feedback that encourages students to continue to practice for improvement.

Skill Category 7: Communicate Through Spoken Presentations
Presenting information orally is an important way that students demonstrate their ability to communicate effectively in the language. Spoken
presentations can be challenging to students, as they need to communicate ideas related to a variety of
interdisciplinary and cultural topics in an organized and
engaging manner. Many students find speaking in front
of a group to be challenging and stressful. They are
apprehensive about making mistakes and effectively
communicating their message. The ability to carefully
plan and outline key ideas and main points is critical so
that students will present information without relying on
memorizing or reading their presentations. Therefore,
teachers should give students multiple and ongoing opportunities to give oral presentations.
Students should also be encouraged to take risks,
as they will likely make errors in their presentations.
By practicing these skills regularly, students will
become more comfortable and confident in presenting
orally. Students should receive feedback that helps them improve not only the content and accuracy of
their presentation, but also their confidence in their
presentational skills. As the year progresses, they will
acquire more interdisciplinary vocabulary and more complex language structures to support longer and more sophisticated oral presentations. There may be several reasons students are not successful in producing oral presentations.
In order to be successful in their oral presentations,
students need to:
Bullet

employ vocabulary and grammatical and syntactical structures to effectively convey their thoughts
Bullet organize their information to deliver an effective presentation
Bullet use strong transitional expressions and cohesive devices that guide the listener’s understanding

Skill Category 8: Communicate Through Written Presentations
Presenting information in writing is an important way
that students demonstrate their ability to communicate
effectively in the language. Presentational writing can
be challenging to students, as it is among the more academic areas of language production, in which
students are often required to effectively express and
explain complex ideas and support them with evidence
from sources. The ability to conduct research, evaluate
sources, and then extract relevant information from
sources is an important part of creating effective
written presentations. Therefore, it is critical to provide
students with multiple and ongoing opportunities to present their ideas in written form.
In order to be successful in their written presentations,
students need to:
Bullet employ academic vocabulary
Bullet use effective grammatical and syntactical structures
Bullet develop organizational skills
Bullet effectively use transitional expressions and cohesive devices to guide the reader’s understanding
Bullet include relevant evidence from sources.
Teachers can help students by actively teaching a writing process, showing students how to create a
step-by-step plan to produce a written presentation that
is well organized and has a logical flow. Student must
also take the time to proofread their work to correct
errors in organization, grammar, syntax, and mechanics.
In addition, students need to know how to find, evaluate, and cite sources and how to use sources to gain
academic and discipline-specific vocabulary. Teachers can provide targeted feedback on grammatical and
syntactical errors to improve the comprehensibility
of students’ work; however, this should be in addition
to providing directive feedback on ways students can improve the strength of their argument. There are
numerous sample essays on AP Central that teachers can access.
The more students practice this skill, the more likely it is
that they will become effective in communicating their
ideas in writing. With practice and feedback, they will
acquire the academic vocabulary, organizational skills,
and appropriate conventions of written language to create written presentations.
Below are some suggested strategies for instruction.

In diesem Text geht es um eine bestimmte Art, Urlaub zu machen. Der
ursprüngliche Artikel wurde am 29. Mai 2012 in Deutschland in der
Zeitschrift Der Spiegel veröffentlicht.
Urlaub auf dem Bauernhof – Die neue Lust am Land
Behutsam sammelt Hanna die Eier im Hühnerstall ein. Eins nach dem
anderem reicht sie sie Jutta Sauer, die die Eier in einen Eimer gleiten
lässt. Die Vierjährige und ihre Familie nennen das Urlaub, für Sauer ist es
Arbeitsalltag. Während viele Deutsche zum Sonnenbaden nach Spanien
fliegen, zieht es die Mews aufs Land. Seit vielen Jahren verbringen sie ihre
Ferien auf dem Bauernhof in Dangast. Dort suchen sie vor allem eins: Ruhe.
„Entschleunigung tritt hier ganz schnell ein“, sagt Erna Mews. „Allein
diese Stille.“ Bei ihr zu Hause in Dormagen, im Städtedreieck zwischen
Düsseldorf, Köln und Mönchengladbach, dröhnen Flugzeuge, eine
Autobahn und Fabriken. Auf Sauers Hof, 30 Kilometer südlich von
Wilhelmshaven am Jadebusen gelegen, gackern meist nur die Hühner.
Auf den Weiden hinter dem roten Backsteinhaus grasen Kühe. In der
Ferne brummen die Traktoren von Helmut Sauer und Sohn Hauke. Auf
dem Land geht alles etwas beschaulicher zu – so empfinden es zumindest
die Touristen. Doch auch die Zeit ist hier bestimmt nicht stehengeblieben.
„Früher mussten wir im Sommer unsere Zimmer räumen“, erinnert sich
Helmut Sauer. Wenn die Feriengäste kamen, zogen er und seine Geschwister
auf den Boden oder in den Stall. Die Gäste saßen beim Abendbrot mit am
Tisch und packten auf dem Hof an.
Heute vermietet die Familie auf ihrem Grundstück drei Wohnungen und
zwei Ferienhäuser. Auch die Landwirtschaft hat sich gewandelt: Urlauber,
die vom Kühemelken oder der Maisernte träumen, könnten enttäuscht
sein. „Das ist mittlerweile alles so hochtechnisiert, da ist nicht mehr viel mit
Helfen“, meint Sauer. Hühner füttern, den Pferdestall ausmisten, im Garten
wühlen und Trecker fahren – Städtern bietet das Landleben trotzdem noch
Handfestes.
„Die Zahl der Übernachtungen nimmt kontinuierlich zu“, sagt der
Geschäftsführer der Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft für Urlaub auf dem
Bauernhof und Landtourismus, Frank Wetterich. Wie das Landleben
selbst gilt auch der Urlaub in idyllischer Abgeschiedenheit seit neuestem
als schick. „In Zeiten der Globalisierung gibt es ein steigendes Bedürfnis
nach überschaubaren Zusammenhängen“, begründet Wetterich. „Die Leute wollen wissen, wo die Milch herkommt.“
Anonyme All-inclusive-Bettenburgen und überfrachtete Rundreisen
durch ferne Länder ziehen oft nicht mehr. Das Exotische findet sich
neuerdings vor der Haustür. „Fast jeder war schon auf Mallorca, aber nicht
im Elbsandsteingebirge“, sagt die Trendforscherin Josefine Sporer. Im
Alltag klimpern die meisten Menschen nur noch auf der Computertastatur
rum oder betatschen das iPhone. Auf dem Bauernhof können sie mit der
Mistgabel in der Hand dagegen noch ordentlich ins Schwitzen geraten.
„Das Landleben verkörpert alles, was wir in der Stadt nicht haben“, sagt die
Expertin vom Hamburger Trendbüro.

Bei den Sauers brummt auf jeden Fall das Geschäft. Von Ostern bis zum
Ende der Herbstferien sind ihre Unterkünfte immer ausgebucht – was
aber auch an der Lage liegt, gibt Jutta Sauer zu. „Der Strand ist nur einen
Kilometer entfernt.“ Deshalb stehen ihre Gäste nicht vor der Wahl: entweder
Sonnenbaden oder Kuhstall. Sie können beides haben.

ese E-Mail ist von Andreas Stöger vom Familien- und Jugendamt der Stadt. Sie erhalten diese Nachricht, weil Ihre Stadt ein neues Jugendzentrum bauen möchte.
Von: Andreas Stöger
Betreff: Planung des Jugendzentrums
Liebe(r) Mitbürger(in),
wie Sie vielleicht schon gehört haben, hat die Stadt neulich beschlossen, ein Jugendzentrum zu bauen, das allen Jugendlichen Möglichkeiten zu sportlichen und
sozialen Aktivitäten geben soll. Mit dieser E-Mail wollen wir Sie als junge(n) Mitbürger(in) bitten, an der Planung von diesem neuen Gebäude teilzunehmen.
Als Erstes würden wir gern von Ihnen hören: Was für Aktivitäten würden Sie und Ihre Freunde gern in so einem Jugendzentrum machen?
Außerdem suchen wir Freiwillige für eine „Experten-Gruppe“ von Jugendlichen, die die Architekten detaillierter beraten werden. Diese Aufgabe ist etwas
zeitintensiver, denn die Gruppe würde sich mindestens einmal pro Woche treffen. Bitte teilen Sie uns mit, ob Sie an dieser Gruppe teilnehmen wollen.
Wir sind sehr gespannt, was Sie zu sagen haben. Für alle Fragen stehen wir Ihnen natürlich gern zur Verfügung.
Mit freundlichen Grüßen
Andreas Stöger
