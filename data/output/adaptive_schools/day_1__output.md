__Audience Connect__

__WHAT?__  
Audience Connect allows the presenter to develop rapport and relationship, as well as establishing credibility\. 

__WHY?__

The trainer needs to make a connection to the world of the audience and share a purpose for the work\.

__HOW? __

__*Suggested Language:*__

*The purpose of this seminar is to support you in your work in developing collaborative groups\. To this end, you will experience concepts, tools, and tips aimed at supporting student learning through your work\. As a group, we will draw from the emerging research base\. We will also draw upon the experiences of the authors, colleagues, and training community in schools, districts, and agencies across North America as well as globally\.*

__Our Purpose__

__Introductory Statement__: “Let’s begin by talking about the ‘why’ behind this workshop\. Our purpose is simple yet profound: to support you in developing and facilitating collaborative groups that make a real impact\.”

__Key Points__:

- “We’re not just aiming to create any kind of collaboration—our focus is on __efficacious__, __thoughtful__, and __purpose\-driven__ teamwork\. This means groups that aren’t just getting along, but are working with intention to improve student outcomes\.”
- “The key to effective collaboration is ensuring that it has a __direct impact on student learning__\. Everything we discuss here will tie back to this core goal\.”

__Expand on Each Point__:

- “We’ll be diving into __research__ that shows how collaboration, when done right, leads to better student achievement\.”
- “We’ll __consider new structures__—whether it’s how we run meetings or how we organize our time—that support this kind of impactful work\.”
- “Most importantly, you’ll leave with __practical tools and concepts__ that you can immediately use in your schools to improve how your teams function and, ultimately, how your students succeed\.”

__Draw on Shared Experiences__:

- “This workshop is not just about theory\. We’ll be drawing on __real experiences from schools__ where collaboration has transformed learning environments\. You’ll hear stories and examples that resonate with your own challenges and triumphs\.”
- “Together, we’ll __share learnings__ and explore how these ideas can be adapted to fit the unique context of your school\.”

__Action/Next Step__: “By the end of this session, you will not only understand the importance of building collaborative groups, but you’ll also have the confidence and tools to __lead them effectively__\. And remember, everything we do today comes back to one core purpose: improving student learning\.”

__SELF\-DIRECTEDNESS AS A 3\-LEGGED STOOL__

__Facilitator Notes: The Three\-Legged Stool Metaphor__

__Introductory Statement__: "Let's explore a powerful metaphor that helps us understand the foundation of our work together \- the three\-legged stool\. Metaphors do more than just create visual images; they help us make meaningful connections and understand complex relationships\."

__Key Points__:

- "This metaphor is particularly valuable because it not only clarifies how different bodies of work support each other, but it also honors the rich history and interconnectedness of these approaches\."
- "Each leg of this stool is essential \- remove any one leg, and the stool cannot stand properly\. Similarly, each component of this work supports the ultimate goal of developing self\-directedness\."

__Expand on Each Leg of the Stool__:

- "The first leg represents __Habits of Mind__, developed by Art Costa and Bena Kallick\. This work focuses on creating thoughtful learning communities in classroom settings, helping students develop dispositions that lead to productive thinking and learning\."
- "The second leg is __Cognitive Coaching℠__, created by Art Costa and Bob Garmston\. This approach centers on thoughtful conversations between individuals \- the kind that mediate thinking and lead to increased cognitive capacity and self\-directedness\."
- "The third leg \- our focus during this seminar \- is __Adaptive Schools__, developed by Bob Garmston and Bruce Wellman\. This work addresses how we develop collaborative groups and provides the systems thinking that completes and stabilizes our stool\."

__Facilitate Connection\-Making__:

- "To help connect these concepts to your own experience, I'd like you to turn to a partner at your table and share what you know or have heard about any of these three legs\. Perhaps you've encountered Habits of Mind in your classroom work, experienced Cognitive Coaching in professional development, or seen elements of Adaptive Schools in your team structures\."
- "This conversation will help us understand your starting points and will begin to build connections between your prior knowledge and what we'll explore together\."

__Action/Next Step__: "As we move through these four days together, we'll be focusing primarily on the Adaptive Schools leg of the stool, but you'll notice how the principles interconnect with the other legs\. Keep this metaphor in mind as we explore how to develop collaborative groups that can adapt and thrive in changing environments\."

__Entering New Territory Mouse Cartoon__

__Script for Slide 1__:

__Introductory Statement__: “Imagine entering a new environment—whether you’re a new administrator, teacher, or in a new building\. It feels like walking into a maze\.”

__Key Point__: “We’re often confronted with new, complex tasks and feel like we need to solve them alone\. This image represents that sense of entering the unknown by yourself\.”

__Example__: “Think about teachers starting in a new school or students entering a new community\. The isolation can breed mediocrity if we don’t break through it\.”

__Action/Next Step__: “Instead of working harder on our own, we need to work smarter by collaborating\. Moving from isolation to teamwork is the key\.”

__Slide 2: Mice Huddling Together__

__Introductory Statement__: “Once we recognize the challenge, the natural next step is to connect with others\. We huddle together, and the situation starts to feel better\.”

__Key Point__: “However, even just being cordial and friendly isn’t enough—we’re not yet at true collaboration\.”

__Example__: “In schools, we often mistake surface\-level interaction for teamwork\. Conviviality feels good, but it’s not where we need to be\.”

__Action/Next Step__: “We need to take that next step towards deeper, more meaningful collaboration\.”

__Slide 3: Mice Standing on Each Other’s Shoulders__

__Introductory Statement__: “True collaboration leads to greater, more positive effects\. It’s about lifting each other up—standing on the shoulders of others to see further\.”

__Key Point__: “Within an organization, resourcefulness and success come from leveraging each other’s strengths and experiences\.”

__Example__: “Margaret Wheatley once said, ‘The quality of adult relationships provides the energy that gets all organizational work done\.’ In this image, the mice represent collaboration, trust, and boosting one another to achieve more than they could alone\.”

__Action/Next Step__: “Let’s foster an environment where we trust one another enough to say, ‘I don’t know,’ and ask for help when we need it\. That’s how we grow as a community\.”

__Wrap\-up for this Section:__

__Transition Statement__: “Now that we’ve explored how isolation can turn into collaboration, let’s think about how these principles apply in your schools or teams\. What steps can we take to create a collaborative culture that propels everyone forward?”

__MATERIALS WALK__

__Introductory Statement__: “Before we dive into the content, let’s take a moment to get familiar with the materials you’ll be using throughout the seminar\.”

__Suggested Language for the Materials Walk__:

- “Please start by putting your name in your __Learning Guide__\. This will be your primary resource throughout our time together\.”
- “You’ll notice that the __side columns__ on each page offer space for your __note\-taking__\. Feel free to jot down ideas, thoughts, or questions as we go along\.”

__Key Points__:

- “The Learning Guide is divided into the four days of the Foundation Seminar\. Each day has dedicated sections that align with our workshop sessions\.”
- “At the __back of the guide__, you’ll find __additional exercises and instruments__ that we’ll reference during the seminar\.”

__Highlight the “Memory Mat”__:

- “Also, inside the __back cover__, you’ll find a card stock __‘Memory Mat’__\. This handy tool summarizes key Adaptive Schools concepts and strategies that you can easily bring to meetings\. It’s designed to be a quick reference guide for important ideas\.”

__Problem\-Based User’s Guide \(p\. xv\)__:

- “If you’re ever looking for something specific, turn to __page xv__ of the sourcebook where you’ll find a __Problem\-Based Users Guide__\. It’s a great tool to help you quickly locate strategies for common challenges\.”

__150 Strategies in Appendix__:

- “Lastly, the __appendices__ provide a comprehensive __list of 150 strategies__ in alphabetical order\. These include tools and inventories that we’ll explore, formatted so they can be printed onto __4x6 cards__ for easy reference and use\.”

__Action/Next Step__: “Now that you’re familiar with the layout of the materials, keep your Learning Guide handy, and let’s move forward into today’s session\.”

08:06

__Thinking Collaborative Overview__

08:07

1m

__Patterns of Adult Interaction Quote__

__Introductory Statement__: “One of the core ideas from Garmston and Wellman is that the way adults interact in a school shapes everything—from the school’s climate to how well students perform\. This idea parallels the work of leadership expert Margaret Wheatley\.”

__Key Points__:

- “According to the authors, Bob Garmston and Bruce Wellman, the __quality of adult relationships__ is a key mediator of student success\.”
- When teachers, administrators, and staff members engage in __collaborative, respectful, and intentional interactions__, it sets the tone for the entire school\. It creates an environment where students thrive\.”

__Example__:

- “In fact, you can __walk into any school__ and almost immediately feel the energy of the adult relationships\. If the staff is working together, sharing ideas, and supporting one another, you can often predict __positive outcomes for students__\.”

__True Collaboration__:

- “It’s important to note that __true collaboration__—not just surface\-level teamwork—has an even __greater impact__\. When adults go beyond simply getting along and actively work together to tackle challenges and share solutions, the benefits for students multiply\.”

__Action/Next Step__: “As we move through the workshop, we’ll focus on how to foster this kind of __deep collaboration__ among adults, so we can create the best possible outcomes for students\.”

__GOAL OF ADAPTIVE SCHOOLS, p\. 16 __

__GOAL: Critical__

*What does this goal mean to you?*

*Partner listen with truly caring ear / paraphrase*

__Introductory Statement__: 

- “Let’s take a moment to reflect on the __goal__ of Adaptive Schools\. This goal is __critical__ not just because it sets direction, but because it speaks to something deeper—our __identity__ as educators and collaborators\.”

__Invite Participants to Read__:

- “Please take a few moments to __read the goal__ from page 16 of the sourcebook, and as you do, think about what it’s saying about __identity__\.”

__Interactive Exercise__:

- “Now, turn to an elbow partner and __share what you’re noticing__ about the goal\.”
- __Partner Instructions__: “As you listen to each other, consider listening with a __truly caring ear__, and when your partner is finished, take a moment to __paraphrase__ what they’ve shared, to ensure you’ve captured their thoughts\.”

__Key Points After Sharing__:

- “When we talk about collaboration, it’s not just about working together—it’s about __inquiring deeply__ and asking the __right questions__\. Getting to those questions requires __trust__ and a willingness to have deeper conversations\.”
- “It also calls for __leadership__—the kind that builds trust and collaboration\. Leadership in this sense is about __creating environments__ where people feel safe and encouraged to engage in these types of discussions\.”

__Emphasize Strategies__:

- “Throughout this seminar, we’ll be exploring __50\-60 strategies and moves__\. It’s easy to view these as a __treasure chest__ of great ideas, but remember that Adaptive Schools is more than just strategies\.”
- “This work invites your __organization to examine its identity__\. These strategies are designed to __actuate the goal__—to help us be more __intentional__ about how we collaborate and lead\.”

__Closing Statement__:

- “The __goal__ of Adaptive Schools, as described on __page 16__, encourages us to reflect not just on what we do, but on __who we are__ as a group\. Who we believe we are in relation to others and our work shapes everything—our focus, dynamics, and decisions\.”
- “This seminar is about building __capacity__—helping you become more effective collaborators, inquirers, and leaders\. We’ll return to this idea throughout the seminar, and tomorrow we’ll explore the goal in even greater depth\.”

- To offer rationale for why participants are in this seminar
- To visually demonstrate the influence of the first follower and how participants can be leaders by being skillful group members

__HOW?__

After the introduction \(above\), show the video\.

__Suggested Language:__

*Please turn to an elbow partner and share what connections you are making to the goal of this seminar\.*

*As a leader and as a skillful group member, your focus is on:*

- *Developing persistence in finding 1st follower who will commit to following\. What you see as the first follower is actually the sixth person to join the dance\.*
- *Developing resilience\. The people who were taping were initially laughing and calling the dancer the lone nut are wanting to join in at the end of the video\. *

  
*Willingness to take risks and encourage people to move outside their comfort zone*

__TRIPLE TRACK AGENDA__

__Introductory Statement__: “Today, we’re working with what we call a __Triple Track Agenda__\. This agenda is designed to help you apply the strategies we’ll be exploring in multiple settings\.”

__Explain the What__:

- “So, __what__ is the Triple Track Agenda? It’s about using strategies in __three different settings__\.”
- “Track 1 focuses on strategies to support __your learning here in this room__—the experience you’ll have throughout this seminar\.”
- “Track 2 is about applying these strategies with __adult groups__, like colleagues or teams in your workplace\. You’ll also get tips for sharing them with others\.”
- “Track 3 is about bringing these strategies into your __classrooms with students__, adapting them for direct student learning\.”

__Explain the Why__:

- “Why use a Triple Track Agenda? It allows you to __transfer__ the learning across different contexts, ensuring it’s relevant whether you’re working with adults or students\.”
- It also supports your brain in __organizing__ the presentation, helping you see how strategies fit into various parts of your work\.”

__Explain the How__:

- “Now, how do we use this Triple Track Agenda? As we go through each strategy, we’ll discuss how it applies in each of these three tracks\.”
- “You’ll find space to __record strategies__ on page 15 of your Learning Guide, and for additional __note\-taking__ on page 131\.”
- “I encourage you to __capture__ what resonates with you in each of these settings so that you can apply it directly to your work\.”

__Key Points__:

- “When thinking about your learning \(Track 1\), remember that learning is about __breaking old patterns, making new ones, and taking those patterns forward__\.”
- “We’ll record some of these strategies on chart paper as we move through the session, so you’ll have a visual reminder of how they apply\.”
- “For Track 2, with __adult groups__, it’s all about creating and sustaining __high\-functioning teams__\. Think about the adult groups you work with, and how you might use these strategies to foster collaboration and growth\.”
- “In Track 3, we’ll think about how you can transfer these strategies into __classrooms with students__\. Remember, transfer isn’t automatic, so we’ll explore some __practical tips__ to help make that transition smoother\.”

__Closing Statement__:

“As we move through the seminar, we’ll be __pulling aside the curtain__ on strategies\. We’ll not only __harvest__ them, but we’ll also spend time __planning applications__—so you leave with a concrete understanding of how to bring these strategies into your daily work\.”

__Agenda__

__FOUR DAY OVERVIEW__

__20 \- Day 1 – Entering the Territory__

__Suggested Language__: 

- “On Day One, we’ll be __grounding ourselves__ in the foundational ideas of __effective professional learning communities__\. This will be about building connections—both with one another and to the research base that supports our work\. Today is all about understanding how to __build trust__ and __establish norms__ that foster collaboration\.”
- “We’ll also focus on the __theory behind the practice__, exploring how to support adults in having those difficult but necessary conversations in safe and supportive ways\.”

__Day 2 – Developing Identity and Capacity__

__Suggested Language__: 

- “On Day Two, we’ll dive into the __nuts and bolts__ of building effective collaborative groups\. This is where we explore __personal growth__, focusing on how adults can assess and develop their own skills, particularly around the __7 norms of collaboration__\.”
- We’ll go deeper into how to talk about __hard topics__ safely, while building the capacity to lead these kinds of conversations in your own environments\.”

__Day 3 – Transforming Meetings__

__Suggested Language__: 

- “Day Three is all about __transforming meetings__\. Have you ever heard someone say they’d rather go to the dentist than sit through another meeting? We’ve all been there\. But meetings don’t have to be unproductive\.”
- “We’ll explore what separates __frustrating meetings__ from __productive ones__ and how to make sure your group’s time together is meaningful and impactful\.”
- “You’ll learn how to consciously develop your group’s __skills, interactions__, and __growth needs__ to get more done in less time and with greater satisfaction\.”

__Day 4 – Sustaining Community__

__Suggested Language__: 

- “On Day Four, we’ll focus on __sustaining the community__ you’ve built\. How do we keep this work going? We’ll explore how to __engage cognitive conflict__—how to challenge one another’s thinking productively—and then move into __planning__ how to transfer the learning from this workshop into your everyday practice\.”
- 	•	“Our goal is for you to walk away from this seminar with the tools and confidence to __prioritize strategies and skills__ that will benefit both your adult learning groups and your students\.”

__Closing Statement__:

“Throughout these four days, we’ll be balancing __big picture ideas__ with __practical strategies__\. Today, we’re starting with __entering the territory__, exploring what we already know about professional learning communities and how this connects to __helping students learn__\. By the end of this journey, you’ll be ready to take these strategies back to your schools to make a real impact\.”40

__MOST IMPORTANT POINT \(M\.I\.P\.\)__

__Facilitator Notes: M\.I\.P\. \(Most Important Point\) Synthesis Strategy__

__Introductory Statement__: "As we transition to the afternoon portion of our day, let's take a moment to synthesize and consolidate our morning's learning\. We'll use a simple but powerful strategy called M\.I\.P\. or Most Important Point to help organize and prioritize what's resonating most strongly with you\."

__Key Points__:

- "Synthesis is a critical cognitive process that helps move information from short\-term to long\-term memory and makes learning more accessible for future application\."
- "This brief activity will help us bridge our morning work with the new content we'll explore this afternoon, creating connections that strengthen understanding\."

__Expand on the Purpose__:

- "M\.I\.P\. is a synthesis strategy that serves multiple purposes simultaneously\. It helps you identify what you personally find most valuable from our morning's work, reinforces key learning through reflection, and provides me with valuable feedback about what's resonating most strongly with you\."
- "This process of selecting and articulating a 'most important point' requires you to evaluate all the content we've covered and make decisions about relative importance \- a higher\-order thinking process that deepens learning\."
- "Additionally, hearing others' most important points often illuminates aspects you might have missed or considered differently, expanding your own thinking\."

__Provide Clear Directions__:

- "Take a moment to reflect individually on everything we've explored this morning \- from our discussions about research on professional community to our exploration of collaborative structures\."
- "Identify what you consider to be your single most important point or takeaway \- the one idea, concept, or insight that feels most significant to you right now\."
- "Jot this down in 1\-2 sentences, being as specific as possible about why this particular point matters to you or how you might apply it\."
- "After you've written your M\.I\.P\., turn to a partner and each share your most important point, listening for similarities and differences in what you've identified as significant\."

__Facilitate Sharing__ \(if time permits\):

- "Let's hear a few of your most important points\. Would some partnerships be willing to share either similarities or interesting differences in what you identified?"
- \

__7 Norms of CollaborationWHAT? __

*7 Norms of Collaboration*

__WHY? __

__Suggested language:__

·        *Norms of are the “glue”   that hold together the Two Ways of Talking\. They provide a toolkit for promoting   a spirit of inquiry in dialogue and discussion and assist groups in becoming   skillful in both ways of talking\. *

- *When used consistently   and appropriately, they reduce affective conflict\. *
- *The norms provide a   structure for assessing individual and group development\.*

__HOW?__  
Show the Norms on the Ways of Talking graphic from Day 1 in LG and   on the banner__, __and share the WHY\. 

__OPTIONAL__

__WHAT?__

New research on team norms

__WHY?  __

·      Supports the importance of group norms in creating productive teams

·      Is current, provocative research

__HOW?__

__Intro to the NormsWHAT?__

Introduction to  the Norms of Collaboration

__WHY?__

__Suggested language:__

- *Norms comes from   the word “normal\.” These are behaviors most people know how to do, but they   are not habits of behavior in groups\. As they are explicitly named and   practiced they become normative\. That is, they are expected and part of the   way groups work on a normal basis\. *
- *Norms are important   because we want to promote a spirit of   inquiry\. Therefore, I want to pause, I want to paraphrase, I want to inquire*\.

__HOW?__

Differentiate  between Norms and Working Agreements\.

__Suggested language:__

*While Working Agreements vary from group to group, based upon the   needs of group members; Norms of Collaboration are “best practice” across   high performing groups\. The Norms have their origin in the work of:*

- *Peter Senge and  colleagues at Harvard, in their 5thDiscipline Fieldbook work;*
- *Art Costa, and  colleagues Bill Baker and Stan Shallit, in their early work with Habits of  Mind;*
- *Bob Garmston and  Bruce Wellman, as well as Adaptive Schools trainers’ work with collaborative groups around the world*

08:20

10m

__7 Norms Invetory__

__WHAT?__  
 The inventory is a self\-assessment of the Norms\. 

__WHY?__

- Inventory elucidates the details of the Norms
- Inventory develops consciousness about one’s own skills and behaviors

__HOW?__

__Suggested Language:__

*To have a point of reference for you, think of your own behavior in a specific group with which you work\. Using the inventory, rate your own behaviors when you are with that group\.*

Read the directions on the slide describing Strength and Stretch\.

__TABLE GROUP DIALOGUE__

__WHAT?__  


Opportunity to practice dialogue

__WHY?__

Experience dialogue after learning about Two Ways of Talking and Norms of Collaboration\.  

__HOW?__

Table groups: You have thought about your own use of the norms\.  What is becoming clearer about how the norms impact a group in which you work?

__*Suggested Language:*__

*We are not suggesting that you start with all these Norms\. Talk with a community about which norms to start with, talk about “How did we do with the norms?” and ”What are some of the things you noticed that caused you to think that?” *

*Here are some ways to assist groups in developing with these Norms:*

*Go to *__*Learning Guide, pp\. 49\-50*__  
*In pairs, put slashes in different colors on scale\.*

- *The important part of this is the dialogue when we have disparate data\.*
- *Have one person collect data on one of the Norms and group reflects on the data at the end of the meeting\. *

*Group picks one or two as goals\. Example: *

  


*A middle school group never paused\. They made a working agreement that the speaker has the floor until she verbally says, “I’m done\.” We need periodically to have a collective pause\. One person said, “If I stop to think, the group goes on without me\!”*

  


__TRAINERS NOTE:__

  
Show where to access the Norms of Collaboration on the website\.    


08:50

10m

__Pausing__Find a “Fresh   Perspective” partner and be seated\.

__WHAT?__

A norm that is a   hallmark of a group’s reflective listening and responding\.

__WHY?__

Pausing supports the brain as it organizes   thoughts and connects them to prior experience, knowledge and feelings\.  It honors people who have a reflective   style\.

__HOW?__

Connect pausing to the wait time research of  Mary Budd Rowe\. Explain the 4 types, using 10\-2 and referencing the LG page\.

Share strategies  groups can use to pause\.  

__Suggested Language:__

*A superintendent in California uses the “positive pause\.”  Whenever anyone puts an idea on the table,   he asks that everyone pauses for 15 seconds to think about how the idea might  work\. *

*Another strategy is to designate a “pauser” who will signal the   group to pause at designated intervals\. This can also be done by setting a   timer\.*

*A third strategy is to use frozen gesture\. This strategy can be   used by one person in the group to get the whole group to pause\. Let’s   imagine that you are at a meeting and no one is pausing, resulting in a   fast\-paced conversation\. Looking around, you can tell that some people are not   following the conversation\. So you hold up your hand and say, “Please hold   on\. We’re talking about 3 important ideas\.” You hold up 3 fingers on your   hand and talk very slowly, paraphrasing the 3 big ideas\. Then you say something   like, “So what do we want to focus on right now?”*

Optional: *To honor the triple track agenda and give   a classroom example, share the strategy of “Classroom Countdown,” whereby the   teacher says to students, “When I ask a question, hold your response for five   seconds\.” To support kids the teacher holds up a fist, raising one finger at   a time, until the 5 seconds is up\.*

*Then predict which of the 7 Norms is the Neglected One*

__WHAT?__

Paraphrasing for   three different intentions

__WHY?__

__Suggested   Language:__

*For principles\-based   leadership, *__*paraphrasing*__* is a   primary and potent tool\. This session is designed to overcome past negative   biases, build constructively on what people think they know, and present new   visions about the potential of this tool\. Most people believe they know how   to *__*paraphrase*__* and many do, yet   often at a fairly pedestrian level of sophistication\. Because the *__*paraphrase*__* is the single most   influential and generic communication tool, it is helpful to give ourselves permission to learn more   about it, and find ways to help others value it\.*

__HOW?__

__Suggested   Language:__

Ask which norm they predicted\. 

Pause, then reveal Paraphrasing as the neglected norm\.

09:30

10m

__Suggested Language:__ \(Depending on audience members’ responses\):

*We tend to notice poorly crafted *__*paraphrases*__*\.  *

*We tend not to notice well\-crafted *__*paraphrases*__*\.*

*According to Adaptive Schools co\-developer Bruce Wellman, four ways to*  
*annoy people with paraphrasing: Paraphrase too often, too long, parroting and*  
*with the wrong pronoun\.*

  


__*WHAT?*__

__*WHY?*__

*·      *Opportunity to both refresh and extend your understanding of paraphrasing

__Pairs Square__

__WHAT?__

Trainer Input on the three types of paraphrase, using slide and referencing the diagram at the bottom of the LG page\.

__Suggested Language:__

*Perhaps the most familiar form of paraphrasing has the intention of acknowledging what has been said\. This paraphrase reflects the essence of the group’s words\.*

__Suggested   Language:__

*The   first type of paraphrase may be most familiar\. It is an Acknowledging   Paraphrase\. *

Useprompt   on screen\. Allow time for quartet processing, then whole group share\.

Add, if   necessary:

- Pronoun  “you” rather than I
- Focused  on thinking or feeling
- No  long preamble
- Reflect  essence of speaker’s message: *The slide uses a mirror to indicate that  his is reflective listening*

Give  directions to quartets, using slide\. 

__Suggested Language:__

*A second type of paraphrase is called an Organizing Paraphrase\. *

Useprompt on screen\. Allow time for quartet processing, then whole group share\.

Add, if necessary:

- Sorting multiple issues/topics
- Offering containers for ideas
- Often using physical gestures such as counting on fingers or holding out hands

__Suggested Language:__

*The organizing paraphrase holds a different intention\. For a person or group that is overwhelmed, the intention might be to break a large task into smaller increments\. The image of the suitcases suggests that lots of items are being placed in containers so we can carry them\.*

Model delivering a paraphrase on the slide, accompanied by hand gestures to separate two issues\.  


Give   directions to quartets, using slide\. 

09:50

10m

__Abstracting__

__Suggested Language:__

*The third form of paraphrase is Abstracting, which takes the group’s thinking to either a more abstract level\. It has the intention of exploring what is behind the speaker’s words, the goal, belief, value, concept labels, or identity, that informs their thinking and feeling\.*

  


__Suggested Language:__

*Quartets, what are some of the things you are noticing about these examples?*

Allow time for quartets to process, then have whole group share\. Add, if necessary:

*The ladder image comes to us from the classic work in semantics by S\.I\. Hayakawa, Language in Thought and Action\. Using the ladder of abstraction, we can respond on the same rung of the ladder—same level of thinking—as the speaker, as we do in the acknowledging and organizing paraphrases\. We can also invite the speaker to climb the ladder and change the level of thinking by using an abstracting paraphrase\. From the concrete details that are given, we can abstract to a bigger picture\.*

  


__*Suggested Language:*__  


*To be on the same rung of the ladder might be to respond with synonym\. A person says: “My car has broken down, and I don’t know how I am going to get to work\.” A response on the same rung of the ladder might be: “So, you’re having a problem with your automobile\.” While this may reflect what was said, it may not do much beyond that\.*

*With your quartet, listen to this abstracting example, and share with each other what it does to our thinking: “So, there is an issue with transportation\.”*

*After quartets process briefly, add that while the first paraphrase leaves us stuck with a broken car/auto, the abstracting example opens our thinking to alternatives such as public transportation, jogging, bicycling, carpooling, etc\. *

*While we may not use it as much, it is also possible to move down the ladder of abstraction to greater concreteness and detail: “So, you want to get to the Ford dealership\.”*

  


__Suggested Language:__

*An intention for abstracting paraphrases might be to help the speaker shift or re\-frame thinking\. *

__Working Agreements__

__Suggested   Language:__

__*WHAT?*__  
*Adaptive Schools distinguish   between “Norms,” which are the general best practices of all productive   groups and “Working Agreements,“ which are the ad hoc agreements that each   group creates depending on their needs\. For example, “Come on time,” “Silence   cell phones,” and “Demonstrate mutual respect,” are Working Agreements\. *

*Setting working   agreements with participant groups may be contextually driven\. That is, they   are congruent with the group’s purposes and development\. Agreements are also   a way of applying the Norm of Paying Attention to Self and Others\.*

__*WHY? *__

*Creating and posting Working   Agreements honors participant needs, and provides a social lubricant for   productive work\. They also provide psychological safety for talking about   difficult topics\.*

__7 Norms of CollaborationWHAT? __

*7 Norms of Collaboration*

__WHY? __

__Suggested language:__

·        *Norms of are the “glue”   that hold together the Two Ways of Talking\. They provide a toolkit for promoting   a spirit of inquiry in dialogue and discussion and assist groups in becoming   skillful in both ways of talking\. *

- *When used consistently   and appropriately, they reduce affective conflict\. *
- *The norms provide a   structure for assessing individual and group development\.*

__HOW?__

aloud, do a Show, Don’t Say, or a combination\.  


14:25

10m

__Intro to the NormsWHAT?__

Introduction to  the Norms of Collaboration

__WHY?__

__Suggested language:__

- *Norms comes from   the word “normal\.” These are behaviors most people know how to do, but they   are not habits of behavior in groups\. As they are explicitly named and   practiced they become normative\. That is, they are expected and part of the   way groups work on a normal basis\. *
- *Norms are important   because we want to promote a spirit of   inquiry\. Therefore, I want to pause, I want to paraphrase, I want to inquire*\.

__HOW?__

Differentiate  between Norms and Working Agreements\.

__Suggested language:__

*While Working Agreements vary from group to group, based upon the   needs of group members; Norms of Collaboration are “best practice” across   high performing groups\. The Norms have their origin in the work of:*

- *Peter Senge and  colleagues at Harvard, in their 5thDiscipline Fieldbook work;*
- *Art Costa, and  colleagues Bill Baker and Stan Shallit, in their early work with Habits of  Mind;*
- *Bob Garmston and  Bruce Wellman, as well as Adaptive Schools trainers’ work with collaborative groups around the world*

14:35

10m

__7 Norms Invetory__

__WHAT?__  
 The inventory is a self\-assessment of the Norms\. 

__WHY?__

- Inventory elucidates the details of the Norms
- Inventory develops consciousness about one’s own skills and behaviors

__HOW?__

__Suggested Language:__

*To have a point of reference for you, think of your own behavior in a specific group with which you work\. Using the inventory, rate your own behaviors when you are with that group\.*

__TABLE GROUP DIALOGUE__

__WHAT?__  


Opportunity to practice dialogue

__WHY?__

Experience dialogue after learning about Two Ways of Talking and Norms of Collaboration\.  

__HOW?__

Table groups: You have thought about your own use of the norms\.  What is becoming clearer about how the norms impact a group in which you work?

__*Suggested Language:*__

*We are not suggesting that you start with all these Norms\. Talk with a community about which norms to start with, talk about “How did we do with the norms?” and ”What are some of the things you noticed that caused you to think that?” *

*Here are some ways to assist groups in developing with these Norms:*

*Go to *__*Learning Guide, pp\. 49\-50*__  
*In pairs, put slashes in different colors on scale\.*

- *The important part of this is the dialogue when we have disparate data\.*
- *Have one person collect data on one of the Norms and group reflects on the data at the end of the meeting\. *

*Group picks one or two as goals\. Example: *

  


*A middle school group never paused\. They made a working agreement that the speaker has the floor until she verbally says, “I’m done\.” We need periodically to have a collective pause\. One person said, “If I stop to think, the group goes on without me\!”*

  


__TRAINERS NOTE:__

  
Show where to access the Norms of Collaboration on the website\.    


15:05

10m

__Pausing__Find a “Fresh   Perspective” partner and be seated\.

__WHAT?__

A norm that is a   hallmark of a group’s reflective listening and responding\.

__WHY?__

Pausing supports the brain as it organizes   thoughts and connects them to prior experience, knowledge and feelings\.  It honors people who have a reflective   style\.

__HOW?__

Connect pausing to the wait time research of  Mary Budd Rowe\. Explain the 4 types, using 10\-2 and referencing the LG page\.

Share strategies  groups can use to pause\.  

__Suggested Language:__

*A superintendent in California uses the “positive pause\.”  Whenever anyone puts an idea on the table,   he asks that everyone pauses for 15 seconds to think about how the idea might  work\. *

*Another strategy is to designate a “pauser” who will signal the   group to pause at designated intervals\. This can also be done by setting a   timer\.*

*A third strategy is to use frozen gesture\. This strategy can be   used by one person in the group to get the whole group to pause\. Let’s   imagine that you are at a meeting and no one is pausing, resulting in a   fast\-paced conversation\. Looking around, you can tell that some people are not   following the conversation\. So you hold up your hand and say, “Please hold   on\. We’re talking about 3 important ideas\.” You hold up 3 fingers on your   hand and talk very slowly, paraphrasing the 3 big ideas\. Then you say something   like, “So what do we want to focus on right now?”*

Optional: *To honor the triple track agenda and give   a classroom example, share the strategy of “Classroom Countdown,” whereby the   teacher says to students, “When I ask a question, hold your response for five   seconds\.” To support kids the teacher holds up a fist, raising one finger at   a time, until the 5 seconds is up\.*

*Then predict which of the 7 Norms is the Neglected One*

__WHAT?__

Paraphrasing for   three different intentions

__WHY?__

__Suggested   Language:__

*For principles\-based   leadership, *__*paraphrasing*__* is a   primary and potent tool\. This session is designed to overcome past negative   biases, build constructively on what people think they know, and present new   visions about the potential of this tool\. Most people believe they know how   to *__*paraphrase*__* and many do, yet   often at a fairly pedestrian level of sophistication\. Because the *__*paraphrase*__* is the single most   influential and generic communication tool, it is helpful to give ourselves permission to learn more   about it, and find ways to help others value it\.*

*A second type of paraphrase is called an Organizing Paraphrase\. *

Useprompt on screen\. Allow time for quartet processing, then whole group share\.

Add, if necessary:

- Sorting multiple issues/topics
- Offering containers for ideas
- Often using physical gestures such as counting on fingers or holding out hands

__Suggested Language:__

*The organizing paraphrase holds a different intention\. For a person or group that is overwhelmed, the intention might be to break a large task into smaller increments\. The image of the suitcases suggests that lots of items are being placed in containers so we can carry them\.*

Model delivering a paraphrase on the slide, accompanied by hand gestures to separate two issues\.  


Give   directions to quartets, using slide\. 

16:05

10m

__Abstracting__

__Suggested Language:__

*The third form of paraphrase is Abstracting, which takes the group’s thinking to either a more abstract level\. It has the intention of exploring what is behind the speaker’s words, the goal, belief, value, concept labels, or identity, that informs their thinking and feeling\.*

  


__Suggested Language:__

*Quartets, what are some of the things you are noticing about these examples?*

Allow time for quartets to process, then have whole group share\. Add, if necessary:

*The ladder image comes to us from the classic work in semantics by S\.I\. Hayakawa, Language in Thought and Action\. Using the ladder of abstraction, we can respond on the same rung of the ladder—same level of thinking—as the speaker, as we do in the acknowledging and organizing paraphrases\. We can also invite the speaker to climb the ladder and change the level of thinking by using an abstracting paraphrase\. From the concrete details that are given, we can abstract to a bigger picture\.*

  


__*Suggested Language:*__  


*To be on the same rung of the ladder might be to respond with synonym\. A person says: “My car has broken down, and I don’t know how I am going to get to work\.” A response on the same rung of the ladder might be: “So, you’re having a problem with your automobile\.” While this may reflect what was said, it may not do much beyond that\.*

*With your quartet, listen to this abstracting example, and share with each other what it does to our thinking: “So, there is an issue with transportation\.”*

*After quartets process briefly, add that while the first paraphrase leaves us stuck with a broken car/auto, the abstracting example opens our thinking to alternatives such as public transportation, jogging, bicycling, carpooling, etc\. *

*While we may not use it as much, it is also possible to move down the ladder of abstraction to greater concreteness and detail: “So, you want to get to the Ford dealership\.”*

  


__Suggested Language:__

*An intention for abstracting paraphrases might be to help the speaker shift or re\-frame thinking\. *

Audience Connect

__WHAT?__  
Audience   Connect allows the presenter to develop rapport and relationship, as well as   establishing credibility\. 

__WHY? __

The   trainer needs to make a connection to the world of the audience and share a   purpose for the work\. 

__HOW? __

__Suggested Language: __

·       *How   many of you have been in a meeting since last time?*

·       *How   many of you were in a meeting that went well? *

*·        How many of you ran that   meeting?*

*·        How many of you were in a meeting   that was not so productive?*

*·        How many of your ran THAT   meeting? *

*Our work today is largely   about meetings\. We think that you can plan a meeting so that others will look   forward to attending\. We know that groups develop when the group leaders see   them as they could be, not as they are\. Today we are going to focus on   meetings in which the maximum amount of work is accomplished, in the minimum   amount of time, with maximum group member satisfaction\. *
