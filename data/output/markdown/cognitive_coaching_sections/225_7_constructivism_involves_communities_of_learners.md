## 7. Constructivism Involves Communities of Learners

Constructivist learning is a reciprocal process of the individual's influence on the group and the group's influence on the individual. Meaning making is not only an individual operation. The individual also constructs meaning interactively with others to construct shared knowledge. Meaning making may be an individual experience-one's unique way of constructing knowledge-and it is a sociocultural phenomenon. Social processes of interaction and participation enhance, refine, and amplify meanings. An empowering way to change conceptions is to present one's own ideas to others, as well as being permitted to hear and reflect on the ideas of others. The benefit of discourse with others, particularly with peers, activates the meaning-making process (Willis 2013). The constructivist environment encourages questioning of each other, rich dialogue within and among groups and teams of learners, resolving differences in perceptions and styles, and synthesizing alternative viewpoints (Vygotsky 1978).
