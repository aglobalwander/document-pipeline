AP Equity and Access Policy
College Board strongly encourages educators to make equitable access a guiding
principle for their AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared
students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination
of barriers that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and
socioeconomic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented. Schools
should make every effort to ensure their AP classes reflect the diversity of their
student population. College Board also believes that all students should have
access to academically challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes,
which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to
equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.

About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills
that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking AP
courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and AP
Exams are developed and scored by college faculty and
experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges and
universities in the United States grant credit, advanced placement, or both on the basis of successful AP
Exam scores—more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the content
and skills that are the focus of the corresponding
college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also
organizes the content and skills into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many AP teachers have
told us they follow in order to focus their instruction.
The intention of this publication is to respect teachers’
time and expertise by providing a roadmap that they
can modify and adapt to their local priorities and
preferences. Moreover, by organizing the AP course
content and skills into units, the AP Program is able
to provide teachers and students with free formative assessments—Personal Progress Checks—that
teachers can assign throughout the year to measure
student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students:
Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically challenging coursework before they enroll in AP
classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is
only through a commitment to equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses:
The AP Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP
courses must participate in the AP Course Audit, a
process through which AP teachers’ course materials
are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.
﻿ V.1 | 1
AP Human Geography Course and Exam Description

=== Page 9 ===
Return to Table of Contents © 2020 College Board
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the AP teacher
and the school principal (or designated administrator) to
confirm awareness and understanding of the curricular
and resource requirements. A syllabus or course outline,
detailing how course requirements are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and course
offerings of colleges and universities. Using this research
and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP
teachers work within the scope of the corresponding
college course to articulate what students should know
and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course.
The resulting course framework is the heart of this course
and exam description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The AP
Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor; all
AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision, piloting,
and analysis to ensure that questions are accurate, fair,
and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development, College
Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher education
institutions. This feedback is carefully considered to
ensure that AP courses and exams are able to provide
students with a college-level learning experience and
the opportunity to demonstrate their qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam development process, relies on the expertise of
both AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple choice questions are scored by machine, the free response questions and through-course performance
assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands
of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are
scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion
is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained,
and their work is monitored throughout the Reading
for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief
Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers
in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of
the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a curve.
Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which means that
every student who meets the criteria for an AP score of
2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no matter how many
students that is. The criteria for the number of points
students must earn on the AP Exam to receive scores of
3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently validates for credit and placement purposes—include:
§§ The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
§§ The number of points researchers have found to
be predictive that an AP student will succeed when
placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
§§ Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP
teachers in the development of the course and exam and
throughout the scoring process ensures that AP Exam
scores accurately represent students’ achievement in the
equivalent college course. Frequent and regular research
studies establish the validity of AP scores as follows:

While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and
universities. To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/ placement policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/creditpolicies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for
seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score
the free-response sections of the AP Exams. Ninety eight percent of surveyed educators who took part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an AP
Reader, including opportunities to:
§§ Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
§§ Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP
scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure to the quality and depth of the responses from the
entire pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
§§ Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
§§ Score from home: AP Readers have online distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects. Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
§§ Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs): AP
Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide suggests a
sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds skill instruction across units, organizes content
into topics, and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course topics and skills, create
customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.
* To report misuses, please call, 877-274-6474 (International: +1-212-632-1781).

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
§§ Teachers and students sign in to, or create, their College Board accounts.
§§ Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
§§ Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on whom the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
§§ Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP coordinator.
§§ Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and AP coordinators
to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following additional benefits:
§§ Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
§§ Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
§§ Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student
pack. The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
§§ Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

Model
Integrating AP resources throughout the course can help students develop skills and
conceptual understandings. The instructional model outlined below shows possible ways to incorporate AP resources into the classroom.
Plan
Teachers may consider the following approaches as they plan their instruction before teaching each unit.
§§ Review the overview at the start of each unit guide to identify essential questions,
conceptual understandings, and skills for each unit.
§§ Use the Unit at a Glance table to identify related topics that build toward a common
understanding, and then plan appropriate pacing for students.
§§ Identify useful strategies in the Instructional Approaches section to help teach the concepts and skills.
Teach
When teaching, supporting resources could be used to build students’ conceptual understanding and their mastery of skills.
§§ Use the topic pages in the unit guides to identify the required content.
§§ Integrate the content with a skill, considering any appropriate scaffolding.
§§ Employ any of the instructional strategies previously identified.
§§ Use the available resources on the topic pages to bring a variety of assets into the classroom.
Assess
Teachers can measure student understanding of the content and skills covered in the unit and provide actionable feedback to students.
§§ At the end of each unit, use AP Classroom to assign students the online Personal
Progress Checks, as homework or an in-class task.
§§ Provide question-level feedback to students through answer rationales; provide unit- and
skill-level feedback using the progress dashboard.
§§ Create additional practice opportunities using the AP Question Bank and assign them through AP Classroom.

Introduction
AP Human Geography introduces high school students to college-level introductory human geography or cultural geography. The content is presented
thematically rather than regionally and is organized around the discipline’s main subfields: economic
geography, cultural geography, political geography, and
urban geography. The approach is spatial and problem
oriented. Case studies are drawn from all world regions, with an emphasis on understanding the world in
which we live today. Historical information serves to
enrich analysis of the impacts of phenomena such as globalization, colonialism, and human–environment
relationships on places, regions, cultural landscapes, and patterns of interaction.
Specific topics with which students engage include
the following:
§§ problems of economic development and cultural change §§ consequences of population growth, changing fertility rates, and international migration §§ impacts of technological innovation on transportation, communication, industrialization, and other aspects of human life §§ struggles over political power and control of territory
§§ conflicts over the demands of ethnic minorities,
the role of women in society, and the inequalities between developed and developing economies §§ explanations of why location matters to agricultural land use, industrial development, and urban problems §§ the role of climate change and environmental abuses in shaping the human landscapes on Earth
The goal for the course is for students to become more geoliterate, more engaged in contemporary
global issues, and more informed about multicultural
viewpoints. They will develop skills in approaching
problems geographically, using maps and geospatial
technologies, thinking critically about texts and graphic
images, interpreting cultural landscapes, and applying
geographic concepts such as scale, region, diffusion,
interdependence, and spatial interaction, among others.
Students will see geography as a discipline relevant
to the world in which they live; as a source of ideas for
identifying, clarifying, and solving problems at various scales; and as a key component of building global citizenship and environmental stewardship.

Course
Content
Based on the Understanding by Design® (Wiggins and McTighe) model, this
course framework provides a clear and detailed description of the course
requirements necessary for student success. The framework specifies what
students must know, understand, and be able to do, with a focus on big ideas
that encompass core principles, theories, and processes of the discipline. The
framework also encourages instruction that prepares students for advanced
geography coursework and active global citizenship.
Big Ideas
The big ideas serve as the foundation of the course and enable students to
create meaningful connections among course concepts. Often, these big ideas
are abstract concepts or themes that become threads that run throughout the
course. Revisiting the big ideas and applying them in a variety of contexts allow
students to develop a deeper conceptual understanding. Below are the big ideas of the course and a brief description of each.
2
BIG IDEA 1: PATTERNS AND SPATIAL ORGANIZATION (PSO)
Spatial patterns and organization of human society are arranged according
to political, historical, cultural, and economic factors.
BIG IDEA 2: IMPACTS AND INTERACTIONS (IMP)
Complex relationships of cause and effect exist among people, their
environments, and historical and contemporary actions.
BIG IDEA 3: SPATIAL PROCESS AND SOCIETAL CHANGE (SPS)
A spatial perspective allows for a focus on the ways phenomena are related
to one another in particular places, which in turn allows for the examination
of human organization and its environmental consequences.

UNITS
The course content is organized into commonly
taught units. The units have been arranged in a logical sequence frequently found in many college courses and textbooks.
The seven units in AP Human Geography, and their weightings on the multiple-choice section of the
AP Exam, are listed below.
Pacing recommendations at the unit level and in the
Course at Glance tables provide suggestions for how
the required course content can be taught and how the
Personal Progress Checks can be administered. The
suggested class periods are based on a schedule in
which the class meets five days a week for 45 minutes each day. While these recommendations have been
made to aid in your planning, you are free to adjust the
pacing based on the needs of your students, alternate
schedules (e.g., block scheduling), or your school’s academic calendar.
TOPICS
Each unit is broken down into teachable segments
called topics. The topic pages (starting on page 30)
contain all required content for each topic. Although
most topics can be taught in one or two class periods,
you are again encouraged to pace your course to suit the needs of your students and school.

Developed with extensive input from the community of AP Human
Geography educators, these unit guides offer teachers helpful guidance
in building students’ skills and knowledge. The suggested sequence was
identified through a thorough analysis of the syllabi of highly effective AP
teachers and the organization of typical college textbooks.
This unit structure respects new AP teachers’ time by providing one
possible sequence they can adopt or modify, rather than having to build
from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units enable the AP
Program to provide interested teachers with formative assessments—the
Personal Progress Checks—that they can assign their students at the
end of each unit to gauge progress toward success on the AP exam.
However, experienced AP teachers who are satisfied with their current
course organization and exam results should feel no pressure to adopt
these units, which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

UNIT 1
Developing Understanding
This first unit sets the foundation for the course by teaching students
how geographers approach the study of places. Students are
encouraged to reflect on the “why of where” to better understand
geographic perspectives. Many other high school courses ask
students to read and analyze data, but for this course, students also
apply a spatial perspective when reading and analyzing qualitative and quantitative data.
Students learn the ways information from data sources such as
maps, tables, charts, satellite images, and infographics informs policy
decisions such as voting redistricting or expanding transportation
networks. They also learn about how people influence and are
influenced by their environment; the resulting impact on topography,
natural resources, and climate; and the differences between and
consequences of environmental determinism and possibilism.
Finally, students are introduced to the language of geography,
learning discipline-specific terminology and applying that language
to contemporary, real-world scenarios so they can better study
population processes and patterns in the next unit.

Critique Reasoning
Using the two major schools of thought regarding human–environmental
interaction—environmental determinism and possibilism—have students identify
the claims of each, explain the reasoning behind each, and find current real-world
examples supporting and/or refuting each. Allow for collaborative discussion at
multiple levels—pairs, small groups, and whole group—to achieve understanding.

Debriefing
Scales of analysis is a challenging topic for students. They tend to struggle with
understanding the significance of examining issues at multiple scales. For complex
issues, leading a facilitated discussion of data that illustrate scale concepts can help
solidify and deepen understanding of content. For example, you can take a set of data
and show what the global patterns are, zoom in to illustrate the national level, then
zoom in again to show the difference in the local level analysis. Finish by leading a
discussion on the significance of the differences in patterns.

UNIT 2
Developing Understanding
This unit addresses the patterns associated with human populations.
Populations may increase or decrease as a result of a combination of
natural changes (births and deaths) and migration patterns (emigration
and immigration). Students examine population distributions at
different scales—local, national, regional, and global. Population
pyramids demonstrate age-sex structures, revealing the growth or
decline of generations and allowing geographers to predict economic needs based on reproductive and aging patterns.
Students learn about factors that influence changes in population
as well as the long- and short-term effects of those population
changes on a place’s economy, culture, and politics. For example,
environmental degradation and natural hazards may prompt
population redistribution at various scales, which in turn creates
new pressures on the environment and on cultural, economic, and
political institutions. The study of migration patterns allows students
to examine factors contributing to voluntary and forced relocation and
the impact of these migrating populations on existing settlements.
Combined, the concepts and theories encountered in this unit
help students develop connections and transfer their learning in
upcoming units to course topics such as cultural patterns, the political
organization of space, food production issues, natural resource use, and urban systems.

UNIT 2
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 2.3
Create Representations
Although population pyramids are most often used to illustrate the population
composition of countries, they may also be used to illustrate the age-sex population
of subnational units. Provide students with scenarios regarding the characteristics of
different subnational units. Then have the students draw a population pyramid based on the scenarios and explain their thinking.
2 2.5
Making Connections
Give students this list of terms: crude birth rate, crude death rate, rate of natural increase,
and total population. Allow students a few minutes to gather and recall information about
the terms or concepts and then pair students to discuss how the relationships among
the terms are represented in the demographic transition model. Then, ask students
to take different population pyramids and place them at the appropriate stage of the
demographic transition model. Have them justify their choice of stage.
3 2.12
Jigsaw
Assign students different countries, some with negative net migration rates and
others with positive net migration rates, and have them use a variety of resources
to examine the effects of migration on their assigned country. Then, create two
groups—one with countries with positive net migration rates and one with countries
with negative net migration rates—and have them discuss and compile information
gathered on migration effects. Lastly, create groups with mixed positive and negative
net migration rate countries and have students summarize and present information on the impacts for these different countries.

UNIT 3
Developing Understanding
The main focus of this unit is on cultural patterns and processes that
create recognized cultural identities.  Students consider the physical
environment to determine the effects of geographical location
and available resources on cultural practices. Visuals representing
artifacts, mentifacts and sociofacts all shed light on cultural
landscapes and how they change over time. Practice in analyzing
images of different places at different times for evidence of their
ethnicity, language, religion, gender roles and attitudes, and other
cultural attributes builds students’ understanding of cultural patterns and processes.
This unit also considers from a temporal and spatial perspective
how culture spreads, through traditional forces such as colonialism
and imperialism and through contemporary influences such as
social media. Rather than emphasize the details of cultural practices
associated with specific languages and religions, this unit instead
focuses on the distribution of cultural practices and on the causes
and effects of their diffusion. For example, students might study the
distribution of Chinese versus English languages or the diffusion
patterns of religions such as Hinduism and Islam, at local, national, or global scales.
An understanding of the diffusion of cultural practices provides a
foundation for the study of political patterns and processes in the next unit.

Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 3.2
Discussion Group
Arrange students into small groups (4–6 students per group is recommended) and
have them analyze a set of images from a place. Have groups look for evidence of
different languages, religions, and ethnicities in the landscape. If students are not
accustomed to “reading” images, you may first want to demonstrate reading the
cultural landscape with a set of images from the community surrounding the school
and walk students through the analytical process as a whole class. If student groups
are given different places to analyze, you may ask each group to share with the rest of the class.
2 3.3
Look for a Pattern
Using different data sets, have students analyze regional patterns associated with
religions and languages. Have students hypothesize as to the reasons behind the
existence of the patterns they identify along with the consequences of the observed
patterns. Students will confirm or alter their reasons and consequences as they progress
through the unit. They can also reflect back on Topic 3.2 and predict how the cultural landscape would reflect the identified patterns.
3 3.6
Fishbowl
Using secondary sources about the current spread of different phenomena and the
process of globalization, ask students to discuss how we became so connected
globally. The inner group models discussion while the outer group listens, responds,
and evaluates. Then the groups switch roles. You might also ask students to reflect
back on Topic 3.5 and explain why the historical causes of diffusion have changed.

UNIT 4
Developing Understanding
This unit addresses the political organization of the world. Building on
knowledge of populations and cultural patterns learned in previous
units, students examine the contemporary political map and the
impact of territoriality on political power and on issues of identity
for peoples. Students also look at the different types of political
boundaries, how they function, and their scale, as they consider both
internal and international boundaries. The interplay of political and
cultural influences may cause tensions over boundaries to arise, such
as sovereign states making claims on what other states consider to be international waters.
Students also examine forms of government and how forces
such as devolution may alter the functioning of political units and
cause changes to established political boundaries. Separatist
and independence movements that challenge the sovereignty of
political states may arise from economic and nationalistic forces,
as seen in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Spain. The influence of
supranational organizations such as the United Nations or European
Union and their role in global affairs presents another challenge to
nationalist sovereignty. Student understanding of cultural patterns and
processes helps inform their understanding of the consequences of centrifugal and centripetal forces.

Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 4.6
Think-Pair-Share
Have students individually think through the question, How can the way voting
district boundaries are drawn impact election outcomes? Then have students gather
evidence/examples to refine and/or support their thoughts. Students can then
discuss their response with a peer. A whole-class discussion can follow focused on
the issue of scale and how, due to internal political boundaries, it can appear that a
subnational unit is in support of one candidate or party when in fact changing the
scale may reveal variation in candidate or party loyalties.
2 4.8
Guided Discussion
This umbrella strategy allows a teacher to use multiple techniques with students in a
lesson. For this topic, use brainstorming and quickwrite as strategies to help students
understand how division of groups by physical geography, ethnic separatism, ethnic
cleansing, terrorism, economic and social problems, and irredentism may prompt devolutionary movements in a state.
3 4.10
Graphic Organizer
Students should use a cause-and-effect graphic organizer to learn about the differing
potential results of centrifugal and centripetal forces. Once students have identified
the consequences of each, you can then ask them to look for contemporary
examples of the consequences, which may be negative or positive. Ask students to
discuss how different groups might have different interpretations of the nature of the
consequences. For example, the breakup of a state will be viewed negatively by the
formal state government but positively by separatists.

UNIT 5
Developing Understanding
This unit examines the origins of agriculture and its subsequent
diffusion. Students learn about the ways agricultural practices have
changed over time as a result of technological innovations, such as
equipment mechanization and improvements in transportation that
create global markets. In addition, they examine the consequences
of agricultural practices such as the use of high-yield seeds and
chemicals, revisiting the human–environmental relationships studied in Unit 1.
Course emphasis on spatial patterns is evident in this unit as
students consider the differences in what foods or resources are
produced and where they are produced. These agricultural production
regions are impacted by economic and technological forces that
increase the size of agricultural operations and the carrying capacity
of the land. This has in turn created a global system of agriculture
and the interdependence of regions of agricultural consumption and production.
Student understanding of this global system of agriculture based
on government cooperation lays the foundation for a deeper
understanding of economic development in the final unit of the course.

UNIT 6
Developing Understanding
Unit 6 addresses the origins and influences, particularly site and
situation, of urban settlements as students explore cities across
the world and the role of those cities in globalization. They examine
the spatial distribution of the world’s largest cities, comparing
them across regions and analyzing patterns of connectivity and
accessibility.  Within cities, students identify patterns of development
and make inferences about their economic and political influences at
regional, national, and international levels of scale. Students examine
the hierarchy of urban settlements on the landscape, applying the
rank-size rule and central place theory at regional and national scales
to evaluate mobility patterns and economic and political relationships.
Statistics such as census data are used to reveal the challenges
of urban places, including density, sprawl, demands of infrastructure, and mobility.
Students examine patterns of change over time and modern
challenges to sustainability from urban growth. On both local
and global scales, they look at the ways that cities are improving
sustainability through new approaches to growth, such as mixed-land use zoning, smart growth policies, and public transportation–oriented development at local and international scales.
This unit reinforces what students learned in the units on politics and
culture as they consider the role cities play as key centers of global
markets, culture, and politics and contrast the roles of urban and rural areas.

Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 6.5
Discussion Groups
Small groups of students can engage in discussions about the similarities and
differences of different urban models, along with reasons behind those similarities
and differences. A graphic organizer might help students organize their thoughts.
Then, as a class, students should explore the limitations of the urban models in predicting the internal structure of cities.
2 6.9
Fishbowl
Divide the class in half, with one group gathering quantitative data on urban areas and
the other gathering qualitative data. Depending on the size of the class you may wish to
have data focusing on one city or several cities. Have them take turns being in the inner
circle, leading the discussion and bringing evidence to support their opinions, and being
in the outer circle, listening, responding, and evaluating. After students have participated
in both the inner and outer circles, you can lead a whole-class discussion on the
differences between and the importance of both qualitative and quantitative data.
3 6.10
Debate
A debate gives students the opportunity to collect evidence in support of their
position and then orally present and defend it. Be sure to direct students to uncover
both the affirming and contradictory evidence toward their position. For this
topic, you could have students debate the pros and cons of gentrification or how
governments should address squatter settlements—but it is important for students
to recognize that these issues are more complex than a simple pro or con.

UNIT 7
Developing Understanding
This unit addresses the origins and influences of industrial
development, along with the role industrialization plays in economic
development and globalization. Concepts learned in the political
unit, such as territoriality, help students build an understanding of
the measures of social and economic development and to explain
development theories, such as dependency theory and Rostow’s
Stages of Economic Growth. The theories they explore are in turn
useful in explaining spatial variations in development such as core periphery relationships.
Students examine contemporary spatial patterns of industrialization
and the resulting geography of uneven development—for example,
the differences between urban and rural China or Brazil. They explore
changes to places resulting from the growth or loss of industry
and the role of industry in the world economy.  Measurements of
development provide the quantitative data to analyze the spatial
relationships of the global market.  Statistics and spatial data reveal
the impact of development on individual populations, including
the role of women in the labor market. Students explore strategies
for sustainable development focused on women, children, health,
education, the environment, and global cooperation.
This final unit of the course pulls together those aspects of human
geography learned in previous units to help students develop a more
complete understanding of local and global geographic patterns and processes and of possibilities for the future.

Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 7.3
Look for a Pattern
Using maps of different measures of development—both social and economic—
have students analyze the patterns present. Have students compare the different
measures to see which patterns are similar across multiple measures and the
advantages of using multiple measures when addressing levels of development.
You may want students to extend the depth of their thinking by having them reflect
on what they have learned throughout the course to first predict what patterns of
development will be present before they look at the maps.
2 7.5
Graphic Organizer
Students use a Venn diagram graphic organizer to compare and contrast different
theories of development, such as Rostow’s Stages of Economic Growth, Wallerstein’s
World System theory, dependency theory, and commodity dependence. You may
then have students discuss how different countries are classified according to the different theories.
3 7.8
Self/Peer Review
Students are asked to read the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals.
After reading the goals, students select the one goal they believe is the most
important to achieve, and then justify their response in writing with evidence and
reasoning. Students then pass their paper to a peer, who can respond to their piece
with challenging questions regarding the choice of goal and with evidence that may contradict the first student’s position.

Selecting and Using Course Materials
Using a wide array of source materials will help students become proficient with the
course skills and develop a conceptual understanding of geography as a field of inquiry.
In addition to using a college-level textbook that will provide required course content,
it’s a good idea to provide regular opportunities for students to examine primary and
secondary source material in various forms, including graphic content (maps, graphs,
charts, photographs), since many geographic concepts are presented spatially in
such formats. Using rich, diverse source materials encourages students to engage in
learning about the world they live in and develop the habits of thinking like a geographer
that are essential for student success in the course.
Textbooks
The textbook used for this course should be written at the level of an introductory
college course. Because skills are fundamental to the teaching of the course, a
textbook that focuses on skill instruction would be a plus.
Although nearly all college-level human geography textbooks address the seven units of
the AP Human Geography course, no single textbook covers the complete curriculum as
described in the framework. It is helpful to obtain and consult multiple textbooks for the
introductory human geography course; doing so allows you to better address curricular
gaps in the textbook you choose for the AP Human Geography course. College-level
human geography textbooks organize content in various ways; if you are following the
unit structure of the course framework, you might need to teach the textbook chapters
out of order. Ultimately, it is best to select a textbook that closely aligns with the course framework and the course skills.
On the AP Central Course Audit page for this course, you’ll find an example textbook
list of college-level textbooks that meet the resource requirements.
TEXT-BASED QUALITATIVE SOURCES
(PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SOURCES)
Students in this AP course are required to analyze primary and secondary source
material in order to deepen their understanding of the key concepts addressed by the
textbook and to practice the required course skills.
Student success in college also depends on exposure to and analysis of multiple
secondary sources in which geographers present and explain their arguments. For
secondary sources, share with your students editorials, journal articles, news media
articles, and essays and books by geographers, choosing a variety of sources that
represent different points of view and that will engage students while enhancing
learning. You can add new articles to keep up with rapidly changing events.

QUANTITATIVE SOURCES
Geography courses require students to engage with data in a variety of ways. The
analysis, interpretation, and application of quantitative information are vital skills for
students in AP Human Geography. New textbooks and publishers’ resources often
contain quantitative information presented via charts, graphs, or other infographics,
but those data can quickly become out of date. Research institutions such as the
Pew Research Center are good resources for current data with which to practice quantitative skills with students.
VISUAL SOURCES
Students will encounter a variety of visual sources on the AP Human Geography Exam.
Some visuals contain data, such as a chart showing aging population by country
across time periods. Other visuals may illustrate geographic principles, processes,
or behaviors, such as topographical maps that demonstrate differences in scale. It is
important to give students practice with a wide variety of visual sources in addition to
those maps or cartoons in their textbook. The following resources provide a wealth of
visuals to choose from for bell-ringer exercises and skills practice.
§§ The National Geologic Map Database is a national archive of standardized maps.
§§ Gapminder is a “fact tank” that offers free teaching resources based on statistics
culled from universities, the United Nations, and non-governmental organizations.
§§ Worldmapper is a collection of world maps called cartograms, on which the size of
different areas is scaled in proportion to a particular variable.

Evaluating the Quality and Credibility of Different
Sources and Perspectives
Students have unprecedented access to information, so it is more important than ever
to help them determine the credibility of sources. The course skills require students to
evaluate the quality and credibility of different information sources and perspectives
and derive supportable conclusions. Consider providing students with a list of news media websites that offer different perspectives.
The table below explains how the credibility and/or reliability of various sources might be addressed.
Criteria
Considerations
Examples and Illustrations
Credibility §§ Credibility requires students to obtain information from sources with knowledge and expertise in human geography. Sources can be print, online, or expert interviews.
§§ Because many students are using the internet or database sources, they should consider the following:
◆ ◆The domain name extensions, which indicate who publishes and owns the domain ◆ ◆The author(s) of the website ◆ ◆The credibility of sources cited in the materials as well as any websites they link to §§ Commonly used extensions include:
◆ ◆.edu (educational organization);
◆ ◆.com (company);
◆ ◆.org (any organization);
◆ ◆.gov (government agency);
◆ ◆.net (network) §§ Read past the first slash in the domain name to see if the page might be someone’s personal page. A personal page might be less credible or biased.
§§ Investigate who the authors are, their credentials, and the organization(s) they are associated with to determine how the information should be viewed.
§§ An article that includes citations of sources is often more credible.
§§ Design a lesson to help students identify examples of cultural relativism and ethnocentrism by comparing the perspectives of various sources.
§§ Have students examine the language used in the lead stories, as well as the pictures that accompany them.
§§ Ask students to compare the focus of various sources, such as news accounts or scholarly articles, and how characteristics, attitudes, and traits influence the study of culture.
§§ Have students synthesize their findings in a short paper examining  how cultural traits vary across societies.

Reliability and Relevance §§ Students should examine the content of a source (the evidence) to ensure it supports their claims and provides insight and knowledge that relates to the topic. This means that evidence is only relevant when it addresses both the topic in context and the student’s argument.
§§ Because we are investigating geographical processes and outcomes that are changing and evolving, it is important to consider whether the information being provided is the most  current.
§§ A biographical article about the life of Thomas
Malthus may not be relevant in supporting a claim about a particular alternative viewpoint on effects of population increase.
§§ A country case study from 2000 might not be relevant in 2018.

Instructional Strategies
The AP Human Geography course framework outlines the concepts and skills students
must master in order to be successful on the AP Exam. You can help students develop
mastery of the course skills by engaging them in learning activities that allow them to
apply their understanding of course concepts. The following strategies, organized in
alphabetical order, might help you to plan your instruction.
Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Create
Representations
Students create tables, graphs, or other infographics to interpret text or data.
Helps students organize information using multiple ways to present data.
Give students a set of data, such as socioeconomic status and ethnicity in megacities, and have them create a graph that best shows the data and the trends.
Critique
Reasoning
Through collaborative discussion, students critique the arguments of others, questioning the author’s perspective, evidence presented, and reasoning behind the argument.
Helps students learn from others as they make connections between concepts and learn to support their arguments with evidence and reasoning that make sense to peers.
Have students critique an argument from a secondary source. Ask students to examine the author’s perspective and the evidence and reasoning he or she uses to support that position.
Close Reading
Reading, rereading, and analyzing small chunks of text word for word, sentence by sentence, and line by line.
Develops comprehensive understanding of text.
When students are reading primary or secondary sources, such as the National Geographic article “Unique Speak,” have them highlight relevant words and passages that support the author’s claim. Ask students to connect the key concepts of the article to the big ideas in Unit 3:
Cultural Patterns and Processes.
Debate
Presenting an informal or formal argument that defends a claim with reasons, while others defend different claims about the same topic or issue. The goal is to debate ideas without attacking the people who defend those ideas.
Gives students an opportunity to collect and orally present evidence supporting the arguments for or against a proposition or issue.
Have students debate the advantages and disadvantages of having a nation-state, using evidence and reasoning to support their claims.

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Debriefing
Teachers facilitate a discussion that leads to consensus understanding.
Helps students clarify misconceptions and deepen understanding of content.
For complex issues, such as the global system of agriculture and how it is impacted by economic and political structures, lead students in a debrief to ensure understanding.
Discussion
Group
Students engage in an interactive small-group discussion.
Helps students gain information and understanding about a concept, idea, or problem.
Use a learning objective, such as Explain how landscape features and land and resource use reflect cultural beliefs and identities, to help students gain information and show their understanding.
Fishbowl
Discussing specific topics within groups:
some students form an inner circle and model appropriate discussion techniques, while an outer circle of students listen, respond, and evaluate.
Provides students with an opportunity to engage in a formal discussion and to experience the roles of both participant and active listener. Students also have the responsibility of supporting their opinions and responses using specific textual evidence.
Use this strategy to discuss the arguments presented in secondary sources and how they relate to the big ideas of the course.
Graphic
Organizer
Representing ideas and information visually (e.g.,
Venn diagrams, flowcharts, cluster maps).
Provides students with a visual system for organizing multiple ideas, details, or textual support to be included in a piece of writing.
Graphic organizers can be helpful when comparing global, national, regional, and local geographic patterns. Make sure students use any organizer thoughtfully and do not simply “fill in the blanks.”
Guided
Discussion
An umbrella strategy that allows for the use of different techniques to guide students through the lesson.
Helps students see the big picture and builds their confidence when dealing with difficult content or new skills.
Use brainstorming and quickwrite as strategies during a guided discussion to help students understand how language, ethnicity, and religion act as both unifying and divisive forces.
Jigsaw
Each student in a group reads a different text or different passage from one text, taking on the role of “expert” on what was read. Students share the information from that reading with students from other groups and then return to their original groups to share their new knowledge.
Helps students summarize and present information to others in a way that facilitates an understanding of a text (or multiple texts) or issue without having each student read the text in its entirety; by teaching others, they become experts.
Use this strategy to facilitate understanding of high-level readings or readings that incorporate several geographic concepts, such as The Spanish
Flu and Its Legacy, which is available on AP Central Human
Geography under “Classroom
Resources.” continued on next page

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Look for a
Pattern
Students evaluate data or create visual representations to find a trend.
Helps students to identify patterns that may be used to draw conclusions.
Using a complex graph (with at least two data sets) or map, have students compare the data to find a trend and draw a conclusion.
Making
Connections
Students are given a concept, term, or document and asked to write what they know about it. Then, students are paired and asked to determine, describe, and explain the connection between the two concepts.
Reinforces the fact that course concepts are often connected and provides the opportunity for students to make and explain connections between and among these concepts.
Write concepts related to one of the course big ideas on cards, place them in a box, and have students pick a card at random.
Give students a few minutes to gather and recall information about the concept, and then pair students and ask them to find the connection between their concepts. Finally, ask the pairs to write a brief explanation of how the concepts are related.
Quickwrite
Students write for a short, specific amount of time about a designated topic.
Helps generate ideas in a short time.
As preparation for the free response questions, have students write to describe, explain, or apply a geographic situation or scenario. Over the course of the academic year, add stimuli to these free response prompts.
Self/Peer Review
Working alone or with a partner to examine a piece of writing for accuracy and clarify.
Provides students with an opportunity to edit a written text to ensure the correctness of identified components.
Students should learn to interpret, evaluate, respond to, and write about a variety of written texts and graphic images. After students have completed a writing assignment, have them perform self and peer revisions of their writing.
Shared Inquiry
Students read a provocative text and are asked interpretive questions (for which there are no predetermined “right” answers). Students who offer different responses debate one another, supporting their positions with specific evidence from the text.
To lead students in a deep discussion of a text and encourage a diversity of ideas to emerge as students think deeply and share interpretations.
Ask students to read Edward
Relph’s “Sense of Place” and discuss the geographical sense of place and its components.
Have students evoke a sense of place within their personal and shared communities.

Example
Socratic
Seminar
This is a focused discussion on a topic, essential question, or selected text in which students ask questions of one another.
The questions initiate a conversation that continues with a series of responses and additional questions.
Helps students arrive at a new understanding by asking questions that clarify; challenging assumptions; probing perspective and point of view; questioning facts, reasons, and evidence; or examining implications and outcomes.
Initiate a discussion of an essential question, such as
What are the consequences, including positive, negative, and unintended, of each type of population policy? during which students can illustrate their understanding of the learning objectives and essential knowledge statements.
Think-Pair-
Share
Students think through a question or issue alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with the class.
Enables the development of initial ideas that are then tested with a partner in preparation for revising ideas and sharing them with a larger group.
To practice comparing the spatial variations of theories of development, ask students to use Think-Pair-Share to come up with similarities, differences and relevance to geographic processes for Rostow’s
Stages of Economic Growth,
Wallerstein’s World System
Theory, dependency theory, and commodity dependence.

Developing the
Course Skills
Throughout the AP Human Geography course, students will develop skills that are
fundamental to the discipline of geography. Since these are the skills that adept
geographers demonstrate, students will benefit from multiple opportunities to develop
them in a scaffolded manner. Through the use of guided questioning, discussion
techniques, and other instructional strategies, students can practice applying these skills
in new contexts, providing an important foundation for their college and career readiness.
The skill categories articulated in the course framework equip students to understand,
analyze, and apply geographic information in a process similar to that followed by
geographers. This process involves the analysis of spatial relationships, quantitative and qualitative sources, and scale.
The unit guides feature a suggested skill that students can practice using the content
of each topic. You are free to use that structure or create a system of your own, helping
students develop skills throughout the course through the sequencing and scaffolding appropriate for them.
The tables on the pages that follow look at each of the skills and provide examples
of questions and instructional strategies for incorporating those skills into your instruction.
