Self-directed learning: The capacity for self-managing, self-monitoring, and self-modifying.

Set-asides: Noticing and freeing oneself from several normal ways of listening and responding in order to be more effective as a Cognitive Coach. Three set-asides are described in this glossary: autobiographical listening, inquisitive listening, and solution listening. Three special set-asides are used during pacing and leading. They are:

- Closure is setting aside the need to understand the end of the story and instead looking for nonverbal cues indicating that a colleague has achieved the necessary internal resources.
- Comfort is setting aside the need for feeling at ease in pacing and leading conversations and being willing to embrace ambiguity as a resource for both parties.
- Comprehension is setting aside a coach's need to know the history, background, and context of a problem. Seeking this information is useful when consulting, but it may be counterproductive when pacing and leading.

Solution listening: Occurs when a listener tries to solve a problem for another. It may involve interpretation and rehearsing.

States of mind: Basic human forces that drive, influence, motivate, and inspire our intellectual capacities, emotional responsiveness, high performance, and productive human action. Specifically, this book describes five states of mind: efficacy, flexibility, craftsmanship, consciousness, and interdependence. (See also the separate entry for each in this glossary.) States of mind are transitory depending on a variety of personal and situational factors, but they can be mediated by helping a colleague become conscious of them and accessing them. They can also be strengthened and made more accessible to selfcoaching over time.

Support functions: Three services coaches may select from to further the aim of self-directed learning: Cognitive Coaching, collaborating, or consulting. (See definitions in this glossary.)
