## 4. Who Am I and Who Am I Becoming? (Self-Knowledge)

Self-knowledge includes the areas of personal values, standards, and beliefs. A teacher with self-knowledge is able to overcome egocentric patterns and teach in the ways that students learn best. A teacher with selfknowledge does not teach only in the way that he or she learns.

With awareness of their own cognitive styles, many teachers discover that the students who distress them the most are the ones with cognitive styles different from their own. For example, students who are abstract and random may drive a teacher whose own learning patterns are concrete and sequential to distraction. This discovery provides another intersection in the domains of knowledge of the discipline being taught, self-knowledge, and pedagogy. Awareness permits the teacher to set aside emotional responses to student style to provide the best learning experiences possible.

Self-knowledge includes information about one's own preferred learning styles, preferred representational systems, moral and ethical considerations in teaching, assumptions and theories about learning, and professional mission and values. Deciding what and how to teach is informed by one's beliefs and values. A calculus teacher, very clear about his own values, once said to us, 'I do not teach calculus. I teach life through calculus.' The following descriptors related to self-knowledge can support teacher reflection by asking themselves, How am I:

- Using understanding of self and individual students' development to meet learning goals?
- Assessing teaching practice and extending professional development through professional dialogue within the professional community?
- Engaging all students in practicing self- and peer-assessment, identifying their own learning goals, and self-monitoring progress over time?

Furthermore, teachers are influenced by their own plans for future

growth and development: retirement, advanced degrees, career ladder mobility, leisure-time hobbies, and so on. Teachers, too, value, exhibit, and therefore teach such dispositions as continual learning, persistence, curiosity, craftsmanship, wonderment, passion, and so forth.
