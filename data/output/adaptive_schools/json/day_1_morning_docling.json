The 3 legs support self-directedness. The first leg is Habits of Mind, created by Art Costa and Bena Kallick, and is applied to the creation of thoughtful learning communities in a classroom setting.\n\nSecond leg of the stool is Cognitive CoachingSM created by Art Costa and Bob Garmston, which is applied to thoughtful conversations between individuals.\n\nThe third leg of the stool, the topic of this seminar, is Adaptive Schools, the work of Bob Garmston and Bruce Wellman. Adaptive Schools is about developing collaborative groups and is the systems thinking that completes this 3-legged stool.\n\nWhat are some of the things you know or have heard about these three legs? Please share with a partner at your table.\n\n## TEACH HAND SIGNAL\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\n## WHAT?\n\nIn this seminar, we will be using a hand signal to gain attention.\n\n## WHY?\n\nRespectful way to reconvene the group Majority of audience members tend to be visual\n\n## HOW?\n\nEveryone, please raise your hand. When the hand is raised, please finish your thought and refocus your attention this direction. (Hands down.)  Often in this seminar, you will be engaged in a conversation with your back to the presenter. People who process visually will often be first to see the hand signal and respond. People who process auditorally will hear the diminished volume and refocus. People who process kinesthetically tend to go with the flow.\n\n## metaphor\n\nentering new territory\u2026 new administrator, new teacher, new position, new building, new team\n\nconfronted with new, complex tasks work harder -&gt; enter that maze alone cubicles\n\nisolation breeds mediocrity\n\ncan't do it alone -&gt; collaboration\n\nmove from that to this.\n\n## WHAT?\n\nThe following slides (cartoon, Garmston-Wellman quote, goal, video) generally introduce the Adaptive Schools work.\n\n## WHY?\n\nUsing cartoons, quotations, metaphors, video, and direct goal language appeals to the variety of learners in the room.\n\nHOW?\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nThink about teachers entering a new building in September, students entering a new community, administrators coming in a new building. So often we enter a new, potentially challenging, situation alone and in isolation. Particularly when you are entering into change alone, it  may seem daunting.\n\nstill just chatting\u2026 cordial / friendly\n\nconviviality feels better\u2026at least we huddle\n\nstill not where we need to be\n\none more step\n\nMove from that to this...\n\nTrue collaboration --&gt; greater, positive effects!\n\nResourcefulness inside organization stand on shoulders of others who can already do something, see far --&gt; boost others --&gt; can see farther\n\nHigh level of trust need communities -- feel safe to say: I don't know how to\u2026\n\nGood at something --&gt; kept to ourselves Bad --&gt; really kept ourselves\n\nattitudes where we boost each other up? dispositions?\n\nCollaborators -- trust enough --&gt; boost each other\n\nAdults don't always know how to do that\n\nMargaret Wheatley-the quality of adult relationships that provide the energy that gets all organizational work done\n\nlogistical announcements: rehydrate/dehydrate\n\n2 breaks 10 minutes lunch 45 minutes take responsibility for your comfort\n\nphone calls/computer use distracting to you and others multi-tasking ' lies' 23 minutes -&gt; flow (Jay Shetty) second hand smoke\n\nForbes from Stanford Multi-tasking lowers your IQ to an 8-year-old Stanford Multi-tasking makes you inefficient-single-tasking (creative, productive, happy)\n\nstep outside for calls, etc.\n\nhand signal / voice signal 'louder please'\n\n## materials walk\n\n## sourcebook!\n\np. xv (15)-Problem-Based Users Guide\n\nappendix list of strategies, 150 in alphabetical order\n\nstrategies, inventories, formatted print on 4x6 cards\n\n## MATERIALS WALK\n\nDo a Materials Walk to briefly explain the organization of the Learning Guide.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nPlease put your name in your Learning Guide.

Please read this goal and note what it's saying about identity. Identity is our bias.\n\nGive time to read.\n\nShare what you are noticing with an elbow partner.\n\n## Give time to share.\n\nAdaptive schools work is more than a treasure chest of strategies and moves; it asks PLCs, committees, work teams, and any productive group, to examine its identity. Who groups believe they are in relation to others and their work directly influences what the group pays attention to, how it defines its work, the internal and external group dynamics, and how the group makes decisions. This is a capacity-building seminar and the identity we are inviting you to hold is about being collaborators, inquirers, and leaders. We're going to be coming back to this throughout the seminar and tomorrow we'll go into more depth with the goal.\n\n## 3 intentions\n\n1-YOUR learning Learning = pattern breaking / making / taking record on chart paper Experience them -&gt; workplace\n\n2-value and usefulness develop / sustain high functioning groups\n\n3-classrooms working with students transfer isn't automatic-&gt;tips\n\npull aside curtain-&gt;strategies. harvest strategies-plan applications to work\n\nTRIPLE TRACK AGENDA\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nWHAT?\n\nTriple track agenda refers to using strategies in three settings: Here in this training, with adults, and with students.\n\nTriple track agendas allow audience members to transfer into various settings. It also supports the brain in organizing the presentation.\n\n## HOW?\n\nUse the slide to display the Triple Track.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nOn p. 15 of the Learning Guide, there is space for you to record strategies. There are also pages for taking notes on p. 131.\n\n## pull away curtain\n\nNOT icebreakers-negative presupposition People cold -&gt; broken open\n\n1-participative group-expectation of interacting\n\n- 2-come to meetings from somewhere else--geographically, emotionally, cognitively broken up fight, taught best lesson-need transition to use minds of people in meeting\n- 3-Connects-work / each other\n- 4-From egocentric to macrocentric-self to community\n\nINCLUSION STRATEGY: LIKE ME Suggested Language: WHAT?\n\nInclusion strategy\n\n## WHY?\n\nSet norms of participation Focus mental energy in the room Who am I relationship to this group? Psychologically transition from self to group\n\n## HOW?\n\nThrough a variety of strategies that we will be exploring in this seminar starting with Like Me.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\n## WHAT?\n\nOne example of an Inclusion Strategy is called Like Me.\n\n## WHY?\n\nLike Me is an Inclusion Strategy the purpose of which is to build community; learn about each other; and is brain-friendly in that it exercises the body and brings oxygen to the brain.\n\n## HOW?\n\nHere are the directions for Like Me: Each time you hear a statement that pertains to you, stand up, then scan the room and make eye contact with others that are also standing.\n\n## TRAINERS NOTE:\n\nDecisions about how to present directions include:\n\nShow, don't say.\n\nShow, then unpack.\n\nShow and read.\n\nFishbowl demonstration\n\nCombinations of the above.\n\nMake decisions about when to read the slides based on the diverse needs of the group.

Why? How? is a format for presenting strategies to learners/participants.\n\n## WHY?\n\nWHAT-WHY-HOW Format is a respectful way to meet the variety of learning styles in your audience.\n\n## HOW?\n\nAfter completing the Like Me Inclusion Strategy, show the 'Format for Strategies Presentation' slide to the group.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nNotice the manner in which the Like Me strategy was just offered to you. First, the What-the strategy was named and briefly described.\n\nNext, the Why-giving rationale for the strategy, something that adult audiences appreciate, yet is sometimes absent. Language might include words like, 'purpose, intention, rationale, etc.'\n\nAnd third, giving the How-whenever possible having the steps in the directions visibly available, respectfully promoting self-directed learning. Language might include words like, 'Directions, steps, process, etc.'\n\nInitially, you will hear the specific words, 'What, Why, How.' As we move through the seminar and you begin to own the pattern, you will hear these synonyms we just offered.\n\nPlease turn to an elbow partner and each complete this prompt: 'The What, Why, How format makes sense to me because...'\n\nbig picture / detail people, address both. why 4 days--outcomes for entire work\n\n1-grounding / community building-connect to each other -&gt; ways support building trust - norm to build community theory behind practice-&gt;collaborating\n\n-&gt;support structures for adults talking about tough stuff in safe ways\n\n- 2-adults taking time to grow themselves\n\nAssessing own personal skills around 7 norms -&gt;deep 2 -&gt; safely talk about hard stuff.\n\n3-NY Times-rather go to dentist -&gt; meetings meetings unproductive for adults AS work changes that Desire -&gt; transformational-all better off and benefits students what is it that separates meetings that frustrate from meetings that are productive NOT develop expertise through sitting together-&gt; developed -&gt; consciously / deliberately focusing on group's skills, interactions, needs for growth, etc. Group only as strong as each member-&gt;develop members get more done with shorter amount of time with greatest pleasure\n\n4-challenge thinking-&gt;transform community\n\n- \u00b7 How prioritize strategies and skills for adult / student work\n\ntoday-&gt;entering territory-&gt;what know about PCLs-&gt;important connection-&gt; help children learn\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nFOUR DAY OVERVIEW\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nDay 1 - Entering the Territory-Research base on effective professional communities learning; focus areas of the Adaptive Schools work\n\nDay 2 - Developing Identity and Capacity-The how-to, nuts and bolts of building effective collaborative groups Day 3 - Transforming Meetings-The best practices of meetings\n\nDay 4 -Sustaining Community-Continuing the work with effective meetings with a focus on engaging cognitive conflict, then planning to transfer learning from the workshop to the workplace\n\n1-research best practices\n\nSusan Rosenholtz-stuck / moving schools.

Emotion in constructive way\n\n7-elicits agendas might otherwise not be heard concerns about topic, having to leave early, distractions Suggested Language:\n\nThe purpose of Grounding is to set a norm for respectful listening, to get everyone's voice in the room in a manner that is not confrontational, to allow people to connect with one another, and to allow for the expressions of hopes and apprehensions, to value thinking and feeling, and to surface agendas that might not otherwise be heard.\n\nExercise in listening deeply\n\nMisunderstandings happen when not listening discipline of respectful listening-nonverbals: eye contact / attentive posture\n\nSomeone else talking, planning own speech / usually is rebuttal art of collaboration-requires listeners\n\nRefrain from verbal responses (uh huh, can you clarify) HOW:  1-name is precious-call out name, call ourselves present\n\n2-\n\n3-Doesn't matter how feel\n\n4-Expectations\n\nStarter's job\u2026\n\nearth time, not clock time--doesn't matter how long it takes\n\nI will start starter.\n\nStarter will share.\n\nNo responses.\n\nGo to next person.\n\nCome back to starter.\n\nstarter: back closest to ___ corner\n\nHere are the directions for Grounding (Refer to slide.)\n\nWhen the members indicate that they understand the process, the facilitator 'Starts the Starter,' that is, names the first speaker. For example, person with fanciest shoes, most visible buttons, most blue, traveled the farthest, etc.\n\nPost prompts on screen. Starter will summarize themes and patterns from the Grounding.\n\nWhen all groups are finished, the facilitator conducts debrief below.\n\n## will process\n\nWithout reflection, there is no learning information that is not processed is quickly lost\n\n## David Rock, 2010\n\n\u00b7Because brain is social-&gt;creating processes that require people -&gt; talk regularly about project will facilitate change\n\n\u2022Simply talking once / week -&gt; brain circuits alive\n\nDEBRIEF PROCESS WHAT?\n\nDebrief content and process\n\nWHY?\n\nAdults don't learn from experience. They learn from processing experience.\n\nHOW?\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nSome people think that adults learn from experience, but in truth they learn from PROCESSING experience. (Show slide.) Because of this, we will engage in a pattern of debrief that you will note for the four days. We will first debrief Content. (A fundamental content debrief question is, 'What are we learning?') and will follow with a debrief about the process (A fundamental process debrief question is, 'How has this process supported our learning?').\n\nFirst, you reflected on content by asking the starter to give a summary of themes that emerged in your group.\n\nOthers may add to the starter's response.\n\nStarters stand and report out themes and patterns.\n\nTips-For larger groups, inform group you will be taking a sample only.\n\nThe point of this debrief is to give the group its own data, and allows the facilitator to gather data that may support group resourcefulness.\n\nOur relationship to the topic is\u2026\n\nWe feel\u2026\n\nOur expectations about being here\u2026\n\n## Paraphrase group to give group their own data back\n\nUsually sounds like this:\n\n2-varied experience\n\n3-generally excited, some angst, generally feeling positive\n\n4-holding expectations about learnings-to take back so kids learn\n\n## Debrief\n\nexpression of feelings / thinking.  Whatever is fine.  Gets it in room.  Up and away from people so can set it aside.  Don't take personally.  Just data.  Keeps group resourceful.\n\nOffer group paraphrase.  Giving group back data.\n\nFirst, you reflected on content by asking the starter to give a summary of themes that emerged in your group. Others may add to the starter's response.\n\nStarters stand and report out themes and patterns.\n\nTips-For larger groups, inform group you will be taking a sample only.\n\nThe point of this debrief is to give the group its own data, and allows the facilitator to gather data that may support group resourcefulness.\n\nhaving problems or need to talk about something hard to talk aboutGrounding is THE right tool for conflict!!!! helps people feel like they are heard.\n\nStart the Starter examples\n\nperson closest to front of room, fancy shoes, wearing most blue, etc.\n\n## Language:\n\nNow as a whole group, we're opening space to reflect on the process by responding to these prompts.\n\nShow prompts one at a time and allow time to read; then open space for responses.\n\nBookend reminder inclusion strategies-WHY?\n\n1-certain things are consistently going to keep happening\n\n-respectful way of listening, not always leader talking\n\n2-values cognition / feeling, enter with head / heart\n\n3-connects group members, allows for expression of hopes / fears -where are my stacks / where everyone else's\n\n4-builds community-&gt;sense of collaborative-ness in room\n\n## CLOSURE FOR INCLUSION STRATEGIES Suggested Language:\n\nGrounding and Like Me are examples of Inclusion Strategies which honor each person's presence, connects people to each other, allows group members to learn about each other, and builds community.\n\nOPTIONAL: Trainers may offer other examples of Inclusion Strategies..\n\nSet your\n\ntime piece for 9 minutes.\n\nBe in your seats at 10.\n\nWHAT: invested in first stage of learning cycle Activate / Engage -&gt; Explore / Discover content combine 2 strategies Penny Payout / Corners\n\n## WHY:\n\n\u00b7big picture of what's coming \u00b7connect w/others about content \u00b7assess own interest \u00b7PRIORITIZING STRATEGY\n\nHOW:  spend based on interest Write how many and where\n\nASSESSING THE GROUP: Penny Payout\n\nLG, p. 19\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nWHAT?\n\nPenny Payout is a strategy for group member choice-making.\n\n## WHY?\n\nPenny Payout will give you the big picture of what's coming and to make personal connect It offers an efficient prioritizing process.\n\nThree charts with 'Facilitating Groups,' 'Developing Groups,' and 'Becoming a More Skillful Group Member' have been created and posted during prep time before the Seminar\n\nUse the slide to present directions for Spend-A-Buck. Allow time for reading.\n\nlayer Penny Payout with Corners\n\n2&amp;3-If spent most of money in facilitating groups, move to this corner.\n\nWhen get there, do 2 things, group will be large, cluster with 2/3 and talk about why you chose this theme for your focus\n\nLook at standing data. 'What might be some implications?'\n\n4-move to the corner where you spent your next highest amount of pennies and reengage in discussions\n\n## CORNERS\n\nLG, p. 19\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nWe are going to layer Spend a Buck with a strategy called Corners. Move to the corner where you spent the most pennies and cluster with 2-3 people and talk about the reasons you chose this area of interest.\n\nPlease move to the corner where you spent your next highest and repeat the process.\n\ndon't learn from experience-&gt; processing experience\n\n## CONTENT-talk at table-what learn?\n\nfacilitator most important person in group?-Not so, is skillful group member is most influential.\n\nGroup only as productive/strong as skillful group member will allow --&gt; develop all.\n\nDevelop group every time-choose something to work on-listening, pausing, paraphrasing, etc. Group development is responsibility of everyone\n\nHow develop group?\n\nPublic agenda -&gt; focus, connections between items Norms, structures/strategies, assess\n\nIn the beginnings of the Adaptive Schools work, we began by focusing on those individuals that were designated as facilitators, and focused on teaching facilitation skills. We began to realize that we also had to focus in other areas as well, such as developing the identity and capacity of the entire group. This led to adding another area of focus, helping every individual group member develop his/her skills. The seminar will offer practical suggestions for growth in each of these three focus areas.\n\nWhile offering this content background information, the trainer walks to each chart corner.\n\nPROCESS-talk at table-how did 2 strategies help learn content?\n\ntalker inners / talker outers-&gt; balance is prioritizing strategy - recognize important for me / important for community groups generate own data-&gt;less likely to argue.\n\ngroups up, moving / loud\u2026feels, looks, sounds - break\n\nResearch-how communicate with each other directly impact learning of kids-kids watching\n\nCan't teach collaboration unless WE learn it, use it, model it\n\nNext step is to do three things:\n\nPlease listen to them all before you move.\n\nNumber one is say, 'Thank you' to your partners; number two is to return to your seats; and number three is to talk about these two strategies, Spend a Buck and Corners.
