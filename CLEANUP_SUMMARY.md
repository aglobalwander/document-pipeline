# Pipeline Documents Cleanup Summary

Date: 2024-06-20

## What Was Done

### 1. Standards Scripts Organization
- Created `/scripts/standards/` directory
- Moved 9 standards extraction and processing scripts
- Added comprehensive README documentation

### 2. Scripts Directory Reorganization
Created organized structure:
```
scripts/
├── pdf_processing/        (9 scripts)
├── document_processing/   (6 scripts)
├── weaviate/             (9 scripts + 2 READMEs)
├── content_processing/    (4 scripts)
├── standards/            (9 scripts + README)
├── standards_org/        (8 scripts)
├── utilities/            (6 scripts)
├── media/                (2 scripts)
├── shell/                (2 shell scripts)
└── archive/              (for deprecated scripts)
```

### 3. Root Directory Cleanup
- Moved shell scripts to `/scripts/shell/`
- Kept essential documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG.md)
- No Python scripts in root (clean)

### 4. Documentation
- Created main README for scripts directory
- Preserved specialized READMEs in appropriate subdirectories
- Added README for standards scripts

## Script Count by Category
- PDF Processing: 9 scripts

- Weaviate Operations: 9 scripts
- Content Processing: 4 scripts
- Standards Extraction: 9 scripts
- Standards Organization: 8 scripts
- Utilities: 6 scripts
- Media Processing: 2 scripts
- Shell Scripts: 2 scripts

**Total: 55 scripts organized**

## Benefits
1. **Clear Organization**: Scripts grouped by functionality
2. **Easy Navigation**: Know where to find specific types of scripts
3. **Better Maintenance**: Related scripts are together
4. **Documentation**: Each category has appropriate documentation
5. **Clean Root**: No loose scripts in project root

## Next Steps
1. Update any hardcoded paths in scripts if needed
2. Test main entry points after reorganization
3. Consider creating a Makefile or task runner for common operations
4. Archive any deprecated scripts to the archive folder
