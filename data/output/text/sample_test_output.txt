When the number of initiatives increases, while time, resources and 
emotional energy are constant, then each new initiative . . . will 
receive fewer minutes, dollars and ounces of emotional energy than its 
 predecessors.

The real path to greatness, it turns out, requires simplicity and dili-
gence. It requires clarity, not instant illumination. It demands each 
of us to focus on what is vital—and to eliminate all of the extraneous 
distractions.

Hedgehogs see what is essential and ignore the rest.

T
he argument of this book is simple: If we choose to take 
just a few well-known, straightforward actions, in every 
subject area, we can make swift, dramatic improvements 
in schools. Some believe we could virtually eliminate the achieve-
ment gap within a few years. An Australian study indicated it would 
take seven years (Garnaut, 2007); another study estimates about five 
years (Kane & Hanushek in Haycock, 2005).

But the price for such swift improvement is steep: Most schools 
would have to stop doing almost everything they now do in the 
name of school improvement. Instead, they would have to focus 
only on implementing “what is essential.” Hardest of all, they would 
have to “ignore the rest” (Collins, 2001, p. 91)—the fads, programs, 
and innovations that now prevent us from ensuring that every stu-
dent in every school receives a quality education. 
Why such draconian action? Because the only reason our 
schools haven’t made astonishing progress in the last 30 years of 
“reform” is quite simple: very few schools ever implemented “what 
is essential”—the most powerful, simple actions and structures that 
would dramatically increase the proportion of students prepared for 
college or careers.
What is “essential” for schools? Three simple things: reasonably 
coherent curriculum (what we teach); sound lessons (how we teach); 
and far more purposeful reading and writing in every discipline, or 
authentic literacy (integral to both what and how we teach). But as 
numerous studies demonstrate, these three essential elements are 
only rarely implemented; every credible study confirms that they 
are still pushed aside by various initiatives, every year, in the major-
ity of schools (Schmoker, 2006).
The status quo has to change. We insult and frustrate our teach-
ers and leaders when we keep asking them to adopt complex, con-
fusing new initiatives and programs that can’t possibly succeed in 
the absence of decent curriculum, lessons, and literacy activities. 
These constitute the indisputable—if age-old—core of effective prac-
tice, and of education itself.
In the last few years, I have found that educators yearn to be told 
something like this:
There will be no more initiatives—at least for a time. Instead, 
we will focus only on what will have an immediate and dra-
matic impact on learning in your classrooms: ensuring the
