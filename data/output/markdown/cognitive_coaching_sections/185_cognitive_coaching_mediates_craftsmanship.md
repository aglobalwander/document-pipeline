## Cognitive Coaching Mediates Craftsmanship

Language and thinking are inseparable. Language plays a critical role in enhancing a person's cognitive maps and has a great impact on an individual's ability to think critically, create a knowledge base for action, and feel efficacious. The skillful coach, recognizing that language and thinking are closely entwined, consistently strives to enhance the clarity and specificity of the teacher's language. Coaches enhance craftsmanship by posing such questions as:

- So how do your actions compare with your expectations of yourself?
- So you're gratified with your progress so far. What will be your next task to master?
- As you consider your desire to meet students' individual needs, what might that look like in your classroom?
- When you say that your students 'understand,' what do you see them doing or hear them saying that may indicate they understand?
- Based on the results of this experiment, what refinements might you make in your approach?
- So as you learn more, you are finding that there is still more to learn. What more do you want to learn about this topic?
