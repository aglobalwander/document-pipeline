## CONCLUSION

The danger in writing about a subject like accessing internal resources is that the examples can too easily be seen as mechanical formulas for given problems. Nothing could be further from the truth. For example, on these last pages, we have displayed primarily what Lankton and Lankton (1983) call the 'social message' carried in words. We are unable to experience on these pages the postural shifts, inflections, breathing changes, and all the many ideomotor responses that send the psychological message.

The skillful coach attends to these states not by mechanically observing and interpreting nonverbal signals but by caringly, intuitively, with the coach's entire presence being committed interdependently, one human being to another, entering the other's model of the world, accessing resources, and illuminating choice.

Skillful coaching does not mean applying formulas. Rather, it means continually designing, testing, and refining an ever-expanding repertoire of new and more efficient ways to be catalytic in a colleague's growth. As coaches become increasingly skillful in working with the map of problem resolving, there is a reciprocal effect on themselves. In recognizing the five states of mind in others, the coach recognizes these states in himself.

The external attention and skill of coaching others becomes internal in the coach, who thus mediates his self to higher states of holonomy. The model of Cognitive Coaching, then, becomes self-mediating, self-transforming, and self-modifying for coaches themselves. As Erich Fromm (1956) wrote:

In thus giving of his life, the mentor enriches the other's sense of aliveness. He does not give in order to receive; giving is in itself exquisite joy. But in giving he cannot help bringing something to life in the other person, and this, which is brought to life, reflects back to him; in truly giving, he cannot help receiving that which is given back.
