## Paraphrasing

Paraphrasing is one of the most valuable and least-used tools in human interaction. A well-crafted paraphrase communicates 'I am trying to understand you and therefore I value what you have to say.' A paraphrase also establishes a relationship between people and ideas. Paraphrasing aligns the parties and creates a safe environment for thinking.

Mediational paraphrases reflect the speaker's content and emotions about the content. They frame the logical level for holding the content. Questions by themselves, no matter how artfully constructed, put a degree

of psychological distance between the asker and the person being asked. Questions, preceded by paraphrases, gain permission to inquire about details and elaboration. Without the paraphrase, probing and questioning may be perceived as interrogation.

To design an effective paraphrase, begin by carefully listening and observing to calibrate the content and emotions of the speaker. Signal your intention to paraphrase by modulating intonation and using an approachable voice. Don't use the pronoun I. (For example, 'What I think I hear you saying . . .') The pronoun 'I' signals that the speaker's thoughts no longer matter and that the paraphraser is now going to insert his own ideas into the conversation.

Open with a reflective stem. This language structure puts the focus and emphasis on the speaker's ideas, not on the paraphraser's interpretation of those ideas. For example, these stems signal that a paraphrase is coming:

- You're suggesting . . .
- You're proposing . . .
- So you're wondering about . . .
- Your hunch is that . . .

Choose a logical level with which to respond. There are at least three broad categories of logical levels:

- 1. Acknowledging content and emotion. If the paraphrase is not completely accurate, the speaker will offer corrections. For example, 'So, you're concerned about the district-adopted standards and how to influence them.'
- 2. Organizing by offering themes and categories that relate several extensive topics. For example, 'So you are concerned about several issues here. One is the effects of testing on students' higher-level thinking. Another is making inferences about school effectiveness based upon test scores alone. And yet another is how they influence teachers' instructional practices.'
- 3. Abstracting by shifting focus to a higher or lower logical level. Paraphrases move to a higher logical level when they name concepts, goals, values, beliefs, identity, and assumptions: 'So, a major goal here is to define what constitutes effective learning and to design authentic ways to gather indicators of achievement.' Paraphrases move to a lower logical level when abstractions and concepts require operational definitions: 'So authentic assessments might include

portfolios, performances, and exhibitions.'

The coach paraphrases, capturing in one word, the essence of what Ochan was describing. Notice Ochan's appreciation of the abstracting paraphrase that led her to transfer the concept of deliberateness to another area of her work. Finally, Carolee summarizes Ochan's learning in this reflecting conversation.
