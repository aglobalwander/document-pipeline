## Generalization

Generalization eliminates the necessity to relearn a concept or behavior

every time we are confronted with a variation of the original. However, generalizations can carry imprecision and inaccuracies that limit thought and choices. The coach might ask, 'Under what conditions might that be true?'

A complex equivalent is a statement that ties two separate ideas together as if they were inseparable: 'He is failing; he doesn't study enough.' In that case, the coach might ask, 'Have you ever known someone to study hard and still fail?' or 'Can one not study at all and still pass?'

A lost performative is a statement in which the performance criteria for a value judgment are missing: 'That was a good paper.' The coach might then ask, 'Good in what way?' or 'What criteria are you considering when you rate it as good?'

A modal operator (derived from mode of operation or modus operandi) is a rule word like can't or impossible : 'I can't do this.' Then the coach might ask, 'What is stopping you?' or 'What would happen if you did?'

In all of these situations, the coach's intention is to illuminate possible inaccuracies represented by the generalizations.
