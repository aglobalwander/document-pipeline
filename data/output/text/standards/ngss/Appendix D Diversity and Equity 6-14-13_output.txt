Appendix D - "All Standards, All Students”:
Making the Next Generation Science Standards Accessible to All Students

The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) are being developed at a historic time
when major changes in education are occurring at the national level. On one hand, student
demographics across the nation are changing rapidly, as teachers have seen the steady increase of
student diversity in the classrooms. Yet, achievement gaps in science and other key academic
indicators among demographic subgroups have persisted. On the other hand, national initiatives
are emerging for a new wave of standards through the NGSS as well as Common Core State
Standards (CCSS) for English language arts and literacy and for mathematics. As these new
standards are cognitively demanding, teachers must make instructional shifts to enable all students to be college and career ready.
The NGSS are building on the National Research Council’s consensus reports in recent
years, including Taking Science to School (2007) and its companion report for practitioners
Ready, Set, Science! (2008), Learning Science in Informal Environments (2009), and most
notably A Framework for K-12 Science Education (2012). These reports consistently highlight
that, when provided with equitable learning opportunities, students from diverse backgrounds are
capable of engaging in scientific practices and constructing meaning in both science classrooms and informal settings.
This chapter, accompanied by seven case studies of diverse student groups, addresses
what classroom teachers can do to ensure that the NGSS are accessible to all students; hence the
title: “All Standards, All Students.” Successful application of science and engineering practices
(e.g., constructing explanations, engaging in argument from evidence) and understanding of how
crosscutting concepts (e.g., patterns, structure and function) play out across a range of
disciplinary core ideas (e.g., structure and properties of matter, earth materials and systems) will
demand increased cognitive expectations of all students. Making such connections has typically
been expected only of “advanced,” “gifted,” or “honors” students. The NGSS are intended to
provide a foundation for all students, including those who can and should surpass the NGSS
performance expectations. At the same time, the NGSS make it clear that these increased
expectations apply to those students who have traditionally struggled to demonstrate mastery
even in the previous generation of less cognitively demanding standards. The goal of the chapter
and the case studies is to demonstrate that the NGSS are extended to all students.
Throughout the chapter and case studies, the terms “dominant” and “non-dominant”
groups are used with reference to student diversity (Gutiérrez & Rogoff, 2003). The dominant
group(s) does not refer to numerical majority, but rather to social prestige and institutionalized
privilege. This is particularly the case as student diversity is increasing in the nation’s
classrooms. Even where the dominant group(s) is the numerical minority, the privileging of their
academic backgrounds persists. In contrast, non-dominant groups have traditionally been
underserved by the education system. Thus, the term “non-dominant” highlights a call to action
that the education system meets the learning needs of the nation’s increasingly diverse student population.
The chapter highlights practicality and utility of implementation strategies that are
grounded in theoretical or conceptual frameworks. It consists of three parts. First, it discusses
both learning opportunities and challenges that the NGSS present to student groups that have
traditionally been underserved in science classrooms. Second, it describes effective strategies for

=== Page 2 ===

Page 2 of 21
implementation of the NGSS in the classroom, school, home, and community. Finally, it
provides the context of student diversity by addressing changing demographics, persistent
science achievement gaps, and educational policies affecting non-dominant student groups.
The seven case studies (available at www.nextgenscience.org) illustrate science teaching
and learning of non-dominant student groups as they engage in the NGSS. Several caveats are
offered to understand the purpose of case studies. First, the case studies are not intended to
prescribe science instruction, but to illustrate an example or prototype for implementation of
effective classroom strategies with diverse student groups. Given the vast range of student
diversity across varied educational settings, teachers and schools will implement the NGSS to
meet the learning needs of specific student groups in local contexts. Second, each case study
highlights one identified group (e.g., economically disadvantaged students, English language
learners). In reality, however, students could belong to multiple categories of diversity (e.g.,
English language learners who are racial and ethnic minorities from economically disadvantaged
backgrounds). Third, as there is wide variability among students within each group,
“essentializing” on the basis of a group label must be avoided. For example, ELLs form a
heterogeneous group with differences in ethnic background, proficiency level in home language
and English, socioeconomic status, immigration history, quality of prior schooling, parents’ educational level, etc.
In identifying student diversity, the case studies address the four accountability groups
defined in No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001 and the reauthorized Elementary and
Secondary Education Act [ESEA], Section 1111(b)(2)(C)(v):
 economically disadvantaged students,  students from major racial and ethnic groups,  students with disabilities, and  students with limited English proficiency.

Further, student diversity is extended by adding three groups:
 girls,  students in alternative education programs, and  gifted and talented students.

Each of the seven case studies consists of three parts that parallel the chapter. It starts
with a vignette of science instruction to illustrate learning opportunities through connections to
the NGSS and the CCSS for English language arts and mathematics as well as use of effective
classroom strategies. The vignette emphasizes what teachers can do to successfully engage
students in learning the NGSS. Then, it provides a brief summary of the research literature on
effective classroom strategies for the student group highlighted in the case study. It ends with the
context for the student group – demographics, science achievement, and educational policy. The
contextual information relies heavily on government reports addressing student diversity
broadly, including the ESEA Act, U.S. Census, National Center for Education Statistics
(including the National Assessment of Educational Progress), and Common Core of Data. The
contextual information also comes from government reports addressing specific student groups
such as students in alternative education programs or gifted and talented students.
The case studies were written by the members of the NGSS Diversity and Equity Team
with expertise on specific student groups. In working on their case studies, many of the members

piloted the NGSS in their own science instruction. The case studies represent science disciplines
across grade levels:
 economically disadvantaged students – 9th grade chemistry
 students from major racial and ethnic groups – 8th grade life science
 students with disabilities – 6th grade space science
 students with limited English proficiency – 2nd grade earth science  girls – 3rd grade engineering
 students in alternative education programs – 10th and 11th grade chemistry
 gifted and talented students – 4th grade life science

Collectively, the chapter and the seven case studies make contributions in several ways.
First, they focus on issues of student diversity and equity in relation to the NGSS specifically as
the NGSS present both learning opportunities and challenges to all students, particularly non dominant student groups. Second, they are intended for educational policies as they highlight
emerging national initiatives through the NGSS as well as the CCSS for English language arts
and mathematics. Third, they are intended for classroom practice as the case studies were written
by members of the NGSS Diversity and Equity Team who are themselves teachers working with
diverse student groups. Fourth, they highlight key findings in research literature on student
diversity and equity for seven demographic groups of students in science education. This is
noteworthy because research for each student group tends to exist independently from the others.
Finally, for each student group, they provide the context in terms of demographics, science achievement, and educational policy.

NGSS: Learning Opportunities and Demands for Non-Dominant
Student Groups

The NGSS offer a clear vision of rigorous science standards by blending scientific and
engineering practices with disciplinary core ideas and crosscutting concepts across K-12. In
addition, the NGSS make connections to the CCSS for English language arts and literacy and for
mathematics. For the student groups that have traditionally been underserved in science
education, the NGSS offer both learning opportunities and challenges. Instead of making a long
list of opportunities and challenges, major considerations are discussed below. Then, learning
opportunities and challenges are illustrated in the seven case studies for economically
disadvantaged students, racial or ethnic minority students, students with disabilities, English
language learners, girls, students in alternative education programs, and gifted and talented students.

NGSS Connections to CCSS for English Language Arts and Mathematics

The NGSS make connections across school curricula. For example, students understand
the crosscutting concept of patterns not only across science disciplines but also across other
subject areas of language arts, mathematics, social studies, etc. Likewise, the crosscutting
concept of cause and effect can be used to explain phenomena in Earth science as well as to
examine character or plot development in literature. Thus, students develop mastery of
crosscutting concepts through repeated and contrastive experiences across school curricula.

=== Page 4 ===

The requirements and norms for classroom discourse are shared across all the science
disciplines, and indeed across all the subject areas. The convergence of disciplinary practices
across the CCSS for English language arts and literacy, the CCSS for mathematics, and the
NGSS are highlighted in Figure 1 (on page 21). For example, students are expected to engage in
argumentation from evidence; construct explanations; obtain, synthesize, evaluate, and
communicate information; and build a knowledge base through content rich texts across the three
subject areas. Such convergence is particularly beneficial for students from non-dominant groups
who are pressed for instructional time to develop literacy and numeracy at the cost of other subjects, including science.
Integration of subject areas strengthens science learning for all students, particularly for
students who have traditionally been underserved. In the current climate of accountability
policies, which are dominated by reading and mathematics, science tends to be de-emphasized.
This is due to the perceived urgency of developing basic literacy and numeracy for students in
low-performing schools including, but not limited to, English language learners and students
with limited literacy development. Thus, allocation and utilization of instructional time across
subject areas will benefit these students. Furthermore, the convergence of core ideas, practices,
and crosscutting concepts across subject areas offers multiple entry points to build and deepen understanding for these students.
Initiatives are emerging to identify language demands and opportunities as English
language learners engage in the NGSS as well as the CCSS for English language arts and literacy
and for mathematics. For example, the Understanding Language Initiative
<http://ell.stanford.edu> is aimed at heightening educator awareness of the critical role that
language plays in the CCSS and the NGSS. Its long-term goal is to help educators understand
that the new standards cannot be achieved without providing specific attention to the language
demands inherent to each subject area. This initiative seeks to improve academic outcomes for
English language learners by drawing attention to critical aspects of instructional practices and
by advocating for necessary policy supports at the state and local levels.

Inclusion of Engineering

Inclusion of engineering along with science in the NGSS has major implications for non dominant student groups. First, from an epistemological perspective, the NGSS reinterpret a
traditional view of epistemology and history of science. For example, Science for All Americans
stated:

The recommendations in this chapter focus on the development of science, mathematics,
and technology in Western culture, but not on how that development drew from earlier
Egyptian, Chinese, Greek, and Arabic cultures. The sciences accounted for in this book
are largely part of a tradition of thought that happened to develop in Europe during the
last 500 years – a tradition to which most people from all cultures contribute today.
(American Association for the Advancement of Science [AAAS], 1989, p. 136)

At that time, although the goal of “Science for all Americans” was visionary, the
definition of science in terms of Western science while ignoring historical contributions from
other cultures presented a limited or distorted view of science. The NGSS, by emphasizing
engineering, recognize contributions of other cultures historically. This (re)defines the

=== Page 5 ===

NGSS Release
Page 5 of 21
epistemology of science or what counts as science, which, in turn, defines or determines school science curriculum.
Second, from a pedagogical perspective, engineering has potential to be inclusive of
students who have traditionally been marginalized in the science classroom and do not see
science as being relevant to their lives or future. By solving problems through engineering in
local contexts (e.g., gardening, improving air quality, cleaning water pollution in the
community), students gain knowledge of science content, view science as relevant to their lives
and future, and engage in science in socially relevant and transformative ways (Rodriguez &
Berryman, 2002).
Finally, from a global perspective, engineering offers opportunities for “innovation” and
“creativity” at the K-12 level. Engineering is a field that is critical to innovation, and exposure to
engineering activities (e.g., robotics and invention competitions) can spark interest in the study
of STEM or future careers (National Science Foundation [NSF], 2010). Although exposure to
engineering at the pre-collegiate level is currently rare (Katehi, Pearson, & Feder, 2009), the
NGSS make exposure to engineering at the pre-collegiate level no longer a rarity, but a
necessity. This opportunity is particularly important for students who traditionally have not
recognized science as relevant to their lives or future or students who come from multiple languages and cultures in this global community.

Focus on Practices

The ways we describe student engagement in science have evolved over time. Terms
such as “hands-on” and “minds-on” have traditionally been used to describe when students
engage in science. Then, National Science Education Standards (National Research Council
[NRC], 1996, 2000) highlighted “scientific inquiry” as the core of science teaching and learning
through which students “develop knowledge and understanding of scientific ideas, as well as an
understanding of how scientists study the natural world” (p. 23). In the NGSS, “inquiry-based
science” is refined and deepened by the explicit definition of the set of eight scientific and
engineering practices, which have major implications for non-dominant student groups (for
details, see Lee, Quinn, & Valdés, 2013; Quinn, Lee, & Valdés, 2012).
Engagement in any of the scientific and engineering practices involves both scientific
sense-making and language use (see Figure 1). Students engage in these practices for the
scientific sense-making process as they transition from their naïve conceptions of the world to
more scientifically-based conceptions. Engagement in these practices is also language intensive
and requires students to participate in classroom science discourse. Students must read, write,
and visually represent as they develop models and construct explanations. They speak and listen
as they present their ideas or engage in reasoned argumentation with others to refine their ideas and reach shared conclusions.
These scientific and engineering practices offer rich opportunities and demands for
language learning while they support science learning for all students, especially English
language learners, students with language processing difficulties, students with limited literacy
development, and students who are speakers of social or regional varieties of English that are
generally referred to as “non-Standard English.” When supported appropriately, these students
are capable of learning science through their emerging language and comprehending and
carrying out sophisticated language functions (e.g., arguing from evidence, constructing
explanations, developing models) using less-than-perfect English. By engaging in such practices,

moreover, they simultaneously build on their understanding of science and their language
proficiency (i.e., capacity to do more with language).

Crosscutting Concepts

Crosscutting concepts are overarching scientific themes that emerge across all scientific
disciplines. These themes provide the context for new disciplinary core ideas and enable students
to “develop a cumulative, coherent, and usable understanding of science and engineering” (NRC,
2011, p. 4-1). Thus, crosscutting concepts bridge the engineering, physical, life, and Earth/space
sciences, and offer increased rigor across science disciplines over K-12. Although Science for All
Americans (AAAS, 1989) identified “common themes” and National Science Education
Standards (NRC 1996) identified “unifying concepts and processes,” the NGSS bring
crosscutting concepts to the forefront as one of three dimensions of science learning.
Crosscutting concepts offers frameworks to conceptualize disciplinary core ideas. In this
way, students think of science learning not as memorization of isolated or disconnected facts, but
as integrated and interrelated concepts. This is a fundamental understanding of science that is
often implied as background knowledge for students in “gifted,” “honors,” or “advanced”
programs. Through the NGSS, explicit teaching of crosscutting concepts enables less privileged
students, most from non-dominant groups, to make connections among big ideas that cut across
science disciplines. This could result in leveling the playing field for students who otherwise might not have exposure to such opportunities.

Implementation of Effective Strategies

To make the NGSS accessible to all students, implementation of effective strategies
capitalizes on learning opportunities while being aware of demands that the NGSS present to
non-dominant student groups, as described in the previous section. Unfortunately, existing
research literature does not address students’ performance expectations as envisioned in the
NGSS based on the mastery of scientific and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, and
disciplinary core ideas. Furthermore, the existing research literature addresses non-dominant
student groups separately. For example, research on race or ethnicity, research on English
language learners, research on students with disabilities, and research on gender comprise
distinct research traditions (for effective strategies for non-dominant groups in science
classrooms, see Special Issue in Theory Into Practice, 2013; for discussion of classroom
strategies and policy issues, see Lee & Buxton, 2010).
There seem to be common themes that unite these distinct research areas. In describing
“equitable learning opportunities” for non-dominant student groups, Lee and Buxton (2010)
highlight the following themes: (1) value and respect the experiences that all students bring from
their backgrounds (e.g., homes or communities), (2) articulate students’ background knowledge
(e.g., cultural or linguistic knowledge) with disciplinary knowledge, and (3) offer sufficient school resources to support student learning.
First, to value and respect the experiences that all students bring from their backgrounds,
it is important to make diversity visible. In the process of making diversity visible, there are both
connections and disconnections between home/community and classroom/school. Effective
teachers understand how disconnections may vary among different student groups, as well as

=== Page 7 ===

NGSS Release
Page 7 of 21
how to capitalize on connections. These teachers bridge diverse students’ background knowledge
and experiences to scientific knowledge and practices.
Second, to articulate students’ background knowledge with disciplinary knowledge of
science, it is important to capitalize on “funds of knowledge” (González, Moll, & Amanti, 2005).
Funds of knowledge are culturally-based understandings and abilities that develop over time in
family and neighborhood contexts, and the social and intellectual resources contained in families
and communities can serve as resources for academic learning. Effective teachers ask questions
that elicit students’ funds of knowledge related to science topics. They also use cultural artifacts
and community resources in ways that are academically meaningful and culturally relevant.
Finally, school resources constitute essential elements of a school’s organizational
context for teaching and learning. School resources to support student learning involve material
resources, human resources (or capital), and social resources (or capital). School resources are
likely to have a greater impact on the learning opportunities of non-dominant students who have
traditionally been underserved in science education. In schools and classrooms where non dominant students reside, resources are often scarce, forcing allocations of the limited resources
for some areas (e.g., reading and mathematics) and not others (e.g., science and other non-tested subject areas).
Below, each of these themes is described as it relates to classroom strategies, home and
community connections, and school resources – all of which can enable non-dominant student groups to engage in the NGSS.

Effective Classroom Strategies

Key features of effective classroom strategies from the research literature on each of non dominant groups are summarized below. In recognition of the fact that each area of research
literature has been developing as an independent body of knowledge, the description of strategies
is provided for each group. Yet, it is noted that while some strategies are unique to a particular
group (e.g., home language use with English language learners, accommodations or
modifications for students with disabilities), other strategies apply to all students broadly (e.g.,
multiple modes of representation). More detailed descriptions are provided in each of the seven
case studies, including the four accountability groups defined in ESEA and three additional
groups. While effective science instruction of the NGSS will be based on the existing research
literature, the NGSS will also stimulate new directions for research to actualize its vision for all students.

Economically disadvantaged students. Strategies to support economically
disadvantaged students include: (1) connecting science education to students’ sense of “place” as
physical, historical, and sociocultural dimensions, (2) applying students’ funds of knowledge and
cultural practices, (3) using project-based science learning as a form of connected science, and
(4) providing school resources and funding for science instruction.

Students from major racial and ethnic groups. Effective strategies for students from
major racial and ethnic groups fall into the following categories: (1) culturally relevant
pedagogy, (2) community involvement and social activism, (3) multiple representation and
multimodal experiences, and (4) school support systems including role models and mentors of similar racial or ethnic backgrounds.

Students with disabilities. Students with disabilities have their Individualized Education
Plans (IEP), specific to the individuals, that mandate the accommodations and modifications that
teachers must provide to support student learning in the regular education classroom.  By
definition, accommodations allow students to overcome or work around their disabilities with the
same performance expectations of their peers, whereas modifications generally change the
curriculum or performance expectations for a specific student. Two approaches for providing
accommodations and modifications are widely used by general education teachers in their
classrooms: (1) differentiated instruction and (2) Universal Design for Learning.

Students with limited English proficiency. The research literature indicates five areas
where teachers can support both science and language learning for English language learners: (1)
literacy strategies for all students, (2) language support strategies with ELLs, (3) discourse
strategies with ELLs, (4) home language support, and (5) home culture connections.

Girls. The research literature points to three main areas where schools can positively
impact girls’ achievement, confidence and affinity with science and engineering: (1) instructional
strategies to increase girls’ science achievement and their intentions to continue studies in
science, (2) curricula to improve girls’ achievement and confidence in science by promoting
images of successful females in science, and (3) classrooms’ and schools’ organizational
structure in ways that benefit girls in science (e.g., after school clubs, summer camps, and mentoring programs).

Students in alternative education programs. The research literature focuses on school wide approaches to promote increased attendance and high school graduation. Specific factors,
taken collectively, correspond with alienation from school prior to dropping-out. Public
alternative schools employ strategies to counteract these factors and increase student
engagement: (1) structured after-school opportunities, (2) family outreach, (3) life skills training,
(4) safe learning environment, and (5) individualized academic support.

Gifted and talented students. Gifted and talented students may have such characteristics
as intense interests, rapid learning, motivation and commitment, curiosity, and questioning skills.
Teachers can employ effective differentiation strategies to promote science learning of gifted and
talented students in four domains: (1) fast pacing, (2) level of challenge (including differentiation
of content), (3) opportunities for self-direction, and (4) strategic grouping.

Home and Community Connections to School Science

While it has long been recognized that building home-school connections is important for
the academic success of non-dominant student groups, in practice, this is rarely done in an
effective manner. There are tensions as parents and families want their children to maintain the
cultural and linguistic practices of their heritage while also wanting their children to participate
fully in the dominant school culture. A challenge facing schools is the perceived disconnect
between school science practices and home and community practices of non-dominant student
groups. Traditionally, research on home-school connections looked at how the family and home
environments of non-dominant student groups measured up to the expectations and practices of

=== Page 9 ===

Page 9 of 21
the dominant group. The results were interpreted in terms of deficits in students’ family and
home environments, as compared to their dominant counterparts. In contrast, more recent
research has identified resources and strengths in the family and home environments of non dominant student groups (Calabrese Barton et al., 2004). Students bring to the science classroom
funds of knowledge from their homes and communities that can serve as resources for academic
learning, and teachers should understand and find ways to activate this prior knowledge
(González, Moll, & Amanti, 2005). Science learning builds on tasks and activities that occur in
the social contexts of day-to-day living, whether or not the school chooses to recognize this.
Through the NGSS, students can engage in scientific and engineering practices,
crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideas by connecting school science to their out-of school experiences in home and community contexts. Several approaches build connections
between home/community and school science: (1) increase parent involvement in their children’s
science classroom by encouraging parents’ roles as partners in science learning, (2) engage
students in defining problems and designing solutions of community projects in their
neighborhoods (typically engineering), and (3) focus on science learning in informal environments.

Parent involvement in school science. Concerted efforts should be made to support and
encourage parent involvement in promoting positive engagement and achievement of non dominant student groups in science classrooms. Siblings and peers can serve as role models on
academic achievement. Parents without academic background in science can still be partners in
their children’s science education by setting high expectations for academic success and higher
education. Teachers can form partnerships with parents, facilitating dialogue to solicit their help
with homework and their attendance at science-related events in the school.
To promote parents’ involvement in school science, schools can play a part to address
parents’ needs from the school and remove roadblocks to participation. Schools may need to
individually invite underserved families on science related field trips, making certain that
particular concerns are met (e.g., child care, translation, transportation) so that the parents are
able to attend. Teachers can create homework assignments that invite joint participation of the
child and parent to complete a task together (e.g., observe the phases of the moon, record water
use in the house). A non-evaluative survey related to science content can generate classroom
discussions that bridge home and school. Homework assignments can encourage dialogue,
increase interest among both parents and students, and solicit home language support for science learning.
Parents from non-dominant backgrounds feel comfortable with the school when they
perceive the school as reflecting their values, and such parents, in turn, are most likely to partner
with the school. For example, a science camp focused on African American achievement had
high parental participation because its goals highlighted issues related to African American
identity and culture (Simpson & Parsons, 2008). Teachers can also increase parent involvement
by relating after-school and summer school themes around values that are important to the families and communities.

Student engagement with school science in community contexts. Strategies that
involve the community underscore the importance of connecting the school science curriculum
to the students’ lives and the community in which they live. It is through these connections that
students who have traditionally been alienated from science recognize science as relevant to their

=== Page 10 ===

June 2013
NGSS Release
Page 10 of 21
lives and future, deepen their understanding of science concepts, develop agency in science, and consider careers in science.
Science learning in community contexts may take different approaches. First, both
disciplinary and informal education experts underscore the connection between science and the
neighborhood that the students reside in. Effective approaches can include engaging in outdoor
exploration (e.g., bird surveys, weather journals) and analyzing local natural resources (e.g., land forms in the neighborhood, soil composition).
Second, the community context for science education capitalizes on the community
resources and funds of knowledge to make science more culturally, linguistically, and socially
relevant for diverse student groups (González, Moll, & Amanti, 2005). For example, a teacher
could tap into the community as a resource by recruiting a community member(s) to assist an
upper elementary class, as students investigate the pollution along a river near the school. By
bringing the neighborhood and community into the science classroom, students learn that science
is not only applicable to events in the classroom, but it also extends to what they experience in
their homes and what they observe in their communities.
Finally, “place-based” science education is consistent with culturally relevant pedagogy
(Ladson-Billings, 1995). Through social activism, students develop critical consciousness of
social inequities, especially as such inequities exist in their communities. When youth find
science education to be empowering and transformative, they are likely to embrace and further
investigate what they are learning, instead of being resistant to learning science. Thus, school
science should be reconceptualized to give a more central role to students’ lived experiences and identities.

Science learning in informal environments. Informal environments for science learning
(e.g., museums, nature centers, zoos, etc.) have the potential to broaden participation in science
and engineering for youth from non-dominant communities. Informal environments may also
include non-institutional opportunities that are not traditionally recognized by school systems
(e.g., community gardens, woodlots, campgrounds). However, informal institutions face
challenges in reaching and serving non-dominant groups, as reflected in low attendance patterns.
Although research on how to structure science learning opportunities to better serve non dominant groups in informal environments is sparse, it highlights two promising insights and practices (NRC, 2009).
First, informal environments for science learning should be developed and implemented
with the interests and concerns of particular cultural groups and communities in mind. Project
goals should be mutually determined by educators and the communities and cultural groups
being served. It is also important to develop strategies that help learners identify with science in
personally meaningful ways. Having community-based contacts that are familiar and safe can be
critical in engaging families in science explorations and conversations and even, at a more basic
level, in helping non-dominant groups see museums as worthwhile destinations for their families.
Second, environments should be developed in ways that expressly draw upon
participants’ cultural practices, including everyday language, linguistic practices, and cultural
experiences. In designed environments, such as museums, bilingual or multilingual labels
provide access to the specific content and facilitate conversations and sense-making among
participants. Developing peer networks may be particularly important to foster sustained
participation of non-dominant groups. Designed spaces that serve families should consider visits
by extended families.  Members of diverse cultural groups can play a critical role in the

development and implementation of programs, serving as designers, advisers, front-line educators, and evaluators of such efforts.

School Resources for Science Instruction

School resources to support student learning generally fall into three categories (Gamoran
et al., 2003; Penuel, Krause, & Frank, 2009). First, material resources include time available for
teaching, professional development, and collaboration among teachers. Material resources also
include curricular materials, equipment, supplies, and expenditures for school personnel and
other purposes related to teaching and learning. Second, human capital includes individual
knowledge, skills, and expertise that might become a part of the stock of resources available in
an organization. In schools, human capital involves teachers’ knowledge, including content
knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and pedagogical content knowledge, as well as principal
leadership. Finally, social capital concerns the relationships among individuals in a group or
organization, including such norms as trust, collaboration, common values, shared responsibility,
a sense of obligation, and collective decision making.
School resources are likely to have a greater impact on the learning opportunities of
non-dominant student groups. This is because the dominant student group is more likely to
have the benefits of other supports for their learning, such as better equipped schools, more
material resources at home, and highly educated parents. In contrast, the academic success of
non-dominant students depends more heavily on the quality of their school environment; yet, it
is these students who are less likely to have access to high quality learning environments. Thus,
inequitable resources are a central concern. The NGSS present both opportunities and
challenges to reconceptualize the allocation and utilization of school resources.

Material resources. Science receives less instructional time (a form of material
resources) than language arts and mathematics, which are both considered to be basic skills.
Particularly, science instruction in low-performing schools is often limited and tightly regulated
due to the urgency of developing basic literacy and numeracy. In addition, under the demands of
accountability policies, schools devote extended time and attention to the heavily tested subjects
of language arts and mathematics, leaving limited time for science.
The NGSS capitalize on the synergy with the CCSS for English language arts and literacy
and for mathematics. The standards across the three subject areas share common shifts to focus
on core concepts and practices that build coherently across K-12. Scientific and engineering
practices in the NGSS (e.g., argumentation from evidence) share commonalities with those of the
CCSS for English language arts and for mathematics (see Figure 1). Furthermore, the CCSS for
literacy require strong content knowledge, informational texts, and text complexity across
subject areas, including science. In a similar manner, the NGSS make connections to the CCSS.
Such synergy will help effective use of instructional time among English language arts, mathematics, and science.

Human capital. While all students deserve access to highly qualified teachers, schools
serving non-dominant student groups require the most effective teachers to enable students to
overcome achievement gaps (Marx & Harris, 2006). The NGSS require science teachers who
possess knowledge of disciplinary core ideas, scientific and engineering practices, and
crosscutting concepts. For non-dominant student groups, teachers should also be able to connect

science to students’ home and community experiences as the students engage in the NGSS. Such
expectations present both opportunities and challenges to teacher preparation and professional
development for urban or low-performing schools where non-dominant student groups tend to be concentrated.
NGSS is built on continuity of learning progressions across grade levels. This presents
both opportunities and challenges to students who are highly mobile or transient. On one hand,
the nationwide purview of the NGSS may help these students by providing them with consistent
standards among states, districts, and schools. On the other hand, this assumption may impede
the ability of new immigrant students to catch up as they are unable to draw from a base of years
of shared experiences. Likewise, students who miss school because of homelessness or other
reasons for mobility may struggle to fill gaps in understanding.

Social capital. The conditions of urban or low-performing schools are not conducive to
building social resources in the form of trust, collaboration, and high expectations collectively.
Urban settings present challenges, including overcrowding, management issues, and emotional
concerns related to conditions of poverty in students’ homes.
The NGSS reinforce the need for collaboration among teachers of different
specializations and subject areas beyond the traditional forms of collaboration. Science teachers
need to work with special education teachers and teachers of English language learners in order
to foster a deeper understanding of science. In addition, science, math, and English language arts
teachers need to work together in order to address both the opportunities and demands for
meaningful connections among these subject areas. Furthermore, collaboration needs to involve
the entire school personnel, including teachers, administrators, counselors, etc. Utilization and
development of social capital among school personnel is key to effective implementation of the
NGSS with all students, particularly students from non-dominant groups.

Context

To engage all students in learning the NGSS, it is important to understand the context that
influences science learning by diverse student groups. This section briefly describes student
demographics, science achievement, and educational policies affecting non-dominant student
groups. More details are presented in each of the seven case studies in terms of economically
disadvantaged students, racial or ethnic minority students, students with disabilities, English
language learners, girls, students in alternative education programs, and gifted and talented students.

Student Demographics

The student population in the U.S. is increasingly more diverse:

 Economically disadvantaged students. The American Community Survey report
from the U.S. Census Bureau summarized the poverty data (U.S. Census Bureau,
2012). Overall 21.6% of children in the U.S. live in poverty, the highest poverty rate
since the poverty survey began in 2001. The poverty rate was the highest for Black at
38.2% and Hispanic at 32.3%, compared to White at 17.0% and Asian at 13.0%.
According to the Common Core of Data report, 48% of students were eligible for free

or reduced price lunch in 2010-11. A greater number of students live in poverty in the
cities compared to suburban areas, towns, and rural areas.

 Students from major racial or ethnic minority groups. The student population in
the U.S. is increasingly more diverse racially and ethnically. According to the 2010
U.S. Census, 36% of the U.S. population is composed of racial minorities, including
16% Hispanics, 13% Blacks, 5% Asians, and 1% American Indian or Native
Alaskans (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). Among the school age population under 19
years old in 2010, 45% were minorities. It is projected that the year 2022 will be the
turning point when minorities will become the majority in terms of percentage of the school-age population.

 Students with disabilities. The number of children and youth ages 3-21 receiving
special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
(IDEA) rose from 4.1 million to 6.7 million between 1980 and 2005, or from 10% to
14% of the student enrollment (National Center for Education Statistics [NCES],
2011). That number decreased to 6.5 million or 13% of student enrollment by 2009.

 Students with limited English proficiency. Over 1 in 5 students (21%) speak a
language other than English at home, and limited English Proficient (LEP) students
(the federal term) have more than doubled from 5% in 1993 to 11% in 2007. The 11%
of LEP students does not count those who were classified as LEP when younger but
who are now considered proficient in English or during a monitoring period.

 Students in alternative education programs. Reporting the demographics of
students in alternative education is difficult due to wide inconsistencies in definitions
across the nation. A significant proportion of students who attend public alternative
schools specifically targeting dropout prevention are economically disadvantaged
students, racial and ethnic minorities, and English language learners (NCES, 2012).

 Gifted and talented students. Reporting the demographics of gifted and talented
students is difficult due to wide inconsistencies in definitions, assessments to identify
these students, and funding for programs across the nation. The National Association
for Gifted Children (NAGC, 2012) defines giftedness as “those who demonstrate
outstanding levels of aptitude or competence in one or more domains” and estimates
that this definition describes approximately three million or roughly 6% of all students, K-12.

Several caveats are made with regard to student diversity. First, each demographic
subgroup is not a homogenous or monolithic group, and there is a great deal of variability among
members of the group. For example, categories of disabilities include specific learning
disabilities, speech and language impairments, other health impairments, intellectual disability,
emotional disturbance, developmental delay, autism, multiple disabilities, hearing impairment,
visual impairment, orthopedic impairment, deaf-blindness, and traumatic brain injury. These
categories could be classified as cognitive, emotional, and physical disabilities. Such variability
among members of a group cautions that essentializing should be avoided.

Second, there is a significant overlap among non-dominant student groups. For example,
most English language learners are racial or ethnic minorities. In addition, 60% of economically
disadvantaged students, including large proportions of racial or ethnic minorities and English
language learners, live cities (NCES, 2012). As a result, these students face multiple challenges in achieving academic success.
Finally, specific student groups are either overrepresented or underrepresented in
education programs. For example, females are underrepresented in engineering and physics
(NSF, 2012). Racial or ethnic minority students, economically disadvantaged students, and
English language learners are underrepresented in gifted and talented programs, whereas they are
overrepresented in special education programs (Harry & Klingner, 2006).

Science Achievement

While the student population in the U.S. is becoming more diverse, science achievement
gaps persist by demographic subgroups. The results of international and national science
assessments indicate the need for a two-pronged approach to enhancing student science
outcomes. Achievement gaps must be closed among demographic subgroups of students, while
improved science outcomes should be promoted for all students. In the report, “Preparing the
Next Generation of STEM Innovators (NSF, 2010), the National Science Board states, “In
America, it should be possible, even essential, to elevate the achievement of low-performing at risk groups while simultaneously lifting the ceiling of achievement for our future innovators” (p.
16).
U.S. students have not ranked favorably on international comparisons of science
achievement as measured by Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS)
and Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). Although TIMSS science results for
U.S. 4th and 8th graders showed positive trends since its first administration in 1995 through the
latest administration in 2007, PISA results for 15 year olds did not corroborate trends indicated
by TIMSS. When it comes to applying science in meaningful ways (e.g., using scientific
evidence, identifying scientific issues, and explaining phenomena scientifically) as measured by
PISA, U.S. students performed in the bottom half of the international comparison and did not
show significant improvements since its first administration in 2000 through its latest administration in 2009.
At the national level, National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) provides data
for U.S. students’ science performance over time. Focusing only on more recent NAEP science
assessments in 1996, 2000, 2005, 2009, and 2011, achievement gaps persist among demographic
subgroups of students across grades 4, 8, and 12. Results are reported by family income level
(based on eligibility for the National School Lunch Program), race or ethnicity, students with
disabilities, English language learners, gender, and type of school (public or private). It is noted
that these subgroups represent the accountability groups defined in ESEA.
The framework for NAEP science involves science content in three areas (physical
science, life science, and Earth and space sciences) and four science practices (identifying
science principles, using science principles, using scientific inquiry, and using technological
design). Two developments are noteworthy in relation to the NGSS. First, the 2009 NAEP
science assessment included interactive computer and hands-on tasks to measure how well
students were able to reason through complex problems and apply science to real-life situations.
This approach could pave a way for assessment of scientific and engineering practices in the

=== Page 15 ===

June 2013
NGSS Release
Page 15 of 21
NGSS. Second, the first-ever NAEP Technology and Engineering Literacy Assessment (TELA)
is currently under development. The initial assessment, planned for 2014, will be a probe—a
smaller-scale, focused assessment on a timely topic that explores a particular question or issue.
This approach could be used for assessment of engineering in the NGSS.
A clear understanding of science achievement gaps should take into account certain
methodological limitations in how these gaps are measured and reported. Science achievement is
typically measured by standardized tests administered to national and international student
samples. A strength of these measures is that they provide access to large data sets that allow for
the use of powerful statistical analyses. However, these measures also present limitations.
First, standardized tests provide only a general picture of how demographic variables
relate to science achievement. For example, “Hispanic” is likely to be treated as a single category
of race or ethnicity, masking potentially important differences in performance among Mexican-
Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban-Americans. Similarly, the group of students with
disabilities (SD) is generic, referring to students who usually have Individualized Education
Programs (IEP) and could include both learning disabled (LD) or emotionally disturbed (ED).
Thus, achievement data are generally lumped together for very different disabilities. Such
overgeneralization hinders more nuanced understanding of achievement gaps, thereby limiting
the potential effectiveness of educational interventions aimed at reducing these gaps.
Second, standardized tests have the potential to reinforce stereotypes, both positive and
negative, of certain demographic groups (Rodriguez, 1998). For example, the “model minority”
stereotype of Asian American students as strong performers in mathematics and science may
well be supported by generalized test data for the racial category of Asian American. However,
such a result masks great disparities within this group, such as Southeast Asian refugees with
limited literacy development in their homes or communities. These students are less likely to
have their needs met in equitable ways if teachers presume that they “naturally” learn science
and mathematics with little trouble. In contrast, high-achieving Hispanic or African American
students may be disadvantaged by teachers or counselors who underestimate them and set low expectations of their academic success.
Finally, standardized tests do not analyze or report interactions between demographic
variables. For example, as racial/ethnic minority students are disproportionately represented in
free or reduced price lunch programs, science achievement gaps between race/ethnicity and
socioeconomic status are confounded. In a similar manner, science achievement gaps between race/ethnicity and gender are confounded.

Educational Policies

The passing of the NCLB Act of 2001 (the reauthorized Elementary and Secondary
Education Act [ESEA]) ushered in a new era of high-stakes testing and accountability policies.
Districts and schools are accountable for making an adequate level of achievement gain each
year, referred to as annual yearly progress (AYP). The theory behind ESEA (NCLB) assumes
that states, districts, and schools will allocate resources to best facilitate the attainment of AYP.
Decisions concerning resources and practices are determined largely by test scores on state assessments.
Although ESEA is most often associated with accountability systems, there is a second
property of ESEA that has also been a focus of attention. ESEA mandates that each state report
AYP disaggregated for demographic subgroups of students. Mandating this disaggregated

=== Page 16 ===

June 2013
NGSS Release
Page 16 of 21
reporting of AYP results in potentially desirable outcomes: (a) each of the groups is publicly
monitored to examine achievement and progress; (b) resources are allocated differentially to
these groups to enhance the likelihood that they meet AYP; and (c) if AYP is not met for these
groups in schools receiving Title I funding, students are provided with additional academic
assistance through Supplemental Educational Services (e.g., tutoring) and the right to transfer to
another public school. Schools, districts, and states cannot hide historically underperforming
demographic groups, since ESEA forces the state to publicly monitor these groups and to be
accountable for their performance. On the undesirable side, however, all of the added attention to
high-stakes testing does not necessarily result in improved teaching. In fact, the increased
emphasis on testing could detract from academically rigorous learning opportunities that are
often lacking with students from certain demographic subgroups. Similarly, calling more public
attention to the failures of schools to adequately meet the needs of these students does little to
ensure that they will receive instruction that is more engaging, more intellectually challenging, or more culturally or socially relevant.
Although ESEA mandates reporting of AYP for reading and mathematics, the same is not
true for science. With respect to science, ESEA only requires that by the 2007-2008 school year
each state would have science assessments to be administered and reported for formative
purposes at least once during grades 3-5, grades 6-9, and grades 10-12. However, it is up to each
state to decide whether to include high-stakes science testing in state accountability systems or
AYP reporting. Although science accountability policies affect all students, the impact is far
greater for student groups that have traditionally been underserved in the education system.
Separate from federal and state policies that apply to all students, specific policies apply
to specific student groups. According to the ESEA Act:

 Title I is the largest federally funded educational program intended for “improving
the academic achievement of the disadvantaged” in order to meet “the educational
needs of low-achieving children in our Nation's highest-poverty schools, limited
English proficient children, migratory children, children with disabilities, Indian
children, neglected or delinquent children, and young children in need of reading assistance.”

 Title I, Part H, states that the Dropout Prevention Act aims “to provide for school
dropout prevention and reentry and to raise academic achievement levels by
providing grants that (1) challenge all children to attain their highest academic
potential; and (2) ensure that all students have substantial and ongoing opportunities
to attain their highest academic potential through school-wide programs proven
effective in school dropout prevention and reentry.”

 Title III addresses “language instruction for limited English proficient and immigrant students.”

 Title VII is designed for “Indian, Native Hawaiian, and Alaska Native education.”

 Title IX prevents gender-based discrimination within federally funded educational
programs. Title IX states, "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex,
be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to

=== Page 17 ===

Page 17 of 21
discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial
assistance" (Public Law No. 92-318, 86 Stat. 235).

 Title IX, Part A, SEC. 9101 (22), provides a federal definition and federal research
funding for gifted and talented students: "The term gifted and talented, when used
with respect to students, children, or youth, means students, children, or youth who
give evidence of high achievement capability in areas such as intellectual, creative,
artistic, or leadership capacity, or in specific academic fields, and who need services
or activities not ordinarily provided by the school in order to fully develop those capabilities."

 The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a law ensuring services to children with disabilities.

Conclusions and Implications

The NGSS offer a vision of science teaching and learning that presents both learning
opportunities and demands for all students, particularly student groups that have traditionally
been underrepresented in the science classroom. Furthermore, the NGSS are connected to the
CCSS for English language arts and mathematics. Changes in the new standards occur as student
demographics in the nation become increasingly diverse while science achievement gaps persist among demographic subgroups.
The academic rigor and expectations of the NGSS are less familiar to many science
teachers than conventional or traditional teaching practices and require shifts for science
teaching, which are consistent with shifts for teaching the CCSS for English language arts and
mathematics (see Figure 1). Science teachers need to acquire effective strategies to include all
students regardless of racial, ethnic, cultural, linguistic, socioeconomic, and gender backgrounds.
While effective classroom strategies that enable students to engage in the NGSS will draw from
the existing research literature, the NGSS will also stimulate new research agenda. For example,
future research may identify ways to make connections between school science and
home/community for non-dominant student groups as they engage in the NGSS. Future research
may also explore how to utilize and allocate school resources to support student learning in terms
of material resources, human capital, and social capital in relation to the NGSS.
Effective implementation of the NGSS for all students, including non-dominant student
groups, will require shifts in the education support system. Key components of the support
system include teacher preparation and professional development, principal support and
leadership, public-private-community partnerships, formal and informal classroom experiences
that require considerable coordination among community stakeholders, technological
capabilities, network infrastructure, cyber-learning opportunities, access to digital resources,
online learning communities, and virtual laboratories. As the NGSS implementation takes root
over time, these components of the education system will also evolve and change accordingly.
