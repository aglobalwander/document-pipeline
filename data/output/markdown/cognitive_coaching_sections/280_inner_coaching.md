## INNER COACHING

The success of an intervention depends on the inner condition of the intervener.

-Bill O'Brien

Mark Treadwell (2014, 12) states: 'Our 'inner voice' is what we use to reflect on what we do, how and why we behave in the way we do, how we critique ourselves and how we connect the knowledge, ideas, concepts, and concept frameworks developed using each of our four learning systems. It is the voice that challenges us to strive further and the voice that condemns our foolishness.'

Before being a spectator of others, you need to be a spectator of yourself. Before any visit to classrooms or conversations with a teacher,

you must engage your 'inner coach.' You need to engage your own internal dialogue-a metacognitive rehearsal inside your own mind. The questions you ask yourself and the answers you provide yourself help to clarify and direct your skills and competencies as an observer and coach. They also influence the success of the observation and the conversation for the teacher. Interrogative self-talk-questions-elicit in your mind an active response and give you an opportunity to prepare and rehearse (Pink 2014). For examples of inner dialogues in preparation for a variety of coaching situations, please refer to appendix B.
