AP Equity and Access Policy
College Board strongly encourages educators to make equitable access a guiding
principle for their AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared
students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination
of barriers that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and
socioeconomic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented. Schools
should make every effort to ensure their AP classes reflect the diversity of their
student population. College Board also believes that all students should have
access to academically challenging course work before they enroll in AP classes,
which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to
equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.

About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills
that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking AP
courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and AP
Exams are developed and scored by college faculty and
experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges and
universities in the United States grant credit, advanced placement, or both on the basis of successful AP
Exam scores—more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams
emphasize challenging, research-based curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources. This
course and exam description presents the content and
skills that are the focus of the corresponding college
course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also organizes
the content and skills into a series of units that represent
a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks
and that many AP teachers have told us they follow in
order to focus their instruction. The intention of this
publication is to respect teachers’ time and expertise
by providing a roadmap that they can modify and adapt
to their local priorities and preferences. Moreover, by
organizing the AP course content and skills into units,
the AP Program is able to provide teachers and students with free formative assessments—Personal Progress
Checks—that teachers can assign throughout the year
to measure student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students: Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP success.
It is only through a commitment to equitable
preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses:
The AP Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP
courses must participate in the AP Course Audit, a
process through which AP teachers’ course materials
are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.
1 ﻿
AP Biology Course and Exam Description
Return to Table of Contents © 2020 College Board

=== Page 9 ===
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the AP teacher
and the school principal (or designated administrator) to
confirm awareness and understanding of the curricular
and resource requirements. A syllabus or course outline,
detailing how course requirements are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The AP
Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor; all
AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision, piloting,
and analysis to ensure that questions are accurate, fair,
and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development, College
Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher education
institutions. This feedback is carefully considered to
ensure that AP courses and exams are able to provide
students with a college-level learning experience and
the opportunity to demonstrate their qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam
development process, relies on the expertise of both
AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice
questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course performance
assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands
of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are
scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion
is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained,
and their work is monitored throughout the Reading
for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief
Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers
in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of
the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a
curve. Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which
means that every student who meets the criteria for
an AP score of 2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no
matter how many students that is. The criteria for the
number of points students must earn on the AP Exam
to receive scores of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently validates for credit and placement
purposes—include:
Bullet The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
Bullet The number of points researchers have found to
be predictive that an AP student will succeed when
placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
Bullet Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP
scores as follows:

While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for
scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and universities.
To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/placement policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/creditpolicies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for
seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score
the free-response sections of the AP Exams. Ninety eight percent of surveyed educators who took part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an
AP Reader, including opportunities to:
Bullet Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
Bullet Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP
scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure to the quality and depth of the responses from the
entire pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
Bullet Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
Bullet Score from home: AP Readers have online distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects. Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
Bullet Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs): AP
Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide suggests a
sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds skill instruction across units, organizes content
into topics, and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course topics and skills, create
customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.﻿

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students and
teachers access to the resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
Bullet Teachers and students sign in to, or create, their College Board accounts.
Bullet Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
Bullet Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
Bullet Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP coordinator.
§Bullet
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and AP coordinators
to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following additional benefits:
Bullet Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
Bullet Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
Bullet Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student pack.
The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
Bullet Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

Introduction
Given the speed with which scientific discoveries and
research continuously expand scientific knowledge, many educators are faced with the challenge of balancing breadth of content coverage with depth of understanding. The AP Biology course outlined in this framework embraces this challenge by deemphasizing a traditional “content coverage” model of instruction in favor of one that focuses on enduring, conceptual understandings and the content that supports them. This approach enables students to spend less time on factual recall and more time on inquiry-based learning of essential
concepts, helping them develop the reasoning skills necessary to engage in the science practices used throughout their study of AP Biology.
To foster this deeper level of learning, the breadth of
content coverage in AP Biology is defined in a way
that distinguishes content essential to support the enduring understandings from the many examples or applications that can overburden the course.
Illustrative examples are provided that offer you a
variety of optional instructional contexts to help your students achieve deeper understanding. Content
that is outside the scope of the course and exam is also identified.
This framework encourages student development
of inquiry and reasoning skills, such as designing
a plan for collecting data, analyzing data, applying mathematical routines, and justifying arguments
using evidence. The result will be readiness for the study of advanced topics in subsequent college courses—a goal of every AP course.

AP BIOLOGY
Course
Content
Based on the Understanding by Design® (Wiggins and McTighe) model, this
course framework provides a clear and detailed description of the course
requirements necessary for student success. The framework specifies what
students must know, be able to do, and understand, with a focus on the big ideas
that encompass core principles, theories, and processes of the discipline. The
framework also encourages instruction that prepares students for advanced work in STEM and life science–related majors.
Big Ideas
The big ideas serve as the foundation of the course and allow students to create
meaningful connections among course concepts. Often, they are abstract
concepts or themes that become threads that run throughout the course.
Revisiting the big ideas and applying them in a variety of contexts allow students
to develop deeper conceptual understandings. Following are the big ideas of the course and a brief description of each:
2
BIG IDEA 1: EVOLUTION (EVO)
The process of evolution drives the diversity and unity of life. Evolution
is a change in the genetic makeup of a population over time, with natural
selection as its major driving mechanism. Darwin’s theory, which is supported
by evidence from many scientific disciplines, states that inheritable variations
occur in individuals in a population. Due to competition for limited resources,
individuals with more favorable genetic variations are more likely to survive
and produce more offspring, thus passing traits to future generations. A
diverse gene pool is vital for the survival of species because environmental
conditions change. The process of evolution explains the diversity and unity
of life, but an explanation about the origin of life is less clear.
In addition to the process of natural selection, naturally occurring
catastrophic and human-induced events as well as random environmental
changes can result in alteration in the gene pools of populations.
Scientific evidence supports that speciation and extinction have occurred
throughout Earth’s history and that life continues to evolve within a
changing environment, thus explaining the diversity of life.
Course Framework V.1 | 17
AP Biology Course and Exam Description

=== Page 25 ===
BIG IDEA 2: ENERGETICS (ENE)
Biological systems use energy and molecular building blocks to grow,
reproduce, and maintain dynamic homeostasis. Cells and organisms
must exchange matter with the environment. Organisms respond to
changes in their environment at the molecular, cellular, physiological, and
behavioral levels. Living systems require energy and matter to maintain
order, grow, and reproduce. Organisms employ various strategies
to capture, use, and store energy and other vital resources. Energy
deficiencies are not only detrimental to individual organisms but they can
cause disruptions at the population and ecosystem levels. Homeostatic
mechanisms that are conserved or divergent across related organisms
reflect either continuity due to common ancestry or evolutionary change in response to distinct selective pressures.
BIG IDEA 3: INFORMATION STORAGE AND TRANSMISSION (IST)
Living systems store, retrieve, transmit, and respond to information
essential to life processes. Genetic information provides for continuity
of life, and, in most cases, this information is passed from parent to
offspring via DNA. Nonheritable information transmission influences
behavior within and between cells, organisms, and populations. These
behaviors are directed by underlying genetic information, and responses to
information are vital to natural selection and evolution. Genetic information
is a repository of instructions necessary for the survival, growth, and
reproduction of the organism. Genetic variation can be advantageous for
the long-term survival and evolution of a species.
BIG IDEA 4: SYSTEMS INTERACTIONS (SYI)
Biological systems interact, and these systems and their interactions
exhibit complex properties. All biological systems comprise parts that
interact with one another. These interactions result in characteristics and
emergent properties not found in the individual parts alone. All biological
systems from the molecular level to the ecosystem level exhibit properties
of biocomplexity and diversity. These two properties provide robustness to
biological systems, enabling greater resiliency and flexibility to tolerate and respond to changes in the environment.

UNITS
The course content is organized into commonly taught units. The units have been arranged in a common sequence frequently found in many college courses and textbooks.
The eight units in AP Biology, and their weightings on the
multiple-choice section of the AP Exam, are listed below.
Pacing recommendations at the unit level and on the
Course at Glance provide suggestions for how you can
teach the required course content and administer the
Personal Progress Checks. The suggested class periods
are based on a schedule in which the class meets five days a week for 45 minutes each day. While these
recommendations have been made to aid in planning,
teachers should of course adjust the pacing based on
the needs of their students, alternate schedules (e.g.,
block scheduling), or their school’s academic calendar.
TOPICS
Each unit is broken down into teachable segments
called topics. The topic pages (starting on p. 34)
contain all required content for each topic. Although
most topics can be taught in one or two class periods,
teachers should pace the course to suit the needs of their students and school.

Introduction
Developed with extensive input from the community of AP Biology
educators, these unit guides offer all teachers helpful guidance in
building students’ skills and knowledge. The suggested sequence
presented in the unit guides was identified through a thorough analysis of
the syllabi of highly effective AP teachers and the organization of typical college textbooks.
This unit structure respects new AP teachers’ time by providing one
possible sequence they can adopt or modify, rather than having to build
from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units enable the AP
Program to provide interested teachers with formative assessments – the
Personal Progress Checks – that they can assign their students at the end
of each unit to gauge progress toward success on the AP exam. However,
experienced AP teachers who are satisfied with their current course
organization and exam results should feel no pressure to adopt these
units, which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

AP Biology Course and Exam Description
UNIT 1
Building Science Practices
1.A
2.A 6.E.b
The ability to describe biological processes, principles, and concepts is central to the study of biology. Visual representations and models are important tools to help students understand relationships within biological systems.
In this unit the successful student should use visual representations to demonstrate understanding of how the properties of water allow it to play a major role in biological systems and to show the properties and structure of biological macromolecules.
In biology, an argument involves making a claim, supporting it with evidence, and providing reasoning to support the claim.
Beginning in this unit and throughout the course, students should become proficient in argumentation by predicting the causes or effects of a change in, or disruption to, one or more components in a biological system. The instructional focus of this unit should be on describing the structure and function of biological macromolecules and describing the relationship between structure and function.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The AP Biology Exam requires students to make predictions and justify their reasoning in real-world scenarios. Students are expected to interpret and evaluate experimental results, analyze biological concepts and scientific investigations, and perform data analysis and statistical testing.
A foundational concept for students to understand is that biological systems depend on relationships that, when compromised, can have far-reaching consequences within the system. These consequences can sometimes be deleterious for cells, organisms, and even ecosystems. This understanding will help students make and justify predictions about how the changes in a biological system affect its function.
On the exam, students tend to struggle with the use of language and similar terms, for example, protein versus proton. This confusion
often results in a failure to earn points on free response questions. Teachers should hold students accountable for the proper use of appropriate terms throughout the course.
Developing Understanding
This first unit sets the foundation for students to understand the chemical basis of life, which
is needed for mastery of future areas of focus and provides students with a survey of the
elements necessary for carbon-based systems to function. Students learn that water and
the properties of water play a vital role in the survival of individuals and biological systems.
They also learn that living systems exist in a highly complex organization that requires input of
energy and the exchange of macromolecules. This unit also addresses in detail how and in what
conformations molecules called monomers bond together to form polymers. The structure of
monomers and polymers determines their function. In the units that follow, students will need to
understand and explain the interaction and bonding of atoms to form molecules.

UNIT OPENERS
Developing Understanding provides an overview that
contextualizes and situates the key content of the unit within the scope of the course.
The big ideas serve as the foundation of the course and help
students to create meaningful connections among concepts.
They are often overarching concepts or themes that spiral
throughout the course. The essential questions are thought provoking questions that motivate students and inspire inquiry.
Building Science Practices describes specific aspects of the
practices that are appropriate to focus on in that unit.
Preparing for the AP Exam provides helpful tips and common
student misunderstandings identified from prior exam data.
Using the Unit Guides
The Unit at a Glance table shows the topics, related enduring
understandings, and suggested skills. The “class periods”
column has been left blank so you can customize the time you spend on each topic.
The table includes suggested skills for each topic to show
possible ways to link the content in that topic to specific AP
Biology skills. The individual skills have been thoughtfully
chosen in a way that allows you to scaffold the skills throughout
the course. The questions on the Personal Progress Checks are
based on this pairing. However, AP Exam questions can pair the content with any of the skills.

TOPIC PAGES
The suggested skill offers a possible skill to pair with the topic.
Available resources are included where possible to help address a particular topic in your classroom.
Enduring understandings are the long-term takeaways related
to the big ideas that leave a lasting impression on students.
Students build and earn these understandings over time by
exploring and applying course content throughout the year.
Learning objectives define what a student needs to be able
to do with content knowledge in order to progress toward the enduring understandings.
Essential knowledge statements describe the knowledge required to perform the learning objective.
Exclusion statements define content or specific details about
the content that do not need to be included in the course because
teaching this level of detail does not further the conceptual
understanding students will need to be successful in this course.
Although excluded content will not be assessed on the AP Biology
Exam, such content may be provided as background or additional
information for the concept and science practice(s) being assessed.
Illustrative examples are suggested, not required, contexts for
instruction that can help students understand a required concept.
They can be chosen according to the availability of data, regional
relevance, interests of the students, and expertise of the instructor.
Exposure to a variety of illustrative examples will allow students to
focus their learning to apply a conceptual understanding across multiple biological systems and/or scales.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
SYI-1.B.2
Structure and function of polymers are derived from the way their monomers are assembled—
Bullet In nucleic acids, biological information is encoded in sequences of nucleotide monomers. Each nucleotide has structural
components: a five-carbon sugar (deoxyribose or ribose), a phosphate, and a nitrogen base (adenine, thymine, guanine, cytosine, or uracil). DNA and RNA differ in structure and function.
Bullet	In proteins, the specific order of amino acids in a polypeptide (primary structure) determines the overall shape of the protein.
Amino acids have directionality, with an amino (NH2) terminus and a carboxyl (COOH) terminus. The R group of an amino acid can be categorized by chemical properties (hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or ionic), and the interactions of these R groups determine structure and function of that region of the protein.
c. Complex carbohydrates comprise sugar monomers whose structures determine the properties and functions of the molecules.

SYI-1.C.1
Directionality of the subcomponents influences structure and function of the polymer—
BulletNucleic acids have a linear sequence of nucleotides that have ends, defined by the 3’ hydroxyl and 5’ phosphates of the sugar in the nucleotide. During DNA and RNA synthesis, nucleotides are added to the 3’ end of the growing strand, resulting in the formation of a covalent bond between nucleotides.
BulletDNA is structured as an antiparallel double helix, with each strand running in opposite 5’ to 3’ orientation. Adenine nucleotides pair with thymine nucleotides via two hydrogen bonds. Cytosine nucleotides pair with guanine nucleotides by three hydrogen bonds.
BulletProteins comprise linear chains of amino acids, connected by the formation of covalent bonds at the carboxyl terminus of the growing peptide chain.

1.B
6.B  4.A 6.E.b  6.E.a 5.A.d
A solid understanding of the origin and function of organelles is the foundation for understanding cell biology. Students should explain the relationships between structure and function of organelles and cellular components on the subcellular and cellular levels.
Understanding biological systems frequently requires students to select the data necessary to solve a problem and use them to perform the appropriate calculations with correct units while showing their work and linking the results to a biological process. Students should gain proficiency in describing the characteristics of data given in a diagram, graph, or data table and identify patterns or trends in the data.
Selecting and creating the appropriate type of graph for a set of data are critical skills for communicating data that students should begin to master in this unit. Students should routinely practice analyzing different types of data, both hypothetical and those they collect, to identify patterns, connect variables, and perform statistical analysis.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the exam, students frequently can correctly identify an organelle but fail to accurately describe its function. Students should be able to explain the relationships between structure and function on both the subcellular and cellular level. Avoid using catchy analogies (e.g., cell city) and food-based models because on the exam students tend to write about the analogy without demonstrating an understanding of its underlying concept using appropriate terminology.
The graphing skills learned in this unit are important. Students should be able to label the independent and dependent variables with units, correctly plot data points with appropriate scaling, and correctly represent the data in question. For instance, a line graph should be used for continuous data and a bar graph for categorical data.
Students often fail to earn points because they draw error bars incorrectly and fail to use them to draw conclusions about the significance of the data.
Developing Understanding
The cell is the basic unit of life. Cells contribute to the organization of life and provide the
environment in which organelles function. Organelles in turn provide compartmentalization and
organize cellular products for dispersal and waste for disposal. Cells have membranes that allow
them to establish and maintain an internal environment. These membranes also control the
exchange of material with the cell’s external environment—an important, foundational concept.
The maintenance of the internal and external conditions of a cell is called homeostasis. Student
understanding of these concepts will be necessary in later units when the focus of instruction
shifts to cellular products and by-products and when students learn why cellular exchange of energy and materials matters.

Since students learned how to make scientific claims in the previous unit, the instructional focus of this unit should be on gaining proficiency in argumentation through supporting claims with evidence. The evidence can be from biological principles, concepts, processes, and/or data. Students should provide reasoning to justify a claim by connecting evidence to biological theories.
A key concept in this unit is structure function relationships. This should be reinforced in context as students proceed through the course. It is important that students understand rates of enzyme reactions and how they are affected by environmental factors, such as enzyme or substrate concentration, pH, temperature, and the presence of inhibitors.
As students learn about cellular respiration and photosynthesis, be sure to emphasize the differences between the two processes, how they function together within an ecosystem, and the consequences of a disruption in either process on a cellular, organismal, and ecosystem level.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Students often lack an understanding of metabolic pathways, confusing them with other processes. Students should know inputs and outputs of metabolic pathways, predict how changes in reactants affect them, and explain how organisms and ecosystems are affected by changes.
Common misconceptions include: only animals conduct cellular respiration, oxygen is created during photosynthesis, and only plants conduct photosynthesis. Be sure to make clear the distinction between memorizing molecules and demonstrating an understanding of how molecular events connect to overall function of organisms and to carbon transfer within ecosystems.
Students should have an understanding of cellular respiration and photosynthesis to predict and justify the effect of environmental changes on those processes.
Students may be required to graph data from an experiment—using the skills learned in Unit 2—and calculate reaction rates. Students are advised to show their calculations, ensuring that units are included in their final answer.
Developing Understanding
In Unit 3, students build on knowledge gained in Unit 2 about the structure and function of
cells, focusing on cellular energetics. Living systems are complex in their organization and
require constant energy input. This unit will provide students with the knowledge necessary to
master the concepts of energy capture and use. Students work through enzyme structure and
function, learning the ways in which the environment plays a role in how enzymes perform their
function(s). Students gain a deeper understanding of the processes of photosynthesis and
cellular respiration, knowledge they will use in Unit 6 while studying how cells use energy to fuel life processes.

For the AP Exam, students must have a deep understanding of the significance of the steps in cell signaling, the amplification of the signal, the recycling of relay molecules between activated and inactivated forms to regulate the cellular response, and the multiple roles of the same molecules in providing specificity. Using the principles of cell signaling, students should be able to explain—using claim, evidence, and reasoning—how a drug works or how the symptoms of a chronic disease arise.
Students should understand that signal molecules bind to receptors and that gene expression can be stimulated by signal transduction.
Students build on their abilities to describe and explain biological concepts and processes by describing the cell cycle regulation. Students should now be able to explain the relationships between structure and function for all organelles and cellular components on both the subcellular and the cellular level.
By performing laboratory investigations focused on the concepts of cell cycle, students should develop an understanding of how to formulate and devise a plan to investigate the answer to a scientific question—critical skills for scientific inquiry. Students continue to build skills in communicating the results of scientific inquiry. This is a unit where students can be given opportunities to practice their graphing skills.
Students may be expected to predict the effect on a cell if there is a disruption in the cell cycle. A common error on the exam is failure to explain the purpose and timing of the cell cycle checkpoints. Students should also be prepared to answer a comparative question about mitosis and meiosis.
Developing Understanding
In Unit 4, students continue to learn about the role of cells, focusing on how cells use energy
and information transmission to communicate and replicate. Through systems of complex
transduction pathways, cells can communicate with one another. Cells can also generate
and receive signals, coordinate mechanisms for growth, and respond to environmental
cues. To maintain homeostasis, cells respond to their environment. They can also replicate
and regulate replication as part of the cell cycle that provides for the continuity of life.
In Unit 5, students will move on to learn about heredity.

Signaling begins with the recognition of a chemical messenger—a ligand—by a receptor protein in a target cell— a. The ligand-binding domain of a receptor recognizes a specific chemical messenger, which can be a peptide, a small chemical, or protein, in a specific one-to-one relationship.
b. G protein-coupled receptors are an example of a receptor protein in eukaryotes.
IST-3.D.2
Signaling cascades relay signals from receptors to cell targets, often amplifying the incoming signals, resulting in the appropriate responses by the cell, which could include cell growth, secretion of molecules, or gene expression—

Building Science Practices 1.B  1.C  3.A  5.C  6.E.b
Preparing for the AP Exam 6.E.c
In this unit students need to analyze and construct models of chromosomal exchange, using them to predict the results of a given scenario, such as a mistake in crossing over or the haploid results of meiosis.
Data can convey important information about biological systems. In order to understand that information, students need to practice describing data and then identifying and describing the patterns and trends that might make the data meaningful for the researcher and possibly lead to the discovery of new information or the development of new concepts. Comparing patterns and trends in data helps students describe biological changes that occur over time, predict short-term and long-term changes, and draw conclusions about the causes and/or solutions to problems in biological systems.
Students also need to calculate genotypic and/or phenotypic ratios. Be sure students understand the difference in these two types of ratios, as confusion between them is a common student error on the exam.
Additionally, students should expect to calculate a chi-square value and explain the meaning in context of a given scenario. On the exam, students commonly fail to identify the null hypothesis rather than an alternate hypothesis; thus, they will need multiple and varied opportunities to practice this skill.
Building their skills in experimental design throughout the course will help address this misconception. Emphasis should be on helping students understand when to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
Students should understand the value and application of the chi-square test in additional contexts beyond genetics. Students should learn the difference between null and alternate hypotheses while understanding that the chi-square is not always the most appropriate statistical test to analyze the results of an experiment.
Developing Understanding
Unit 5 focuses on heredity and the biological concepts and processes involved in ensuring the
continuity of life. Students learn that the storage and transmission of genetic information via
chromosomes from one generation to the next occur through meiosis. Meiotic division ensures
genetic diversity, which is crucial to the survival of a species. In this unit, students gain a deeper
understanding of Mendelian genetics and learning how non-Mendelian genetics describes
those patterns of inheritance that seem to violate Mendel’s laws. This unit also teaches the role
played by chromosomal inheritance, environmental factors, and nondisjunction on an individual’s
phenotype. In Unit 6, students move on to learn about gene expression and regulation.

Topic
Sample Activity 1 5.1
Think-Pair-Share
Students can construct simulated chromosomes with pop beads or pipe cleaners and
manipulate them through the stages of meiosis. As students are modeling the process,
they can make a sketch or take a photograph of each stage. They should begin with either
a 2n = 4 or a 2n = 6 “cell” so that they can build their understanding using a simpler system
before applying what they have learned to meiosis in humans. This can be introduced or de-briefed using a Think-Pair-Share approach.
2 5.3
Construct an Argument
Students can use genetic corn to apply the chi-square test to a dihybrid cross. First,
students calculate the expected genotypic and phenotypic ratios using a Punnett square.
They then formulate null hypotheses for the cross and perform a chi-square test. They
conclude by stating whether they should reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis and justify their reasoning.
3 5.5
Debate
Students can read a case study about the genetics and evolution of skin color, then answer
any questions that may accompany the case study. Alternately, teachers can provide
appropriate questions and/or assignments to ensure that students understand the concepts
addressed in the case study. Instead of answering the questions on paper, students can be
divided into groups to debate possible answers to some or all of the questions. This activity
can be augmented by having students read an article about the biology of skin color.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
IST-1.J.1
Patterns of inheritance of many traits do not follow ratios predicted by Mendel’s laws and can be identified by quantitative analysis, where observed phenotypic ratios statistically differ from the predicted ratios— a. Genes that are adjacent and close to one another on the same chromosome may appear to be genetically linked; the probability that genetically linked genes will segregate as a unit can be used to calculate the map distance between them.
IST-1.J.2
Some traits are determined by genes on sex chromosomes and are known as sex linked traits. The pattern of inheritance of sex-linked traits can often be predicted from data, including pedigree, indicating the parent genotype/phenotype and the offspring genotypes/phenotypes.
IST-1.J.3
Many traits are the product of multiple genes and/or physiological processes acting in combination; these traits therefore do not segregate in Mendelian patterns.

2.C  6.A 6.B  6.D  6.E.a
The ability to describe, analyze, and create models and representations to explain and/ or illustrate biological processes and make predictions about them is an important skill for students to master. The primary learning goal in this unit is to create or use a representation/model to communicate biological phenomena, use the model to solve a problem, and refine the model or representation to analyze situations or solve problems.
Throughout the course, students should have had multiple opportunities that involve making a claim, supporting it with evidence, and providing reasoning to support the claim. In this unit and throughout the course, students should become proficient in argumentation by predicting the causes or effects of a change in, or disruption to, one or more components in a biological system.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Students often do not understand the difference between a gene and an allele.
Gene expression occurs at many levels, all of which are crucial in producing an organism’s phenotype. Students can use the lac operon in E. coli to help them understand the significance of positive gene regulation.
Often on the exam, students fail to provide reasoning connecting a change on the molecular level (e.g., a mutation) to a change in phenotype (e.g., an increase or decrease in protein levels). Students should understand that the location of a mutation in the codon can affect the structure and function of a protein. Common errors include stating that mutations result in the denaturation of a protein or that point mutations cause frameshift mutations. Students also tend to describe all mutations as having negative effects; exposure to examples of mutations that have no impact on phenotype can help prevent this misunderstanding.
Developing Understanding
Progressing from the continuity of life to gene expression, in Unit 6 students gain
in-depth knowledge about nucleic acids and their role in gene expression. Students
receive a finer focus on the comparison between the structures of DNA and RNA. This unit
highlights how an individual’s genotype is physically expressed through that individual’s
phenotype. Understanding protein synthesis (transcription and translation) is vital to
answering essential questions about gene expression. Regulation of gene expression
and cell specialization are instrumental in ensuring survival within an individual and across
populations. Unit 7 moves on to cover natural selection.

Sample Activity 1 6.2
Misconception Check
Using diagrams of nucleotides that can be found on the internet and photocopied, students
can model the process of replication, explaining what is happening as they go. You can easily
assess their understanding by observing the results of replication that students produce.
2 6.3
Think-Pair-Share
Students build a model of transcription using pool noodles that can be purchased at
a dollar store. Using everyday materials, such as tape, colored paper, yarn (or string),
and markers, they identify the promoter region, TATA box, transcription start site, and
terminal sequence. They describe the process of transcription from the initial binding of
the transcription factors to the production of the transcript. This can be introduced or de-briefed using a Think-Pair-Share approach.
3 6.4
Construct an Argument
Students develop a skit to demonstrate the process of translation. Once they have an
understanding of the process, challenge them to act out what might happen if there were a
change in the DNA sequence or if one of the needed components was unavailable. Debrief
by having students explain the rationale for the modifications they made in their skit.

Building Science Practices 1.B  2.A  2.D.c  3.B  3.E.a  4.B.c  5.A.a 6.C  6.E.b
By now, students should be accustomed to using visual models and representations to explain or illustrate biological processes. This unit provides students the opportunity to gain proficiency in describing a given model or representation and communicating the biological meaning it represents. Mastery is demonstrated when students can create or use models such as cladograms and phylogenetic trees to communicate biological phenomena, analyze situations, or solve new problems.
Hardy-Weinberg equations are used with respect to a specific gene. Thus, when teaching students how to use the equations, be careful to distinguish between allele and genotype frequencies. The Hardy-Weinberg principle clarifies the factors that alter allele frequency, but it does not imply that allele frequencies are static. This is an important understanding that students need in order to make predictions about a change in a population and to justify the reasoning for their predictions.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The principle of natural selection and its components appears throughout the course.
It is important that students are precise in the language they use when writing about evolution, being careful to avoid writing statements that are Lamarckian. A common student error is using buzzwords such as “fitness” without proper explanation of the underlying concept. Students should recall the sources of genetic variation learned in Unit 5 in order to demonstrate the understanding that genetic variation is necessary for natural selection and describe its role in reproductive success. In their writing, students should be clear that while natural selection acts on individuals, it is populations that evolve. Another common error on the exam is that students do not clearly differentiate the types of reproductive isolating mechanisms that lead to speciation.
Developing Understanding
The concepts in Unit 7 build on foundational content from previous units as students discover
natural selection, a mechanism of evolution—the theory that populations that are better
adapted to their environment will survive and reproduce. Thus, the evolution of a species
involves a change in its genetic makeup over time. In this unit, students study the evidence for
and mechanisms of evolutionary change. Students also learn what happens when a species
does not adapt to a changing or volatile environment and about the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
as a model for describing and predicting allele frequencies in nonevolving populations. Students
will learn to calculate and draw conclusions about the evolution, or lack thereof, of a population
from data related to allele frequencies. Biological principles studied here and in previous units will culminate in Unit 8, which covers ecology.

EVO-1.K
Describe the conditions under which allele and genotype frequencies will change in populations.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
EVO-1.K.1
Hardy-Weinberg is a model for describing and predicting allele frequencies in a nonevolving population. Conditions for a population or an allele to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium are—(1) a large population size, (2) absence of migration, (3) no net mutations, (4) random mating, and (5) absence of selection. These conditions are seldom met, but they provide a valuable null hypothesis.
EVO-1.K.2
Allele frequencies in a population can be calculated from genotype frequencies.
RELEVANT EQUATION
Hardy-Weinberg-Equation p^2 + 2 p q + q ^ 2 = 1 p + q = 1
where:
p = frequency of allele 1 in the populatio n q = frequency of allele 2 in the population

Building Science Practices 3.C.a
4.A 5.A.c  5.B  5.D.a  6.D  6.E.c
Designing research to test biological systems is at the heart of this course.
Students should be able to understand and evaluate experimental plans designed and conducted by others. They should be able to identify the experimental methods, measurements, and data collection methods used and articulate the hypothesis. They should also be able to plan and implement data collection strategies that test biological systems, in order to understand and develop solutions to problems within biological systems. An understanding of how to design experiments that test biological systems is demonstrated by the ability to interpret the results of an experiment in relation to a hypothesis. Sometimes, experimental procedures will need to be modified in order to collect appropriate data; students should understand how to modify a procedure to collect data and test a hypothesis.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Students should demonstrate understanding of the relationship between organisms and their environment by constructing and analyzing food chains and food webs and analyzing trophic diagrams. On past exams, when students have been asked to construct a food web from a data table, they have struggled with inferring the correct relationships between the organisms and with translating how a relationship between two organisms resulted in their placement on the food web. Another common error is the incorrect placement of the arrows that indicate energy flow. Students should use their knowledge from Unit 3 to explain how energy and carbon are transferred through an ecosystem so that they can predict how changes in the environment can impact an ecosystem, both positively and negatively.
Throughout the course, students should practice providing support for their claims about biological systems. Connections to ecology throughout the course are fundamental and will help students to build this skill.
Developing Understanding
As a culmination of this course, Unit 8 brings together all other units to show how a
system’s interactions are directly related to the system’s available energy and its ability to
evolve and respond to changes in its environment. When highly complex living systems
interact, communities and ecosystems will change based on those interactions. The more
biodiversity present in a system, the more likely that system is to maintain its health and
success in the face of disruption. Energy flows through systems; the rate of flow determines
the success of the species within the systems. By this point in the curriculum, a student
should be able to accurately determine what happens within biological systems when disruptions occur.

Lab Experiments
The AP Biology Exam directly assesses the learning
objectives of the course framework, which means the
inclusion of appropriate experiments aligned with those
learning objectives is important for student success.
Selecting experiments that provide students with the
broadest laboratory experience possible is important
when designing the course. You should plan to devote
25 percent of instructional time to lab investigations
and have students conduct at least two investigations per big idea.
some of the investigations in the lab manual. None of
the investigations in the lab manual require the use
of probes or computer sensors for data collection,
though they can be used if available. It is recommended that instructors have a computer and projector to
show computer-based animations and simulations for
pre-lab activities or post-lab discussions. However, a
paper-based alternative can easily be provided if the
equipment is unavailable. Students may use computers
or graphing calculators to analyze data and present their findings, but they do not need to do so.
We encourage you to be creative in designing a lab program while ensuring students explore and develop understandings of core techniques. After completion, students should be able to
to collect data, use data to form conclusions, and
apply their conclusions to larger biological concepts.
Students should report recorded data and quantitative conclusions drawn from the data with appropriate
precision (i.e., significant figures). Students should
also develop an understanding of how changes in the
design of the experiments would impact the validity
and accuracy of their results. Many questions on the
AP exam are written in an experimental context, so
these skills will prove invaluable for both concept comprehension and exam performance.
It is important that the AP Biology laboratory program
be adapted to local conditions and funding even while
it aims to offer the students a well-rounded experience
with experimental biology. Adequate lab facilities should be provided so that each student has a work space
where equipment and materials can be left overnight if
necessary. Sufficient lab glassware for the anticipated
enrollment and appropriate instruments (balances, and pH meters) should be provided.
Students in AP Biology will find it helpful to have access
to computers with software appropriate for processing
lab data and writing reports. A lab assistant in the form
of a paid or unpaid aide may also be helpful; previous students may be able to earn credit by serving as assistants in the lab.
Lab Materials
There are avenues you can explore as a means of
obtaining access to more expensive equipment, such
as computers, spectrophotometers, gel electrophoresis
equipment, and probes. Spectrophotometers can often
be rented for short periods of time from instrument
suppliers. Chemical companies often have equipment
that can be borrowed; company representatives should
have this information. Alternatively, local colleges or
universities may allow high school students to complete
a lab as a field trip on their campus, or they may allow teachers to borrow their equipment. They may even donate their old equipment to your school. Some
schools have partnerships with local businesses that
can help with lab equipment and materials. It never hurts
to ask for equipment and/or make your laboratory needs known. There are many grant programs that biology
teachers can apply to for funds to purchase equipment
and supplies, and you can also use online donation sites such as Donors Choose and Adopt-A-Classroom.
AP Biology is a college-level course, but the equipment
and chemicals needed for the labs are comparable to
those required for a high school-level biology course.
A list of instruments, equipment, and chemicals for AP Biology can be found at the beginning of each
investigation in the AP Biology Investigative Labs: An
Inquiry-Based Approach lab manual. Most lab manuals
provide a list of materials and equipment needed for
each lab investigation. Before purchasing materials,
consult your lab manual and calculate how much of a
substance or material may be needed for the number of students you have.
Students will need access to basic lab equipment
and glassware (e.g., beakers, graduated cylinders, and balances). Access to some specialized equipment, such as spectrophotometers, gel electrophoresis
equipment and pH meters, may be needed to complete 167

§ §
How to Set Up a Lab Program
Getting Students Started with Their Investigations
There are no prescriptive “steps” to the iterative process of inquiry-based investigations. However,
there are some common characteristics of inquiry that
will support students in designing their investigations.
Often, this simply begins with using the learning objectives to craft a question for students to
investigate. You may choose to give students a list of
materials they are allowed to use in their experimental
design or require that students request the equipment
they feel they need to investigate the question. Working
with learning objectives to craft questions may include:
Bullet Selecting learning objectives from the course
framework that relate to the subject currently under
study, and which may set forth specific tasks, in the form of “Design an experiment to…”
Prior to performing lab experiments, you can provide
meaning and purpose for students by giving them the
opportunity to practice lab skills and scientific thinking.
Pre-lab work that is acknowledged or checked can help determine what gaps students may have prior
to engagement with the lab. Modeling lab skills and procedures is sometimes necessary for students to have a successful lab experience.
At the conclusion of each experiment, students should
compose a lab report for which they receive feedback,
identifying gaps in skills or lab procedures. Conducting
post-lab discussions is an excellent strategy to ensure
students are mastering lab and inquiry techniques and
skills. These discussions also help students to connect
the lab investigation to the enduring understandings.
The lab, as well as pre- and post-lab work should be
extensions of student learning in the classroom rather
than discrete activities. Design pre-lab exercises
and discussions that prepare students for each lab
experience and then follow up each investigation with
a post-lab discussion to debrief procedures, errors,
and conclusions. Test the students’ understanding of
biology concepts by asking them “what if” questions
like “Predict what will happen if….” or “What should the next experiment be if…”
Bullet Rephrasing or refining the learning objectives that
align to the unit of study to create an inquiry-based investigation for students.
Students should be given latitude to make design modifications or ask for additional equipment
appropriate for their design. It is also helpful for
individual groups to share with the class their basic
design to elicit feedback on feasibility. During labs, students are encouraged to proceed independently, receiving only minor guidance from the teacher by the end of the course. Students should have many opportunities for post-lab reporting to share the
successes and challenges of individual lab designs.
Observations and Data
Manipulation
Students must practice making careful observations and accurately recording what they observe. Too
frequently students confuse what they see with what they think they are supposed to see. They should be encouraged to be accurate reporters, even when
their findings seem to conflict with what they are led
to expect by the textbook or lab procedure. Proper interpretation of observations is also important.
Students should be able to find evidence of change (growth, color change, temperature change, gas
evolution, etc.) and its absence. Students should know
how to make and interpret quantitative measurements correctly. This includes knowing the appropriate instrument for making the measurement.
Students need instruction and multiple opportunities
for practice with lab tools and techniques so that they can become more proficient investigators.
Ensure that students understand how to choose an
instrument that will help them gather the observations
or measurements required to answer a question. Also
ensure students know how to properly record, organize,
display, and interpret the measurements made via the
chosen instrument in order to support a conclusion
or claim pertaining to a particular question. If access
to instrumentation is a challenge, online and local university resources may be available.

encouraged to critique and challenge one another’s claims based on the evidence collected during the investigation.
Lab Safety
A successful AP Biology lab program will instill in each
student a lifelong “safety sense” that will ensure their
safe transition into more advanced work in college or
Bullet All facilities should conform to federal, state, and
local laws and guidelines pertaining to the safety of students and instructors.
Bullet Teachers with a limited background in biology
should receive additional safety training specific to biology labs before teaching AP Biology.
Bullet Lab experiments and demonstrations should not
be carried out if they could expose the students to unnecessary risks or hazards.
Bullet Students should be fully informed of potential laboratory hazards relating to chemicals and equipment before performing specific experiments.
Bullet Storage and disposal of hazardous chemicals must be done in accordance with local regulations and
policies. Instructors and students should know what these regulations are.
Basic lab safety instruction should be an integral part
of each laboratory experience. Topics that should be
covered include:
Bullet Simple first aid for cuts and thermal and chemical burns
Bullet Use of safety goggles, eye washes, body showers, fire blankets, and fire extinguishers
Bullet Safe handling of glassware, hot plates, burners and other heating devices, and electrical equipment
Bullet Proper interpretation of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) and hazard warning labels

Selecting and Using Course Materials
You will need a wide variety of source materials to help students become proficient with science practices
and develop a conceptual understanding of biology. In
addition to using a textbook published within the past
10 years that will provide required course content, you
should create opportunities for students to examine
primary source material in different forms and engage
in other types of scientific scholarship. Rich, diverse
source material allows the teacher more flexibility in
designing learning activities that develop the habits of
scientific thinking that are essential for student success in the course.
course, you’ll find an example textbooks list of college level textbooks that meet the AP Biology Course Audit curricular requirements.
When planning instruction, it is advisable to consult
multiple books and resources in addition to the selected
textbook, to gain additional perspectives on the various
concepts in the course that students need to learn.
Primary Sources
Many teachers may prefer to augment a textbook with
journal articles and/or abstracts from the scientific
literature. Students may find it useful to analyze primary
source material regularly to deepen their understanding of the key concepts addressed by the textbook and
to apply the science practices. While an increasing
number of textbooks include primary source material,
it is still important to introduce students to a wide
variety of materials in order to provide opportunities
to analyze data from diverse sources. These sources should include data tables, charts, graphs, and
diagrams. You may also use the ancillary materials and
website resources that accompany recently published textbooks to find quality materials to supplement classroom instruction.
Textbooks
Any textbook used in the course should be written at the college level and encourage a conceptual
understanding of biology. Ideally, the textbook will
include multiple examples and approaches to enable
students to make connections across different domains
within biology and between biology and other social and natural sciences.
College Board does not endorse any particular
textbook, and the AP Biology Development Committee does not use any specific book when creating the exam. Therefore, when choosing a textbook, you should take into account many factors such as
content, readability, learning level, and availability of
ancillary materials. On the AP Central page for this

Guided Inquiry in AP
Instruction
The process of following an experimental procedure to confirm a known outcome can build basic laboratory
skills. However, authentic inquiry allows students opportunities to develop and refine higher-order scientific
thinking skills. Inquiry skills are built through gradual release in lessons (scaffolding levels). Instead of seeking
confirmation of concepts, inquiry-based labs and classroom activities allow students, with guidance, to observe
phenomena, explore ideas, and find patterns. This allows students to answer questions they have developed
themselves. You are encouraged to create opportunities for open-ended (inquiry-based) laboratory exercises
where students can formulate questions, troubleshoot problems, and make appropriate adjustments.
The four levels of inquiry, according to "The Nature of Scientific Enquiry," are
1. Confirmation: Students confirm a principle through an activity in which the results are known in advance.
2. Structured Inquiry: Students investigate a teacher-presented question through a prescribed procedure.
3. Guided Inquiry: Students investigate a teacher-presented question using student-designed/selected procedures.
4. Open Inquiry: Students investigate topic-related questions that are student formulated through student designed/selected procedures.
For each level of inquiry, please see the table below for whether a question, procedure, and/or solution should be provided by you or generated by students.

Instructional Strategies
The AP Biology course framework outlines the concepts and skills students must master in order to be successful
on the AP Exam. In order to address those concepts and skills effectively, you should incorporate a variety of
instructional approaches into their daily lessons and activities. You can help students develop mastery of science
practices by engaging them in learning activities that allow them to apply their understanding of course concepts.
As you plan instruction, you may wish to consider the following strategies. The strategies and examples are meant
to be suggestions only, and you may use or alter them as fits your needs.
Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Ask the Expert (or Students as
Experts)
Students are assigned as “experts” on problems they have mastered; groups rotate through the expert stations to learn about problems they have not yet mastered.
Provides opportunities for students to share their knowledge and learn from one another.
Assign students as “experts” on replication, transcription, post transcriptional processing, translation, or post-translational processing. Students rotate through stations in groups, working with the station expert to complete a series of questions on the topic.
Construct an
Argument
Students use scientific reasoning to present assumptions about biological situations, support conjectures with scientifically relevant and accurate data, and provide a logical progression of ideas leading to a conclusion that makes sense.
Helps develop the process of evaluating scientific information, developing reasoning skills, and enhancing communication skills in supporting conjectures and conclusions.
Present students with a written or visual scenario of the results of a laboratory investigation, then have them work together to draw conclusions about scientific investigations.
Ask them to support their conclusions with data by having each student or group of students add a sentence to the conclusion. Once the conclusion is complete, read it (or show it on a screen), and then facilitate a class discussion.
Debate
Engaging in an informal or formal argumentation of an issue.
Gives students an opportunity to collect and orally present evidence supporting the affirmative and negative arguments of a proposition or issue.
Students can debate which line of evidence provides the strongest support for evolution.
Error Analysis
Students analyze an existing solution to determine whether (or where) errors have occurred.
Allows students to troubleshoot errors and focus on solutions that may arise when they perform the same procedures themselves.
Have students analyze their work to determine where there were errors in their calculations.
For example, this can be done as part of the diffusion and osmosis lab, or when teaching chi-square or the Hardy-
Weinberg principle.

Purpose
Example
Fishbowl
Some students form an inner circle and model appropriate discussion techniques, while an outer circle of students listens, responds, and evaluates.
Provides students with an opportunity to engage in a formal discussion and to experience the roles of both participant and active listener; students also have the responsibility of supporting their opinions and responses using specific evidence.
Divide students into two groups, and ask them for form two concentric circles.
The inner circle can explain photosynthesis to the students in the outer circle, and the outer circle can explain cellular respiration to students in the inner circle.
Graph and Switch
Generating a graph to represent data and then switch papers to review each other’s representations.
Allows students to practice creating different representations of data and both give and receive feedback on each other’s work.
Give students a data table, and ask them to graph the data.
They switch papers and then offer one another feedback.
This can be scaffolded by distributing multiple data tables that require different types of graphs. Students can exchange papers and provide feedback on whether their classmate(s) graphed the data appropriately.
Idea Spinner
The teacher creates a spinner marked into four quadrants and labeled "Predict, Explain,
Summarize, Evaluate." After new material is presented, the teacher spins the spinner and asks students to answer a question based on the location of the spinner. For example, if the spinner lands in the "Summarize" quadrant, the teacher might say, "List the key concepts just presented."
Functions as a formative assessment technique.
Present students with a written or visual scenario of the results of a laboratory investigation.
Using the spinner, ask students to predict what would happen if one of the experimental conditions changed, explain the results, summarize the results, or evaluate the methods used.
Index Card
Summaries/
Questions
Periodically, distribute index cards and ask students to write on both sides, with these
instructions: (Side 1) Based on our study of (unit topic), list a big idea that you understand and word it as a summary statement.
(Side 2) Identify something about (unit topic) that you do not yet fully understand and word it as a statement or question.
Functions as a formative assessment technique.
At the beginning or end of class, show students an image of a food chain or food web. On one side of an index card, students can summarize energy flow through ecosystems. On the other side of the index card, students can write a question about this topic. Collect the cards and read through them, noticing any trends in student responses. Address all questions that day (if done at the beginning of class) or the next day (if giving at the end of class).

Present students with common or predictable misconceptions about a designated concept, principle, or process. Ask them whether they agree or disagree and to explain why. The misconception check can also be presented in the form of a multiple-choice or true false quiz.
Functions as a formative assessment technique.
Provide students with a statement on the board, or on paper, such as “All mutations are bad.” Ask them if the statement is true or false, and ask them to explain their reasoning. Address any misconceptions according to the answers they give.
One-Minute
Essay
A one-minute essay question (or a one-minute question) is a focused question with a specific goal that can, in fact, be answered within a minute or two.
Functions as a formative assessment technique.
Give students one minute to respond to a prompt such as “Explain the relationship between photosynthesis at the cellular level and environmental carbon cycling.”
QuickWrite
Writing for a short, specific amount of time about a designated topic related to a text.
Generates multiple ideas in a quick fashion that could be turned into longer pieces of writing at a later time (may be considered as part of the drafting process).
Prior to teaching about water and why it is so important as a biological molecule, ask students to take a few minutes to explain why they think water exhibits the properties of cohesion and adhesion. At the conclusion of the lesson, students can revisit their answer and revise it to reflect on what they have learned.
Think-Pair-
Share
Considering and thinking about a topic or question and then writing what has been learned; pairing with a peer or a small group to share ideas; sharing ideas and discussion with a larger group.
Constructs meaning about a topic or question; tests thinking in relation to the ideas of others; prepares for a discussion with a larger group.
When teaching about biological molecules, for example, ask students to reflect on their current learning by asking them to think about the following
prompt: “Explain why lipids are nonpolar and insoluble in water.” Once students have had a minute or two to think about the question, they can turn to a neighbor or shoulder-partner and then share their answer.
After two to three minutes of sharing, the teacher can engage the class in a whole group discussion to ensure that students are building the necessary foundational understandings.

Developing the
Science Practices
Throughout the AP Biology course, students will develop skills that are fundamental to the discipline of biology.
Since these science practices represent the complex skills that adept biologists demonstrate, students will benefit
from multiple opportunities to develop these skills in a scaffolded manner.
The science practices enable students to apply their content knowledge and establish lines of evidence, using them
to develop and refine testable explanations and predictions of natural phenomena. The science practices that follow
capture important aspects of the work that scientists engage in, at the level of competence expected of AP Biology
students. These practices are effectively integrated with the course content and can be paired with a variety of
learning objectives. You are strongly encouraged to design instruction with these science practices in mind.
Science Practice 1: Explain biological concepts, processes, and models presented in written format.
The ability to use verbal and/or written explanations
relates to the overall function of the biological system.
Students should have a deep enough understanding of
the processes to predict the effects of environmental
changes on those processes and justify their prediction
(see Practice 6). Additionally, they should be able to use
their understanding to explain the results of their own investigations.

Science Practice 3: Determine scientific questions and methods.
To provide deeper understanding of the concepts,
students should be able to pose, refine, and evaluate scientific questions about natural phenomena and
investigate answers through experimentation, research,
and information gathering and discussion. Suppose a
student poses the question: “What happens to the rate
of photosynthesis at very high temperatures?” This
question can be addressed in a variety of ways, using
literature searches, fact finding, and/or designing an
experiment to investigate the effect of temperature
on chloroplast function, including collecting data,
making predictions, drawing conclusions, and refining
the original question or approaches. Students need
to learn to formulate good scientific questions that lend themselves to experimental approaches and can be evaluated using data and addressed through
hypothesis testing. After identifying possible sources of
error in an experimental procedure or data set, students
should then revise the protocol to obtain more valid
results. When presented with a range of data, students
should identify outliers and propose an explanation
for them as well as a justification for how they should be handled.

in many aquatic ecosystems. To test this hypothesis, the researchers divided a small
lake in two roughly equal halves with an impermeable curtain that was fastened and
sealed to the bedrock of the lake. Beginning in 1971 the researchers treated one side
of the lake with sucrose and the other side with both sucrose and phosphate. From
1971 to 1983 the researchers monitored the phytoplankton biomass in both parts of the lake. The results are shown in Figure 1.

in the middle of the protein, whereas amino acids with polar R groups were
primarily on the surface of the protein. Which of the following best explains the
location of the amino acids in the folded protein?
(A)	Polar R groups on the surface of the protein can form ionic bonds with the charged ends of the water molecules.
(B)	 Polar R groups are too bulky to fit in the middle of the protein and are pushed toward the protein’s surface.
(C)	 Nonpolar R groups that cannot form hydrogen bonds with water are pushed into the middle of the protein.
(D)	Nonpolar R groups from different parts of the protein form covalent bonds
with each other to maintain the protein’s structure.
13. The apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella, is native to North America and
originally fed on fruit of the wild hawthorn. Since the mid-1800s, a population
of flies has emerged that instead feed on domesticated apples. Apple maggot flies
typically mate on or near the fruit of their host plants. Many varieties of apples
ripen three to four weeks before the hawthorn fruits do.
The different fruit preferences of the two fly populations will most likely have which of the following effects?
(A) The flies that eat hawthorn fruit will increase in number, while the flies that
eat apples will decrease in number because of the use of insecticides on apple trees.
(B)	 The single fly species will evolve into two distinct species because of the lack of gene flow between the two populations.
(C)	 The ability to survive on a diet of two different fruits will help the flies learn to eat many more types of fruit.
(D)	The flies that eat hawthorn fruit will lay some of their eggs on the earlier ripening apples to minimize competition among the larvae.
Platelets are fragments of larger cells and normally circulate in the blood without
adhering to blood vessel walls. When the wall of a blood vessel is damaged, collagen
fibers in the wall are exposed to the interior of the blood vessel. The exposed fibers
and chemicals released from the endothelial cells that line the blood vessel attract
platelets, which start to form a plug and release other chemicals (Figure 1).

initially bind attract more platelets to the damaged area.
(B) This is an example of positive feedback, because it results from the
interactions among collagen, endothelial cells, and platelets.
(C) This is an example of negative feedback, because a large clump of platelets
can block the blood vessel and prevent blood flow through it.

Section II: Free-Response Questions
The following are examples of the kinds of free-response questions found on the
exam. Note that on the actual AP Exam, there will be two long questions and four short-answer questions.
Read each question carefully. Write your response in the space provided for each
part of each question. Answers must be written out in paragraph form. Outlines,
bulleted lists, or diagrams alone are not acceptable and will not be scored.
Interpreting and Evaluating Experimental Results (Question 1 on the AP Exam)
In many countries, Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes are responsible for transmitting
the parasite that causes malaria to people through their bites. A primary tool for
mosquito control is the use of insecticidal nets sprayed with chemicals known as
pyrethroids, which are relatively safe for people but toxic to mosquitoes. However,
mosquito resistance to pyrethroids has now become widespread. Pyrethroids
interfere with the function of a transmembrane sodium channel found in cells
of the mosquitoes (Figure 1). In one common mutation to the channel protein, a
phenylalanine is substituted for a leucine at amino acid position 1014. Scientists
hypothesize that this mutation is responsible for some cases of pyrethroid resistance.

To investigate pyrethroid resistance, mosquitoes were collected four times over a two-year period from the following two regions.
Bullet Region A: a southern vegetable-growing region where large amounts of insecticide are applied for crop protection
Bullet Region B: a northern rice-growing region where very little insecticide is applied for rice protection
Scientists exposed the collected mosquitoes to filter papers soaked in two different
pyrethroid insecticides, deltamethrin and permethrin, and the percent mortality
of the mosquitoes was determined after 24 hours (Figure 2). The scientists
simultaneously determined whether leucine or phenylalanine was encoded at
position 1014 by each of the two copies of the sodium channel gene (Table 1).

simultaneously determined whether leucine or phenylalanine was encoded at position 1014 by each of the two copies of the sodium channel gene (Table 1).

(a) Describe the most likely cause of the amino acid substitution in the sodium channel protein. Explain how the
substitution of a single amino acid in the channel protein could cause pyrethroid resistance in mosquitoes.
(b) Identify the dependent variable in the experiment whose data are graphed in Figure 2. Identify the positive
control in the experiment. Justify exposing some mosquitoes to untreated filter paper each time the experiment was performed.
(c) Based on the data in Figure 2, describe whether mosquitoes from region A or from region B are more likely to
exhibit greater evolutionary fitness if exposed to permethrin in their native environment over the time period of the
experiment. Based on the data in Figure 2, describe any significant change in the susceptibility of mosquitoes from
region B to each of the two insecticides over the two-year period. Use the data in Table 1 to calculate the frequency
of the allele coding for phenylalanine in each population of mosquitoes in October 2008. Round your answers to two decimal places.
(d) Using mosquitoes from insecticide-free areas, the scientists developed mosquito strains with amino acid substitutions
at other positions in the sodium channel protein. They exposed the mosquito strains to nonpyrethroid insecticides.
Predict the susceptibility of the mosquitoes to the insecticides. The scientists claim that the mosquito population of
region B evolved resistance over the period of the experiment and that resistance arose as a result of the immigration of
resistant mosquitoes from other regions. Based on the data in Table 1 and the information provided, provide evidence to support the scientists’ claim.

Provide evidence to support the scientists’ claim.
• The frequency of the phenylalanine allele increased from very low to much higher (OR: from 0.17 to 0.5)
for population B mosquitoes that come from an area with low insecticide use. Thus insecticide use
is not selecting for those mosquitoes with the phenylalanine allele; it is more likely that pyrethroid resistant mosquitoes with the phenylalanine allele are immigrating to the area, thus increasing the frequency of the allele in the population.

Describe the process in eukaryotes that ensures that the number of chromosomes will not double from
parent to offspring when gametes fuse during fertilization.
• Homologous pairs of chromosomes separate in meiosis I, so the gametes are haploid (n), and each
gamete receives only one member of each chromosome pair.
1 point
1.A (b)
Explain how any one chromosome in individual 16 contains “DNA” that came from both individuals 1 and 2.
• Individual 5 inherited one member of each homologous pair of chromosomes from individuals 1 and 2.
During gamete formation in individual 5, crossing over occurred between nonsister chromatids in each
homologous pair. Thus each chromosome formed and passed on to individual 16 contains DNA from both 1 and 2.

Explain whether the inheritance pattern of the condition is sex-linked or autosomal and dominant or recessive.
• The disease phenotype is recessive and is autosomal/not sex-linked. It cannot be dominant because
individuals 3 and 4 do not have it, but their offspring 14 does. It is not sex-linked because if it was
Y-linked, all male offspring of males with the disease phenotype would have the trait, and they do not.

Structure and function of polymers are derived from the way their monomers are assembled—
Bu lletIn nucleic acids, biological information is encoded in sequences of nucleotide monomers. Each nucleotide has structural
components: a five-carbon sugar (deoxyribose or ribose), a phosphate, and a nitrogen base (adenine, thymine, guanine, cytosine, or uracil). DNA and RNA difef r in structure and function.
Bullet In proteins, the specific order of amino acids in a polypeptide (primary structure) determines the overall shape of the protein.
Amino acids have directionality, with an amino (NH ) terminus and a carboxyl 2 (COOH) terminus. The R group of an amino acid can be categorized by chemical properties (hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or ionic), and the interactions of these R groups determine structure and function of that region of the protein.

Directionality of the subcomponents influences structure and function of the polymer—
BulletNucleic acids have a linear sequence of nucleotides that have ends, defni ed by the 3’ hydroxyl and 5’ phosphates of the sugar in the nucleotide. During DNA and RNA synthesis, nucleotides are added to the 3’ end of the growing strand, resulting in the formation of a covalent bond between nucleotides.
BulletDNA is structured as an antiparallel double helix, with each strand running in opposite 5’ to 3’ orientation. Adenine nucleotides pair with thymine nucleotides via two hydrogen bonds. Cytosine nucleotides pair with guanine nucleotides by three hydrogen bonds.
BulletProteins comprise linear chains of amino acids, connected by the formation of covalent bonds at the carboxyl terminus of the growing peptide chain.

Scoring Guidelines for Question 1: Interpreting and Evaluating
Experimental Results 10 points |  |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Learning Objectives: EVO-1.E EVO-1.H EVO-1.L IST-2.E SYI-1.C |  |
(a) | Describe the most likely cause of amino acid substitution in the sodium channel protein.
• A change occurred in the DNA sequence encoding the sodium channel polypeptide. | 1 point
1.A
| Explain how the substitution of a single amino acid in the channel protein could cause pyrethroid resistance by mosquitoes.
• The substitution could change the shape of the protein channel so that pyrethroids can no longer
affect it / bind to it / interfere with its function. | 1 point
1.C | Total for part (a) | 2 points
(b) | Identify the dependent variable in the experiment.
Accept one of the following:
• Percent mortality • Susceptibility to insecticide | 1 point
3.C
| Identify the positive control in the experiment.
• Testing the strain that is susceptible to the insecticides | 1 point
3.C
| Justification of exposing some mosquitoes to untreated filter paper each time the experiment was performed.
• Exposing mosquitoes to untreated filter paper confirms that any observed mortality is from the
insecticides rather than from the filter paper itself or any other experimental conditions. | 1 point
3.C | Total for part (b) | 3 points
(c) | Describe whether mosquitoes from region A or from region B are more likely to exhibit greater
evolutionary fitness if exposed to permethrin in their native environment over the time period of the experiment.
• Mosquitoes from region A are much more likely to survive to reproduce, so the region A mosquitoes will have greater evolutionary fitness. | 1 point
4.B
| Describe any significant change in the susceptibility of mosquitoes from region B to each of the two insecticides over the two-year period.
• For permethrin, there was little significant change in susceptibility until the June 2010 test, when the
mosquitoes were significantly less susceptible than they had been for the previous three tests. For
deltamethrin, there was a significant decrease in susceptibility from June 2009 to October 2009 and
then a further significant decrease from October 2009 to June 2010. | 1 point
4.B
| Calculate the frequency of the allele coding for phenylalanine in each population of mosquitoes in October
2008. Answers must be rounded to two decimal places No points are awarded for working, just answers in the acceptable range.
as
• Mosquitoes from region A: "An equation reads ollows. 5 plus 2 times 31 equals 67 and start fraction 67 over 78 end fraction equals 86.
f
Acceptable range is .85 - .86
• Mosquitoes from region B:"An equation reads follows. 5 plus 2 times 2 equals 9 and start fraction 9 over 54 end fraction equals dot 17 dot.
as
Acceptable range is .16 - .17 | 1 point
5.A | Total for part (c) | 3 points

--- Table 1 on Page 221 -- | Provide evidence to support the scientists’ claim.
• The frequency of the phenylalanine allele increased from very low to much higher (OR: from 0.17 to 0.5)
for population B mosquitoes that come from an area with low insecticide use. Thus insecticide use
is not selecting for those mosquitoes with the phenylalanine allele; it is more likely that pyrethroid resistant mosquitoes with the phenylalanine allele are immigrating to the area, thus increasing the
frequency of the allele in the population. | 1 point

Learning Objectives: IST-1.H IST- 1.I |  |
(a) | Describe the process in eukaryotes that ensures that the number of chromosomes will not double from
parent to offspring when gametes fuse during fertilization.
• Homologous pairs of chromosomes separate in meiosis I, so the gametes are haploid (n), and each
gamete receives only one member of each chromosome pair. | 1 point
1.A
(b) | Explain how any one chromosome in individual 16 contains “DNA” that came from both individuals 1 and 2.
• Individual 5 inherited one member of each homologous pair of chromosomes from individuals 1 and 2.
During gamete formation in individual 5, crossing over occurred between nonsister chromatids in each
homologous pair. Thus each chromosome formed and passed on to individual 16 contains DNA from both 1 and 2. | 1 point
2.B
(c) | Indicate the genotypes of individuals 2, 4, 8, and 18.
• Individual 2, 4, and 18: The genotype of all three is Bb.
• Individual 8: The genotype is bb. | 1 point
2.D
(d) | Explain whether the inheritance pattern of the condition is sex-linked or autosomal and dominant or recessive.
• The disease phenotype is recessive and is autosomal/not sex-linked. It cannot be dominant because
individuals 3 and 4 do not have it, but their offspring 14 does. It is not sex-linked because if it was
Y-linked, all male offspring of males with the disease phenotype would have the trait, and they do not. | 1 point
2.C | Total for question 5 | 4 points
