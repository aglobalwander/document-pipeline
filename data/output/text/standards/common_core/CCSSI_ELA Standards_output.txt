Common Core State Standards for ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS & Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects
The Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts & Literacy in
History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects (“the Standards”) are
the culmination of an extended, broad-based effort to fulfill the charge issued
by the states to create the next generation of K–12 standards in order to help
ensure that all students are college and career ready in literacy no later than the end of high school.
The present work, led by the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO)
and the National Governors Association (NGA), builds on the foundation laid by
states in their decades-long work on crafting high-quality education standards.
The Standards also draw on the most important international models as well
as research and input from numerous sources, including state departments
of education, scholars, assessment developers, professional organizations,
educators from kindergarten through college, and parents, students, and other
members of the public. In their design and content, refined through successive
drafts and numerous rounds of feedback, the Standards represent a synthesis of
the best elements of standards-related work to date and an important advance over that previous work.
As specified by CCSSO and NGA, the Standards are (1) research and evidence
based, (2) aligned with college and work expectations, (3) rigorous, and
(4) internationally benchmarked. A particular standard was included in the
document only when the best available evidence indicated that its mastery was
essential for college and career readiness in a twenty-first-century, globally
competitive society. The Standards are intended to be a living work: as new and
better evidence emerges, the Standards will be revised accordingly.
The Standards are an extension of a prior initiative led by CCSSO and NGA to
develop College and Career Readiness (CCR) standards in reading, writing,
speaking, listening, and language as well as in mathematics. The CCR Reading,
Writing, and Speaking and Listening Standards, released in draft form in
September 2009, serve, in revised form, as the backbone for the present
document. Grade-specific K–12 standards in reading, writing, speaking, listening,
and language translate the broad (and, for the earliest grades, seemingly
distant) aims of the CCR standards into age- and attainment-appropriate terms.
The Standards set requirements not only for English language arts (ELA)
but also for literacy in history/social studies, science, and technical subjects.
Just as students must learn to read, write, speak, listen, and use language
effectively in a variety of content areas, so too must the Standards specify
the literacy skills and understandings required for college and career
readiness in multiple disciplines. Literacy standards for grade 6 and above
are predicated on teachers of ELA, history/social studies, science, and
technical subjects using their content area expertise to help students meet
the particular challenges of reading, writing, speaking, listening, and language
in their respective fields. It is important to note that the 6–12 literacy
standards in history/social studies, science, and technical subjects are not
meant to replace content standards in those areas but rather to supplement
them. States may incorporate these standards into their standards for those
subjects or adopt them as content area literacy standards.
As a natural outgrowth of meeting the charge to define college and career
readiness, the Standards also lay out a vision of what it means to be a literate
person in the twenty-first century. Indeed, the skills and understandings
students are expected to demonstrate have wide applicability outside the
classroom or workplace. Students who meet the Standards readily undertake
the close, attentive reading that is at the heart of understanding and enjoying
complex works of literature. They habitually perform the critical reading
necessary to pick carefully through the staggering amount of information
available today in print and digitally. They actively seek the wide, deep, and
thoughtful engagement with high-quality literary and informational texts
that builds knowledge, enlarges experience, and broadens worldviews.
They reflexively demonstrate the cogent reasoning and use of evidence
that is essential to both private deliberation and responsible citizenship in a
democratic republic. In short, students who meet the Standards develop the
skills in reading, writing, speaking, and listening that are the foundation for any creative and purposeful expression in language.

Common Core State Standards for ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS & Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects
CCR and grade-specific standards
The CCR standards anchor the document and define general, cross-disciplinary
literacy expectations that must be met for students to be prepared to
enter college and workforce training programs ready to succeed. The K–12
grade-specific standards define end-of-year expectations and a cumulative
progression designed to enable students to meet college and career readiness
expectations no later than the end of high school. The CCR and high school
(grades 9–12) standards work in tandem to define the college and career
readiness line—the former providing broad standards, the latter providing
additional specificity. Hence, both should be considered when developing college and career readiness assessments.
Students advancing through the grades are expected to meet each year’s grade specific standards, retain or further develop skills and understandings mastered
in preceding grades, and work steadily toward meeting the more general expectations described by the CCR standards.
Grade levels for K–8; grade bands for 9–10 and 11–12
The Standards use individual grade levels in kindergarten through grade 8 to
provide useful specificity; the Standards use two-year bands in grades 9–12 to
allow schools, districts, and states flexibility in high school course design.
A focus on results rather than means
By emphasizing required achievements, the Standards leave room for teachers,
curriculum developers, and states to determine how those goals should be
reached and what additional topics should be addressed. Thus, the Standards
do not mandate such things as a particular writing process or the full range of
metacognitive strategies that students may need to monitor and direct their
thinking and learning. Teachers are thus free to provide students with whatever
tools and knowledge their professional judgment and experience identify as
most helpful for meeting the goals set out in the Standards.
An integrated model of literacy
Although the Standards are divided into Reading, Writing, Speaking and
Listening, and Language strands for conceptual clarity, the processes of
communication are closely connected, as reflected throughout this document.
For example, Writing standard 9 requires that students be able to write
about what they read. Likewise, Speaking and Listening standard 4 sets the
expectation that students will share findings from their research.
Research and media skills blended into the Standards as a whole
To be ready for college, workforce training, and life in a technological society,
students need the ability to gather, comprehend, evaluate, synthesize, and
report on information and ideas, to conduct original research in order to answer
questions or solve problems, and to analyze and create a high volume and
extensive range of print and nonprint texts in media forms old and new. The
need to conduct research and to produce and consume media is embedded
into every aspect of today’s curriculum. In like fashion, research and media
skills and understandings are embedded throughout the Standards rather than treated in a separate section.
Shared responsibility for students’ literacy development
The Standards insist that instruction in reading, writing, speaking, listening,
and language be a shared responsibility within the school. The K–5 standards
include expectations for reading, writing, speaking, listening, and language
applicable to a range of subjects, including but not limited to ELA. The grades
6–12 standards are divided into two sections, one for ELA and the other for
history/social studies, science, and technical subjects. This division reflects the
unique, time-honored place of ELA teachers in developing students’ literacy
skills while at the same time recognizing that teachers in other areas must have a role in this development as well.
Part of the motivation behind the interdisciplinary approach to literacy
promulgated by the Standards is extensive research establishing the need
for college and career ready students to be proficient in reading complex
informational text independently in a variety of content areas. Most of the
required reading in college and workforce training programs is informational
in structure and challenging in content; postsecondary education programs
typically provide students with both a higher volume of such reading than is
generally required in K–12 schools and comparatively little scaffolding.
The Standards are not alone in calling for a special emphasis on informational
text. The 2009 reading framework of the National Assessment of Educational
Progress (NAEP) requires a high and increasing proportion of informational text
on its assessment as students advance through the grades.
Key Design Considerations

Distribution of Literary and Informational Passages by Grade in the 2009 NAEP Reading Framework
Grade
Literary
Informational 4 50% 50% 8 45% 55% 12 30% 70%
Source: National Assessment Governing Board. (2008). Reading framework for the 2009 National Assess ment of Educational Progress. Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office.
The Standards aim to align instruction with this framework so that many more
students than at present can meet the requirements of college and career
readiness. In K–5, the Standards follow NAEP’s lead in balancing the reading
of literature with the reading of informational texts, including texts in history/
social studies, science, and technical subjects. In accord with NAEP’s growing
emphasis on informational texts in the higher grades, the Standards demand
that a significant amount of reading of informational texts take place in and
outside the ELA classroom. Fulfilling the Standards for 6–12 ELA requires
much greater attention to a specific category of informational text—literary
nonfiction—than has been traditional. Because the ELA classroom must focus
on literature (stories, drama, and poetry) as well as literary nonfiction, a great
deal of informational reading in grades 6–12 must take place in other classes if
the NAEP assessment framework is to be matched instructionally.1 To measure
students’ growth toward college and career readiness, assessments aligned with
the Standards should adhere to the distribution of texts across grades cited in the NAEP framework.
NAEP likewise outlines a distribution across the grades of the core purposes
and types of student writing. The 2011 NAEP framework, like the Standards,
cultivates the development of three mutually reinforcing writing capacities:
writing to persuade, to explain, and to convey real or imagined experience.
Evidence concerning the demands of college and career readiness gathered
during development of the Standards concurs with NAEP’s shifting emphases:
standards for grades 9–12 describe writing in all three forms, but, consistent
with NAEP, the overwhelming focus of writing throughout high school should
be on arguments and informative/explanatory texts.2

1The percentages on the table reflect the sum of student reading, not just reading in ELA
settings. Teachers of senior English classes, for example, are not required to devote 70
percent of reading to informational texts. Rather, 70 percent of student reading across the grade should be informational.
2As with reading, the percentages in the table reflect the sum of student writing, not just writing in ELA settings.
Distribution of Communicative Purposes by Grade in the 2011 NAEP Writing Framework
Grade
To Persuade
To Explain
To Convey Experience 4 30% 35% 35% 8 35% 35% 30% 12 40% 40% 20%
Source: National Assessment Governing Board. (2007). Writing framework for the 2011 National
Assessment of Educational Progress, pre-publication edition. Iowa City, IA: ACT, Inc.
It follows that writing assessments aligned with the Standards should adhere to
the distribution of writing purposes across grades outlined by NAEP.
Focus and coherence in instruction and assessment
While the Standards delineate specific expectations in reading, writing,
speaking, listening, and language, each standard need not be a separate focus
for instruction and assessment. Often, several standards can be addressed by
a single rich task. For example, when editing writing, students address Writing
standard 5 (“Develop and strengthen writing as needed by planning, revising,
editing, rewriting, or trying a new approach”) as well as Language standards 1–3
(which deal with conventions of standard English and knowledge of language).
When drawing evidence from literary and informational texts per Writing
standard 9, students are also demonstrating their comprehension skill in relation
to specific standards in Reading.  When discussing something they have
read or written, students are also demonstrating their speaking and listening
skills. The CCR anchor standards themselves provide another source of focus and coherence.
The same ten CCR anchor standards for Reading apply to both literary and
informational texts, including texts in history/social studies, science, and
technical subjects. The ten CCR anchor standards for Writing cover numerous
text types and subject areas. This means that students can develop mutually
reinforcing skills and exhibit mastery of standards for reading and writing across a range of texts and classrooms.

6    |   introduction
Common Core State Standards for ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS & Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects 1.
The Standards define what all students are expected to know and be
able to do, not how teachers should teach. For instance, the use of
play with young children is not specified by the Standards, but it is
welcome as a valuable activity in its own right and as a way to help
students meet the expectations in this document. Furthermore, while
the Standards make references to some particular forms of content,
including mythology, foundational U.S. documents, and Shakespeare,
they do not—indeed, cannot—enumerate all or even most of the
content that students should learn. The Standards must therefore
be complemented by a well-developed, content-rich curriculum
consistent with the expectations laid out in this document.
2.
While the Standards focus on what is most essential, they do not
describe all that can or should be taught. A great deal is left to
the discretion of teachers and curriculum developers. The aim of
the Standards is to articulate the fundamentals, not to set out an
exhaustive list or a set of restrictions that limits what can be taught beyond what is specified herein.
3.
The Standards do not define the nature of advanced work for students
who meet the Standards prior to the end of high school. For those
students, advanced work in such areas as literature, composition,
language, and journalism should be available. This work should provide
the next logical step up from the college and career readiness baseline established here.
4.
The Standards set grade-specific standards but do not define the
intervention methods or materials necessary to support students
who are well below or well above grade-level expectations. No set of
grade-specific standards can fully reflect the great variety in abilities,
needs, learning rates, and achievement levels of students in any given
classroom. However, the Standards do provide clear signposts along
the way to the goal of college and career readiness for all students.

5.
It is also beyond the scope of the Standards to define the full range of
supports appropriate for English language learners and for students
with special needs. At the same time, all students must have the
opportunity to learn and meet the same high standards if they are to
access the knowledge and skills necessary in their post–high school lives.

Each grade will include students who are still acquiring English.
For those students, it is possible to meet the standards in reading,
writing, speaking, and listening without displaying native-like control of conventions and vocabulary.

The Standards should also be read as allowing for the widest
possible range of students to participate fully from the outset and
as permitting appropriate accommodations to ensure maximum
participation of students with special education needs. For example,
for students with disabilities reading should allow for the use of
Braille, screen-reader technology, or other assistive devices, while
writing should include the use of a scribe, computer, or speech-to text technology. In a similar vein, speaking and listening should be interpreted broadly to include sign language.
6.
While the ELA and content area literacy components described
herein are critical to college and career readiness, they do not
define the whole of such readiness. Students require a wide ranging, rigorous academic preparation and, particularly in the early
grades, attention to such matters as social, emotional, and physical
development and approaches to learning. Similarly, the Standards
define literacy expectations in history/social studies, science, and
technical subjects, but literacy standards in other areas, such
as mathematics and health education, modeled on those in this
document are strongly encouraged to facilitate a comprehensive, schoolwide literacy program.
What is Not Covered by the Standards
The Standards should be recognized for what they are not as well as what they are. The most important intentional design limitations are as follows:

=== Page 7 ===
7    |   introduction
Common Core State Standards for ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS & Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects
They demonstrate independence.
Students can, without significant scaffolding, comprehend and evaluate
complex texts across a range of types and disciplines, and they can construct
effective arguments and convey intricate or multifaceted information. Likewise,
students are able independently to discern a speaker’s key points, request
clarification, and ask relevant questions. They build on others’ ideas, articulate
their own ideas, and confirm they have been understood. Without prompting,
they demonstrate command of standard English and acquire and use a
wide-ranging vocabulary. More broadly, they become self-directed learners,
effectively seeking out and using resources to assist them, including teachers, peers, and print and digital reference materials.
They build strong content knowledge.
Students establish a base of knowledge across a wide range of subject matter
by engaging with works of quality and substance. They become proficient
in new areas through research and study. They read purposefully and listen
attentively to gain both general knowledge and discipline-specific expertise.
They refine and share their knowledge through writing and speaking.
They respond to the varying demands of audience, task, purpose, and discipline.
Students adapt their communication in relation to audience, task, purpose, and
discipline. They set and adjust purpose for reading, writing, speaking, listening,
and language use as warranted by the task. They appreciate nuances, such as
how the composition of an audience should affect tone when speaking and
how the connotations of words affect meaning. They also know that different
disciplines call for different types of evidence (e.g., documentary evidence in history, experimental evidence in science).

They comprehend as well as critique.
Students are engaged and open-minded—but discerning—readers and listeners.
They work diligently to understand precisely what an author or speaker is
saying, but they also question an author’s or speaker’s assumptions and
premises and assess the veracity of claims and the soundness of reasoning.
They value evidence.
Students cite specific evidence when offering an oral or written interpretation
of a text. They use relevant evidence when supporting their own points in
writing and speaking, making their reasoning clear to the reader or listener, and
they constructively evaluate others’ use of evidence.
They use technology and digital media strategically and capably.
Students employ technology thoughtfully to enhance their reading, writing,
speaking, listening, and language use. They tailor their searches online to
acquire useful information efficiently, and they integrate what they learn using
technology with what they learn offline. They are familiar with the strengths and
limitations of various technological tools and mediums and can select and use those best suited to their communication goals.
They come to understand other perspectives and cultures.
Students appreciate that the twenty-first-century classroom and workplace
are settings in which people from often widely divergent cultures and who
represent diverse experiences and perspectives must learn and work together.
Students actively seek to understand other perspectives and cultures through
reading and listening, and they are able to communicate effectively with
people of varied backgrounds. They evaluate other points of view critically
and constructively. Through reading great classic and contemporary works
of literature representative of a variety of periods, cultures, and worldviews,
students can vicariously inhabit worlds and have experiences much different than their own.
Students Who are College and Career Ready
in Reading, Writing, Speaking, Listening, and Language
The descriptions that follow are not standards themselves but instead offer a portrait of students who meet the standards set out in this document. As students
advance through the grades and master the standards in reading, writing, speaking, listening, and language, they are able to exhibit with increasing fullness and
regularity these capacities of the literate individual.

How to Read This Document
Overall Document Organization
The Standards comprise three main sections: a comprehensive K–5 section
and two content area–specific sections for grades 6–12, one for ELA and one
for history/social studies, science, and technical subjects. Three appendices accompany the main document.
Each section is divided into strands. K–5 and 6–12 ELA have Reading, Writing,
Speaking and Listening, and Language strands; the 6–12 history/ social studies,
science, and technical subjects section focuses on Reading and Writing. Each
strand is headed by a strand-specific set of College and Career Readiness
Anchor Standards that is identical across all grades and content areas.
Standards for each grade within K–8 and for grades 9–10 and 11–12 follow the
CCR anchor standards in each strand. Each grade-specific standard (as these
standards are collectively referred to) corresponds to the same-numbered
CCR anchor standard. Put another way, each CCR anchor standard has an
accompanying grade-specific standard translating the broader CCR statement into grade-appropriate end-of-year expectations.
Individual CCR anchor standards can be identified by their strand, CCR status,
and number (R.CCR.6, for example). Individual grade-specific standards can
be identified by their strand, grade, and number (or number and letter, where
applicable), so that RI.4.3, for example, stands for Reading, Informational Text,
grade 4, standard 3 and W.5.1a stands for Writing, grade 5, standard 1a. Strand
designations can be found in brackets alongside the full strand title.
Who is responsible for which portion of the Standards
A single K–5 section lists standards for reading, writing, speaking, listening,
and language across the curriculum, reflecting the fact that most or all of the
instruction students in these grades receive comes from one teacher. Grades
6–12 are covered in two content area–specific sections, the first for the English
language arts teacher and the second for teachers of history/social studies,
science, and technical subjects. Each section uses the same CCR anchor
standards but also includes grade-specific standards tuned to the literacy requirements of the particular discipline(s).
Key Features of the Standards
Reading: Text complexity and the growth of comprehension
The Reading standards place equal emphasis on the sophistication of what
students read and the skill with which they read. Standard 10 defines a grade-by grade “staircase” of increasing text complexity that rises from beginning reading
to the college and career readiness level. Whatever they are reading, students
must also show a steadily growing ability to discern more from and make fuller
use of text, including making an increasing number of connections among ideas
and between texts, considering a wider range of textual evidence, and becoming
more sensitive to inconsistencies, ambiguities, and poor reasoning in texts.
Writing: Text types, responding to reading, and research
The Standards acknowledge the fact that whereas some writing skills, such
as the ability to plan, revise, edit, and publish, are applicable to many types of
writing, other skills are more properly defined in terms of specific writing types:
arguments, informative/explanatory texts, and narratives. Standard 9 stresses
the importance of the writing-reading connection by requiring students to draw
upon and write about evidence from literary and informational texts. Because
of the centrality of writing to most forms of inquiry, research standards are
prominently included in this strand, though skills important to research are infused throughout the document.
Speaking and Listening: Flexible communication and collaboration
Including but not limited to skills necessary for formal presentations, the
Speaking and Listening standards require students to develop a range of
broadly useful oral communication and interpersonal skills. Students must learn
to work together, express and listen carefully to ideas, integrate information
from oral, visual, quantitative, and media sources, evaluate what they hear, use
media and visual displays strategically to help achieve communicative purposes, and adapt speech to context and task.
Language: Conventions, effective use, and vocabulary
The Language standards include the essential “rules” of standard written
and spoken English, but they also approach language as a matter of craft
and informed choice among alternatives. The vocabulary standards focus on
understanding words and phrases, their relationships, and their nuances and on
acquiring new vocabulary, particularly general academic and domain-specific words and phrases.
Appendices A, B, and C
Appendix A contains supplementary material on reading, writing, speaking and
listening, and language as well as a glossary of key terms. Appendix B consists of
text exemplars illustrating the complexity, quality, and range of reading appropriate
for various grade levels with accompanying sample performance tasks. Appendix
C includes annotated samples demonstrating at least adequate performance in student writing at various grade levels.

College and Career Readiness Anchor Standards for Reading
The K–5 standards on the following pages define what students should understand and be able to do by
the end of each grade. They correspond to the College and Career Readiness (CCR) anchor standards
below by number. The CCR and grade-specific standards are necessary complements—the former
providing broad standards, the latter providing additional specificity—that together define the skills and
understandings that all students must demonstrate.
Key Ideas and Details 1.
Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it; cite specific
textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.
2.
Determine central ideas or themes of a text and analyze their development; summarize the key supporting details and ideas.
3.
Analyze how and why individuals, events, and ideas develop and interact over the course of a text.
Craft and Structure 4.
Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and
figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.
5.
Analyze the structure of texts, including how specific sentences, paragraphs, and larger portions of the text (e.g.,
a section, chapter, scene, or stanza) relate to each other and the whole.
6.
Assess how point of view or purpose shapes the content and style of a text.
Integration of Knowledge and Ideas 7.
Integrate and evaluate content presented in diverse media and formats, including visually and quantitatively, as well as in words.* 8.
Delineate and evaluate the argument and specific claims in a text, including the validity of the reasoning as well as the relevance and sufficiency of the evidence.
9.
Analyze how two or more texts address similar themes or topics in order to build knowledge or to compare the approaches the authors take.
Range of Reading and Level of Text Complexity
10.	 Read and comprehend complex literary and informational texts independently and proficiently.
*Please see “Research to Build and Present Knowledge” in Writing and “Comprehension and Collaboration” in Speaking and Listening for
additional standards relevant to gathering, assessing, and applying information from print and digital sources.
Note on range and content of student reading
To build a foundation for college and career readiness, students must read widely and deeply from among a broad range of high-quality, increasingly challenging literary and informational texts. Through extensive reading of stories, dramas, poems, and myths from diverse cultures and different time periods, students gain literary and cultural knowledge as well as familiarity with various text structures and elements. By reading texts in history/social studies, science, and other disciplines, students build a foundation of knowledge in these fields that will also give them the background to be better readers in all content areas. Students can only gain this foundation when the curriculum is intentionally and coherently structured to develop rich content knowledge within and across grades. Students also acquire the habits of reading independently and closely, which are essential to their future success.

Reading Standards: Foundational Skills (K–5)
These standards are directed toward fostering students’ understanding and working knowledge of concepts of print, the alphabetic principle, and other basic
conventions of the English writing system. These foundational skills are not an end in and of themselves; rather, they are necessary and important components
of an effective, comprehensive reading program designed to develop proficient readers with the capacity to comprehend texts across a range of types and
disciplines. Instruction should be differentiated: good readers will need much less practice with these concepts than struggling readers will. The point is to teach
students what they need to learn and not what they already know—to discern when particular children or activities warrant more or less attention.
Note: In kindergarten, children are expected to demonstrate increasing awareness and competence in the areas that follow.
Kindergartners:
Grade 1 students:
Print Concepts 1.
Demonstrate understanding of the organization and basic features of print.
a.	 Follow words from left to right, top to bottom, and page by page.
b.	 Recognize that spoken words are represented in written language by specific sequences of letters.
c.	 Understand that words are separated by spaces in print.
d.	 Recognize and name all upper- and lowercase letters of the alphabet.
1.
Demonstrate understanding of the organization and basic features of print.
a.	 Recognize the distinguishing features of a sentence (e.g., first word, capitalization, ending punctuation).
Phonological Awareness 2.
Demonstrate understanding of spoken words, syllables, and sounds (phonemes).
a.	 Recognize and produce rhyming words.
b.	 Count, pronounce, blend, and segment syllables in spoken words.
c.	 Blend and segment onsets and rimes of single-syllable spoken words.
d.	 Isolate and pronounce the initial, medial vowel, and final sounds (phonemes)
in three-phoneme (consonent-vowel-consonent, or CVC) words.* (This does not include CVCs ending with /l/, /r/, or /x/.)
e.	 Add or substitute individual sounds (phonemes) in simple, one-syllable words to make new words.
2.
Demonstrate understanding of spoken words, syllables, and sounds (phonemes).
a.	 Distinguish long from short vowel sounds in spoken single-syllable words.
b.	 Orally produce single-syllable words by blending sounds (phonemes), including consonant blends.
c.	 Isolate and pronounce initial, medial vowel, and final sounds (phonemes) in spoken single-syllable words.
d.	 Segment spoken single-syllable words into their complete sequence of individual sounds (phonemes).
*Words, syllables, or phonemes written in /slashes/refer to their pronunciation or phonology.
Thus, /CVC/ is a word with three phonemes regardless of the number of letters in the spelling of the word.

College and Career Readiness Anchor Standards for Writing
The K–5 standards on the following pages define what students should understand and be able to do by the end of
each grade. They correspond to the College and Career Readiness (CCR) anchor standards below by number. The
CCR and grade-specific standards are necessary complements—the former providing broad standards, the latter
providing additional specificity—that together define the skills and understandings that all students must demonstrate.
Text Types and Purposes* 1.
Write arguments to support claims in an analysis of substantive topics or texts, using valid reasoning and relevant and sufficient evidence.
2.
Write informative/explanatory texts to examine and convey complex ideas and information clearly and accurately
through the effective selection, organization, and analysis of content.
3.
Write narratives to develop real or imagined experiences or events using effective technique, well-chosen details, and well-structured event sequences.
Production and Distribution of Writing 4.
Produce clear and coherent writing in which the development, organization, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience.
5.
Develop and strengthen writing as needed by planning, revising, editing, rewriting, or trying a new approach.
6.
Use technology, including the Internet, to produce and publish writing and to interact and collaborate with others.
Research to Build and Present Knowledge 7.
Conduct short as well as more sustained research projects based on focused questions, demonstrating understanding of the subject under investigation.
8.
Gather relevant information from multiple print and digital sources, assess the credibility and accuracy of each
source, and integrate the information while avoiding plagiarism.
9.
Draw evidence from literary or informational texts to support analysis, reflection, and research.
Range of Writing
10.	 Write routinely over extended time frames (time for research, reflection, and revision) and shorter time frames (a
single sitting or a day or two) for a range of tasks, purposes, and audiences.
*These broad types of writing include many subgenres. See Appendix A for definitions of key writing types.
Note on range and content of student writing
To build a foundation for college and career readiness, students need to learn to use writing as a way of offering and supporting opinions, demonstrating understanding of the subjects they are studying, and conveying real and imagined experiences and events. They learn to appreciate that a key purpose of writing is to communicate clearly to an external, sometimes unfamiliar audience, and they begin to adapt the form and content of their writing to accomplish a particular task and purpose. They develop the capacity to build knowledge on a subject through research projects and to respond analytically to literary and informational sources. To meet these goals, students must devote significant time and effort to writing, producing numerous pieces over short and extended time frames throughout the year.

Writing Standards K–5
The following standards for K–5 offer a focus for instruction each year to help ensure that students gain adequate mastery of a range of skills and applications.
Each year in their writing, students should demonstrate increasing sophistication in all aspects of language use, from vocabulary and syntax to the development
and organization of ideas, and they should address increasingly demanding content and sources. Students advancing through the grades are expected to meet
each year’s grade-specific standards and retain or further develop skills and understandings mastered in preceding grades. The expected growth in student writing
ability is reflected both in the standards themselves and in the collection of annotated student writing samples in Appendix C.

Note on range and content of student speaking and listening
To build a foundation for college and career readiness, students must have ample opportunities to take part in a variety of rich, structured conversations—as part of a whole class, in small groups, and with a partner. Being productive members of these conversations requires that students contribute accurate, relevant information; respond to and develop what others have said;
make comparisons and contrasts; and analyze and synthesize a multitude of ideas in various domains.
New technologies have broadened and expanded the role that speaking and listening play in acquiring and sharing knowledge and have tightened their link to other forms of communication. Digital texts confront students with the potential for continually updated content and dynamically changing combinations of words, graphics, images, hyperlinks, and embedded video and audio.
College and Career Readiness Anchor Standards for Speaking and Listening
The K–5 standards on the following pages define what students should understand and be able to do by the end of
each grade. They correspond to the College and Career Readiness (CCR) anchor standards below by number. The
CCR and grade-specific standards are necessary complements—the former providing broad standards, the latter
providing additional specificity—that together define the skills and understandings that all students must demonstrate.
Comprehension and Collaboration 1.
Prepare for and participate effectively in a range of conversations and collaborations with diverse partners,
building on others’ ideas and expressing their own clearly and persuasively.
2.
Integrate and evaluate information presented in diverse media and formats, including visually, quantitatively, and orally.
3.
Evaluate a speaker’s point of view, reasoning, and use of evidence and rhetoric.
Presentation of Knowledge and Ideas 4.
Present information, findings, and supporting evidence such that listeners can follow the line of reasoning and the
organization, development, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience.
5.
Make strategic use of digital media and visual displays of data to express information and enhance understanding of presentations.
6.
Adapt speech to a variety of contexts and communicative tasks, demonstrating command of formal English when indicated or appropriate.

College and Career Readiness Anchor Standards for Language
The K–5 standards on the following pages define what students should understand and be able to do by the end of
each grade. They correspond to the College and Career Readiness (CCR) anchor standards below by number. The
CCR and grade-specific standards are necessary complements—the former providing broad standards, the latter
providing additional specificity—that together define the skills and understandings that all students must demonstrate.
Conventions of Standard English 1.
Demonstrate command of the conventions of standard English grammar and usage when writing or speaking.
2.
Demonstrate command of the conventions of standard English capitalization, punctuation, and spelling when writing.
Knowledge of Language 3.
Apply knowledge of language to understand how language functions in different contexts, to make effective
choices for meaning or style, and to comprehend more fully when reading or listening.
Vocabulary Acquisition and Use 4.
Determine or clarify the meaning of unknown and multiple-meaning words and phrases by using context clues,
analyzing meaningful word parts, and consulting general and specialized reference materials, as appropriate.
5.

6.
Acquire and use accurately a range of general academic and domain-specific words and phrases sufficient for
reading, writing, speaking, and listening at the college and career readiness level; demonstrate independence in
gathering vocabulary knowledge when encountering an unknown term important to comprehension or expression.
Note on range and content of student language use
To build a foundation for college and career readiness in language, students must gain control over many conventions of standard English grammar, usage, and mechanics as well as learn other ways to use language to convey meaning effectively. They must also be able to determine or clarify the meaning of grade-appropriate words encountered through listening, reading, and media use; come to appreciate that words have nonliteral meanings, shadings of meaning, and relationships to other words; and expand their vocabulary in the course of studying content. The inclusion of Language standards in their own strand should not be taken as an indication that skills related to conventions, effective language use, and vocabulary are unimportant to reading, writing, speaking, and listening; indeed, they are inseparable from such contexts.

Staying on Topic Within a Grade and Across Grades:
How to Build Knowledge Systematically in English Language Arts K–5
Building knowledge systematically in English language arts is like giving children various pieces of a puzzle in each grade that, over time, will form one big picture.
At a curricular or instructional level, texts—within and across grade levels—need to be selected around topics or themes that systematically develop the knowledge
base of students. Within a grade level, there should be an adequate number of titles on a single topic that would allow children to study that topic for a sustained
period. The knowledge children have learned about particular topics in early grade levels should then be expanded and developed in subsequent grade levels to
ensure an increasingly deeper understanding of these topics. Children in the upper elementary grades will generally be expected to read these texts independently
and reflect on them in writing. However, children in the early grades (particularly K–2) should participate in rich, structured conversations with an adult in response
to the written texts that are read aloud, orally comparing and contrasting as well as analyzing and synthesizing, in the manner called for by the Standards.
Preparation for reading complex informational texts should begin at the very earliest elementary school grades. What follows is one example that uses domain specific nonfiction titles across grade levels to illustrate how curriculum designers and classroom teachers can infuse the English language arts block with rich,
age-appropriate content knowledge and vocabulary in history/social studies, science, and the arts. Having students listen to informational read-alouds in the early
grades helps lay the necessary foundation for students’ reading and understanding of increasingly complex texts on their own in subsequent grades.

College and Career Readiness Anchor Standards for Reading
The grades 6–12 standards on the following pages define what students should understand and be able to do by the
end of each grade. They correspond to the College and Career Readiness (CCR) anchor standards below by number.
The CCR and grade-specific standards are necessary complements—the former providing broad standards, the latter
providing additional specificity—that together define the skills and understandings that all students must demonstrate.
Key Ideas and Details 1.
Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual
evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.
2.
Determine central ideas or themes of a text and analyze their development; summarize the key supporting details and ideas.
3.
Analyze how and why individuals, events, and ideas develop and interact over the course of a text.
Craft and Structure 4.
Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative
meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.
5.
Analyze the structure of texts, including how specific sentences, paragraphs, and larger portions of the text
(e.g., a section, chapter, scene, or stanza) relate to each other and the whole.
6.
Assess how point of view or purpose shapes the content and style of a text.
Integration of Knowledge and Ideas 7.
Integrate and evaluate content presented in diverse formats and media, including visually and quantitatively, as well as in words.* 8.
Delineate and evaluate the argument and specific claims in a text, including the validity of the reasoning as well as the relevance and sufficiency of the evidence.
9.
Analyze how two or more texts address similar themes or topics in order to build knowledge or to compare the approaches the authors take.
Range of Reading and Level of Text Complexity
10.	 Read and comprehend complex literary and informational texts independently and proficiently.
*Please see “Research to Build Knowledge” in Writing and “Comprehension and Collaboration” in Speaking and Listening for
additional standards relevant to gathering, assessing, and applying information from print and digital sources.
Note on range and content of student reading
To become college and career ready, students must grapple with works of exceptional craft and thought whose range extends across genres, cultures, and centuries. Such works offer profound insights into the human condition and serve as models for students’ own thinking and writing.
Along with high-quality contemporary works, these texts should be chosen from among seminal U.S. documents, the classics of American literature, and the timeless dramas of Shakespeare.
Through wide and deep reading of literature and literary nonfiction of steadily increasing sophistication, students gain a reservoir of literary and cultural knowledge, references, and images; the ability to evaluate intricate arguments; and the capacity to surmount the challenges posed by complex texts.

Range of Writing
10.	 Write routinely over extended time frames (time for research, reflection, and revision) and shorter time frames (a
single sitting or a day or two) for a range of tasks, purposes, and audiences.
*These broad types of writing include many subgenres. See Appendix A for definitions of key writing types.
Note on range and content of student writing
For students, writing is a key means of asserting and defending claims, showing what they know about a subject, and conveying what they have experienced, imagined, thought, and felt. To be college- and career ready writers, students must take task, purpose, and audience into careful consideration, choosing words, information, structures, and formats deliberately. They need to know how to combine elements of different kinds of writing—for example, to use narrative strategies within argument and explanation within narrative— to produce complex and nuanced writing. They need to be able to use technology strategically when creating, refining, and collaborating on writing. They have to become adept at gathering information, evaluating sources, and citing material accurately, reporting findings from their research and analysis of sources in a clear and cogent manner. They must have the flexibility, concentration, and fluency to produce high-quality first draft text under a tight deadline as well as the capacity to revisit and make improvements to a piece of writing over multiple drafts when circumstances encourage or require it.

Writing Standards 6–12
The following standards for grades 6–12 offer a focus for instruction each year to help ensure that students gain adequate mastery of a range of skills and
applications. Each year in their writing, students should demonstrate increasing sophistication in all aspects of language use, from vocabulary and syntax to
the development and organization of ideas, and they should address increasingly demanding content and sources. Students advancing through the grades are
expected to meet each year’s grade-specific standards and retain or further develop skills and understandings mastered in preceding grades. The expected growth
in student writing ability is reflected both in the standards themselves and in the collection of annotated student writing samples in Appendix C.

College and Career Readiness Anchor Standards for Speaking and Listening
The grades 6–12 standards on the following pages define what students should understand and be able to do by the
end of each grade. They correspond to the College and Career Readiness (CCR) anchor standards below by number.
The CCR and grade-specific standards are necessary complements—the former providing broad standards, the latter
providing additional specificity—that together define the skills and understandings that all students must demonstrate.
Comprehension and Collaboration 1.
Prepare for and participate effectively in a range of conversations and collaborations with diverse partners,
building on others’ ideas and expressing their own clearly and persuasively.
2.
Integrate and evaluate information presented in diverse media and formats, including visually, quantitatively, and orally.
3.
Evaluate a speaker’s point of view, reasoning, and use of evidence and rhetoric.
Presentation of Knowledge and Ideas 4.
Present information, findings, and supporting evidence such that listeners can follow the line of reasoning and the
organization, development, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience.
5.
Make strategic use of digital media and visual displays of data to express information and enhance understanding of presentations.
6.
Adapt speech to a variety of contexts and communicative tasks, demonstrating command of formal English when indicated or appropriate.
Note on range and content of student speaking and listening
To become college and career ready, students must have ample opportunities to take part in a variety of rich, structured conversations—as part of a whole class, in small groups, and with a partner—built around important content in various domains.
They must be able to contribute appropriately to these conversations, to make comparisons and contrasts, and to analyze and synthesize a multitude of ideas in accordance with the standards of evidence appropriate to a particular discipline. Whatever their intended major or profession, high school graduates will depend heavily on their ability to listen attentively to others so that they are able to build on others’ meritorious ideas while expressing their own clearly and persuasively.
New technologies have broadened and expanded the role that speaking and listening play in acquiring and sharing knowledge and have tightened their link to other forms of communication.
The Internet has accelerated the speed at which connections between speaking, listening, reading, and writing can be made, requiring that students be ready to use these modalities nearly simultaneously. Technology itself is changing quickly, creating a new urgency for students to be adaptable in response to change.

Conventions of Standard English 1.
Demonstrate command of the conventions of standard English grammar and usage when writing or speaking.
2.
Demonstrate command of the conventions of standard English capitalization, punctuation, and spelling when writing.
Knowledge of Language 3.
Apply knowledge of language to understand how language functions in different contexts, to make effective
choices for meaning or style, and to comprehend more fully when reading or listening.
Vocabulary Acquisition and Use 4.
Determine or clarify the meaning of unknown and multiple-meaning words and phrases by using context clues,
analyzing meaningful word parts, and consulting general and specialized reference materials, as appropriate.
5.
Demonstrate understanding of figurative language, word relationships, and nuances in word meanings.
6.
Acquire and use accurately a range of general academic and domain-specific words and phrases sufficient for
reading, writing, speaking, and listening at the college and career readiness level; demonstrate independence in
gathering vocabulary knowledge when considering a word or phrase important to comprehension or expression.
Note on range and content of student language use
To be college and career ready in language, students must have firm control over the conventions of standard English. At the same time, they must come to appreciate that language is as at least as much a matter of craft as of rules and be able to choose words, syntax, and punctuation to express themselves and achieve particular functions and rhetorical effects. They must also have extensive vocabularies, built through reading and study, enabling them to comprehend complex texts and engage in purposeful writing about and conversations around content. They need to become skilled in determining or clarifying the meaning of words and phrases they encounter, choosing flexibly from an array of strategies to aid them. They must learn to see an individual word as part of a network of other words—words, for example, that have similar denotations but different connotations. The inclusion of Language standards in their own strand should not be taken as an indication that skills related to conventions, effective language use, and vocabulary are unimportant to reading, writing, speaking, and listening; indeed, they are inseparable from such contexts.

College and Career Readiness Anchor Standards for Reading
The grades 6–12 standards on the following pages define what students should understand and be able to do by the end
of each grade span. They correspond to the College and Career Readiness (CCR) anchor standards below by number.
The CCR and grade-specific standards are necessary complements—the former providing broad standards, the latter
providing additional specificity—that together define the skills and understandings that all students must demonstrate.
Key Ideas and Details 1.
Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual
evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.
2.
Determine central ideas or themes of a text and analyze their development; summarize the key supporting details and ideas.
3.
Analyze how and why individuals, events, or ideas develop and interact over the course of a text.
Craft and Structure 4.
Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative
meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.
5.
Analyze the structure of texts, including how specific sentences, paragraphs, and larger portions of the text (e.g., a
section, chapter, scene, or stanza) relate to each other and the whole.
6.

10.	 Read and comprehend complex literary and informational texts independently and proficiently.
*Please see “Research to Build and Present Knowledge” in Writing for additional standards relevant to gath ering, assessing, and applying information from print and digital sources.
Note on range and content of student reading
Reading is critical to building knowledge in history/social studies as well as in science and technical subjects. College and career ready reading in these fields requires an appreciation of the norms and conventions of each discipline, such as the kinds of evidence used in history and science; an understanding of domain-specific words and phrases;
an attention to precise details; and the capacity to evaluate intricate arguments, synthesize complex information, and follow detailed descriptions of events and concepts.
In history/social studies, for example, students need to be able to analyze, evaluate, and differentiate primary and secondary sources. When reading scientific and technical texts, students need to be able to gain knowledge from challenging texts that often make extensive use of elaborate diagrams and data to convey information and illustrate concepts. Students must be able to read complex informational texts in these fields with independence and confidence because the vast majority of reading in college and workforce training programs will be sophisticated nonfiction. It is important to note that these Reading standards are meant to complement the specific content demands of the disciplines, not replace them.

Note on range and content of student writing
For students, writing is a key means of asserting and defending claims, showing what they know about a subject, and conveying what they have experienced, imagined, thought, and felt. To be college and career ready writers, students must take task, purpose, and audience into careful consideration, choosing words, information, structures, and formats deliberately. They need to be able to use technology strategically when creating, refining, and collaborating on writing. They have to become adept at gathering information, evaluating sources, and citing material accurately, reporting findings from their research and analysis of sources in a clear and cogent manner. They must have the flexibility, concentration, and fluency to produce high-quality first draft text under a tight deadline and the capacity to revisit and make improvements to a piece of writing over multiple drafts when circumstances encourage or require it. To meet these goals, students must devote significant time and effort to writing, producing numerous pieces over short and long time frames throughout the year.
