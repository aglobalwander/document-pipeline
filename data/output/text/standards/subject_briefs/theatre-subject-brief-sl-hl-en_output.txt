The Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the
16 to 19 age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be
knowledgeable and inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis
on encouraging students to develop intercultural understanding, open‑mindedness, and
the attitudes necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core. Students
study two modern languages (or a modern language and a classical language),
a ­humanities or social science subject, an experimental science, mathematics
and one of the creative arts. Instead of an arts subject, students can choose two
subjects from another area. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes
the Diploma Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare
students effectively for university entrance. In each of the academic areas students
have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can choose subjects
that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.
Normally, three subjects (and not more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and
the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends 240 teaching hours for HL
subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than
at SL. In addition, three core elements—the extended essay, theory of knowledge and creativity,
activity, service—are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.

I. Course description and aims
The IB Diploma Programme theatre course is a multifaceted theatre-making course. It gives students
the opportunity to make theatre as creators, designers, directors and performers. It emphasizes the
importance of working both individually and as part of an ensemble. It offers the opportunity to
engage actively in the creative process of inquiring, developing, presenting and evaluating. Students
are encouraged to work as inquisitive and imaginative artists, transforming ideas into action and communicating these to an audience.
Theatre students learn to apply research and theory to inform and contextualize their work as they
experience the course through practical and physical engagement. They understand that knowledge
resides in the body and that research can be conducted physically through both action and practice.
In this respect, the theatre course encourages students to appreciate that through the processes of
researching, creating, preparing, presenting and critically reflecting on theatre—as participants and
spectators—they gain a richer understanding of themselves, their community and the world.
Through the study of theatre, students strengthen their awareness of their own personal and cultural
perspectives, developing an appreciation of the diversity of theatre practices, their processes and their
modes of presentation. This enables students to discover and engage with different forms of theatre
