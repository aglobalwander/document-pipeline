## Navigating Support Functions during a Conversation

'I don't know. What ideas do you have?' a teacher might ask during a reflecting conversation. In cases like these, the coach is asked to become a consultant. If the teacher is still uncertain, the coach asks permission to switch support functions by saying, 'Would you like some options?' The coach would then shift his body position away from mirroring the teacher , shift his tone to the credible voice, and say, 'Here are three ideas.' After describing the ideas, he would switch back to a mirror position and in the approachable voice, he might say, 'What thoughts do those ideas trigger for you?' In this case, the coach has remained in the mediative posture, offering not suggestions but options and then inviting the teacher to build on these.

We stress the importance of modifying the body posture because this helps the teacher be clear about the support person's intention in the moment, and the changing relationship within the conversation. To not give some kind of signal, the teacher is left in a state of uncertainty, a primary source of anxiety and withdrawal (Rock 2008). While today we know that mirror neurons will help the teacher understand the intentions of the coach, shifting body and voice tone when offering options supports clarity (Feuerstein et al. 2010).

Jane, the coach, switches the support function from coaching to consulting about Habits of Mind with a new teacher, Erin. Notice how Jane's body language breaks rapport to signal a change in support function.

Notice how the coach marks her shift in support function by turning and breaking eye contact with the teacher after having received permission to

consult. Near the end of the segment the coach returns to the coaching relationship by shifting her body and then asks, 'So I'm wondering how something like that might fit.'
