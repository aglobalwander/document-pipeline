## Three Resources of Mediation

Three resources are constantly monitored and sustained in the mediation process: reciprocity, clear intentions, and vision.

- 1. Reciprocity : Skillful mediators maintain mutually cooperative, trusting relationships. The mediator holds and demonstrates the utmost respect for the individual's feelings, ideas, and perspectives.
- 2. Attention to intentions : When assuming the identity of a mediator, one must also be very clear about intentions. Mediators monitor their own values and realize that although it might be tempting to solve a problem, evaluate, or give advice, they must hold those thoughts in abeyance in order to allow the other person to resolve the situation. Mediators are not 'fixers.' Instead, they have faith that others can solve their own problems. Trying to 'fix' others detracts from a trusting relationship.
- 3. Desired state The mediator and the individual also need a clear vision of a more desirable state for the individual. For example:
- If the person is experiencing a feeling of helplessness, the vision would be to help him achieve a feeling of efficacy.
- If the person is struggling with vagueness or a lack of clarity, the vision would be for her to become clear about goals, outcomes, vocabulary, strategies, or definitions.
- If the person is unaware of his actions and values and their effects on others, the vision would be to build greater

- consciousness of those actions, values, and effects.
- If the person is holding on to a rigid stance or narrow perspective, the vision could be for her to think more flexibly, more broadly, and from alternate perspectives.
- If the person is experiencing a feeling of isolation, the vision would be for him/her to develop stronger, interdependent relationships, connectedness, and a sense of affiliation and belonging.

Thus, Cognitive Coaching is conceived as an exercise in strengthening the neural circuitry that enhances a colleague's capacity for cognitive control and self-regulation.
