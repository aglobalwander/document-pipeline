## Self-Directedness

A self-directed person can be described as:

- Self-Managing : Knowing the significance of and being inclined to approach tasks with outcomes clearly in mind, a strategic plan, and necessary data, and then drawing from past experiences, anticipating success indicators, and creating alternatives for accomplishment.
- Self-Monitoring : Having sufficient self-knowledge about what works and establishing conscious metacognitive strategies to alert the perceptions for in-the-moment indicators of whether the strategic plan is working and to assist in the decision-making processes of altering the plan and choosing the right actions and strategies.
- Self-Modifying : Reflecting on, evaluating, analyzing, and constructing meaning from experience and making a commitment to apply the learning to future activities, tasks, and challenges.

Self-directed people are resourceful. They tend to engage in causal thinking, spend energy on tasks, set challenging goals for themselves, persevere in the face of barriers and occasional failure, and accurately forecast future performances. They pro-actively locate resources when perplexed. Seeking constant improvement, they are positive and flexible in their perspectives and are optimistic and confident with self-knowledge. They feel good about themselves, control performance anxiety, translate concepts into action, and are committed to continuous lifelong learning. (Mediating self-directedness is elaborated in chapter 4.)
