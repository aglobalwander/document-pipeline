About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills
that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking AP
courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and AP
Exams are developed and scored by college faculty and
experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges and
universities in the United States grant credit, advanced
placement, or both on the basis of successful AP Exam
scores; more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the content
and skills that are the focus of the corresponding
college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also
organizes the content and skills into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many AP teachers have
told us they follow in order to focus their instruction.
The intention of this publication is to respect teachers’
time and expertise by providing a roadmap that they
can modify and adapt to their local priorities and
preferences. Moreover, by organizing the AP course
content and skills into units, the AP Program is able to provide teachers and students with formative assessments—Personal Progress Checks—that
teachers can assign throughout the year to measure
student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students: Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically
challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to equitable preparation and
access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses: The AP
Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this
publication is optional, the AP Program does have a
short list of curricular and resource requirements that
must be fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to
offer AP courses must participate in the AP Course
Audit, a process through which AP teachers’ course materials are reviewed by college faculty. The AP
Course Audit was created to provide teachers and
administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource requirements for AP courses and
to help colleges and universities validate courses
marked “AP” on students’ transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’ courses meet or exceed
the curricular and resource expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.
﻿ V.1 | 1
AP Art History Course and Exam Description

=== Page 9 ===
Return to Table of Contents © 2020 College Board
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the AP teacher and the school principal (or designated
administrator) to confirm awareness and understanding
of the curricular and resource requirements. A syllabus
or course outline, detailing how course requirements
are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The AP
Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor; all
AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision, piloting,
and analysis to ensure that questions are accurate, fair,
and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development, College
Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher education
institutions. This feedback is carefully considered to
ensure that AP courses and exams are able to provide
students with a college-level learning experience and
the opportunity to demonstrate their qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam
development process, relies on the expertise of both
AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice
questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course performance
assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands
of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are
scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion
is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained,
and their work is monitored throughout the Reading
for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief
Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers
in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of
the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a
curve. Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which
means that every student who meets the criteria for
an AP score of 2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no
matter how many students that is. The criteria for the
number of points students must earn on the AP Exam
to receive scores of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently validates for credit and placement
purposes—include:
§§ The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer
AP Exam questions to them.
§§ The number of points researchers have found to be predictive that an AP student will succeed when placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
§§ Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP
scores as follows:
AP Score

College Grade
Equivalent 5
Extremely well qualified
A 4

While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for
scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and universities.
To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/placement
policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/ creditpolicies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for
seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score
the free-response sections of the AP Exams. Ninety eight percent of surveyed educators who took part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an AP
Reader, including opportunities to:
§§ Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
§§ Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP
scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure to the quality and depth of the responses from the
entire pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
§§ Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
§§ Score from home: AP Readers have online distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects. Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
§§ Earn Continued Education Units (CEUs): AP
Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide suggests a
sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds skill instruction across units, organizes content
into topics, and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course topics and skills, create
customized tests and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.
* To report misuses, please call, 877-274-6474  (International: +1-212-632-1781).

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
§§ Teachers and students sign in to, or create, their College Board accounts.
§§ Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
§§ Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
§§ Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP coordinator.
§§ Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and AP coordinators
to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following additional benefits:
§§ Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
§§ Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
§§ Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student pack.
The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
§§ Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

Model
Integrating AP resources throughout the course can help students develop skills and
conceptual understandings. The instructional model outlined below shows possible ways to incorporate AP resources into the classroom.
Plan
Teachers may consider the following approaches as they plan their instruction before teaching each unit.
§§ Review the overview at the start of each unit guide to identify essential questions,
conceptual understandings, and skills for each unit.
§§ Use the Unit at a Glance table to identify related topics that build toward a common
understanding, and then plan appropriate pacing for students.
§§ Identify useful strategies in the Instructional Approaches section to help teach the concepts and skills.
Teach
When teaching, supporting resources can be used to build students’ conceptual understanding and mastery of skills.
§§ Use the topic pages in the unit guides to identify the required content.
§§ Integrate the content with a skill, considering any appropriate scaffolding.
§§ Employ any of the instructional strategies previously identified.
§§ Use the available resources on the topic pages to bring a variety of assets into the classroom.
Assess
Teachers can measure student understanding of the content and skills covered in the unit and provide actionable feedback to students.
§§ At the end of each unit, use AP Classroom to assign students the online Personal
Progress Checks, as homework or as an in-class task.
§§ Provide question-level feedback to students through answer rationales; provide unit- and
skill-level feedback using the progress dashboard.
§§ Create additional practice opportunities using the AP Question Bank and assign them through AP Classroom.

Introduction
The AP Art History course welcomes students into the global art world as
active participants, engaging with its forms and content as they research,
discuss, read, and write about art, artists, art making, and responses to and
interpretations of art. The study of art history invites students to discover the
diversity in and connections among forms of artistic expression throughout history and from around the globe.
The AP Art History course framework contains clear
learning objectives that represent the art historical
skills valued by art historians and higher education faculty. The framework limits the required course
content to 250 works of art, aligning with college and university faculty expectations of the number
and types of works students should know. This finite
number of works allows teachers to present artwork in greater depth and invites students to actively
engage with the works, constructing understandings
of individual works and interconnections of art and
art making throughout history. This approach allows students to develop profound understanding of
representative works of art from diverse cultures,
including fundamental information that places these
works in context and illuminates relationships among them. The course is not designed to encourage or reward students’ memorization of isolated facts
about works of art, artists, or cultures; rather, it invites them to actively engage with the works to develop
enduring understandings of art making and artistic developments throughout history.
By providing detailed information about and parameters for what is expected of students, the framework offers teachers freedom and flexibility
to tailor instruction to meet the needs and interests of their students and encourages them to include
additional works they value within their individual
course content. Ultimately, the knowledge and skills
students develop in AP Art History can qualify them for college credit and placement into subsequent college coursework in art history.

The course framework includes two essential components:
1   ART HISTORICAL THINKING SKILLS
The art historical thinking skills are central to the study and practice of
art history. Help students develop and apply the described skills on a regular basis over the span of the course.
2   COURSE CONTENT
The course content is organized into commonly taught units of study
that provide a suggested sequence for the course, and detail required
content and conceptual understandings that colleges and universities
typically expect students to master to qualify for college credit and/
or placement. This content is grounded in big ideas, which are cross cutting concepts that build conceptual understanding and spiral throughout the course.

Course
Content
Based on the Understanding by Design® (Wiggins and McTighe) model, this
course framework provides a clear and detailed description of the course
requirements necessary for student success. The framework specifies what
students must know, be able to do, and understand, with a focus on the big ideas
that encompass core principles, theories, and processes of the discipline. The
framework also encourages instruction that prepares students to understand
representative works of art from diverse cultures, including placing these works
in context and illuminating relationships among them.
Big Ideas
The big ideas serve as the foundation of the course and develop understanding
as they spiral throughout the course. The big ideas enable students to create
connections among course concepts. Often, these big ideas are overarching
concepts or themes that become threads that run throughout the course.
Revisiting the big ideas and applying them in a variety of contexts allow students
to develop deeper conceptual understanding. Below are the big ideas of the course and a brief description of each.
2
BIG IDEA 1: CULTURE (CUL)
Cultural practices or belief systems often affect art and art making.
BIG IDEA 2: INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER CULTURES (INT)
Interactions with other cultures affect art and art making.
BIG IDEA 3: THEORIES AND INTERPRETATIONS (THR)
Theories and interpretations of art are affected by other disciplines, technology, or the availability of evidence.
BIG IDEA 4: MATERIALS, PROCESSES, AND TECHNIQUES (MPT)
Use of and access to materials, processes, and techniques affect art and art making.

Image Set
The AP Art History course identifies 250 works of art that represent foundational
exemplars of global artistic traditions. The works in this image set have been selected
to encourage students’ careful study, critical analysis skills, and understanding of
connections among global artistic traditions. Students will learn to apply the art
historical thinking skills to the works in the image set and beyond.
The image set includes the following required information for each of the 250 works
of art that may be assessed on the AP Art History Exam.
§§ Complete identifying information. Students are responsible for completely and
accurately identifying each work with the specific level of detail provided within the
image set. If students choose to refer to works beyond the image set in the context
of the AP Art History Exam, they are responsible for identifying those works with the same degree of detail.
◆
◆Title/Designation—Name or standard description of the work (location
included as present-day city and nation for architectural monuments) ◆
◆Artist/Culture—Artist(s) and/or culture of origin ◆
◆Date of creation—Time in which the work was created ◆
◆Materials/Media—Ingredients and components used to create the work of art
§§ Image(s) of the work. Each work is represented by one or more images. Large and
complex monuments such as the Parthenon are represented by multiple images,
some of which may specify areas of focus, such as floor/site plans, architectural
elements including interior and exterior views, and sculptural elements. Contextual
images may also be provided. The images within the image set are the same as
those that will appear on the AP Art History Exam.
Teachers and students have the freedom to include in their studies both works in the
image set and works they choose to study beyond the image set as AP Art History course content.
The image set will be updated periodically to continue to align with works of art
studied in college and university survey courses. Teachers will be notified of these
changes to the required course content well ahead of changes taking effect.
Please note that the AP Program consulted course textbooks, scholarly resources, and/or owning institutions
to verify identifying information for each work of art.

Glossary
Though not defined here, students and teachers are expected to be familiar with other vocabulary
specific to individual works of art, artists, architects, and/or cultures.
Aesthetic refers to a type of human experience
that combines perception, feeling, meaning making, and appreciation of qualities of produced and/or
manipulated objects, acts, and events of daily life.
Aesthetic experience motivates behavior and creates
categories through which our experiences of the world can be organized.
Artistic associations include self-defined groups, workshops, academies, and movements.
Artistic changes are divergences from tradition in artistic choices demonstrated through art-making
processes, through interactions between works of art
and audience, and within form and/or content. Tradition
and change in form and content may be described in terms of style.
Artistic traditions are norms of artistic production and
artistic products. Artistic traditions are demonstrated
through art-making processes (utilization of materials
and techniques, mode of display), through interactions
between works of art and audience, and within form and/or content of a work of art.
Attribution is identifying or categorizing an unknown
work based on similarities to other works’ artist, culture, art-historical style, or object type.
Audiences are those who interact with a work of art as
participants, facilitators, and/or observers. Audience
characteristics include gender, ethnicity, race, age,
socioeconomic status, beliefs, and values. Audience groups may be contemporaries, descendants,
collectors, scholars, gallery/museum visitors, and other artists.
A claim is an observation or assertion, usually stated
in a thesis, that expresses an idea or point of view and is art historically defensible.
Composition consists of interactive communicative
elements of design, representation, and presentation within a work of art and the way the elements
within the work are arranged to create the desired relationship of these elements in the work.
Content of a work of art typically includes subject
matter: visible imagery that may be formal depictions
(e.g., minimalist or nonobjective works), representative
depictions (e.g., portraiture and landscape), and/or symbolic depictions (e.g., emblems and logos) and
may also include other visual properties involving
abstraction or other non subject-driven work. Content
may be narrative, symbolic, spiritual, historical,
mythological, supernatural, and/or propagandistic (e.g., satirical and/or protest oriented).
Context includes original and subsequent historical
and cultural situation of a work of art. Context includes
information about the time, place, and culture in which a work of art was created, as well as information about when, where, and how subsequent audiences interacted with the work. The artist’s intended
purpose for a work of art is contextual information, as
is the chosen site for the work (which may be public
or private), as well as subsequent locations of the
work. Modes of display of a work of art can include
associated paraphernalia (e.g., ceremonial objects and
attire) and multisensory stimuli (e.g., scent and sound).
Characteristics of the artist and audience—including
intellectual ideals, beliefs, and attitudes, and aesthetic,
religious, political, social, and economic attributes—
are context. Patronage, ownership of a work of art, and
other power relationships are also aspects of context.
Contextual evidence may include audience response
to a work of art. Contextual evidence may be provided
through records, reports, religious chronicles, personal
reflections, manifestos, academic publications, mass
media, sociological data, cultural studies, geographic
data, artifacts, narrative and/or performance (e.g., oral,
written, poetry, music, dance, dramatic productions), documentation, archaeology, and research.
To corroborate is to confirm or support the claim
and/or thesis by providing evidence; adding proof or
discussing examples that support or further the thesis
and/or claim. Those examples can be derived from an
analysis of a work of art, reference to other works of
art, the context in which the work was produced, or subsequent valid scholarly interpretations.
Design elements are line, shape, color (hue, value,
saturation), texture, value (shading), space, and form.
Design principles are balance/symmetry, rhythm/ pattern, movement, harmony, contrast, emphasis, proportion/scale, and unity.
Form describes component materials and how they
are employed to create physical and visual elements
that coalesce into a work of art. Form is investigated
by applying design elements and principles to analyze
the work’s fundamental visual components and their relationship to the work in its entirety.
Function includes the artist’s intended use(s) for the work and the actual use(s) of the work, which may change according to the context of audience, time, location, and culture. Functions may be for
utility, intercession, decoration, communication, and
commemoration and may be spiritual, social, political, and/or personally expressive.

Materials (or medium) include raw ingredients (e.g., pigment, wood, and limestone), compounds (e.g.,
textile, ceramic, and ink), and components (e.g., beads, paper, and performance) used to create a work of
art. Specific materials have inherent properties (e.g.,
pliability, fragility, and permanence) and tend to accrue
cultural value (e.g., the value of gold or feathers due to relative rarity or exoticism).
Presentation is the display, enactment, and/or appearance of a work of art.
To qualify is to refine the claim and/or thesis by
explaining relevant connections, providing nuance,
or considering diverse views. This includes, but is
not limited to, addressing valid scholarly counter arguments to the claim and/or thesis.
Response to/Reception of a work is the reaction of a
person or population to the experience generated by a
work of art. Responses from an audience to a work of
art may be physical, perceptual, spiritual, intellectual, and/or emotional.
Style is a combination of unique and defining features
that can reflect the historical period, geographic
location, cultural context, and individual hand of the artist.
Techniques include art-making processes, tools, and
technologies that are used to manipulate, transform, and/
or repurpose  materials. Techniques vary across cultural
contexts, time, and materials, and may be practiced by
one artist or architect or may necessitate a group effort.
A thesis expresses an art historically defensible claim
that responds to a prompt rather than merely restating
or rephrasing the prompt. A thesis consists of one or more sentences located in one place.
A work of art is created by the artist’s deliberate manipulation of materials and techniques to produce purposeful form and content, which may be
architecture, an object, an act, and/or an event. A work
of art may be two-, three-, or four-dimensional (time based and performative). A work of art is considered to be a primary source.

Introduction
Developed with extensive input from the community of AP Art History
educators, the unit guides offer teachers helpful guidance in building
students’ skills and knowledge. The suggested sequence was identified
through a thorough analysis of the syllabi of highly effective AP teachers
and the organization of typical college textbooks.
This unit structure respects new AP teachers’ time by providing one
possible sequence they can adopt and modify rather than having to
build from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units enable the AP
Program to provide interested teachers with formative assessments—the
Personal Progress Checks—that they can assign their students at the end
of each unit to gauge progress toward success on the AP exam. However,
experienced AP teachers who are satisfied with their current course
organization and exam results should feel no pressure to adopt these
units, which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

The “class periods” column has been left blank so that teachers can customize the time they spend on each topic.
The suggested skills for each topic show possible ways to link
the content in that topic to a specific art historical thinking skill.
The individual skills have been thoughtfully chosen for each
topic in a way that allows teachers to spiral the skills throughout
the course. The questions on the Personal Progress Checks are
based on this pairing. However, AP Exam questions can pair the content with any of the skills.

UNIT 1
Building the Art Historical
Thinking Skills
1.A
1.B
7.A
The study of art history invites students to develop deep understanding of works of art from diverse cultures, including fundamental information that places these works in context. A critical component of this are the skills of identification and description. Unit 1 introduces the important skill of visual analysis, explaining how artistic decisions about visual characteristics shape a work of art.
Visual analysis allows students to observe and understand the aesthetic features of a work of art, which then enables them to participate in the conversation about how art is interpreted. Students will read historical interpretations of works of art, understand and describe these interpretations, and work toward explaining how an interpretation of a work of art may be derived from an analysis of its characteristics, including form, style, materials, content, function, context, reception, and/or meaning.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The AP Art History Exam asks students to identify and describe visual elements of works from the image set. This is a good starting point for students before they move on to the more complex task of analyzing the visual elements they have identified. When students can analyze visual characteristics of a work of art from the image set they can then apply this skill to analyze visual characteristics of works that are beyond the image set; a skill that is assessed both in the multiple-choice questions and in free-response questions 3 and 5.
Visual and contextual analysis are foundational skills that are assessed throughout the multiple-choice section of the exam and are components of most of the free-response questions. Students will need a clear understanding of the differences between the two. Successful examples of what constitutes visual and contextual analysis can be found in the AP Art
History Free-Response Question Samples and Commentary.
Developing Understanding
The discipline of art history examines art and the practices of art making, and explores how
theories and interpretations of art develop and change over time. Cultural practices, belief
systems, and physical setting are important parts of understanding art and art making in Unit 1.
The influence of these factors can be seen in early works from throughout the world that share
certain features, including a concern with the natural world and humans’ place within it.
The analysis and interpretations of art from this period are especially important, as little-to-no
written evidence exists for such early works, and art historians develop theories in collaboration
with social and physical scientists to understand art historical developments.

OBJECTIVE
CUL-1.A
Explain how cultural practices, belief systems, and/or physical setting affect art and art making.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
CUL-1.A.12
Medieval artistic traditions include late antique, early
Christian, Byzantine, Islamic, migratory, Carolingian*,
Romanesque, and Gothic, each named for their principal
culture, religion, government, and/or artistic style.
CUL-1.A.13
Medieval art (European, c. 300–1400 ce; Islamic, c. 300–1600 ce) derived from the requirements of
worship (Jewish, Christian, or Islamic), elite or court
culture, and learning. Elite religious and court cultures
throughout the Middle Ages prioritized the study of
theology, music, literary and poetic invention, and in the
Islamic world, scientific and mathematical theory.
CUL-1.A.14
Medieval figurative and aniconic two- and three dimensional works of art are characterized by stylistic
variety, avoidance of naturalism, primarily religious or
courtly subject matter, and the incorporation of text.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
CUL-1
Cultural practices, belief systems, and physical setting constitute an important part
of art and art making and are often communicated in various stylistic conventions
and forms. Such cultural considerations may affect artistic decisions that include,
but are not limited to, siting, subject matter, and modes of display, and may help to

UNIT 1
Building the Art Historical
Thinking Skills
1.A
1.B
7.A
The study of art history invites students to develop deep understanding of works of art from diverse cultures, including fundamental information that places these works in context. A critical component of this are the skills of identification and description. Unit 1 introduces the important skill of visual analysis, explaining how artistic decisions about visual characteristics shape a work of art.
Visual analysis allows students to observe and understand the aesthetic features of a work of art, which then enables them to participate in the conversation about how art is interpreted. Students will read historical interpretations of works of art, understand and describe these interpretations, and work toward explaining how an interpretation of a work of art may be derived from an analysis of its characteristics, including form, style, materials, content, function, context, reception, and/or meaning.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The AP Art History Exam asks students to identify and describe visual elements of works from the image set. This is a good starting point for students before they move on to the more complex task of analyzing the visual elements they have identified. When students can analyze visual characteristics of a work of art from the image set they can then apply this skill to analyze visual characteristics of works that are beyond the image set; a skill that is assessed both in the multiple-choice questions and in free-response questions 3 and 5.
Visual and contextual analysis are foundational skills that are assessed throughout the multiple-choice section of the exam and are components of most of the free-response questions. Students will need a clear understanding of the differences between the two. Successful examples of what constitutes visual and contextual analysis can be found in the AP Art
History Free-Response Question Samples and Commentary.
Developing Understanding
The discipline of art history examines art and the practices of art making, and explores how
theories and interpretations of art develop and change over time. Cultural practices, belief
systems, and physical setting are important parts of understanding art and art making in Unit 1.
The influence of these factors can be seen in early works from throughout the world that share
certain features, including a concern with the natural world and humans’ place within it.
The analysis and interpretations of art from this period are especially important, as little-to-no
written evidence exists for such early works, and art historians develop theories in collaboration
with social and physical scientists to understand art historical developments.

OBJECTIVE
CUL-1.A
Explain how cultural practices, belief systems, and/or physical setting affect art and art making.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
CUL-1.A.1
Human expression existed across the globe before the
written record. Although prehistoric Europe has been the
focus of many introductions to the history of art, very
early art is found worldwide and shares certain features,
particularly concern with the natural world and humans’ place within it.
CUL-1.A.2
Periods before the written record are often defined in
terms of geological eras or major shifts in climate and
environment. The periods of global prehistory, known
as lithic or stone ages, are Paleolithic (“Old Stone Age”),
Mesolithic (“Middle Stone Age”), and Neolithic (“New
Stone Age”). A glacial period produced European ice
ages; Saharan agricultural grassland became desert;
and tectonic shifts in southeast Asia created land bridges between the continent and the now-islands
of the Pacific south of the equator. Human behavior and expression were influenced by the changing environments in which they lived.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
CUL-1
Cultural practices, belief systems, and physical setting constitute an important part
of art and art making and are often communicated in various stylistic conventions
and forms. Such cultural considerations may affect artistic decisions that include,
but are not limited to, siting, subject matter, and modes of display, and may help to
shape the creation of art in a given setting or within a given culture.

KNOWLEDGE
CUL-1.A.3
Globally, the earliest peoples were small groups of
hunter-gatherers, whose paramount concern was sheer
survival, which resulted in the creation of practical
objects. From earliest times, these practical tools were accompanied by objects of unknown purpose—ritual
and symbolic works perhaps intended to encourage the
availability of flora and fauna food sources. Art making
was associated with activities such as food production
(hunting, gathering, agriculture, animal husbandry) and
patterns of behavior, such as settlement, demonstration
of status, and burial. For example, places of gathering or
settlement and/or objects found in such places may be
painted and/or incised with imagery related to their use.
CUL-1.A.4
In many world regions—including those not in direct contact with one another—art shows humans’ awareness of fundamental, stable phenomena, from
the macrocosmic (e.g., astronomical cycles, such as
equinoxes and solstices) to the microcosmic (e.g.,
exploitation of permanent materials available in local
environments, such as stone, hardened clay, and jade).

Explain how materials, processes, and techniques affect art and art making.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
MPT-1.A.1
The first instances of important artistic media, approaches, and values occurred on different continents, with Africa and Asia preceding and
influencing other areas as the human population spread.
People established many artistic media, from the first
fired ceramics to painting and incised graphic designs
(primarily on rock surfaces), sculpture (notably female
and animal figurines), and architecture (stone megalithic installations).
MPT-1.A.2
Beginning approximately 77,000 years ago, the first “art”
was created in the form of rock paintings and carved
natural materials, such as ocher. Geometric patterns
and representations of life-forms, usually human and
animal, were typical two-dimensional creations. Three dimensional forms were sculpted, and monuments, large scale objects, and environments were assembled and/or constructed.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
MPT-1
Art and art making takes many different forms both within and across cultures, and
the materials, processes, and techniques employed may also vary by location and
culture with wide-ranging influence on the art that is generated.

ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
MPT-1.A.3
Humans established Paleolithic communities in West,
Central, South, Southeast, and East Asia between 70,000
and 40,000 bce. Paleolithic and Neolithic cave paintings
featuring animal imagery are found across Asia, including
in the mountains of Central Asia and Iran and in rock
shelters throughout central India. In prehistoric China,
ritual objects were created in jade, beginning a 5,000-year
tradition of working with the precious medium. Ritual, tomb,
and memorializing arts are found across Neolithic Asia,
including impressive funerary steles from Saudi Arabia
and Yemen. Asia’s greatest contribution to early world art
is in ceramic technology, with some of the earliest pieces
(dating to 10,500 bce) produced by the Jomon culture
in Japan. Even earlier pottery continues to be found,
particularly in China. Ceramics were also produced in Iran
beginning in the eighth millennium bce, and refined vessel
forms arose from the adoption of the potter’s wheel in the fourth millennium bce.
MPT-1.A.4
In the Pacific region, migrations from Asia approximately
45,000 years ago were possible because of lowered sea
levels and the existence of land bridges. The earliest
created objects have been dated to about 8,000 years ago. The Lapita peoples, who moved eastward from
Melanesia to Polynesia beginning about 4,000 years
ago, created pottery with incised geometric designs
that appear across the region in multiple media today.
MPT-1.A.5
Paleolithic and Neolithic Europe’s artistic statements
were made in small human figural sculptures (central
Europe), cave paintings (France and Spain), and outdoor,
monumental stone assemblages (British Isles). These
provide glimpses into the beginnings of ritual life
(15,000 bce) as people tried to influence and integrate
with the natural cycles of the cosmos and promote both
human and animal fertility. These works establish the
dynamic interplay of naturalism and abstraction found throughout art’s history.
MPT-1.A.6
On the American continent, from the Arctic to Tierra del
Fuego, indigenous peoples who had recently migrated
from Asia (before 10,000 bce) first made sculptures from
animal bone and later from clay, with animals and sacred
humans as dominant subject matter. Similar to European
expressions, ancient American art adapts animal images
to the natural contours of the chosen materials and
features fecund females. The fact that female figurines
may also display unusual or supernatural characteristics
suggests the importance of shamanic religion brought from Asia very early in human history.

Explain how theories and interpretations of works of art are shaped by visual analysis as well as by other disciplines, technology, or the availability of evidence.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
THR-1.A.1
Over time, art historians’ knowledge of global
prehistoric art has developed through interdisciplinary
collaboration with social and physical scientists.
THR-1.A.2
Ongoing archaeological excavations and the use of
carbon-14 dating have illuminated interconnections of
art across the world. Because of the understandably small number of surviving and located monuments,
however, reasons for similarity or difference in form
remain largely conjectural. Nonetheless, comparisons of groups of objects and the application of
ethnographic analogy (considering modern traditional
cultural practices as models for ancient ones) and
reconstruction of religious history (noting shamanism
as the earliest, most persistent worldwide spiritual
approach) can be applied to help establish general
theories of the function and meaning of prehistoric art.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
THR-1
The study of art history is shaped by different theories and interpretations of art
and art making that change over time. These theories and interpretations may
be generated both by visual analysis of works of art and by scholarship that may
be affected by factors, including, but not limited to, other disciplines, available technology, and the availability of evidence.

ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
THR-1.A.3
Since it was first practiced c. 1900, modern stratigraphic
archaeology (recording precisely each level and location
of all objects) has served as a basis for art historical studies. Archaeology supports understandings of
how people, culture, and therefore art travelled across
the globe well before highly organized societies were formed. Important monuments, such as the caves at
Lascaux, and media, particularly ceramics, were first
discovered and described by archaeologists and then
became available for interpretation by art historians— the two disciplines are highly complementary.
THR-1.A.4
The function of artistic expression prior to written
records is inferred from evidence of technology and
survival strategies and based on the relationship of tools
and their function (whether task-related or expressive), available food sources, the rise of sophisticated culture, and humans’ capacity to shape and manage
the environment. Basic art historical methods can be
applied to prehistoric art by comparing works of art,
imagery, materials, and techniques to identify patterns (such as a prevalence of transformational animal human iconography), then ethnographic approaches
can be used to propose hypotheses (e.g., that certain
iconography is shamanic in nature). Cross-cultural
comparisons can help establish wider generalizations
(e.g., that South African, Asian, and indigenous American
peoples all participated in rock/cave expressions of a
visionary aesthetic). In this way, the apparent paucity of evidence can be mitigated, and theories can be
proposed, tested, refined, and potentially rejected by
conflicting evidence or new information, as in other periods of art history and in other disciplines.

5.A
With a larger collection of well-documented works, Unit 2 is the place to introduce students to the concept of artistic traditions that can be traced in the collective works of cultures. Students will continue to practice the skills of visual identification and description using images both within and beyond the image set, and will increasingly study the context in which art was created to explain how the purpose or intent shaped its creation and its meaning. Analysis of vast architectural complexes, and of smaller works such as sculptures and paintings, provides opportunities for students to understand and explain how a work’s context influenced the artistic decisions in the creation of the art. Students should explain how specific works demonstrate continuity with the larger artistic tradition, or how the work may deviate from this tradition.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Context is critically important in analyzing a work of art.  Both long and short essay questions on the exam require students to explain how context affects the use, purpose, meaning, or significance of works of art. Students often find it challenging to differentiate between visual and contextual analysis. Help them to analyze exam questions carefully to determine whether the question calls for visual analysis, contextual analysis, or both.
Additionally, students often need specific instruction on the difference between visual and contextual description, and what constitutes context. Students should practice explaining how keep on one line why context influences artistic decisions about form, style, materials, content, and/or function in the creation or meaning of a work of art. This distinction between visual and contextual description can be a challenge for students, so allowing time for practice and feedback, and reviewing successful examples of analysis, are important to build their abilities.
Developing Understanding
Art and art making of the Ancient Mediterranean illustrate the active exchange of ideas,
reception of artistic styles, and a subsequent influence on the classical world. The study of
artistic innovations and conventions developed in the ancient Near East and dynastic Egypt
provides a foundation for comparative understanding of subsequent artistic traditions within
the region and beyond, as ancient Greek, Etruscan, and Roman artists and architects were influenced by earlier Mediterranean cultures.
This unit provides the foundation for the exploration of art in Europe and the Americas as
students compare developments, consider continuities and changes over time, and build an
understanding of how these works fit into a larger artistic tradition.

Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 2.1
Think-Pair-Share
Using the Seated Scribe (15), have students work through a Think-Pair-Share exercise
focusing on the contextual elements of this work. Set some focused questions, such
as: “What is the purpose of this work? When and where was it made? What is the
subject of this work? Who was it made for? How might viewers have experienced this work? What might they have thought about it?” 2 2.1
Fishbowl
Place students into two circles for a fishbowl activity. Have the inner circle of students
practice describing visual elements of a work beyond the image set and explain how
artistic decisions about form, materials, style, and content shaped the work. After the
inner circle has had their formal discussion, ask the outer circle to provide feedback
from their active listening evaluations. Use the Standing hippopotamus known as
“William” from the Metropolitan Museum collection (metmuseum.org/art/collection/ search/544227).
3 2.3
Socratic Seminar
Lead a modified Socratic seminar in which the teacher models the strategy by asking
a series of guided questions focused on explaining first the possible intent, purpose,
and function of the Acropolis (35). Gradually extend your questioning to include how
these features shaped the meaning of the work, perhaps focusing on the impact the structure may have had on visitors.
SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page provide possible ways to integrate varied instructional
approaches into the classroom. These activities are optional, and teachers are free to alter
or edit them. Note that for images included from the image set, the image number has been
provided in parentheses. Please refer to the Instructional Approaches section beginning on

LEARNING
OBJECTIVE
CUL-1.A
Explain how cultural practices, belief systems, and/or physical setting affect art and art making.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
CUL-1.A.5
The art of the ancient Near East (present-day Iraq,
Syria, Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Jordan,
and Cyprus, from 3500 to 330 bce) is associated with
successive city-states and cultural powers—Sumerian,
Akkadian, Neo-Sumerian and Babylonian, Assyrian, Neo-
Babylonian, and Persian. Religion plays a significant role
in the art and architecture of the ancient Near East, with
cosmology guiding representation of deities and kings who themselves assume divine attributes.
CUL-1.A.6
The art of dynastic Egypt (present-day Egypt and Sudan,
from 3000 to 30 bce) generally includes coverage of
predynastic Egypt and Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms.
The Amarna period (New Kingdom) was also important
because of its cultural reform and stylistic revolution.
The art of dynastic Egypt embodies a sense of
permanence. It was created for eternity in the service of
a culture that focused on preserving a cycle of rebirth.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
CUL-1
Cultural practices, belief systems, and physical setting constitute an important part
of art and art making and are often communicated in various stylistic conventions
and forms. Such cultural considerations may affect artistic decisions that include,
but are not limited to, siting, subject matter, and modes of display, and may help to
shape the creation of art in a given setting or within a given culture.

ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
CUL-1.A.7
Egyptian art incorporates mythological and religious symbolism, often centered on the cult of the sun.
Representations of humans make clear distinctions between the deified pharaoh and people in lower
classes, using representational and stylistic cues such
as hierarchical proportion and idealization versus naturalism. Approaches to portraiture depend on a
figure’s rank in society. The artistic canon of dynastic
Egypt, with strict conventions of representation, use
of materials, and treatment of forms, was followed
for many centuries with only short-lived periods of
experimentation and deviation. Innovations in art and architecture tended to occur within the basic and established scheme.
CUL-1.A.8
Ancient Greek art was produced in Europe and western
Asia, primarily in the region of present-day Greece,
Turkey, and southern Italy, from 600 bce to 100 ce
Etruscan art (c. 700–100 bce, from the region of Etruria
in central Italy) and ancient Roman art was produced in
Europe and western Asia from c. 753 bce to 337 ce.
CUL-1.A.9
Art considered Ancient Greek includes works from the
Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, as defined
according to artistic style, not by political units such
as governments or dynasties. Etruscan art is typically
considered as a single cultural unit even though Etruria was composed of separate city-states. Roman art
includes works from the republican, early imperial, late
imperial, and late antique periods, as defined using governmental structures and dynasties rather than stylistic characteristics.
CUL-1.A.10
The Greek, Etruscan, and Roman cultures shared a rich
tradition of epic storytelling (first orally transmitted, later
written) that glorified the exploits of gods, goddesses, and heroes. The texts recorded a highly developed
rhetorical tradition that prized public oratory and poetry.
Religious rituals and prognostications were guided by oral tradition, not texts.
CUL-1.A.11
Ancient Greek religious and civic architecture and
figural representation are characterized by idealized proportions and spatial relationships, expressing societal values of harmony and order.

OBJECTIVE
MPT-1.A
Explain how materials, processes, and techniques affect art and art making.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
MPT-1.A.7
Artists created fully developed, formal types, including
sculptures of human figures interacting with gods and
stylistic conventions representing the human form with
a combined profile and three-quarter view. In these
combinations, important figures are set apart using
a hierarchical scale or by dividing the compositions
into horizontal sections or registers, which provide
significant early examples of historical narratives.
MPT-1.A.8
The Egyptian architectural construction of the
clerestory is particularly important for the history of architecture. Development of monumental stone
architecture culminated with the pyramids and with innovative designs for rock-cut tombs and pylon
(massive sloped gateway) temples, each demonstrating the importance of the pharaoh—a god-king with
absolute power, descended directly from the sun god.
MPT-1.A.9
Art from the Etruscan and Roman periods is typified by
stylistic and iconographical eclecticism and portraiture.
Roman architecture is also characterized by borrowing
from its immediate predecessors (Greek and Etruscan) and by technical innovation.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
MPT-1
Art and art making take many different forms both within and across cultures, and
the materials, processes, and techniques employed may also vary by location and
culture with wide-ranging influence on the art that is generated.

Interactions Within and Across Cultures in Ancient
Mediterranean Art
Required Course Content
LEARNING
OBJECTIVE
INT-1.A
Explain how interactions with other cultures affect art and art making.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
INT-1.A.1
Works of art illustrate the active exchange of ideas and
reception of artistic styles among the Mediterranean cultures and the subsequent influence on the classical world.
INT-1.A.2
The study of artistic innovations and conventions
developed in the ancient Near East and dynastic Egypt
(facilitated by recorded information from the time)
provides a foundation for comparative understanding
of subsequent artistic traditions within the region and beyond.
INT-1.A.3
Ancient Greek, Etruscan, and Roman artists and
architects were influenced by earlier Mediterranean
cultures. Etruscan and Roman artists and architects
accumulated and creatively adapted Greek objects and
forms to create buildings and artworks that appealed
to their tastes for eclecticism and historicism. Many
Hellenistic works are in fact Roman in origin, which
favors presenting these traditions at the same time.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
INT-1
A variety of factors leads to and motivates interaction between and among cultures,
and this interaction may influence art and art making. Such cultural interaction
may result from factors including, but not limited to, travel, trade, war, conquest,
and/or colonization, and may include forms of artistic influence such as spolia,
appropriation, and stylistic revivals, among other expressions of cultural exchange.

Purpose and Audience in Ancient Mediterranean Art
Required Course Content
LEARNING
OBJECTIVE
PAA-1.A
Explain how purpose, intended audience, or patron affect art and art making.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
PAA-1.A.1
Artistic traditions of the ancient Near East and dynastic
Egypt focused on representing royal figures and
divinities, as well as on the function of funerary and
palatial complexes within their cultural contexts.
PAA-1.A.2
Architectural representations include towering ziggurats
that provide monumental settings for the worship of
many deities, as well as heavily fortified palaces that
increased in opulence over the centuries, proclaiming the power and authority of rulers.
PAA-1.A.3
The culture of dynastic Egypt represents an elaborate funerary sect whose devotees created numerous ka
statues (to house the ka, or spirit, after death), artifacts, decorations, and furnishings for tombs.
PAA-1.A.4
The art of Ancient Greece and Rome is grounded in civic ideals and polytheism. Etruscan and ancient Roman
art express republican and imperial values, power,
and preference for conspicuous display. Etruscan and
Roman architecture are characterized by investment in public structures.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
PAA-1
A variety of purposes may affect art and art making, and those purposes may
include, but are not limited to, intended audience, patron, artistic intention, and/
or function. Differing situations and contexts may influence the artist, patron, or
intended audience, with functions sometimes changing over time, and therefore
affecting the role these different variables may play in art and art making.

OBJECTIVE
THR-1.A
Explain how theories and interpretations of works of art are shaped by visual analysis as well as by other disciplines, technology, or the availability of evidence.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
THR-1.A.5   The study of art history is shaped by different
theories and interpretations of art and art making that
change over time and may be generated both by visual
analysis as well as by scholarship. These theories and
interpretations may be used, harnessed, manipulated,
and adapted in order to make an art-historical argument
about a work or a group of works of art. Contextual
information for Ancient Greek and Roman art can be
derived from contemporary literary, political, legal,
and economic records, as well as from archaeological excavations conducted from the mid-18th century
onward. Etruscan art, by contrast, is illuminated primarily
by modern archaeological record and by descriptions
of contemporary external observers. The arts of these
early western artistic cultures are generally studied
chronologically. Additionally, archaeological models
and stylistic analysis have identified periods based on
stylistic changes. Artworks are assigned to periods
according to styles (e.g., archaic Greek), governments, or dynasties (e.g., the Roman Republic).

ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
THR-1.A.6   Ancient Greek and Roman art provides the foundation for the later development of European
and Mediterranean artistic traditions. From the 18th century onward, European and American observers admired ancient Greek and Roman ethical and
governmental systems, which contributed to prioritizing
art and architecture that could be associated with
political elites and cultural capitals (e.g., Rome). More
recently, art historians have examined art produced by
contemporary subjects or “provincial” populations.
THR-1.A.7  Some of the earliest written statements about
artists and art making survive from the ancient Greek
and Roman worlds. Little survives of the rich Etruscan
literary tradition that is documented in Roman sources.

Building the Art Historical
Thinking Skills
4.B
4.C
6.B
7.A
8.A
This unit contains works of art and historical contexts with which students may be more familiar and therefore is a great opportunity to introduce more complex practices, such as attribution (by linking works of art to specific artists, cultures, and styles) and argumentation (by teaching students how to make defensible claims about works of art).
The span of time in Unit 3 provides an opportunity for students to begin explaining why a work, such as the Annunciation
Triptych (66), represents both continuity and change within an artistic tradition. Have them also begin to explain the influence of a work (such as architectural plans) on art in Europe or even across cultures.
Use detailed, historically supported interpretations of the works from this unit to help students analyze the form, style, materials, content, function, and context of the art in relation to the interpretations. This approach allows students to gain insight into how an interpretation is developed.
Preparing for the AP Exam
By Unit 3, students should begin to move beyond analysis of specific works and their contexts to connect works of art to a larger artistic tradition, style, or practice. This can be challenging as it requires students to move beyond initial art historical skills of identifying and describing what they see, and toward learning to use their visual and contextual analysis skills in combination with their art historical knowledge to explain how a work is an example of a specific tradition, or how it represents a change from that artistic tradition.
By identifying traits of the specific work, traits of the larger tradition, and the context in which the work was created, students can successfully explain how and why the work demonstrates continuity or change within an artistic tradition. The exam assesses this skill in both the multiple-choice and free response sections; as a result, students should practice recognizing and identifying these connections as well as articulating them in writing.
Developing Understanding
The art and architecture created by Medieval European artists and architects was heavily
influenced by purpose and audience. The shared artistic forms, functions, and techniques
apparent in these works were often influenced by both earlier and contemporary cultures.
This is evident in places of worship, for example the Great Mosque’s influence on the
Alhambra or Chartres Cathedral’s influence on cathedral architecture that followed.
The Renaissance and Baroque traditions built upon those established in the Medieval
period, and expanded upon them to include new technological and cultural developments.
The cultural shift that took place during the Renaissance in Europe led artists to explore
secular subjects in addition to religious works, such as scenes from everyday life like
Bruegel’s Hunters in the Snow or Ruysch’s Fruit and Insects.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page provide possible ways to integrate varied instructional
approaches into the classroom. These activities are optional, and teachers are free to alter
or edit them. Note that for images included from the image set, the image number has been
provided in parentheses. Please refer to the Instructional Approaches section beginning on
p. 295 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 3.1
Jigsaw
Organize students into groups of three (counting off—1, 2, and 3). Then have them
then form groups based on their numbers (all ones together, all twos together, etc.)
Assign a work of art from the image set to each of the numbered groups. The ones will
analyze the Catacomb of Priscilla (48), the twos will analyze Chartres Cathedral (60),
and the threes will analyze the Alhambra (65). Each numbered group will analyze the
form, style, materials, function, and context of their structure in order to become
experts who can explain how these artistic decisions by the architects caused a
response in visitors and shaped its reception. Once they are experts, they should
return to their original groups and share their knowledge so that each student learns about all three of these structures.
2 3.2
Look for a Pattern
Using the Hagia Sophia (52), The Great Mosque, Córdoba (56), and the Mosque of
Selim II (84), ask students to look for patterns of both change and continuity with the
Islamic artistic tradition. When their analysis is complete, have them write a short
explanation of why the works demonstrate change and a short explanation of why the works demonstrate continuity.
3 3.5
Graphic Organizer
Have students use a t-chart to list evidence that can be used to support a claim (or
thesis) based on the following prompt: Explain how Jan van Eyck’s The Arnolfini
Portrait (68) represents more of a continuity or change within the Northern
Renaissance artistic tradition.
On the left of the t-chart, have students list evidence that supports this work being
a continuity within the tradition, and on the right-side have students list evidence
that supports this work being a change. Students should develop a thesis based on
the evidence from the t-chart. Remind them that a proper claim takes a position, is
defensible by the evidence, and does not simply restate the prompt.
A sample claim could be: Van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait represents change within the
tradition of Northern European art because he painted a secular portrait of a couple in their own home showcasing their wealth.

CUL-1.A.12
Medieval artistic traditions include late antique, early
Christian, Byzantine, Islamic, migratory, Carolingian*,
Romanesque, and Gothic, each named for their principal
culture, religion, government, and/or artistic style.
CUL-1.A.13
Medieval art (European, c. 300–1400 ce; Islamic, c. 300–1600 ce) derived from the requirements of
worship (Jewish, Christian, or Islamic), elite or court
culture, and learning. Elite religious and court cultures
throughout the Middle Ages prioritized the study of
theology, music, literary and poetic invention, and in the
Islamic world, scientific and mathematical theory.
CUL-1.A.14
Medieval figurative and aniconic two- and three dimensional works of art are characterized by stylistic
variety, avoidance of naturalism, primarily religious or
courtly subject matter, and the incorporation of text.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
CUL-1
Cultural practices, belief systems, and physical setting constitute an important part
of art and art making and are often communicated in various stylistic conventions
and forms. Such cultural considerations may affect artistic decisions that include,
but are not limited to, siting, subject matter, and modes of display, and may help to
shape the creation of art in a given setting or within a given culture.

CUL-1.A.15
The early modern Atlantic World (from approximately 1400 to 1850 ce) encompasses what is known today
as Western Europe—specifically Italy, Spain, France,
Germany, England, Belgium, and the Netherlands—and
those territories in the Americas that were part of the
Spanish empire, including the Caribbean, the Western
and Southwestern regions of the United States, Mexico,
Central America, and South America. Study of this
art historical period, and specifically of the European
material traditionally identified by the more familiar
labels of Renaissance and Baroque, is canonical in the discipline and is thus extremely well documented.
CUL-1.A.16
The arts of 15th-century Europe reflected an interest
in classical models, enhanced naturalism, Christianity,
pageantry, and increasingly formalized artistic training.
CUL-1.A.17
The 16th-century Protestant Reformation and subsequent Catholic Counter-Reformation compelled a divergence between western European art in the
north and south with respect to form, function, and
content. Production of religious imagery declined in northern Europe, and nonreligious genres, such as
landscape, still life, genre, history, mythology, and
portraiture, developed and flourished. In the south,
there was an increase in the production of political
propaganda, religious imagery, and pageantry, with the
elaboration of naturalism, dynamic compositions, bold
color schemes, and the affective power of images and constructed spaces.
CUL-1.A.18
In the 17th century, architectural design and figuration
in painting and sculpture continued to be based on
classical principles and formulas but with a pronounced interest in compositional complexity, dynamic
movement, and theatricality. There was an increasing
emphasis on time, narrative, heightened naturalism, and psychological or emotional impact.

OBJECTIVE
INT-1.A
Explain how interactions with other cultures affect art and art making.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
INT-1.A.4
Continuities and exchanges between coexisting
traditions in medieval Europe are evident in shared
artistic forms, functions, and techniques. Medieval
artists and architects were heavily influenced by earlier and contemporary cultures, including coexisting
European cultures. Early medieval and Byzantine art was
influenced by Roman art and by motifs and techniques
brought by migratory tribes from eastern Europe, West
Asia, and Scandinavia; high medieval art was influenced
by Roman, Islamic, and migratory art; and European
Islamic art was influenced by Roman, migratory,
Byzantine, and West Asian art. Cultural and artistic
exchanges were facilitated through trade and conquest.
INT-1.A.5
Before the late Middle Ages, the coexistence of many regional styles makes period-wide generalizations
impossible. Isolated regional revivals of naturalism
and classicism occurred, sometimes motivated by the
association of classicism with the Roman Christian
emperors and church. Other traditions, such as those of
European Islamic art and early medieval migratory art,
embraced calligraphic line and script, as well as dense geometrical and organic ornament.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
INT-1
A variety of factors leads to and motivates interaction between and among cultures,
and this interaction may influence art and art making. Such cultural interaction
may result from factors including, but not limited to, travel, trade, war, conquest,
and/or colonization, and may include forms of artistic influence such as spolia,
appropriation, and stylistic revivals, among other expressions of cultural exchange.

INT-1.A.6
The advent of the Age of Exploration in the late 15th
century resulted in the emergence of global commercial and cultural networks via transoceanic trade and
colonization. European ideas, forms, and practices began to be disseminated worldwide as a result of exploration, trade, conquest, and colonization.
INT-1.A.7
Art production in the Spanish viceroyalties in the
Americas exhibited a hybridization of European and indigenous ideas, forms, and materials, with some
African and Asian influences. Although much colonial art
is religious, nonreligious subjects—such as portraiture,
allegory, genre, history, and decorative arts—were central to Spanish viceregal societies.
INT-1.A.8
Art production in the Spanish viceroyalties paralleled
European art practices in terms of themes, materials,
formal vocabulary, display, and reception. However,
given the Spanish Catholic context in which this art
production developed, Spanish colonial art of the early
modern period corresponded more closely to that of southern Europe.

PAA-1.A.5
Corporate and individual patronage informed the
production, content, form, and display of art—from
panel painting, altarpieces, sculpture, and print to
myriad decorative arts, such as metalwork and textiles.
Displayed in churches, chapels, convents, palaces, and
civic buildings, the arts performed various functions (e.g., propagandistic, commemorative, didactic,
devotional, ritual, recreational, and decorative).
PAA-1.A.6
Surviving architecture is primarily religious in function (though domestic architecture survives from the
late Middle Ages); both ground plans and elevations accommodated worship and incorporated symbolic numbers, shapes, and ornament.
PAA-1.A.7
Audiences’ periodic rejections of figural imagery on
religious structures or objects on theological grounds
were common to all three major medieval religions.
These artworks could facilitate a connection with the
divine through their iconography (icons) or contents (reliquaries).
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
PAA-1
A variety of purposes may affect art and art making, and those purposes may
include, but are not limited to, intended audience, patron, artistic intention, and/
or function. Differing situations and contexts may influence the artist, patron, or
intended audience, with functions sometimes changing over time, and therefore
affecting the role these different variables may play in art and art making.

THR-1.A.8
The study of art history is shaped by different theories
and interpretations of art and art making that change over time and may be generated both by visual
analysis as well as by scholarship. These theories and
interpretations may be used, harnessed, manipulated,
and adapted in order to make an art-historical argument about a work or a group of works of art. European
medieval art is generally studied in chronological order and divided into geographical regions, governing
cultures, and identifiable styles, with associated but
distinctive artistic traditions. There is significant overlap
in time, geography, practice, and heritage of art created
within this time frame and region. Nationalist agendas and
disciplinary divisions based on the predominant language
(Greek, Latin, or Arabic) and religion (Judaism, Western
or Eastern Orthodox Christianity, or Islam) have caused
considerable fragmentation in the study of medieval art.

THR-1.A.10
Art from the early modern Atlantic world is typically
studied in chronological order, by geographical region,
according to style, and medium. Thus, early modernity
and the Atlantic arena are highlighted, framing the
initiation of globalization and emergence of modern
Europe, and recognizing the role of the Americas in
these developments. More attention has been given in
recent years to larger cultural interactions, exchanges, and appropriations.
THR-1.A.11
Most primary source material is housed in archives and
libraries worldwide and includes works of art both in situ
and in private and public collections. An immense body of secondary scholarly literature also exists.
THR-1.A.12
The traditional art history survey presents a historical
narrative that, by selectively mapping development of
the so-called “Old World,” constructs the idea of the
West. One problem with this model is that in privileging
Europe, the Old World is placed in an oppositional
relationship to the rest of the world, which tends to
be marginalized, if not neglected. A focus on early modernity and interconnectedness of the Atlantic regions presents a more comprehensive approach to the study of art.
THR-1.A.13
Information and objects from different parts of the world
were gathered in European cultural centers, where their
influence is evident in the contents of curiosity cabinets;
advances in science and technology; consolidation of European political and economic power; and the
development of modern conceptions of difference, such as race and nationalism.
LEARNING
OBJECTIVE
THR-1.A

Students are likely to be familiar with some of the works of art from this period. Build on this knowledge to practice contextual analysis so that students can use these skills to connect works from regions and time periods with which they may be less familiar.
Students can fine-tune their attribution skills and focus on major movements and time periods to help categorize and classify works. They can spend time on comparison, specifically explaining similarities and differences in how works of art convey their meaning.
Build on argumentation skills developed in Unit 3 by having students use specific and relevant evidence to support claims developed when examining the works in Unit 4. Rather than using generic statements, such as many things influenced art over time, claims should be specific: an increase in industrialization affected the development of art in nineteenth-century Europe.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The long essay responses on the Exam assess students' ability to respond to prompts effectively, using specific and relevant evidence to support their claims.
Free-response question 5 asks students to use visual and contextual analysis to analyze a work from outside of the required image set. Students should identify a work of art with which they are unfamiliar by identifying and comparing features in the unknown work to similar ones in a work from the image set. They must learn to combine their art historical knowledge and visual and contextual analysis skills to explain how the unknown work is similar to the one they know by describing how specific features or traits are similar, or how the pieces’ intent, purpose, or function have similarly shaped the creation or meaning of the work. This is the art historical skill of attribution.
To prepare students for the exam, they should practice these skills using a variety of images and objects outside of the required 250 works.
Developing Understanding
From the mid-1700s to 1980 ce, Europe and the Americas experienced rapid change and
innovation that involved considerable cultural, technological, and stylistic shifts. Art was
created and existed in the context of dramatic events such as industrialization, urbanization,
economic upheaval, migration, and war. In the mid-19th century, advances in technology
hastened the development of building construction, including skyscrapers as an innovative
architectural form. This unit allows students to make connections between these contexts
and the art that emerged from them with a focus on the influence of interactions between and
among cultures, the effects of technology, and significant shifts in purposes, functions, and audiences for art.
BIG IDEA 2
Interactions with Other
Cultures
INT §§ How did cultural interactions influence and shape the creation of art and artistic traditions in Later Europe and the
Americas?
BIG IDEA 4
Materials, Processes, and Techniques  MPT §§ How is art and art making in this period shaped by advances in technology, increased availability of materials, and wider dissemination of techniques?

Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 4.1
Graphic Organizer
Have students create a concept web showing the influences of Monet’s Saint-Lazare
Station (116) on other artistic production within and across time periods (including the
Impressionist, Post-impressionist, and into Modernist movements). Place an image of
Saint-Lazare in the middle of a white board or piece of chart paper and ask students
to add images that were influenced by this work and include a paragraph explaining the influence.
2 4.1
Quickwrite
Organize students into three groups and have each group  first classify the works by
movement and then quickwrite to generate ideas that explain the meaning or significance
of similarities and/or differences between the following works of art: Group 1: Monticello
(102), Oath of the Horatii (103), and George Washington (104); Group 2: The Starry Night
(120), Where Do We Come From? (123), and Mont Sainte-Victoire (125); Group 3:
Les Demoiselles d’Avignon (126) and The Portuguese (130). When each group has
finished their quickwrite, ask them to give a brief share out explaining their ideas.
3 4.2
Be the Docent
Have students work with a partner and choose one of the works from this topic. Each pair
then researches the artist’s intent or purpose for the work and its meaning. Have copies
of the works displayed in some way,  Have each pair prepare and explain the artist’s intent
or purpose, and (if possible) critical or popular reception of the work to classmates in a
gallery scenario where the students are the docents, explaining works of art to visitors
(their classmates). Alternatively, work with an AP World or AP European History class and have those students visit your “gallery.” 4 4.3
Match Game
Have students choose one work from this topic and research to find another work
by the same artist. Place all of the works NOT in the image set on cards (or on slides)
and have students match the work with the known artist. When a student correctly
matches the artist and the work, have them explain why they attributed the work to the artist.
SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page provide possible ways to integrate varied instructional
approaches into the classroom. These activities are optional, and teachers are free to alter
or edit them. Note that for images included from the image set, the image number has been
provided in parentheses. Please refer to the Instructional Approaches section beginning on

LEARNING
OBJECTIVE
CUL-1.A
Explain how cultural practices, belief systems, and/or physical setting affect art and art making.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
CUL-1.A.19
From the mid-1700s to 1980 ce, Europe and the
Americas experienced rapid change and innovation.
Art existed in the context of dramatic events such as
industrialization, urbanization, economic upheaval,
migration, and war. Countries and governments were
re-formed, and women’s and civil rights’ movements catalyzed social change.
CUL-1.A.20
The Enlightenment set the stage for this era. Scientific
inquiry and empirical evidence were promoted in order
to reveal and understand the physical world. Belief in
knowledge and progress led to revolutions and a new
emphasis on human rights. Subsequently, Romanticism
offered a critique of Enlightenment principles and industrialization.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
CUL-1
Cultural practices, belief systems, and physical setting constitute an important part
of art and art making and are often communicated in various stylistic conventions
and forms. Such cultural considerations may affect artistic decisions that include,
but are not limited to, siting, subject matter, and modes of display, and may help to
shape the creation of art in a given setting or within a given culture.

LEARNING
OBJECTIVE
INT-1.A
Explain how interactions with other cultures affect art and art making.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
INT-1.A.9
Architecture witnessed a series of revival styles,
including classical, Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque.
INT-1.A.10
Artists were affected by exposure to diverse cultures, largely as a result of colonialism.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
INT-1
A variety of factors leads to and motivates interaction between and among cultures,
and this interaction may influence art and art making. Such cultural interaction
may result from factors including, but not limited to, travel, trade, war, conquest,
and/or colonization, and may include forms of artistic influence such as spolia,
appropriation, and stylistic revivals, among other expressions of cultural exchange.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
CUL-1.A.21
Artists assumed new roles in society. Styles of art
proliferated and often gave rise to artistic movements.
Art and architecture exhibited a diversity of styles, forming an array of “isms.” Diverse artists with a common dedication to innovation came to be
discussed as the avant-garde. Subdivisions include
neoclassicism, romanticism, realism, impressionism,
post-impressionism, symbolism, expressionism, cubism, constructivism, abstraction, surrealism, abstract
expressionism, pop art, performance art, and earth and
environmental art. Many of these categories fall under the general heading of modernism.
CUL-1.A.22
The philosophies of Marx and Darwin affected
worldviews, followed by the works of Freud and Einstein.
Later, postmodern theory influenced art making and the study of art.

Explain how artistic decisions about form, style, materials, content, function, and/or context of a work of art (or group of related works of art) elicit a response or shape its reception.
Required Course Content
LEARNING
OBJECTIVE
PAA-1.A
Explain how purpose, intended audience, or patron affect art and art making.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
PAA-1.A.9
Works of art took on new roles and functions in society, and were experienced by audiences in new ways.
PAA-1.A.10
Art was displayed at public exhibitions, such as the
Salon in Paris, and later at commercial art galleries.
Church patronage declined and corporate patronage
emerged. The museum became an important institution
of civic and national status and pride. The sale of art to
the public became the leading driver of art production.
The collection of art increased, driving up prices, as art
became a commodity that appreciated in value. After
the devastation of Europe in World War II, artists in the
United States dominated the art market.
PAA-1.A.11
Audiences ranged from private patrons to the public, who were sometimes hostile toward art that broke with tradition.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
PAA-1
A variety of purposes may affect art and art making, and those purposes may
include, but are not limited to, intended audience, patron, artistic intention, and/
or function. Differing situations and contexts may influence the artist, patron, or
intended audience, with functions sometimes changing over time, and therefore
affecting the role these different variables may play in art and art making.

UNIT 4
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
PAA-1.A.12
Artists were initially bonded by sanctioned academies
and pursued inclusion in juried salons for their work to
be displayed. The influence of these academies then
receded in favor of radical individualism; some artists
worked without patronage. Some joined together in self defined groups, often on the margins of the mainstream
art world, and they often published manifestos of their
beliefs. Change and innovation dominated this era and became goals in their own right.
PAA-1.A.13
Women artists slowly gained recognition as many competed for admiration of their individuality and genius.

LEARNING
OBJECTIVE
MPT-1.A
Explain how materials, processes, and techniques affect art and art making.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
MPT-1.A.11
In the mid-19th century, advances in technology, such
as the steel frame, ferroconcrete construction, and
cantilevering, hastened the development of building construction. Skyscrapers proliferated and led to
an international style of architecture that was later challenged by postmodernism.
MPT-1.A.12
Artists employed new media, including lithography,
photography, film, and serigraphy. They used industrial
technology and prefabrication, as well as many new
materials, to create innovative and monumental works,
culminating with massive earthworks. The advent of
mass production supplied artists with ready images,
which they were quick to appropriate. Performance was
enacted in novel ways and recorded on film and video.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
MPT-1
Art and art making take many different forms both within and across cultures, and
the materials, processes, and techniques employed may also vary by location and
culture with wide-ranging influence on the art that is generated.

OBJECTIVE
THR-1.A
Explain how theories and interpretations of works of art are shaped by visual analysis as well as by other disciplines, technology, or the availability of evidence.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
MPT-1.A.14
Art of this era often proved challenging for audiences and patrons to immediately understand. The study
of art history is shaped by different theories and interpretations of art and art making that change over time and may be generated both by visual
analysis as well as by scholarship. These theories and
interpretations may be used, harnessed, manipulated,
and adapted in order to make an art-historical argument about a work or a group of works of art.

Thinking Skills
1.A

1.C
5.A  5.B
The art of the Indigenous Americas presents a wide-ranging collection of works that vary by cultural origin. Students will learn to deepen their visual analysis skills as they focus on describing the elements of these varied works and explain how artists’ decisions about form, style, materials, technique, and content shape the works they are studying (ranging from the wood-carved
Kwakwaka’wakw Transformation mask (164) to the stone complex of Yaxchilán (155)).
This unit provides an excellent opportunity to introduce additional works to develop students’ ability to transfer their visual analysis skills to unknown works. Whether students are working with works from the image set or unknown works, they should continue to use the visual elements they are describing as the foundation for their analysis.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Students apply the skill of visual analysis in many ways in both the multiple-choice and free-response sections of the Exam.
In addition to describing visual elements, such as style and form, students need to demonstrate an understanding of how the artist's decisions affected the work. For example, how the artists' decision to echo a traditional form using modern materials in the
Black-on-Black ceramic vessel (166) shaped the work.
In addition to students demonstrating their ability to identify a work with which they are not familiar by attributing it to a specific artist, culture, or tradition, they must also be able to build on this to effectively use their skills of visual analysis to describe an unknown work of art by analyzing its form, style, and content, and even the materials and techniques employed in its creation. The exam assesses their ability to apply their skills of visual analysis to both known and unknown works, so students will need regular practice to be prepared for the questions in each of the exam sections that address this.
Developing Understanding
Art of the Indigenous Americas emphasizes unity with the natural world, spirituality, animal based media, and creation of aesthetic objects with a strong functional aspect. This unit
introduces distinct cultural developments in Ancient Mesoamerica, the Ancient Central
Andes, Ancient America, and Native North America that are reflected in the art and art making
of each different culture. The similarities and differences in the cultures, as well as in materials,
processes, and techniques, provide students the opportunity to understand how these
factors shape and are shaped by art and art making.

KNOWLEDGE
CUL-1.A.23
Art of the Indigenous Americas is among the world’s
oldest artistic traditions. Although its roots lie in northern
Asia, it developed independently between c. 10,000
bce and 1492 ce, which marked the beginning of the
European invasions. Regions and cultures are referred to
as the Indigenous Americas to signal the priority of First
Nations cultural traditions over those of the colonizing
and migrant peoples that have progressively taken over the American continents for the past 500 years.
CUL-1.A.24
Art of the Indigenous Americas is categorized by
geography and chronology into the designations of Ancient
America and Native North America. “Ancient America” is
the category used for art created before 1550 ce, south
of the current United States–Mexico border. This region
is traditionally divided into three main areas of culture—
Mesoamerica, Central America*, and Andean South
America. “Native North America” denotes traditionally
oriented cultures north of the United States–Mexico border
from ancient times to the present, with an emphasis on
the period from 1492 ce to today. Native North America
has many regional subunits, such as the Northwest Coast,
Southwest, Plains, and Eastern Woodlands.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
CUL-1
Cultural practices, belief systems, and physical setting constitute an important part
of art and art making and are often communicated in various stylistic conventions
and forms. Such cultural considerations may affect artistic decisions that include,
but are not limited to, siting, subject matter, and modes of display, and may help to
shape the creation of art in a given setting or within a given culture.

CUL-1.A.25
Ancient Mesoamerica encompassed what are now
Mexico (from Mexico City southward), Guatemala, Belize,
and western Honduras, from 15,000 bce to 1521 ce, which
was the time of the Mexica (Aztec) downfall. General
cultural similarities of ancient Mesoamerica include
similar calendars, pyramidal stepped structures, sites
and buildings oriented in relation to sacred mountains and celestial phenomena, and highly valued green materials, such as jadeite and quetzal feathers.
CUL-1.A.26
Three major distinct cultures and styles of Ancient
Mesoamerica (Middle America) were the Olmec, Maya,
and Mexica (also known as Aztec—the empire that was dominated by the Mexica ethnic group). The Olmec
culture existed during the first millennium bce, primarily
in the Gulf Coast; the Mayan culture peaked during
the first millennium ce in eastern Mesoamerica (the
Yucatan Peninsula, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras);
and the Mexica culture existed from 1428 to 1521 ce
in the region of central Mexico, though subordinating most of Mesoamerica. (Other important cultures
include Teotihuacan, Toltec, West Mexican, Mixtec,
and Zapotec.*) Styles from the various Mesoamerican cultures differed markedly.
CUL-1.A.27
Mesoamerican sculptural and two-dimensional art
tended toward the figural, particularly in glorification of
specific rulers. Mythical events were also depicted in
a realistic, figural mode. Despite the naturalistic styles
and anthropomorphic interpretations of subject matter,
shamanic transformation, visions, and depiction of other
cosmic realms appear prominently in Mesoamerican art.
CUL-1.A.28
The ancient Central Andes comprised present-day
southern Ecuador, Peru, western Bolivia, and northern
Chile. General cultural similarities across the Andes included an emphasis on surviving and interacting
with the challenging environments, reciprocity and
cyclicality (rather than individualism), and reverence for
the animal and plant worlds as part of the practice of shamanistic religion.

CUL-1.A.29
As with ancient Mesoamerica, the Central Andes region
was a seat of culture and art parallel to the “Old World” in
antiquity, diversity, and sophistication. Baskets from this
region have been found dating to as early as 8800 bce,
proving early peopling from Asia through the rest of the
Americas was accomplished by Neolithic times. Chavín
and Inka were representative and distinct early and late
cultures/styles, respectively (Chavín, c. 1200–500 bce in
the northern highlands with reach to the southern coast;
Inka, 1438–1534 ce covering the entire Central Andes),
although many other important, art producing cultures existed between them. Similarities within Central
Andean cultures can be traced to the influence of three
significantly distinct ecosystems in close proximity—the dominant Andes mountains, a narrow desert coast,
and the planet’s largest rain forest (the Amazon). These
environments necessarily play a central role in art,
influencing the materials (especially the prominence
of camelid fiber and cotton textiles), political systems
(coastal diversity, highland impulses toward unification),
and overall values (reciprocity, asymmetrical dualism,
and travel across long distances). Peoples of the Andes
practiced the world’s earliest and most persistent
artificial mummification (in many forms, from 5500 bce
onward), and almost all art became grave goods for use in the afterlife.
CUL-1.A.30
Complex ties linked coast with highlands; these connections brought forth themes of reciprocity,
interdependence, contrast, asymmetry, and dualism.
Accordingly, most Andean art seems to have been made
by collaborative groups—the best known being the Inka
high-status aclla (the empire’s most talented women weavers, who were kept cloistered).
CUL-1.A.31
Andean art tends to explore the terrestrial (e.g., animal
and plant imagery, mountain veneration, sculpting of
nature itself, and organic integration of architecture with
the environment). It also concerns the non-terrestrial
via abstraction and orientation toward the afterlife and
the other realms of the cosmos. Shamanic visionary
experience was a strong theme, especially featuring humans transforming into animal selves.

CUL-1.A.32
Different regions of Native America have broadly similar
styles of art, allowing grouping into Arctic*, Northwest
Coast, Southwest, Plains, and Eastern Woodlands,
among others. The various Native American groups may
be seen to share larger ideas of harmony with nature,
oneness with animals, respect for elders, community
cohesion, dream guidance, shamanic leadership, and
participation in large rituals (such as potlatches and sun
dances). Post-contact art not only reflects these long standing values, but it is also concerned with the history
of conflict within tribes and between indigenous people and the U.S. and Canadian governments.
CUL-1.A.33
Indians, Native Americans, North American Indians
(in the United States), and First Nations (in Canada)
are nonindigenous terms for the indigenous peoples
inhabiting areas north of what is now the United States–
Mexico border, from ancient times to the present. They
did not have a collective name for themselves, being many different tribes and nations.

Mesoamerica has had an influence on its invaders and
the world at large since the 16th century. Mesoamerica
is the origin of many of the world’s staple foods—
chocolate, vanilla, tomatoes, avocados, and maize (corn).
Mesoamericans discovered rubber, invented the first ball
game, and included a number of matrilineal and matriarchal
cultures. Recognition of the importance of this area in world
history and art has lagged, but it increases as inclusiveness
and multiculturalism grow in scholarship and popular
consciousness. Indigenous culture continues; more than
seven million people speak Mayan languages today, and
more than one million speak Nahuatl, the Aztec language.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
INT-1
A variety of factors leads to and motivates interaction between and among cultures,
and this interaction may influence art and art making. Such cultural interaction may
result from factors including, but not limited to, travel, trade, war, conquest, and/or
colonization, and may include forms of artistic influence such as spolia, appropriation,
and stylistic revivals, among other expressions of cultural exchange.

INT-1.A.12
When Mexico was first discovered by Europe, gifts
of Mexica art sent to Charles V alerted such artists
as Albrecht Dürer to the unfamiliar but impressive
media and images from the New World. Colonial artists
preserved certain pre-Hispanic traditions both overtly
and covertly in their art. After independence from Spain
(in the early 19th century), the Aztec were claimed
in nationalistic causes, and national museums were created to promote ancient art. Twentieth-century
muralists, such as Diego Rivera, overtly incorporated themes from the Mexica past. Twentieth-century
European and American artists, such as Henry Moore*
and Frank Lloyd Wright, were strongly influenced by
the sculpture and architecture of ancient Mesoamerica as well.
INT-1.A.13
The European invasions prevailed beginning in 1534 ce,
but indigenous descendants of ancient peoples remain.
Eight to ten million people still speak Quechua, the
Inka language. Being more distant geographically
and aesthetically, Andean art was less well known to early modern Europe and current society than was
Mesoamerican art. However, some key modern Euro-
American artists, such as Paul Gauguin, Josef and Anni
Albers*, and Paul Klee*, found inspiration in ancient
Peruvian textiles and ceramics. Modern Latin American
artists, such as Joaquín Torres Garcia of Uruguay*,
blended Inka art and architecture with modernist theory
and style, exploring a common abstract vocabulary.

INT-1.A.14
Although disease and genocide practiced by the
European invaders and colonists reduced the Native
American population by as much as 90%, Native
Americans today maintain their cultural identity and
uphold modern versions of ancient traditions in addition
to creating new art forms as part of the globalized contemporary art world. Because of the history of
suppression and forced assimilation into white culture,
the influence of Native North American art on modern
U.S. and European art styles has been minimized.
However, recent cultural revitalization of traditions and
active contemporary artistic production by self-taught
and academically trained artists keep Native American
participation in global artistry alive. Strains range
from self-conscious revival of ancient arts, such as in
Puebloan pottery, to cutting political commentary on racism and injustice.
INT-1.A.15
Centuries of interaction with colonial and migrant peoples means that some imported materials (e.g.,
glass beads, machine-made cloth, and ribbon) are now
considered traditional. Likewise, in subject matter, the
Spanish-introduced horse has become a cultural and
artistic staple, alongside the indigenous buffalo, raven,
and bear. European influence is inevitable but may be
subtle. What is considered traditional is constantly
changing; there is no singular, timeless, authentic Native
American art or practice.

KNOWLEDGE
MPT-1.A.13
Artistic traditions of the Indigenous Americas exhibit
overarching traits—content that emphasizes unity with
the natural world and a five-direction (north, south,
east, west, center) cosmic geometry; spirituality based
in visionary shamanism; high value placed on animal based media (e.g., featherwork, bone carving, and
hide painting); incorporation of trade materials (e.g.,
greenstones, such as turquoise and jadeite; shells,
such as the spiny oyster; and in the case of Native
North America, imported beads, machine-made cloth,
and glazes); stylistic focus on the essence rather than
the appearance of subjects; and creation of aesthetic
objects that have a strong functional aspect, reference,

MPT-1.A.14
The necessity to interact with three disparate
environments (mountains, desert coast, and rainforest)
in order to survive instilled in Andean culture and art
an underlying emphasis on trade in exotic materials.
A hierarchy of materials was based on availability and/
or requirement for collaboration to manipulate the
materials. Featherwork, textiles, and greenstone were
at the top of the materials hierarchy; metalwork, bone,
obsidian, and stone toward the middle; and ceramics
and wood at the lower end of the hierarchy. Textiles were a primary medium and were extraordinarily
well preserved on the desert coast, fulfilling key practical and artistic functions in the various environmental zones.
MPT-1.A.15
Mesoamerican pyramids began as early earthworks,
changed to nine-level structures with single temples,
and then later became structures with twin temples.
Sacred sites were renovated and enlarged repeatedly
over the centuries, resulting in acropolises and massive
temples. Architecture was mainly stone post-and-lintel,
often faced with relief sculpture and painted bright
colors, emphasizing large masses that sculpt outdoor
space. Plazas were typical for large ritual gatherings.
Elaborate burials and other underground installations to honor the role of the underworld were also found.
MPT-1.A.16
Native American art media include earthworks, stone and adobe architecture, wood and bone carving,
weaving and basketry, hide painting, ceramics, quillwork
and beadwork, and, recently, painting on canvas and other European-style media. Geometric patterning, figures (often mythic or shamanic), and animals
(e.g., snakes, birds, bison, and horses) are often seen.

Purpose and Audience in Indigenous American Art
LEARNING
OBJECTIVE
PAA-1.A
Explain how purpose, intended audience, or patron affect art and art making.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
PAA-1.A.14
What is called “art” is considered to have, contain, and/
or transfer life force rather than simply represent an
image. Likewise, art is considered participatory and
active, rather than simply made for passive viewing.
PAA-1.A.15
Art was produced primarily in workshops, but certain
individual artists’ styles have been identified (particularly
in the Maya), and some works of art were signed. Artists
were typically elite specialists and, among the Maya, the second sons of royalty.
PAA-1.A.16
Rulers were the major, but not the only, patrons.
Audiences were both large (for calendrical rituals in
plazas) and small (for gatherings of priests and nobles
inside small temples atop pyramids). Some audiences were supernatural, as for the elaborate graves considered to be located in the underworld.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
PAA-1
A variety of purposes may affect art and art making, and those purposes may
include, but are not limited to, intended audience, patron, artistic intention, and/
or function. Differing situations and contexts may influence the artist, patron, or
intended audience, with functions sometimes changing over time, and therefore
affecting the role these different variables may play in art and art making.

ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
PAA-1.A.17
Many Native American artworks are ritual objects to
wear, carry, or use during special ceremonies in front of
large audiences. Functionality of the object is preferred;
the more active a work of art, the more it is believed to
contain and transfer life force and power. Intellectual pursuits apparent in artistic expressions include
astronomical observation; poetry, song, and dance;
and medicine (curing and divining). Artistic practices
included workshops, apprentice-master relationships,
and, less often, solitary art making. Some specialization
by gender (e.g., women weaving and men carving) can
be seen. Patrons might be the tribal leaders, an elder,
or a family member. Audiences mostly were the entire group, though some objects and performances were restricted by their sacred or political nature.

ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
THR-1.A.15
The study of art history is shaped by different theories
and interpretations of art and art making that change over time and may be generated both by visual
analysis as well as by scholarship. These theories and
interpretations may be used, harnessed, manipulated,
and adapted in order to make an art-historical argument about a work or a group of works of art. Despite
underlying similarities, there are key differences
between the art of ancient America and Native North
America with respect to its dating, environment, cultural
continuity from antiquity to the present, and sources
of information. Colonization by different European
groups (Catholic and Protestant) undergirds distinct
modern political situations for Amerindian survivors.
Persecution, genocide, and marginalization have shaped current identity and artistic expression.

ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
THR-1.A.16
Archaeological excavation of works of art, monuments,
and cities/sites predating European invasion serves
as the mainstay for reconstructing the art and culture
of ancient America, although the majority of surviving
artworks were not scientifically extracted. Spanish
chronicles by invaders, friars, and colonists provide some information about monuments and artistic
practices of the last independent indigenous peoples,
such as the Inka, Mexica (also known as Aztecs), and
Puebloans; these sources can be cautiously applied to earlier cultures’ basic values and approaches.
THR-1.A.17
Hieroglyphs of the Mayas and Mexica illuminate
text and image, and historical and artistic elements
of those cultures. Ethnographic analogy highlights
basic cultural continuities so that present traditional
practices, myths, and religious beliefs may illuminate past artistic materials, creative processes, and
iconography. Other disciplines, such as astronomy,
botany, and zoology, help identify siting of cities and
monuments, as well as native flora and fauna subject
matter. Like all art historical research, work in these areas uses iconographic and formal analyses of
large numbers of artworks and increasingly employs multidisciplinary collaboration.
THR-1.A.18
Sources of information for Native North American art
include archaeological excavations for precontact and
colonial cultures, written ethnohistoric documents,
tribal history (oral and written), modern artists’ accounts and interviews, and museum records. Colonial and modern mistreatment of Native North Americans means that historical information sources may be
highly contested. Divergent stories depend on whether
native or non-native sources are used. Sometimes the
stories converge in a positive way, as in Maria and Julian
Martinez’s revival of ancient black-on-black ceramic
techniques, which was encouraged by anthropologists.

Unit 6 focuses on using contextual analysis to better understand the rich artistic traditions of the different African cultures represented by the individual works in the image set. Given the small number of works included in this unit, and the vast and rich artistic traditions of African art, this unit also presents the opportunity to provide works outside of the image set so that students continue to hone the art historical skill of visual analysis of unfamiliar works. Students should apply their skills of contextual description to examine the function, context, siting, subject matter, and reception of the works of art in this unit.
They will build upon this to explain how the purpose or function has shaped the creation of the work, how the work’s context may have influenced artistic decisions, and how the artistic decisions have influenced the response to or reception of the work.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the exam, students may be asked to explain how and why context influences artistic decisions, and how these decisions affect the creation or the meaning of a work of art. This challenging task can often cause students to confuse visual analysis with contextual analysis by mentioning the form, style, materials, technique, or content itself, rather than how context influenced those elements or the artist’s use of them.
Students should begin by identifying visual elements, and then go on to explain how or why those visual elements were chosen. As the most sophisticated and challenging part of this analysis, students should explain how the context of the work led to the artists’ decisions, and how those decisions shaped the work to elicit a certain response or shape how an audience receives it.
Free-response question 5 asks students to use visual analysis skills to justify an attribution of an unknown work. By recognizing and describing patterns and similarities between an unknown work and one from the image set, students can make a thematic connection and use this visual evidence to justify their attribution.
Developing Understanding
Connecting the concept of culture to African art is critical to understanding the art itself,
as well as the role it plays in the many and varied African societies. Artistic expression is an
integral part of social life within the African continent, connecting daily practices to beliefs,
systems of authority, and social structures. This unit allows students to further examine
the role of art historical interpretations by exploring art and art making in Africa. Students
will recognize that art often generates different theories and interpretations, that these
interpretations are based on both visual and contextual analysis, and that these theories
often change over time as a result of influences that may include available technology,
contributions of other disciplines, the availability of evidence, and even cultural biases.

OBJECTIVE
CUL-1.A
Explain how cultural practices, belief systems, and/or physical setting affect art and art making.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
CUL-1.A.34
Human life, which is understood to have begun in Africa,
developed over millions of years and radiated beyond
the continent of Africa. The earliest African art dates to 77,000 years ago.
CUL-1.A.35
Early artistic expression on the African continent is
found in the rock art of the Sahara and in southern
Africa. Those works depict the animals that lived in
each region, human pursuits (e.g., herding, combat, and
perhaps dance or some sort of regularized behavior),
contact among different groups of people, and the use of technologies (e.g., horses and chariots).
CUL-1.A.36
The now-deserts of the Sahara were once grasslands and
an original source of agriculture and animal husbandry. As
the desert grew, it stretched toward the still well-watered
valley of the Nile and the culture of pharaonic Egypt.
CUL-1.A.37
Art reveals belief systems; it presents a world that is
known but not necessarily seen, predictable, or even
available to everyone. These arts are expressive rather
than representational and often require specialized or
supernaturally ordained capabilities for their creation,
use, and interpretation. African art is concerned with
ideas (beliefs and relationships that exist in the social
and intellectual world) rather than with objects of the natural or physical world.
CUL-1.A.38
As in all arts, aspects of human experience (such as
origins, destinies, beliefs, physicality, power, and gender) are expressed through objects and performances.
Artistic expression in Africa is an integral part of social
life, connecting daily practices to beliefs, systems
of power and authority, and social networks that link people to their families, communities, and shared
ancestors. African arts mark status, identity, and cycles
of human experience (e.g., maturational, seasonal, astronomical, and liturgical).
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
CUL-1
Cultural practices, belief systems, and physical setting constitute an important part
of art and art making and are often communicated in various stylistic conventions
and forms. Such cultural considerations may affect artistic decisions that include,
but are not limited to, siting, subject matter, and modes of display, and may help to
shape the creation of art in a given setting or within a given culture.

CUL-1.A.39
Urbanization and its monumental trappings (both
bureaucratic and architectural) often associated with
“civilization” take many forms in Africa. Administrative
and liturgical centers exist apart from settlement that is
often determined by the spaces required for agriculture
or herding. Seasonal climatic shifts and demands of
political relations affect the scale and distribution of
built environments and arts that mark them. The sites
of Meroë, Timbuktu, Zimbabwe, Igbo Ukwu, and Kilwa
Kisiwani demonstrate that range of monumentalities.

ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
INT-1.A.16
Human migrations carried populations southward into
central Africa and eventually across the Congo River
Basin. The arts, major world religions, and international
trade routes followed those paths and flourished in patterns of distribution seen in Africa today.
INT-1.A.17
Outsiders have often characterized, collected, and
exhibited African arts as primitive, ethnographic, anonymous, and static, when in reality Africa’s
interaction with the rest of the world led to dynamic
intellectual and artistic traditions that sustain hundreds
of cultures and almost as many languages, contributing
dramatically to the corpus of human expression. African
life and arts have been deeply affected by ongoing,
cosmopolitan patterns of interaction with populations around the world and through time.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
INT-1
A variety of factors leads to and motivates interaction between and among cultures,
and this interaction may influence art and art making. Such cultural interaction
may result from factors including, but not limited to, travel, trade, war, conquest,
and/or colonization, and may include forms of artistic influence such as spolia,
appropriation, and stylistic revivals, among other expressions of cultural exchange.

KNOWLEDGE
INT-1.A.18
Creative contributions of African life and arts are found
in populations around the world. Artistic practices were conveyed by and continue to be serviced by
African people and beliefs, from Macao to Manaus to
Mauritania. These creative contributions are reflected
in diverse art forms, from the practices of Santeria to Japanese screens and the paintings of Renaissance
Venice. The literatures of Negritude and the Harlem
Renaissance expanded the notions of place and race to
new levels that are again changing in the contemporary
diaspora. Although traditional African art forms are
usually described and exhibited, contemporary African
arts have increased awareness and understanding of the arts of the continent across the globe.

ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
PAA-1.A.18
Human beliefs and interactions in Africa are instigated
by the arts. African arts are active; they motivate
behavior, contain and express belief, and validate social organization and human relations.
PAA-1.A.19
Use and efficacy are central to the art of Africa. African arts, though often characterized, collected, and
exhibited as figural sculptures and masks, are by nature meant to be performed rather than simply viewed.
African arts are often described in terms of the contexts
and functions with which they appear to be associated.
PAA-1.A.20
Art is created for both daily use and ritual purposes
(such as leadership, religious beliefs, diagnosis and
divination, education, and personal adornment). Art
forms may be prescribed by a diviner, commissioned by
a supplicant, and produced by a specific artist. The art
object comes under the custodianship of the person
who commissioned it or a member of his or her family.
Performances of objects are accompanied by costumes
and music. None of these practices is simple or random.
Cultural protocols acknowledge and ensure the efficacy
and appropriateness of artistic experience in Africa.
TOPIC 6.2
Purpose and Audience in African Art
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
PAA-1
A variety of purposes may affect art and art making, and those purposes may
include, but are not limited to, intended audience, patron, artistic intention, and/
or function. Differing situations and contexts may influence the artist, patron, or
intended audience, with functions sometimes changing over time, and therefore
affecting the role these different variables may play in art and art making.

ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
PAA-1.A.21
The arts of authority (both achieved and inherited status
and roles) legitimate traditional leadership. Leaders’
histories and accomplishments are often entrusted to
and lauded by historians, bards, and elders. Personal
identity, social status, and relationships are delineated
by aesthetic choices and artistic expression. Common
ancestors link leaders, sanction social behavior and
choices, and define the order of social life. Education,
incorporation into adulthood, and civic responsibility are
processes marked by the creation, manipulation, and interpretation of art objects.
PAA-1.A.22
African histories, often sung or recited, are traditionally
the responsibility of specialists. African art is sung, danced, and presented in holistic experiences for
designated audiences; it is created for specific reasons and to produce expected results.

LEARNING
OBJECTIVE
THR-1.A
Explain how theories and interpretations of works of art are shaped by visual analysis as well as by other disciplines, technology, or the availability of evidence.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
THR-1.A.19
As they have been traditionally collected by outsiders,
African art objects that are similar in form are often
grouped with works that come from the same place and
are produced by a designated ethnic group. The name
of the artist and the date of creation may not be known
or acknowledged, but such gaps in the record do not
necessarily reflect a lack of interest on the part of those
who commission, use, and protect art objects. The Africa
we know often comes from ideas promulgated by non-
Africans since the 9th century—as though Africa’s history
were brought to, rather than originating from, Africa.
THR-1.A.20
The study of art history is shaped by different theories
and interpretations of art and art making that change over time and may be generated both by visual
analysis as well as by scholarship. These theories and
interpretations may be used, harnessed, manipulated,
and adapted in order to make an art-historical argument about a work or a group of works of art. Although
interpretation of some of this art is conjectural at best,
the clarity and strength of design and expression in the work is obvious.

In this unit students continue to practice contextual analysis, now with a focus on works in West and Central Asia. They will consider how the purpose or function of a work has shaped its creation and how a work's context may have influenced artistic decisions, recognizing that function, siting, or reception may be key factors. Students will examine the many works, such as the Kaaba (183) or the
Bamiyan Buddha (182), influenced by religious and philosophical traditions.
Such contextual analysis of works is critical to mastering the art historical thinking skills in this unit. Students should then move to explaining how and why works in this unit demonstrate continuity and change within
their artistic tradition, explaining their influence on other art.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Art History Exam, students will need to describe and explain continuity and change within artistic traditions, which can be a difficult task.
The most challenging part of this analysis is explaining the significance of the continuity and change that exists between works of art within an artistic tradition. Students may be able to explain that there is continuity or change between works within a tradition, but they often struggle, or do not even attempt to explain, why this is important and what it tells us. Regular discussion and writing about the significance of continuity and change within a tradition will move students toward mastery of this skill.
Developing Understanding
The arts of West and Central Asia provide evidence of the cultural transfer of ideas and art
forms throughout this region. The presence of Hellenistic architecture, Buddhist sculpture,
ceramic tile decoration, and chinoiserie outside of their original areas of development are each illustrations of this cultural transfer.
Many of these works were created for a specific religiously-affiliated purpose, patron, or
audience. They play a key role in the history of world art, serving as an example of the vast
cultural interchanges that link European and Asian peoples.
Ceramics, metalwork, textiles, painting, and calligraphy are some of the materials, processes,
and techniques employed by artists in these regions and cultures. This unit illustrates the
importance and influence that these different materials and techniques had on art and art making within and across cultures.

Have students debate the significance and meaning of continuities and changes
between Folio from a Qur’an (187), Bahram Gur Fights the Karg (189), and The Court of
the Gayumars (190). Divide students into two teams; one will argue that the three works
represent continuity within the Islamic and West and Central Asian tradition and the other
will argue that the works represent change. Both teams should acknowledge the opposite
viewpoint but should come up with evidence to support their positions and refute the
others. Challenge each group to address how interactions with other cultures may have led to these changes and/or continuities.

Artists of West and Central Asia excelled in the creation
of particular art forms exhibiting key characteristics
unique to their regions and cultures. Important forms
include ceramics, metalwork, textiles, painting, and calligraphy.
MPT-1.A.19
Ceramic arts have flourished in West Asia since the prehistoric era, and many technical advancements
in this media, such as the development of lusterware
and cobalt-on-white slip painting, developed there.
Ceramic arts were used to create utilitarian vessels
and elaborate painted and mosaic-tile architectural
decoration, carrying forward artistic practices explored
in ancient West Asia (the Near East). High points in West
and Central Asian ceramics include Persian mosaic tile architecture from the Seljuk through the Safavid
dynasties, as seen in the Great Mosque of Isfahan, and
Iznik tile work and export ceramics created during the
Ottoman dynasty.

MPT-1.A.20
Metalwork and metallurgy flourished in West and Central
Asia in the creation of metal plaques, vessels, arms,
armor and tack, sculpture, and decorative objects of all
kinds. Islamic metalwork is widely regarded as one of
the finest decorative art forms of the medieval world.
Metal sculpture was an important art form in Central
Asian and Himalayan Buddhist art, which created
Buddhist figures in bronze, copper, brass, and silver,
and often ornamented them with gilding, metal inlay,
and paint. Metal artworks were created through various
processes including casting, beating, chasing, inlaying, and embossing.
MPT-1.A.21
Textile forms from this region include silk-tapestry weaving, silk velvets, and wool and silk carpets.
MPT-1.A.22
Painting in West and Central Asia usually took three
forms—wall painting, manuscript painting, and in the
Himalayan regions, the painting of thangkas (large
paintings on cloth) of Buddhist deities and mandalas.
Calligraphy was a prominent art form, particularly in
Islamic art in West Asia where beautiful forms were
created to transmit sacred texts. Calligraphy is found
on architecture, decorative arts objects, and ceramic
tiles, as well as in manuscripts written on paper, cloth, or vellum.
MPT-1.A.23
Styles of art from West Asia tend to favor two dimensional design. These works are often highly decorative, employing geometric and organic forms
and vegetal designs, qualities that carry over into figural
works, where figures inhabit flat or shallow spaces with tipped perspectives and patterned landscapes.

CUL-1.A.40
The religious arts of West and Central Asia are united
by the traditions of the region—Buddhism and Islam.
Cultures of these regions are diverse, but they were
united through their shared beliefs and practices,
particularly the world religions of Buddhism, which
originated in the 6th century bce in South Asia, and of
Islam, which originated in the 7th century ce in West Asia.
CUL-1.A.41
West Asia is the cradle of arts produced in regions with
a dominant Islamic culture. These arts may be religious or secular in nature and may or may not have been
made by or for Muslims. The term “Islamic art” may
be applied to these diverse art forms. Many examples
of Islamic art from across the traditional Islamic lands
share similarities in terms of their content and visual characteristics.
CUL-1.A.42
Pilgrimage is an important religious practice in Islam and
Buddhism, and is a key focus of several monuments and
artworks in West and Central Asia including the Kaaba,
the most sacred site in Islam; the Dome of the Rock in
Jerusalem; and the Buddha sculpture Jowo Rinpoche, considered the most sacred image in Tibet.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
CUL-1
Cultural practices, belief systems, and physical setting constitute an important part
of art and art making and are often communicated in various stylistic conventions
and forms. Such cultural considerations may affect artistic decisions that include,
but are not limited to, siting, subject matter, and modes of display, and may help to
shape the creation of art in a given setting or within a given culture.

ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
PAA-1.A.23
The arts of West and Central Asia were created for and
acquired by various kinds of local and global patrons.
Audiences for these works included royal and wealthy
patrons, lay and monastic religious practitioners, and
foreign collectors who acquired works through gift or trade.
PAA-1.A.24
Architecture in West and Central Asia is frequently
religious in function. West and Central Asia is home to
many important Islamic mosques, which are decorated
with nonfigural imagery, including calligraphy and
vegetal forms. All mosques have a Qibla wall, which
faces the direction of Mecca, home of the Kaaba. This
wall is ornamented with an empty mihrab, serving as a niche for prayer. A large congregational mosque may also include a minbar (pulpit for the imam),
as well as a minaret and a central courtyard to call and accommodate practitioners for prayer. Other
important forms of Islamic religious architecture include commemorative monuments, such as the Kaaba and
the Dome of the Rock, and tomb architecture. Central
Asia is further recognized for its outstanding Buddhist
cave architecture, which incorporates relief carving,
constructive sculpture, and wall painting. In the Tibetan
lands, Buddhist architecture flourishes in the form of stupas and monastic architecture.

OBJECTIVE
INT-1.A
Explain how interactions with other cultures affect art and art making.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
INT-1.A.19
The arts of West and Central Asia play a key role in
the history of world art, giving form to the vast cultural
interchanges that have occurred in these lands that link the European and Asian peoples.
INT-1.A.20
Historical cultures of West and Central Asia reside in a
vast area that includes the Arabian Peninsula and the
Levant, Anatolia, Greater Iran, Central Asia, Inner Asia, and
Himalayan Asia. These regions have had shifting political
boundaries throughout their histories and include lands
associated with the former Soviet Union and modern
China. They form the heart of the ancient Silk Route that
connected the Greco-Roman world with China and India.
INT-1.A.21
Arts attest to the transmission and influence of cultural ideas,
such as Islam and Buddhism, and cultural art forms, such
as Hellenistic architecture, Buddhist sculpture, chinoiserie
(in Persian art), and ceramic-tile decoration. Cross-cultural
comparisons with the arts of these regions may be made
most readily to the arts of the ancient Mediterranean;
medieval Europe; and South, East, and Southeast Asia.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
INT-1
A variety of factors leads to and motivates interaction between and among cultures,
and this interaction may influence art and art making. Such cultural interaction
may result from factors including, but not limited to, travel, trade, war, conquest,
and/or colonization, and may include forms of artistic influence such as spolia,
appropriation, and stylistic revivals, among other expressions of cultural exchange.

ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
INT-1.A.22
The arts of West and Central Asia had great international
impact through trade. Textiles were perhaps the most important art form in these regions and dominated
much of the international trade between Europe and Asia. Islamic metalworks, including examples with
Christian subject matter, were created for trade in the
regions bordering the Mediterranean. Ceramics were
another important trade item, particularly the Iznik wares created in Turkey.
INT-1.A.23
West Asian art finds its greatest source of refinement
and international influence in the Persianate arts
from the Timurid and Safavid dynasties of Iran, which
influenced the Ottoman arts of Turkey and the Mughal
arts of India. Styles of art in Central Asia can be
divided into Persianate Islamic styles, which maintain developments made in West Asian art, and Indian inspired styles, which are characterized by the idealized figural art traditions of South Asia.

ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
THR-1.A.21
The study of art history is shaped by different theories
and interpretations of art and art making that change over time and may be generated both by visual
analysis as well as by scholarship. These theories and
interpretations may be used, harnessed, manipulated,
and adapted in order to make an art-historical argument
about a work or a group of works of art. Use of figural art
in religious contexts varies among traditions, whereas
figural art is common in secular art forms across West and Central Asia.

ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
THR-1.A.22
Figural art is a primary form of visual communication
in Buddhist communities in Central Asia, as it is across
Asia. Figural imagery is used to depict Buddha and
various attendants, teachers, practitioners, and deities.
This is an iconic culture, and the presence of invoked
figural imagery is important to Buddhist practices.
These figures may be venerated in shrine settings, may
inhabit conceptual landscapes and palaces of ideal
Buddhist worlds, may be found in mandalas, or may be depicted in paintings.
THR-1.A.23
Islamic art that is created for religious purposes does
not contain figural imagery. Mosque architecture is
decorated with nonfigural imagery, including calligraphy,
geometric, and vegetal forms. Manuscripts or objects containing sacred texts may contain calligraphy,
illumination, or geometric and vegetal decoration, but should not contain figural imagery.
THR-1.A.24
Figural art is an important subject of Islamic art in
West and Central Asia. Islamic cultures draw a clear
distinction between sacred and secular contexts, and figural imagery abounds in secular works, such as
decorative arts and manuscript painting, which often
depict sociological types, such as hunters or courtiers,
or narrative subjects, such as the ancient kings and
heroes of the Persian Shahnama. Religious ideas or
content are sometimes carried over into secular art forms and may be illustrated when they become the
subject of courtly or popular literature and poetry. For
example, the prophet Moses might be illustrated in
the Khamsa of Nizami. Moses would not be illustrated, however, in the holy Qur’an.

8.B
8.C
The different styles of works in Unit 8 allow students to practice comparison (especially within and between regions) and artistic traditions (e.g., the influence of religion on various works from Borobudur Temple (199) to the Taj Mahal (209) in this region over time).
Practice argumentation by building on skills developed in earlier units. If students used purpose and materials to support claims in Unit 3, for example, they could use similar techniques to identify specific and relevant evidence about art in this unit. Once they have determined what kind of evidence to use to support their claim, have students explain how the evidence justifies the claim. One way students can do this is by comparing the use of visuals such as relief carvings in places of worship like Angkor Wat (199) and Chartres Cathedral (60).
Preparing for the AP Exam
Free-response question 1 asks students to compare how different works convey meaning. Often, students describe their understanding of a work's meaning but then struggle to explain how this meaning is conveyed or fail to offer specific visual or contextual evidence to support an explanation.
Students often explain how one work conveys meaning and then explain how a second work conveys meaning but do not proceed to effectively compare the two.
To do so, students will have to discuss the similarities and/or differences in how the two works convey meaning, what this means, and why it is significant.
Developing Understanding
Asian art was and is global, as the cultures of these regions were connected to each other and to
West Asia and Europe, with clear reciprocal influences. In this unit, students connect works of art
and artistic traditions to the cultural practices and belief systems in South, East, and Southeast
Asia. Many religious and philosophic traditions developed in these regions, and the art generated
shows the strong influence of these traditions as art was created for the express purpose of supporting such beliefs and practices.
Students have the opportunity to study the artistic traditions of each of the regions in this unit
and the discrete works within each tradition. They will also examine the works and how they
provide evidence of these reciprocal cultural exchanges by considering them in the larger context of centuries of art history.

OBJECTIVE
MPT-1.A
Explain how materials, processes, and techniques affect art and art making.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
MPT-1.A.24
South, East, and Southeast Asia have long traditions
of art making, reaching back into prehistoric times.
The earliest known ceramic vessels were found in
Asia—fired shards from Yuchanyan Cave in China have been dated to 18,300 and 17,500 bce, followed by
Jomon vessels from Japan with shards dating back to
10,500 bce. The arts of South, East, and Southeast Asia
represent some of the world’s oldest, most diverse, and most sophisticated visual traditions.
MPT-1.A.25
The arts of South, East, and Southeast Asia include important forms developed in a wide range of media. Ceramic arts have flourished in Asia since
the prehistoric era, and many technical and stylistic
advancements in this media, such as the use of high-fire
porcelain, developed here. Metal was used to create
sculpture, arms and armor, ritual vessels, and decorative
objects of all kinds. Shang dynasty bronze vessels* from
China employed a unique piece-molding technique that has never been successfully replicated.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
MPT-1
Art and art making take many different forms both within and across cultures, and
the materials, processes, and techniques employed may also vary by location and
culture with wide-ranging influence on the art that is generated.

MPT-1.A.26
Distinctive art forms from South, East, and Southeast
Asia include the construction of Buddhist reliquary
stupas; the practice of monochromatic ink painting on silk and paper, which developed in China; the
development of the pagoda, an architectural form based on a Chinese watchtower; the use of rock gardens, tea houses, and related ceremonies; and Japanese woodblock printing.
MPT-1.A.27
Stone and wood carving were prominent art forms
used in architectural construction, decoration, and sculpture. Temples intended to house deities or
shrines were constructed or rock-cut. Rock-cut caves containing Buddhist imagery, shrines, stupas, and
monastic spaces span across Asia from India through
Central Asia to China. Japanese architecture often uses
natural materials, such as wood, or follows Chinese
architectural models with wood structures and tile roofs.
MPT-1.A.28
Painting in Asia usually took two forms—wall painting
and manuscript or album painting. The painting styles
that developed in India and East Asia favor contour
drawing of forms over modeling. Calligraphy was an
important art form in these regions. In China, calligraphy was considered the highest art form, even above
painting. Calligraphy was also prominent in Islamic art
in Asia, and is found on architecture, decorative arts
objects, and ceramic tiles, and in manuscripts written on paper, cloth, or vellum.
MPT-1.A.29
Important textile forms from this region include silk and wool-tapestry weaving, cotton weaving, printing, painting, and carpet weaving.
MPT-1.A.30
Elegant and elaborate decorative programs featuring floral and animal designs are commonly found on decorative arts from East Asia.

Sophisticated Neolithic and Bronze Age civilizations
thrived across Asia, including the Indus Valley civilization
in Pakistan and India, the Yangshao* and Longshan*
cultures and Shang dynasty* in China, the Dongson*
culture in Southeast Asia, and the Yayoi* and Kofun*
cultures in Japan. The people and cultures of these regions were diverse, but prehistoric and ancient
societies based in key regions (e.g., the Indus River
Valley, Gangetic Plain, and Yellow River) developed core
social and religious beliefs that were embraced across
larger cultural spheres, helping to shape the regional identities of people within Asia.
CUL-1.A.44
The core cultural centers in Asia became home to many
of the world’s great civilizations and ruling dynasties, including Gupta India, Han China, Khmer Cambodia,
and Heian Japan. The shared cultural ideas in each
region and civilization gave birth to visual traditions that
employed related subjects, functions, materials, and artistic styles.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
CUL-1
Cultural practices, belief systems, and physical setting constitute an important part
of art and art making and are often communicated in various stylistic conventions
and forms. Such cultural considerations may affect artistic decisions that include,
but are not limited to, siting, subject matter, and modes of display, and may help to
shape the creation of art in a given setting or within a given culture.

KNOWLEDGE
CUL-1.A.45
Many of the world’s great religious and philosophic
traditions developed in South and East Asia. Extensive
traditions of distinctive religious art forms developed
in this region to support the beliefs and practices of these religions.
CUL-1.A.46
The ancient Indic worldview that dominated South Asia
differentiated earthly and cosmic realms of existence,
while recognizing certain sites or beings as sacred, and
understood time and life as cyclic. The religions that
developed in this region—Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism,
Sikhism, and numerous folk religions—all worked
within this worldview and sought spiritual development,
spiritual release, or divine union through various religious methodologies and social practices. The
Indic worldview was also grafted onto the preexisting
animistic and popular beliefs in Southeast Asia during several waves of importation and Indian attempts at colonization.
CUL-1.A.47
The practice of the indigenous Asian religions necessitated the development of novel art and
architectural forms to support them. Uniquely Asian
art forms include iconic images used in Buddhist and
Hindu traditions; elaborate narrative and iconographic
compositions created in sculptures, textiles, and wall paintings used to ornament shrines, temples, and
caves; the Buddhist stupa and monastic complex; the
Hindu temple; Raigo scenes* associated with Pure Land
Buddhism; the Zen rock garden; and Zen ink painting.
CUL-1.A.48
Religious practices associated with Hinduism,
Buddhism, and Jainism are iconic; therefore figural
imagery of divinities and revered teachers plays a
prominent role in religious practice. The wealth of
Buddhist imagery in Asia alone would rival, if not
surpass, the wealth of Christian imagery in medieval
Europe. Figural imagery associated with Asian religious
art may be venerated in temple or shrine settings; may
inhabit conceptual landscapes and palaces of ideal
Buddhist worlds, or mandalas; and are depicted in
paintings. Figural subjects are common in Indian and East Asian painting.

CUL-1.A.49
East Asian religions emphasize the interconnectedness
of humans with both the natural world and the spirit
world. Both Daoism, with its almost antisocial focus on living in harmony with nature and the Dao, and
Confucianism, more of an ethical system of behaviors
rather than a religion, developed in China in the 5th century BCE from these foundations. Buddhism, which arrived in China in the early centuries of the Common Era, shared clear affinities with the indigenous Chinese religions through its focus on
nature, interconnectedness, and appropriate behavior.
Korean traditions were heavily influenced by China and
incorporate Confucian, Buddhist, and local shamanistic
beliefs and practices. The ancient Japanese landscape

ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
PAA-1.A.25
South, East, and Southeast Asia have rich traditions of
courtly and secular art forms that employ local subjects
and styles. In India, regional painting styles developed
to illustrate mythical and historical subjects, and poetic
texts documented court life. In China and Japan, a new
genre of literati painting developed among the educated
elite. Literati paintings often reveal the nonprofessional
artist’s exploration of landscape subjects, which are
frequently juxtaposed with poetry. Chinese societies
also developed a hierarchical and differentiated society
that encouraged appropriate social behaviors that are expressed in art and architecture.
PAA-1.A.26
Architecture from these regions is frequently religious in function.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
PAA-1
A variety of purposes may affect art and art making, and those purposes may
include, but are not limited to, intended audience, patron, artistic intention, and/or
function. Differing situations and contexts may influence the artist, patron, or
intended audience, with functions sometimes changing over time, and therefore
affecting the role these different variables may play in art and art making.

PAA-1.A.27
Islamic architecture in South and Southeast Asia
takes two major forms: secular (forts and palaces) and
religious (mosques and tombs). Islamic mosques are
decorated with nonfigural imagery, including calligraphy
and vegetal forms. All mosques have a Qibla wall, which
faces the direction of Mecca, home of the Kaaba. This
wall is ornamented with an empty mihrab, which serves as a niche for prayer.
PAA-1.A.28
The term “secular” is a bit misleading when describing
Asian art, as religious ideas or content frequently are
carried over into secular art forms (e.g., Hindu deities
depicted in Ragamala painting* in India, or Zen Buddhist
sensibilities applied to ceramic production and flower arranging in Japan).

ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
INT-1.A.24
Asian art was and is global. The cultures of South, East,
and Southeast Asia were interconnected through trade
and politics and were also in contact with West Asia and Europe throughout history.
INT-1.A.25
Trade greatly affected the development of Asian cultures and Asian art. Two major methods for international trade connected Asia—the Silk Route
that linked Europe and Asia, connecting the Indian
subcontinent to overland trade routes through Central
Asia, terminating in X’ian, China, and the vast maritime networks that utilized seasonal monsoon winds to
move trade among North Africa, West Asia, South Asia,
Southeast Asia, and south China. These routes were the
vital mechanism for the transmission of cultural ideas
and practices, such as Buddhism, and of artistic forms,
media, and styles across mainland and maritime Asia.
INT-1.A.26
Buddhism was actively imported to Japan from Korea and China in the 7th and 8th centuries, and as in
China, it succeeded because of courtly patronage and similarities with local traditions.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
INT-1
A variety of factors leads to and motivates interaction between and among cultures,
and this interaction may influence art and art making. Such cultural interaction
may result from factors including, but not limited to, travel, trade, war, conquest,
and/or colonization, and may include forms of artistic influence such as spolia,
appropriation, and stylistic revivals, among other expressions of cultural exchange.

South, East, and Southeast Asia were also home
to foreign cultures and religions, including Greco-
Roman cultures, Christianity, and most notably
Islamic cultures from West and Central Asia. Islamic
influence is particularly strong in India, Malaysia, and
Indonesia, which were under at least partial control
of Islamic sultanates during the second millennia CE.
These regions have also been influenced by cultures
and beliefs from West Asia and Europe. Today South

INT-1.A.28
Asian arts and architecture reveal exchanges of
knowledge in visual style, form, and technology with
traditions farther west. Early connections with the Greco-
Roman world are evident in the Hellenistic-influenced
artistic style and subjects found in artwork associated with ancient Gandharan culture in Afghanistan and
Pakistan (Gandhara bridges what is categorized as West
and East Asian content in AP Art History; influence of
Gandharan art is observed in the Buddha of Bamiyan).
Early Buddha sculptures in north India, China, and Japan
wear a two-shouldered robe based on the Roman toga.
South and Southeast Asia had early contact with Islam
through trade and in western India, through military
campaigns. In the 12th and 13th centuries, Islamic
sultanates arose in these lands, creating another layer of
cultural practices and interactions and influencing Asian
visual culture through the importation and creation of
new art forms and styles. Innovations based on Islamic
influence in these areas include the use of paper for
manuscripts and paintings, as well as the adoption of
Mughal styles in Hindu court architecture, painting, and
fashion. European influence is evident in the evolution
of architectural styles, and in the adoption of naturalism
and perspective in Asian painting traditions during the colonial era.

KNOWLEDGE
INT-1.A.29
Asian art forms had great influence on the arts of West
Asia and Europe. Art and ideas were exchanged through
trade routes. The impact of Asian art is especially
evident during times of free exchange, such as the Silk
Route during the Han and Tang dynasties and Mongol
Empire, the colonial era, and the opening of Japan for
trade in the 19th century. In West Asia and Europe,
collectors acquired Asian art works through gift or trade.
Ceramics created in China, from Tang slipwares to high fire porcelains, have been coveted internationally for more than 1,000 years. The popularity of Chinese blue-and-white porcelain was so high that ceramic
centers in Iran, Turkey, and across Europe developed local versions of blue-and-white ceramics to meet market demand. Textiles are also a very important
Asian art form and dominated much of the international
trade between Europe and Asia. Silk and silk weaving
originated in China, where it flourished for thousands
of years. Cotton was first spun and woven in the Indus
Valley region of Pakistan and was, like silk, important
for international trade. Cross-cultural comparisons may be made most readily among the arts of South,
East, and Southeast Asia and the arts of the ancient
Mediterranean, medieval Europe, and West Asia.

Historical Thinking Skills
1.A
1.B
1.C
7.A  7.B
By Unit 9, students should be able to identify a work of art clearly and accurately and provide relevant identification details about that work. Students should consider the varied and disparate arts of the Pacific and be able to explain how artistic decisions have shaped those works of art, from the architecture of Nan Madol (213) to the
Hawaiian feather cape (215).
The content in this unit is an excellent opportunity for students to explore experts’ interpretations of the works, their reception, and their meaning, as they in turn build their own understanding of the works. Art historical interpretations grow from analysis of the form, style, materials, content, function, context, reception, and/or meaning of a particular work—creating an evidence-based argument.
The development of this skill will then allow students to combine the skills they have developed throughout the previous units to craft their own, relevant, evidence-based interpretation of works of art.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Throughout the multiple-choice section of the exam, as well as in free-response question 4, students will need to demonstrate the skill of art historical interpretation.
Students will need to practice explaining how an art historical interpretation is derived in order to evaluate whether the interpretation is a valid one based on their own analysis of a work’s elements. They often need guidance to recognize that the interpretations of others are not necessarily established fact and should be considered and analyzed based on evidence. This is a difficult task, as it requires a synthesis of many of the art historical skills.
Students eventually will transfer their understanding of this concept to their own analysis and writing as they communicate their analysis of works by making claims they can justify with specific visual and contextual supporting evidence. In this way, they will be crafting their own art historical interpretation of a work and defending it.
Developing Understanding
Understanding the intended purpose and audience of the arts of the Pacific is an important
focus of study in this unit. Works of art from this region are often performed, and the experience
is central to the creation of and participation in them. The arts of the Pacific are expressions of
beliefs and social structure, which are strong forces in the social and cultural life of this region.
Art and art making in this region is influenced by many things, and physical setting and available
materials can be important considerations that affect artistic decisions and creations. Created
in a variety of media, such as sea ivory and shell, wood, coral, and stone, the arts of the Pacific
are often distinguished by their use of these materials.

KNOWLEDGE
MPT-1.A.31
Pacific arts are composed of objects, acts, and events
that are forces in social life. Created in a variety of
media, Pacific arts are distinguished by the virtuosity with which materials are used and presented.
MPT-1.A.32
Pacific arts are objects and events created from fibers,
pigments, bone, sea ivory, seashell, and tortoise shell,
as well as wood, coral, and stone, which are carried, exchanged, and used by peoples of the region.
MPT-1.A.33
Objects and behaviors in the cultures of the Pacific are often designed and presented to stimulate a
particular response. Rare and precious materials are
used to demonstrate wealth, status, and particular circumstance. Ritual settings are structured with elements that address all of the senses. Physical combat and warfare are announced and preceded by
displays of ferocity in dress, dance, verbal aggression, and gestural threats.

ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
CUL-1.A.50
The Pacific region—including more than 25,000 islands,
about 1,500 of which are inhabited—is defined by its
location within the Pacific Ocean, which comprises one
third of the earth’s surface. The lands are continental,
volcanic, and atollian. Each supports distinct ecologies
that exist in relation to the migrations and sociocultural systems that were transported across the region.
CUL-1.A.51
Geological and archaeological evidence indicates
that Papuan-speaking peoples traveled across a land
bridge that connected Asia and present-day Australia about 30,000 years ago. Lapita people migrated
eastward across the region beginning 4,000 years ago.
Populations sailed from Vanuatu eastward, and carried
plants, animals, and pottery that now demonstrate a
pattern of migration and connection from what was the
Lapita culture.
TOPIC 9.2
Interactions Within and Across Cultures in Pacific Art
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
CUL-1
Cultural practices, belief systems, and physical setting constitute an important part
of art and art making and are often communicated in various stylistic conventions
and forms. Such cultural considerations may affect artistic decisions that include,
but are not limited to, siting, subject matter, and modes of display, and may help to
shape the creation of art in a given setting or within a given culture.

KNOWLEDGE
CUL-1.A.52
Ships and devices of navigation and sailing expertise
were built and used to promote exploration, migration, and the exchange of objects and cultural patterns
across the Pacific. Navigators created personal charts
or expressions of the truths of their experience of the
sea and other objects intended to protect and ensure
the success of sailing. Ocean-going vessels carried
families, and often communities, across vast distances;
passengers could also return to their place of departure.
CUL-1.A.53
The sea is ubiquitous as a theme of Pacific art and as a
presence in the daily lives of a large portion of Oceania, as it both connects and separates the lands and peoples of the Pacific.

INT-1.A.30
The arts of the Pacific vary by virtue of ecological
situations, social structure, and impact of external influences, such as commerce, colonialism, and missionary activity.
INT-1.A.31
The region was explored by Europeans as early as the
16th century and most extensively from the second half
of the 18th century. By the beginning of the 19th century,
Dumont d’Urville had divided the region into three
units—micro- (small), poly- (many), and mela- (black)
nesia (island). By 800 ce the distribution that has come
to be described as Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia was established.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
INT-1
A variety of factors leads to and motivates interaction between and among cultures, and
this interaction may influence art and art making. Such cultural interaction may result
from factors including, but not limited to, travel, trade, war, conquest, and/or colonization,
and may include forms of artistic influence such as spolia, appropriation, and stylistic
revivals, among other expressions of cultural exchange.

OBJECTIVE
PAA-1.A
Explain how purpose, intended audience, or patron affect art and art making.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
PAA-1.A.29
Arts of the Pacific involve the power and forces of deities,
ancestors, founders, and hereditary leaders, as well as
symbols of primal principles, which are protected by
wrapping, sheathing, and other forms of covering to
prevent human access. Ritual dress, forms of armor, and
tattoos encase and shield the focus of power from human
interaction. One’s vital force, identity, or strength (mana) is
expressed and protected by rules and prohibitions, as well
as by wrapping or shielding practices, or tapu. Mana is also
associated with communities and leaders who represent
their peoples. Objects that project status and sustain
structure hold and become mana. These objects are made
secure through tapu or behaviors that limit access to and protect the objects.
PAA-1.A.30
Pacific arts are performed (danced, sung, recited,
displayed) in an array of colors, scents, textures, and movements that enact narratives and proclaim primordial truths. Belief in the use of costumes, cosmetics, and constructions assembled to enact
epics of human history and experience is central to the creation of and participation in Pacific arts.
PAA-1.A.31
Objects such as shields, ancestral representations, and
family treasures were and continue to be constructed
to give form to and preserve human history and social continuity. Other art forms are constructed to be displayed and performed to remind people of their
heritage and shared bonds (such as the significance of
an ancestor or leader) and are intended to be destroyed once the memory is created.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
PAA-1
A variety of purposes may affect art and art making, and those purposes may
include, but are not limited to, intended audience, patron, artistic intention, and/or
function. Differing situations and contexts may influence the artist, patron, or
intended audience, with functions sometimes changing over time, and therefore
affecting the role these different variables may play in art and art making.

KNOWLEDGE
PAA-1.A.32
Rulers of the Saudeleur Dynasty commanded
construction of Nan Madol in Micronesia, a residential and ceremonial complex of numerous human-made
islets. Rulers of Hawaii were clothed in feather capes that announce their status and shield them from
contact. Societies of Polynesia in New Zealand, Rapa
Nui, and Samoa create sacred ceremonial spaces that
both announce and contain their legitimacy, power,
and life force. In Melanesia, individuals and clans earn
status and power and sustain social balance in a set
of relationships marked by the exchange of objects.
Masks, and the performance of masks, are a recital and commemoration of ancestors’ histories and wisdom.
PAA-1.A.33
Reciprocity is demonstrated by cycles of exchange
in which designated people and communities provide specific items and in exchange receive equally
predictable items. The process of exchange is complex and prescribed. Chants, dances, scents, costumes,
and people of particular lineage and social position are
called into play to create a performance that engages all
of the senses and expands the form and significance of the exchange.
PAA-1.A.34
Duality and complementarity are aspects of social
relations that are often characterized by opposing forces or circumstances and express the balance of relations necessary between those seemingly
divergent forces. Gender, for example, is the basis for
inclusion in some societies but is understood in the
context of complement rather than opposition. Spatial
organization, shared spaces, and exclusive or rarified
spaces are created and used to reinforce social order.

ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
THR-1.A.26
The study of art history is shaped by different theories
and interpretations of art and art making that change over time and may be generated both by visual
analysis as well as by scholarship. These theories and
interpretations may be used, harnessed, manipulated,
and adapted in order to make an art-historical argument
about a work or a group of works of art. The arts of
the Pacific are expressions of beliefs, social relations,
essential truths, and compendia of information held by designated members of society.
THR-1.A.27
The acts of creation, performance, and even destruction
of a mask, costume, or installation often carry the
meaning of the work of art (instead of the object itself carrying the meaning). Meaning is communicated at
the time of the work’s appearance, as well as in the
future when the work, or the context of its appearance,
is recalled. This sort of memory is evoked through
the presentation of primordial forms such as cultural
heroes, founding ancestors, or totemic animals in order
to reaffirm shared values and important truths. In some
instances the memory is created and performed, and
then the objects that appeared in those processes are destroyed, leaving a new iteration of the memory.

Building the Art Historical
Thinking Skills
4.A
4.B  4.D  8.D
In addition to the other skills, spending time on argument in Unit 10 will be useful for students. An argumentative essay on the
Exam may ask students to explain continuity and/or change over time within an artistic tradition or to compare similarities and differences between works from different artistic traditions. In this unit, have students connect the evidence to the claim. Ask them to explain how the evidence justifies the claim. This justification often utilizes a word like because or through. For example,
Cindy Sherman’s Untitled #228 is a modern version of a Renaissance and Baroque work depicting the biblical story of Judith.
Sherman makes this connection through visual elements such as the use of similar
Biblical subject matter, the use of the color red for the heroine’s robes, and the drapery background.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The two long essay prompts ask students to connect visual or contextual analysis with the larger meaning or commentary communicated by a work. Students should identify specific support for the points they are making in their responses. They may know and be able to express a claim, but they often use generalizations when discussing the works or make vague statements in their arguments rather than providing specific and relevant evidence to support claims.
Students can then move on to develop rich and complex arguments in a number of ways. This might include considering multiple perspectives or explaining complex connections between, for example, a work’s context and the meaning conveyed by the work of art. This level of thought and sophistication in their thought and writing will move them toward success not only on the free-response section of the AP Art History
Exam but in many other academic situations as well.
Developing Understanding
Global contemporary art is characterized by the intersection of culture, materials, technologies,
and the globalized context in which it is created. Students should understand the role that each
of these factors plays in the art and art making in this unit, and should build on their knowledge
and understanding from previous units to add depth and complexity to their understanding
of these works. Because some art and art making is a specific reaction to or commentary
on previous art or artistic traditions, it often cannot be understood without knowledge of the context or reference.

MPT-1.A.35
Hierarchies of materials, tools, function, artistic training, style, and presentation are challenged. Questions
about how art is defined, valued, and presented are
provoked by ephemeral digital works, video-captured
performances, graffiti artists, online museums and
galleries, declines in (but preservation of) natural materials and traditional skills, predominance of
disposable material cultures, and the digital divide— access or lack of access to digital technology.

TOPIC 10.3
Interactions Within and Across Cultures in Global Contemporary Art
Required Course Content
LEARNING
OBJECTIVE
INT-1.A
Explain how interactions with other cultures affect art and art making.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
INT-1.A.32
In the scholarly realm, as well as in mainstream media, contemporary art is now a major phenomenon experienced and understood in a global context.
Art history surveys have traditionally offered less attention to art made from 1980 to the present. Although such surveys often presented contemporary art as largely a European and American phenomenon, today, contemporary art produced by artists of Africa, Asia, Oceania,
and the First Nations is receiving the same, if not more, attention than work produced in Europe and the Americas.
INT-1.A.33
The waning of colonialism, inaugurated by independence
movements; shifts in the balance of power with the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and the rise of China; and the development of widespread
communication networks such as the internet have all
contributed to representations of the world that are global and interconnected rather than Eurocentric.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
INT-1
A variety of factors leads to and motivates interaction between and among cultures,
and this interaction may influence art and art making. Such cultural interaction
may result from factors including, but not limited to, travel, trade, war, conquest,
and/or colonization, and may include forms of artistic influence such as spolia,
appropriation, and stylistic revivals, among other expressions of cultural exchange.

LEARNING
OBJECTIVE
CUL-1.A
Explain how cultural practices, belief systems, and/or physical setting affect art and art making.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
CUL-1.A.54
The art world has expanded and become more
inclusive since the 1960s, as artists of all nationalities,
ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations have
challenged the traditional privileged place of white,
heterosexual men in art history. This activism has been
supported by theories (e.g., deconstructionist, feminist,
poststructuralist, and queer) that critique perspectives
on history and culture that claim universality but are in fact exclusionary.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
CUL-1
Cultural practices, belief systems, and physical setting constitute an important part
of art and art making and are often communicated in various stylistic conventions
and forms. Such cultural considerations may affect artistic decisions that include,
but are not limited to, siting, subject matter, and modes of display, and may help to
shape the creation of art in a given setting or within a given culture.

Theories and Interpretations of Global
Contemporary Art
Required Course Content
LEARNING
OBJECTIVE
THR-1.A
Explain how theories and interpretations of works of art are shaped by visual analysis as well as by other disciplines, technology, or the availability of evidence.
ESSENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
THR-1.A.28
The study of art history is shaped by different
theories and interpretations of art and art making that change over time and may be generated both
by visual analysis as well as by scholarship. These
theories and interpretations may be used, harnessed, manipulated, and adapted in order to make an art historical argument about a work or a group of works
of art. Intended meanings are often open-ended and subject to multiple interpretations.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING

AP ART HISTORY

=== Page 304 ===
Selecting and Using Course Materials
Understanding a work of art involves consulting multiple sources of information. The first source
is the work of art itself, which may be experienced
in person or through a print or online resource. AP
Art History students should also consult primary
sources of information about a work of art: firsthand
accounts created by the artist, colleagues of the artist,
immediate audiences, or others. Primary sources can
describe how a work was initially displayed or explain
artistic choices of media and technique, for example.
Secondary sources (e.g., journal articles, critical reviews,
scholarly videos, guest or online lectures, podcasts, and museum interpretive materials) can be equally
revealing, as they offer analysis and interpretation of
artistic ideas, processes, products, and responses of different audiences.
Textbooks
The textbook is an important tool that can be used to
help students understand works of art including and
beyond the image set. Most importantly, the textbook
should be written at a college level and include scholarly
interpretations of art. Since the art historical skills are
fundamental to the course, a textbook that focuses on skill instruction is useful.
College-level art history textbooks organize content
in various ways; if following the unit structure of the course framework, the textbook chapters might be taught out of order. Most AP Art History teachers supplement the textbook with additional print and digital resources.
On the AP Central Course Audit page for this course,
you will find examples of college-level textbooks that meet the resource requirements.
Digital Resources
Thanks to the ubiquity of online communication, students have many options for conducting
independent research, participating in collaborative
investigations, and sharing and testing their findings via
communications with classmates, artists, audiences, art
historians, critics, and scholars. Teachers and students
can set up an online class site for sharing, compiling, and discussing art historical information.
AP Art History, Live and in Person
Art history is a living discipline—students encounter and respond to works of art every day that are influenced by the history of art making.
Students should experience AP Art History as a personal engagement with works of art in their immediate surroundings, as well as with works of art experienced in performances, museums,
galleries, books, and online. Students should practice connecting art they encounter outside the AP Art
History course to what they are learning about works of art in class.
Teachers should devise learning activities that require students to engage with actual works of art and architecture, including experiences with:
§§ museum visits;
§§ tours of artists’ studios;
§§ local architecture;
§§ galleries, exhibits, and displays (formal or informal, public or private);
§§ public monuments;
§§ works by fellow students or family members;
§§ urban planning and design; and §§ performance or street art.
Art history students’ understanding of the discipline
can also be significantly enriched by creating and analyzing their own artwork through the lens of
their AP Art History scholarship. Whether examining
their own work, the work of a peer, or works of art and architecture within local environs—along with required course content—students should practice
applying their analytical skills to understand any work
of art and connect it to other aesthetic objects, acts, or events.

Evaluating Quality and Credibility of Different Sources and Perspectives
Students have unprecedented access to information, so it is more important than ever to help them
determine the credibility of sources. The art historical
thinking skills require students to consider the quality of relevance of different information sources and perspectives to derive supportable conclusions,
Teachers should share and analyze trusted, high-quality resources with students.
The table below explains how students might address credibility or reliability of various sources.
Criteria
Considerations
Examples and Illustrations
Credibility §§ Credibility requires students to obtain information from sources with knowledge and expertise in art history. Sources can be print, online, or expert interviews or documentaries.
§§ Because many students are using the internet or database sources, students should consider
the following:
◆ ◆The domain name extensions indicate who publishes and owns the domain ◆ ◆Commonly used extensions include:
◆ ◆.edu (educational organization);
◆ ◆.com (company);
◆ ◆.org (any organization);
◆ ◆.gov (government agency);
◆ ◆.net (network).
◆ ◆The author(s) of the website ◆ ◆The credibility of sources cited in the materials as well as any websites they link to
§§ Read past the first slash in the domain name to see if the page might be someone’s personal page. A personal page might be less credible or include a bias that distorts the facts.
§§ Finding out who the authors are, their credentials, and the organization they are associated with will help to determine whether they are qualified to write about the topic.
§§ An article that includes citations of resources is often more credible.
§§ Design a lesson where students compare two art historical interpretations of one work in the image set. Ask students to research and determine which expert they find the most credible.
§§ Ask students to compare the description and interpretation of a work from a museum website with that of a textbook. Have them compare how the work is described for a public audience (the museum site) with a more scholarly audience (textbook).
Reliability §§ Students should examine the content of a source (the evidence) to ensure it supports their claims and provides insight and knowledge that relates to the topic. This means that evidence is only relevant when it addresses both the topic in context and the student’s argument.
§§ Because we are investigating a field where topics, works, and interpretations are changing and evolving, it is important to consider if the information being provided is the most recent and current.
§§ A YouTube video produced by an art lover may not be as reliable as one made by an art historian.
§§ An interpretation of a work written close to the time of the creation may differ from a modern interpretation. Guide students to determine reliability.

Instructional Strategies
The AP Art History course framework outlines the concepts and skills students must master in order
to be successful on the AP Exam. In order to address those concepts and skills effectively, it helps to
incorporate a variety of instructional approaches into daily lessons and activities. Help your students
develop mastery of the art historical skills and reasoning processes by engaging them in learning
activities that allow them to apply their understanding of course concepts. Consider the following strategies as you plan instruction.
Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Be the Docent
Through collaborative research, students learn about a work of art and how to present that information verbally and to answer questions about the work.
To help students apply their knowledge of a work of art, work as a team, and answer questions from peers.
Have students work with a partner and choose one of the works from a chosen topic. Each pair then researches the artist’s intent or purpose for the work and its meaning. Have copies of the works displayed in some way. Have each pair explain the artist’s intent or purpose, and (if possible) critical or popular reception of the work to classmates in a gallery scenario where the students are the docents, explaining works of art to visitors (their classmates).
Alternatively, work with an
AP World or AP European
History class and have those students visit your “gallery.”
Critique
Reasoning
Through collaborative discussion, students critique the arguments of others, questioning the art historian’s perspective, evidence presented, and reasoning behind the argument.
To help students learn from others as they make connections between concepts and learn to support their arguments with evidence and reasoning that make sense to peers.
Ask students to critique the reasoning behind one or more interpretations of a work of art, such as Sika dwa kofi (Golden Stool) (170) or David’s The Oath of the Horatii (103). Have students examine the interpretation to determine the evidence the historian uses regarding form, style, materials, content, function, reception, or meaning, to develop the interpretation.

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Debate
The presentation of an informal or formal argument that defends a claim with reasons, while others defend different claims about the same topic or issue. The goal is to debate ideas without attacking the people who defend those ideas.
To provide students an opportunity to collect and orally present evidence supporting the affirmative and negative arguments of a proposition or issue.
Have students debate the attribution of an unknown work of art. Make sure students use evidence to support their arguments.
Describe
Describing the visual details of a work of art, orally or in written format.
To allow students to practice visual analysis by describing what they see when experiencing a work of art (within the image set and with works beyond the image set).
In pairs, have one student describe the visual elements of a work of art to their partner who is not looking at the image. Have the student describing include the form, style, materials, technique, and content so their partner can either identify or produce a sketch of the work accurately.
Discussion Group
Students engage in an interactive, small-group discussion, often with an assigned role (e.g., questioner, summarizer, facilitator, and evidence keeper) to consider a topic, text, question, etc.
To allow students to gain new understanding of or insight into a text or issue by listening to multiple perspectives.
Use the learning objectives, such as explaining how theories and interpretations of works of art are shaped by visual analysis as well as by other disciplines, technology, or the availability of evidence (THR-1.A) to discuss how these factors may affect a given interpretation of a work of art.
Fishbowl
Some students form an inner circle and model appropriate discussion techniques while an outer circle of students listens, responds, and evaluates.
To provide students with an opportunity to engage in a formal discussion and to experience the roles of both participant and active listener; students also have the responsibility of supporting their opinions and responses using specific evidence.
Use this strategy to discuss the art historical interpretations of works from the image set.

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Flash Cards
Visual representations (print or digital) of the works from the image set that contain basic informational details, such as title, artist, date created, materials, and geographic location.
To allow students to be able to recall facts about the required works in the image set.
Print or digital flash cards (or an online game) with both images of works and simply the titles to help students correctly identify the works of art in the image set using these basic descriptors.
This exercise can help students develop the baseline content knowledge necessary to progress toward more complex skills.
Graphic Organizer
Representing ideas and information visually (e.g.,
Venn diagrams, flowcharts, and cluster maps).
To provide a visual system for organizing multiple ideas, details, and/or textual support to be included in a piece of writing.
Graphic organizers can be helpful when comparing specific information about works of art (such as form, style, context, and materials). Organizers such as concept webs or timelines are also useful to help students understand context and making connections between and among works of art. Make sure students use any organizer thoughtfully and are not simply “filling in the blanks.”
Guided Discussion
A Guided Discussion is an umbrella strategy that allows for the use of different techniques as you guide students through the lesson.
Helps students see the big picture and builds their confidence when dealing with difficult content and/or new skills.
Use brainstorming and questioning strategies to have students analyze and explain how the decisions of the artist shaped the work of art. For example, “Why did the artist create in this style? Why did the artist use this form?
Materials? Techniques, etc.” If the answers are unknown, have students speculate based on their knowledge. In this case, these questions can form the basis for attribution of an unknown work.

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Jigsaw
Each student in a group reads a different text or different passage from a single text, taking on the role of “expert” on what was read. Students share the information from that reading with students from other groups and then return to their original groups to share their new knowledge.
To have students summarize and present information to others in a way that facilitates an understanding of a text (or multiple texts) or issue without having each student read the text in its entirety; by teaching others, they become experts.
Have students examine a series of works of art displayed in public spaces, such as the panels in San Vitale (51), Raphael’s
School of Athens (76), and Diego Rivera’s fresco
Dream of a Sunday
Afternoon in the Alameda
Park (143), and use the questions in the previous column to analyze how artistic decisions and the context of the work shaped its reception by its audience.
Look for a Pattern
Students evaluate information to determine a pattern.
To identify patterns that may be used to draw conclusions.
Use a questioning strategy, such as Look for a Pattern, to analyze and classify a work of art that is not in the image set, such as a mosque. Start by having students identify the architectural style, visual forms, and purpose of some mosques in the image set, such as the
Great Mosque of Cordoba (56), the Mosque of Selim
II (84), and The Great
Mosque (Masjid-e Jameh) (186). Then have students apply those patterns to the unknown work in order to build an evidence-based explanation attributing the work as a mosque.
Making
Connections
Students are given a concept, term, required case, or document and asked to write what they know about it. Then, students are paired and asked to determine, describe, and then explain the connection between the two concepts.
To reinforce the fact that works often can be connected and provides the opportunity for students to make and explain connections between and among works from the image set and unknown works.
Provide students with a work of art, a style of work, audiences, or other organizing theme on cards;
place them into a box; and have students pick a card at random. Give students a few minutes to gather and recall information about the information on the card, and then pair students and ask them to find the connection between their works. Finally, ask the pairs to write a brief explanation of how the works are related.

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Match Claims and Evidence
Students are given sample claims (most of which can be improved upon) to evaluate and revise.
Then students match their revised claims with pieces of evidence that can be used to support the claims. Once matched, students write a statement explaining how and why the evidence supports the claim.
To provide opportunities for students to edit existing claims and match those claims with existing evidence in preparation for writing their own argumentative essays.
In early stages of practicing argumentation, ask small groups of students to write claims and supporting evidence statements based on a prompt. Have groups trade claims and evidence and revise or modify the claims (if necessary), match the claims and evidence, and write statements explaining why the evidence supports the claim.
Match Game
Students practice attribution by matching works to specific artists, movements, or locations.
To provide practice for students to attribute works within and beyond the image set.
Have students choose one work and do research to find another work by the same artist. Place all of the works NOT in the image set on cards (or on slides) and have students match the work with the known artist.
When a student correctly matches the artist and the work, have them explain why they attributed the ital work to the artist.
Quickwrite
Students write for a short, specific amount of time about a designated topic.
To help generate ideas in a short time.
As preparation for the free-response questions, use the learning objectives, such as explaining how cultural practices, belief systems, and physical setting affect art and art making (CUL-1.A), to have students write claims and explain evidence that supports their claims for various topics.
Peer Review/
Peer Editing
Working alone or with a partner to examine a piece of writing for accuracy and clarity.
Provides students an opportunity to edit a written text to ensure correctness of identified components.
As students work through writing components of their arguments (claims, evidence, justification), have students perform self or peer revisions of their practice argument essays so that they have the opportunity to review their practice claims, supporting evidence, and justification of how the evidence supports the claim.

A focused discussion tied to a topic, essential question, or selected text in which students ask questions of one another. The questions initiate a conversation that continues with a series of responses and additional questions.
To help students arrive at a new understanding by:
§§ Asking questions that clarify §§ Challenging assumptions §§ Probing perspective and point of view §§ Questioning facts, reasons, and evidence §§ Examining implications and outcomes.
Use the essential questions at the start of each unit to initiate discussion where students can illustrate their understanding of the learning objectives and essential knowledge statements.
Think-Pair-Share
Students think through a question or issue alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with the class.
Enables the development of initial ideas that are then tested with a partner in preparation for revising ideas and sharing them with a larger group.
Have students use Think-
Pair-Share to determine the intended meaning of a given work, and then some similarities and differences in how the work conveys that meaning.

Developing Art Historical
Thinking Skills
Throughout the course, students should practice and develop the skills that are fundamental to the discipline of art
history. These thinking skills represent the complex abilities that adept art historians demonstrate, and students will
benefit from multiple opportunities to develop them in a scaffolded manner. Through the use of guided questioning,
discussion techniques, and other instructional strategies, you can help your students practice applying these skills
in new contexts, providing an important foundation for their college and career readiness.

Skill 1: Visual Analysis
ANALYZE VISUAL ELEMENTS OF WORKS OF ART
Students begin their study by carefully observing a work of art in order to
accurately describe what they see. The identify and describe visual elements,
referencing actual, physical aspects of the work of art, such as form, style, and
technique. For example, consider the jade cong (7), an ancient Chinese artifact in
the shape of a tube with a square cross section and round hole. Students should
begin their exploration of the cong through visual analysis, with the teacher
leading students’ exploration of formal qualities such as size, shape, and material.

Skill 2: Contextual Analysis
ANALYZE CONTEXTUAL ELEMENTS OF A WORK OF ART, AND
CONNECT CONTEXTUAL AND VISUAL ELEMENTS OF A WORK OF ART
Because the works in the canon of AP Art History encompass pieces from all
around the world, contextualization is often an area in which students struggle.
While researching a work of art, such as the jade cong, students learn that little
is known about the cultural and historical milieu of cong. Therefore, contextual
analysis focuses on scientific and ethnographic research findings.

Skill 3: Comparison of Works of Art
COMPARE TWO OR MORE WORKS OF ART
Art historians often compare works of art in order to gain a deeper understanding
of those works. For example, comparative analysis can extend to other works
made from materials similar to those used in the cong— an Olmec-style mask
from Templo Mayor, for example—or to works related by chronology, location,
or visual appearance. This process deepens their understanding of one work as
they compare it to counterparts, and consider similarities and differences among
the works. This is the foundation of comparative analysis. Teachers model the
processes of finding, evaluating, and synthesizing information about the cong
from different sources, demonstrating how an evidence-based understanding of the work is constructed.

Establishing reasoned connections with other works of art adds to students’
knowledge of works of art, such as the cong, and helps situate it within the realm
of global artistic traditions. As students build their understanding of these artistic
traditions, styles, and practices, they can begin to identify and explain patterns of
continuity or change and how works of one tradition have influenced others.

Skill 8: Argumentation
DEVELOP AND SUPPORT ART HISTORICAL ARGUMENTS
Argumentation is a skill that is valuable across disciplines. Art historians use
argumentation to establish claims and supporting evidence for their interpretations.
The most complex skills in Art History are explaining how evidence justifies a claim and developing a complex argument.
There are many ways to create a complex argument. Students might explain the
nuances of an argument, or they could corroborate, qualify, or modify their claims,
perhaps through addressing alternative perspectives.
Claims can be supported by what students see in the work (such as the use of
colors, light, symbolism, etc.), ways that people experience the work (i.e., the feeling
of intimacy or spirituality inside a place of worship), or the context of the work (for
example, a mask that is part of a ritual or ceremony). It is not enough for students
to just identify evidence; they need to articulate how a piece of evidence supports
their claim. This often takes the form of a “because” statement. The why? Because ...
relationship helps students articulate defensible claims, think of specific and relevant
evidence, and explain how the evidence supports the claim.
Skill
Key Questions

Strategies 8.A. Articulate a defensible claim about one or more works of art (or group of related works of art).
§§ What do you know about the work(s) described in the prompt?
§§ What are your options regarding which claims to make?
§§ Based on the prompt and the evidence, what claim will you make?
§§ State in a few words, how you will prove your claim (“because” statement).
Based on a given prompt, such as Explain why the unknown work is an example of Romanticism, have students brainstorm evidence that could be used to support a claim, and then write sample claims. Then have them trade claims with a partner and have each determine whether the statement is a true claim (defensible and related to the prompt and work). If not, have the partners work together to revise the statements into defensible claims.

Editing 8.B. Using specific and relevant evidence, support a claim about one or more works of art (or group of related works of art).
§§ Brainstorm to think of relevant evidence that relates to the work(s) established in the prompt.
§§ Hone your initial list of evidence by describing specific examples that support the argument.
§§ Determine whether the evidence supports, refutes, or modifies each of the possible positions.
Based on a given prompt, such as Explain how the artist or architect (for a given set of works) used shapes or forms to create meaning, have small groups of students write claims and supporting evidence statement. Have groups trade claims and evidence and revise or modify the claims (if necessary), match the claims and evidence, and write statements explaining why the evidence supports the claim.

AP Art History as a Process of Inquiry
Evidence-based critical analysis in the AP Art History course is conducted through inquiry and research.
Students carefully observe a work of art, such as an
ikenga (a sculpture of a horned deity made by the Igbo
people of southeastern Nigeria), in order to accurately
describe what they see. Verbally and/or in writing,
they describe visual elements, referencing actual, physical aspects of the work of art and observed
design relationships to support their description. They
utilize resources to back up assertions about materials
and technique and to investigate function, content,
and context. In doing so, students continue to seek,
evaluate, and apply evidence to test and strengthen their analyses. Description is transformed into
explanation: “this is how it looks” becomes “this is why it looks that way.”
Student inquiry about a single work of art expands as
they consider additional works. They may comparatively analyze two ikenga, compare the ikenga with a contemporary wood sculpture by a Nigerian artist,
or relate it to broader notions of artistic production,
such as representations of power and identity from another culture.
From the vantage point of inquiry, students can analyze
and relate different interpretations of why and how a
work of art is created as well as why and how audiences respond. They continue to formulate questions
and then find, evaluate, and synthesize information
from diverse resources, working toward the goal of
addressing a question or developing a plausible claim.

Accurately uses specific visual evidence from both works to explain ONE similarity OR difference in how the imagery depicts the battle or conflict.
Examples of acceptable responses include the following:
Similarities:
•	 Both depict clearly dominant victors exercising overpowering physical force to subdue their enemies.
•	 In both works the victors are calm and controlled; they succeed without difficulty or uncertainty.
•	 In both the victors appear unconcerned with their own safety, having minimal weapons or protective gear.
•	 Both depict the heat of battle as emotionally intense and dramatic, employing agonized expressions,
crowded composition, contorted poses, and diagonal forms.
•	 Both works heighten the violence of war by bringing the chaotic action out into the space of the
viewer. The relief’s figures spill out onto the steps, while the mosaic’s foreground figures are radically foreshortened.
•	 In both the enemies are shown in poses of defeat and submission.
•	 Both works emphasize the suffering of the losers and evoke pathos from the viewer. The mother of
Athena’s foe appears to beg for mercy, while Alexander’s opposing general is grief-stricken at the death of his forward guard.
Differences:
•	 Pergamon’s combatants are mythological beings, while the mosaic portrays human soldiers in a historical battle.

General Scoring Notes
•	 Except where otherwise noted, each point of the rubric is earned independently. For instance, a student could earn
one or two points for evidence (Row C) or earn the point for analysis and reasoning (Row D) without earning a point for claim or thesis (Row B).
•	 Accuracy: The components of this rubric each require that students demonstrate art historically defensible content
knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, a response may contain errors that do not detract from its overall
quality, provided the art historical content used to advance the argument is accurate.
•	 Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not
be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of art historical content knowledge and skills described in the rubric.

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes
The evidence provided must be accurate, relevant, and art historically defensible.
Calling of Saint Matthew
Examples that earn a point include the following:
•
“The artist uses a diagonal beam of light, crossing
the painting from the upper right to the lower left.” • “The artist employs tenebrism, the use of bold contrasting lights and darks.” •
“The artist uses light to emphasize hands, gestures,
expressions and characters to assist in deciphering the narrative.” • “The artist uses light to reveal a dingy tavern.” • “The painting was created during the time of the
Catholic Counter-Reformation, a time of church reform and intense spiritual activities.” •
“Artists in the Baroque often used light to create dramatic, theatrical effects.” •
“In the biblical narrative, Matthew is a tax collector, an occupation held in great disdain during Jesus’ lifetime.”
Chartres Cathedral
Examples that earn a point include the
following:
• “Chartres has an extensive number of stained glass windows which enabled artists to allow colored light to permeate the structure’s vast interior.” • “The large and numerous windows were permitted by the use of flying buttresses, a
Gothic innovation.” • “The dominant color of the stained-glass windows is sapphire blue, a color associated with the Virgin Mary.” • “Large windows with multicolored stained glass depict biblical subjects and narratives. One of these windows is Notre Dame de la Belle
Verriere.” • “Varied segments of society, ranging from royal heads of state to guild members, were charged with patronizing the church by donating beautiful windows through which light passes and illuminates subjects invested with both sacred and secular interests.” • “The windows exemplify the concept of lux nova or new light, a concept that was central to the
Gothic use of stained glass within cathedrals.”
Ecstasy of Saint Teresa

following:
• “The chapel is dramatically lit by a window hidden behind a broken pediment above the main sculpture group.” • “The deeply cut folds of St. Teresa’s drapery in particular create dramatic light and shadow effects.” • “The figures of St. Teresa and the angel are positioned against bronze rays that shoot downward from above and represent, as well as reflect, natural light.” • “The painting was created during the time of the
Catholic Counter-Reformation, a time of church reform and intense spiritual activities.” • “Artists in the Baroque often used light to create dramatic, theatrical effects. Bernini’s background as a set designer made him particularly adept at creating such effects.”

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes
The response must explain the relationship between the evidence provided and an argument about the prompt.
Calling of Saint Matthew
Examples that earn the point include the
following:
•
“The diagonal beam of light indicates God’s spirit or presence where stark tenebrism amplifies the
association of light with divinity; where the divine
light does not fall, the unilluminated areas thus look even darker.” •
“The stark lighting emphasized the dingy setting and unidealized contemporary characters, indicating that salvation was open to all.” • “The ideals of the Catholic Counter-Reformation strove to make Christian narratives and doctrines more understandable and meaningful to a broad
Catholic audience. Works of art created at this time often used light to achieve this goal.” •
“Light illuminates Matthew’s dark, sinful life and promises a transformation and conversion. “
Chartres Cathedral
Examples that earn the point include the
following:
• “The predominant blue color signifies heaven and is symbolically linked with the Virgin Mary and her role as the Queen of Heaven. As Queen of Heaven, Mary acts as a primary mediator between humans and her son.” • “The intended effect of the light passing through the windows was to move the pious believer through dramatic sights so that they feel drawn closer to God’s heavenly kingdom.” • “The concept of lux nova originated with Abbot
Suger of St. Denis. Suger understood this as a
way to illuminate the soul and to mystically unite the soul with God.”
Ecstasy of Saint Teresa
Examples that earn the point include the
following:
• “Since the window from which the light emanates is hidden, the illuminated effect is one of a mystical, heavenly or divine nature.
The work suggests the presence of the divine through the brilliant light in the chapel.” • “In the context of the Catholic Counter
Reformation, Bernini’s use of light was intended to encourage active participation and intense faith and devotion from viewers.” • “The dramatically lit scene of Teresa and the angel, similar to a stage set, was intended to elicit a multisensory emotional response in viewers.” • “The work is based on writings by Saint Teresa, a nun who attempted to bring more meaning into spiritual ritual through intense meditation that lead to a mystical experience, partly symbolized by light effects in Bernini’s work.” • “The dramatic light and shadow effects created by the deeply cut folds of St. Teresa’s drapery heighten the work’s visionary qualities.”

The response may demonstrate a complex understanding in a variety of ways, such as:
•
Explaining relevant and insightful connections between the evidence and the claim •
Confirming the validity of a claim by corroborating multiple perspectives •
Explaining nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables •
Qualifying or modifying a claim by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence
The complex understanding must be developed in the response and consist of more than a phrase or reference.
Calling of Saint Matthew
Examples that earn this point might include the
following, if appropriate elaboration is provided:
• “The ‘Calling of Saint Matthew’ exemplifies
Caravaggio’s treatment of religious subject matter
in his mature work, which is characterized by realism
combined with a theatrical/artificial use of light.” • “Caravaggio depicts Matthew and the characters that surround him as ordinary people who would have seemed familiar to the sixteenth/seventeenth
century audience; the stark use of light only serves to highlight their ordinary looks.” • “Caravaggio’s choice to place a biblical event in a contemporary sixteenth/seventeenth-century
setting filled by ordinary, and somewhat questionable looking, characters, can be interpreted as making the story more accessible to the contemporary audience.” • “The effect of Caravaggio’s strategic lighting in creating a sense of mystery and spiritual drama
is heightened by its combination with an ordinary, contemporary setting.”
Chartres Cathedral
Examples that earn this point might include the following, if appropriate elaboration is
provided:
• “While the architects of Chartres Cathedral increased the size of the windows to maximize the amount of light entering the church’s interior, the use of stained-glass windows
actually created a relatively dimly lit interior.” • “French Gothic churches did not usually contain
brightly lit interiors during the Middle Ages, but
rather, the light was filtered through the stained glass. The jewel-toned light was intended to create a otherworldly experience that would mystically transport the believer and unite their soul with God.”
Ecstasy of Saint Teresa
Examples that earn this point might include the following, if appropriate elaboration is
provided:
• “The multisensory emotional response elicited
by the work was similar to the aims of Ignatius of Loyola’s Spiritual exercises.” • “The inclusion of portraits of members of Cardinal Cornaros’ family who are depicted watching the events from balconies on either side of the chapel, suggests their emotional involvement in this spiritual experience, and, by extension, invites the involvement of the audience, according to the goals of the Counter
Reformation of using art to increase piety and devotion.”

Accurately describes ONE visual characteristic of the work shown.
Examples of acceptable responses include:
•	 The colors are soft blues, greens, and browns.
•	 A large tree on the left dominates the painting’s composition.
•	 Roughly parallel lines of the ground (lower left corner), the tree branches, and the mountains create visual rhythm and unity.
•	 The bottom half of the painting depicts a lake, with reflections of the house and some trees.
•	 The colors are somewhat dark, so it might be early morning or evening.
•	 The greens suggest that it is summer.
•	 The highlights and shadows show that light is coming from the left of the scene depicted.
•	 Brushstrokes are visible.
•	 Brushstrokes within smaller areas often form roughly parallel lines.

Accurately uses specific evidence to explain ONE technique Cezanne uses to create a sense of space in this work.
Examples of acceptable responses include:
•	 The size of the tree makes it appear close to the viewer.
•	 The overlapping shapes of the tree trunk, the branches, and the ground on which it stands make them
appear to be in front of the lake and the opposite shore.
•	 The small scale of the houses creates the sense that they are relatively far away.
•	 The use of blue in between the branches refers to the sky.
•	 The use of consistent colors throughout the painting makes the visual space shallow; the farthest
mountaintops look as close as the shore of the lake, for example.

5.B 5
Accurately explains how this work departs from earlier Western traditions of landscape painting.
Examples of acceptable responses include:
•	 There is no use of aerial or linear perspective.
•	 The top of the painting does not look like it is in the far distance.
•	 Colors are not blended into each other to model the forms of the mountains.
•	 The landscape on the far side of the lake is depicted through fractured areas of color with straight lines
and angles; this makes the representation somewhat abstract.
•	 The parallel lines and similar colors of the tree branches and the mountain slopes contribute to
the abstraction and help to make the painting as much about design on the surface as about literal depiction of landscape.
•	 The colors are somewhat arbitrary in that they are not affected as much by their distance from the
viewer as they would be in earlier Western traditions.

Appendixes  V.1 | 375
Analyzing works of art often entails concurrent investigation of interrelated aspects of form, function, content, and context.
To analyze form:
Investigate component materials and how they create physical and visual elements in a work of art.
Use knowledge of design elements and principles to examine fundamental visual components and their relationship to the work in its entirety.
To analyze function:
Consider artist’s intended use(s) for the work and actual use(s), which may change according to context.
Keep in mind ...
§§ Functions may be for utility, intercession, decoration, communication, and/ or commemoration; they
may be spiritual, social, political, and/or personally expressive.
To analyze content:
Explore the interacting, communicative elements of design, representation, and presentation.
Keep in mind ...
§§ Content includes subject matter — visible imagery may involve formal depictions, representative depictions, and/or symbolic depictions.
§§ Content may be narrative, symbolic, spiritual, historical, mythological, supernatural, and/or propagandistic.
To analyze context:
Examine original and subsequent historical and cultural milieu of a work of art.
Keep in mind ...
Context includes information about:
§§ the time, place, and culture in which a work of art was created, and when, where, and how subsequent audiences interacted with the work
§§ the artist’s intended purpose for a work of art, the chosen site for the work, and subsequent locations
§§ modes of display including associated paraphernalia and multisensory stimuli
§§ characteristics of the artist and audiences (e.g., aesthetic, intellectual, religious, political, social, and economic)
§§ patronage, ownership of a work of art, and other power relationships §§ audience response to a work of art
Contextual information may be provided through records, reports, religious chronicles, personal
reflections, manifestos, academic publications, mass media, sociological data, cultural studies,
geographic data, artifacts, narrative and/or performance, documentation, archaeology, and research.
