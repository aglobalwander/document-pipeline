Introduction
Purpose of this document 1
Economics guide

=== Page 8 ===
The Diploma Programme is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19
age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and
inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to
develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The Diploma Programme model
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core (see figure 1). It encourages the
concurrent study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study two modern languages (or a modern
language and a classical language), a humanities or social science subject, an experimental science,
mathematics and one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma
Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance.
In each of the academic areas students have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can
choose subjects that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.

Introduction
The Diploma Programme 2
Economics guide

=== Page 9 ===
Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they can,
instead of an arts subject, choose two subjects from another area. Normally, three subjects (and not
more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB
recommends 240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than at SL.
At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of the
course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some element of coursework assessed by teachers.
The core of the Diploma Programme model
All Diploma Programme students participate in the three course elements that make up the core of the model.
Theory of knowledge (TOK) is a course that is fundamentally about critical thinking and inquiry into the
process of knowing rather than about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines the
nature of knowledge and how we know what we claim to know. It does this by encouraging students to
analyse knowledge claims and explore questions about the construction of knowledge. The task of TOK is
to emphasize connections between areas of shared knowledge and link them to personal knowledge in
such a way that an individual becomes more aware of his or her own perspectives and how they might differ from others.
Creativity, activity, service (CAS) is at the heart of the Diploma Programme. The emphasis in CAS is on
helping students to develop their own identities, in accordance with the ethical principles embodied in the
IB mission statement and the IB learner profile. It involves students in a range of activities alongside their
academic studies throughout the Diploma Programme. The three strands of CAS are creativity (arts, and
other experiences that involve creative thinking), activity (physical exertion contributing to a healthy
lifestyle) and service (an unpaid and voluntary exchange that has a learning benefit for the student).
Possibly, more than any other component in the Diploma Programme, CAS contributes to the IB’s mission
to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect.
The extended essay, including the world studies extended essay, offers the opportunity for IB students to
investigate a topic of special interest, in the form of a 4,000-word piece of independent research. The area
of research undertaken is chosen from one of the students’ six Diploma Programme subjects, or in the case
of the interdisciplinary world studies essay, two subjects, and acquaints them with the independent
research and writing skills expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally presented,
structured writing, in which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent manner,
appropriate to the subject or subjects chosen. It is intended to promote high-level research and writing
skills, intellectual discovery and creativity. An authentic learning experience, it provides students with an
opportunity to engage in personal research on a topic of choice, under the guidance of a supervisor.
Approaches to teaching and approaches to learning
Approaches to teaching and learning across the Diploma Programme refers to deliberate strategies, skills
and attitudes which permeate the teaching and learning environment. These approaches and tools,
intrinsically linked with the learner profile attributes, enhance student learning and assist student
preparation for the Diploma Programme assessment and beyond. The aims of approaches to teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme are to:
•
empower teachers as teachers of learners as well as teachers of content •
empower teachers to create clearer strategies for facilitating learning experiences in which students
are more meaningfully engaged in structured inquiry and greater critical and creative thinking
The Diploma Programme 3
Economics guide

=== Page 10 ===
•
promote both the aims of individual subjects (making them more than course aspirations) and linking
previously isolated knowledge (concurrency of learning) •
encourage students to develop an explicit variety of skills that will equip them to continue to be
actively engaged in learning after they leave school, and to help them not only obtain university
admission through better grades but also prepare for success during tertiary education and beyond •
enhance further the coherence and relevance of the students’ Diploma Programme experience •
allow schools to identify the distinctive nature of an IB Diploma Programme education, with its blend of idealism and practicality.
The five approaches to learning (developing thinking skills, social skills, communication skills, self management skills and research skills) along with the six approaches to teaching (teaching that is inquiry based, conceptually focused, contextualized, collaborative, differentiated and informed by assessment)
encompass the key values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy.
The IB mission statement and the IB learner profile
The Diploma Programme aims to develop in students the knowledge, skills and attitudes they will need to
fulfil the aims of the IB, as expressed in the organization’s mission statement and the learner profile.
Teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme represent the reality in daily practice of the organization’s educational philosophy.
Academic honesty
Academic honesty in the Diploma Programme is a set of values and behaviours informed by the attributes
of the learner profile. In teaching, learning and assessment, academic honesty serves to promote personal
integrity, engender respect for the integrity of others and their work, and ensure that all students have an
equal opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquire during their studies.
All coursework—including work submitted for assessment—is to be authentic, based on the student’s
individual and original ideas with the ideas and work of others fully acknowledged. Assessment tasks that
require teachers to provide guidance to students or that require students to work collaboratively must be
completed in full compliance with the detailed guidelines provided by the IB for the relevant subjects.
For further information on academic honesty in the IB and the Diploma Programme, please consult the IB
publications Academic honesty in the IB educational context, Effective citing and referencing, Diploma
Programme: From principles into practice and General regulations: Diploma Programme. Specific information
regarding academic honesty as it pertains to external and internal assessment components of this Diploma
Programme subject can be found in this guide.
Acknowledging the ideas or work of another person
Coordinators and teachers are reminded that candidates must acknowledge all sources used in work
submitted for assessment. The following is intended as a clarification of this requirement.
Diploma Programme candidates submit work for assessment in a variety of media that may include audio visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print or electronic sources. If a candidate uses
the work or ideas of another person, the candidate must acknowledge the source using a standard style of
referencing in a consistent manner. A candidate’s failure to acknowledge a source will be investigated by
the IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.
The IB does not prescribe which style(s) of referencing or in-text citation should be used by candidates; this
is left to the discretion of appropriate faculty/staff in the candidate’s school. The wide range of subjects,
three response languages and the diversity of referencing styles make it impractical and restrictive to insist
on particular styles. In practice, certain styles may prove most commonly used, but schools are free to The Diploma Programme 4
Economics guide

=== Page 11 ===
choose a style that is appropriate for the subject concerned and the language in which candidates’ work is
written. Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a given subject, it is expected that the
minimum information given includes: name of author, date of publication, title of source, and page numbers and URL as applicable.
Candidates are expected to use a standard style and use it consistently so that credit is given to all sources
used, including sources that have been paraphrased or summarized. When writing text candidates must
clearly distinguish between their words and those of others by the use of quotation marks (or other
method, such as indentation) followed by an appropriate citation that denotes an entry in the bibliography.
If an electronic source is cited, the date of access must be indicated. Candidates are not expected to show
faultless expertise in referencing but are expected to demonstrate that all sources have been
acknowledged. Candidates must be advised that audio-visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data
published in print or in electronic sources that is not their own must also attribute the source. Again, an
appropriate style of referencing/citation must be used.
Learning diversity and learning support requirements
Schools must ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided to
candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Access and inclusion
policy and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes.
The documents Meeting student learning diversity in the classroom and The IB guide to inclusive education: a
resource for whole school development are available to support schools in the ongoing process of increasing
access and engagement by removing barriers to learning.

Overview of the curriculum model
Economics is an exciting, dynamic subject that allows students to develop an understanding of the
complexities and interdependence of economic activities in a rapidly changing world.
At the heart of economic theory is the problem of scarcity. While the world’s population has unlimited
needs and wants, there are limited resources to satisfy these needs and wants. As a result of this scarcity,
choices have to be made. The economics course, at both SL and HL, uses economic theories to examine the ways in which these choices are made:
•
at the level of producers and consumers in individual markets (microeconomics) •
at the level of the government and the national economy (macroeconomics) •
at an international level where countries are becoming increasingly interdependent through
international trade and the movement of labour and capital (the global economy).
The choices made by economic agents (consumers, producers and governments) generate positive and
negative outcomes and these outcomes affect the relative well-being of individuals and societies. As a
social science, economics examines these choices through the use of models and theories. The Diploma
Programme (DP) economics course allows students to explore these models and theories, and apply them,
Introduction
Nature of the subject 6
Economics guide

=== Page 13 ===
using empirical data, through the examination of the following six real-world issues which are posed as
economic questions:
•
How do consumers and producers make choices in trying to meet their economic objectives?
•
When are markets unable to satisfy important economic objectives—and does government intervention help?
•
Why does economic activity vary over time and why does this matter?
•
How do governments manage their economy and how effective are their policies?
•
Who are the winners and losers of the integration of the world’s economies?
•
Why is economic development uneven?
Economic theory suggests that the material well-being of societies is related to the quantity of goods and
services that are available to that society. As a result, economic growth and increased efficiency have
become prominent goals. However, there are two important global economic issues related to these goals
and the choices made by economic agents. These are the ways in which economic activity impacts the
environment, and the challenges facing the world in terms of fair access to resources, goods and services.
When exploring these significant global issues, sustainability and equity become key concepts for DP economics students to understand.
In all areas of economic activity, the economic agents can be divided up into the private sector (consumers
and producers) and the public sector (governments). To different extents and with different outcomes, the
public sector in any economy assumes some responsibility for monitoring and regulating the behaviour of
the private sector. This government intervention is a significant concept that appears throughout the
course and students are expected to critically evaluate the balance between the market forces of the private sector and intervention by governments.
Given the rapidly changing world, economic activity and its outcomes are constantly in flux. Therefore,
students are encouraged, throughout the course, to research current real-world issues. Through their own
inquiry, it is expected that students will be able to appreciate both the values and limitations of economic
models in explaining real-world economic behaviour and outcomes.
By focusing on the six real-world issues through the nine key concepts (scarcity, choice, efficiency, equity,
economic well-being, sustainability, change, interdependence and intervention), students of the economics
course will develop the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes that will encourage them to act responsibly as global citizens.
Distinction between SL and HL
The HL course in economics differs from the SL course in economics in terms of the:
•
recommended hours devoted to teaching (240 hours for HL compared to 150 hours for SL) •
extra depth and breadth required (extension material for HL only) •
nature of the examination questions. Both SL and HL students develop quantitative skills, but HL
students will need to further develop these as appropriate, in analysing and evaluating economic
relationships in order to provide informed policy advice. These skills are specifically assessed in HL paper 3.
Economics and the core
Economics and theory of knowledge
As with other disciplines within individuals and societies, there is a variety of ways to gain knowledge in
economics. For example, data and evidence collection, experimentation, observation, inductive and
deductive reasoning, can all be used to help explain patterns of behaviour and lead to knowledge claims.
Students in individual and societies subjects are required to evaluate claims by exploring questions
concerning their validity, reliability, credibility and certainty, as well as individual and cultural perspectives
on them. For example, at the core of economic theories are important assumptions such as the ceteris
Nature of the subject 7
Economics guide

=== Page 14 ===
paribus (all other things being equal) assumption. Students must be aware of these assumptions and be
able to critically assess how these might limit reliability in the application of economic theory.
Through inquiry, students in the economics course will be challenged to:
•
obtain evidence related to economic theories in different contexts •
explain how the evidence that they have collected is supported by economic theory •
understand the limitations of economic theory in explaining real-world behaviour.
The relationship between each subject and TOK is of crucial importance and fundamental to the DP. Having
followed a course of study in individuals and societies, students should be able to reflect critically on the
nature, scope and limitations of knowledge used in human sciences, and in doing so, become the
“inquiring, knowledgeable and caring young people” of the IB mission statement.
During the economics course, a number of questions will arise that highlight the relationships between
TOK and economics. Some of the knowledge questions that might be considered include the following:
•
Are there fundamental differences between economics and other disciplines or areas of knowledge? If
so, are these differences more than just methodological differences?
•
How have technological advances affected the nature and practices of economics?
•
Do emotion and intuition have a role in economics?
•
What factors affect the reliability and validity of economic models?
•
Does the inability of economics to perform controlled experiments mean that economics cannot be
scientific in its approach to understanding the world?
•
What are the implications of accepting that knowledge in economics changes over time?
Economics and the extended essay
An extended essay (EE) in economics provides students with an opportunity to undertake in-depth research
in an area related to the subject. Throughout the process, students will develop their research skills by
selecting and using relevant sources. Students should select and apply relevant economic theories to
develop an argument in response to a clearly defined research question based on an economics topic. The
essay topic may relate to an area of the DP economics course, but this is not a requirement and other areas of the wider subject may be explored.
Students should take a recent economic issue, policy or event, and then gather data and apply economic
theories, models and tools to evaluate it. The economic issue, policy or event must have taken place up to
five years prior to the beginning of the research process.
Appropriate resources for an EE in economics could include both primary and secondary data, obtained
from economics textbooks, general economics books, newspapers and magazines, government publications, databanks, interviews, or surveys.
An EE in economics is not an extension of the internal assessment task for the subject. Students must
ensure that they understand the clear distinction between the internal assessment and the EE.
Indication of the possible range of topics, research questions and approaches that can be considered can
be found in the Extended essay guide in the section “Economics: Subject-specific guidance”.
Economics and creativity, activity, service
The economics course highlights many economic issues that have local, national and global manifestations.
Students develop awareness of these issues, and by investigating their own examples of such issues as part
of the course, they deepen their understanding. Through CAS, students can further extend their awareness
and take valuable steps in working towards alleviating economic problems through their own actions and through motivating others to take action.
Economics students might choose to engage with CAS in the following ways.
•
Plan, participate and implement an activity to help raise awareness in the community about any
number of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including: poverty, reduced inequalities, decent
work and economic growth, innovation and infrastructure, responsible consumption and production.
Nature of the subject 8
Economics guide

=== Page 15 ===
•
Establish a group within the school to promote one of the official “global days”, for example:
▪
International Women’s Day to highlight and promote the importance of gender equity in employment (8 March) ▪
World No Tobacco Day to highlight and raise awareness of the social costs of smoking (31 May) ▪
Earth Day to highlight and promote the role of responsible consumption in achieving sustainability (22 April).
•
Establish a Fairtrade club to raise awareness of the importance of responsible consumption.
Economics and the IB learner profile
The economics course is closely aligned with the IB mission which “aims to develop inquiring,
knowledgeable and caring young people who help to create a better and more peaceful world through
intercultural understanding and respect.” (IB mission statement). This mission is further delineated through
the attributes of the IB learner profile, and the economics curriculum offers students opportunities to
demonstrate and develop these attributes through the implicit and explicit content of the course.
IB learners are:
Economics students will:
Inquirers
undertake independent and collaborative investigations into real-world economic
issues, such as: disparities in economic development; concentration of economic
power; inequity in the distribution of income; winners and losers in the global economy.
Knowledgeable
utilize economic concepts, theories and models with confidence to gain a more
sophisticated understanding of current economic issues, data and events.
Thinkers
synthesize and evaluate economic information and data to draw conclusions and develop balanced, well-supported arguments.
Communicators
compose clear and concise analytical commentaries utilizing the language and tools of economics.
Principled
act with integrity, critically evaluating economic data and evidence understanding that
the possession of knowledge carries with it an ethical responsibility.
Open-minded
understand that different economic schools of thought identify different causes and
therefore offer different solutions to economic problems which establishes economics as a highly contentious and dynamic discipline.
Caring
appreciate that economics is a social science that has a human impact, influencing the well-being of individuals and societies.
Risk-takers
utilize economic knowledge and understanding to develop and present creative policy recommendations for real-world economic issues.
Balanced
consider multiple perspectives when developing a position on an economic issue and
support any judgments made with effective and balanced reasoning.
Reflective
compare the role of positive versus normative economics in the development of
economic theory, considering the ability of economists to achieve objectivity within the context of the value-laden social sciences.
Economics and international-mindedness
The economics course promotes international-mindedness through a curriculum that allows for the
exploration of economics within a decidedly global context. Throughout the course, teachers have the
freedom to choose a range of both local and global examples, case studies and inquiries that are most
Nature of the subject 9
Economics guide

=== Page 16 ===
relevant to their student populations in order to animate the main content. This flexibility ensures that the
course remains relevant and responsive to the rapidly changing global environment.
While economics has its foundations in theory, the course places emphasis on the application of economic
theory to real-world issues. By examining economic issues and policy interventions at local, national and
global levels, students are empowered to use their knowledge and understanding of economics to seek
solutions to issues that matter to them. Economics provides students with the analytical tools necessary to
develop a deep understanding of major global challenges dealing with issues of equity, sustainability, the
concentration of economic power and increasing interdependence.
The internationally minded economics student engages actively with the content and has a highly
developed agency when exploring the economic issues facing individuals and societies. In this context,
agency refers to the ability of individuals to act independently and make their own economic choices. This
includes having control over their actions and consequences.
Nature of the subject 10
Economics guide

=== Page 17 ===
The economics course is underpinned by a number of pedagogical principles. In particular, the teaching of
economics is conceptually focused and grounded in real-world issues. The relationship between concepts,
content and contexts can be illustrated in the following graphic.
Figure 3
The relationship between inquiries, concepts, content and contexts in economics
As figure 3 indicates, the three components of inquiries are of equal relevance and teachers may choose
any one as a starting point for their teaching. Concepts are anchored in the content of economics—its
theories, models, ideas and tools—and are given context through the study of real-world issues and
examples. Together these components help students to acquire a holistic and integrated understanding of economics as a discipline.
The economics course is focused on inquiry-based teaching and learning, in which students are given the
opportunity to explore economic theories or global issues using real-world examples. The teaching of the
economics content should, therefore, be supported by focusing on real-world issues and applying real world examples. In some of the assessments, using real-world examples will be the basis of the response
and an argument must be formed around them. This argument should then demonstrate the student’s
understanding of economics through the lens of a real example rather than the response being purely
theoretical. In doing this the students will be able to go beyond merely “stating” an example in a theoretical
response. Students need to unpack their examples to clearly demonstrate/analyse/justify/evaluate why
they are relevant examples for particular economic issues.
While inquiry permeates the whole course, the assessment objective 3 (AO3) topics that require more
depth are considered areas that lend themselves particularly well to this approach. However, it is important
Introduction
Approaches to teaching and learning in economics 11
Economics guide

=== Page 18 ===
that teachers know that inquiry as a teaching and learning strategy is not only applicable for AO3 topics.
Teachers need to see the value of this approach in terms of allowing students to develop and demonstrate
higher-order thinking skills. It is important to highlight that inquiry needs to be taking place to ensure
students are actively involved in researching economic issues. These inquiries may take the form of
suggested statements that are provided in the microeconomics, macroeconomics and the global economy
units in the guide and further explored through examples in the Economics teacher support material (TSM).
This inquiry approach will aid students in developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills, an
appreciation of different viewpoints, collaboration and reflective discussion.
Economic skills are important to the study of DP economics and reflect the subject’s distinctive approach.
Teaching and learning these skills enriches the students’ understanding of economics and enables them to
apply these to various economic theories, models, ideas and tools. It is essential that the skills should be
covered throughout the course and that they are introduced and integrated where appropriate in relation
to the concepts, content and context at both SL and HL. Students are expected to demonstrate
competence in the use of economic skills in the external assessment and internal assessment. These skills
are covered generally in the “Approaches to teaching and learning” section in the TSM while the more
subject-specific skills are addressed in assessment objectives.
The nine key concepts that underpin the economics course (scarcity, choice, efficiency, equity, economic
well-being, sustainability, change, interdependence and intervention) are integrated into the conceptual
understandings of all the units to ensure that a conceptual thread is woven throughout the course.
Conceptually focused teaching helps learners to:
•
organize new information by categorizing groups of theories, ideas, tools, or facts according to patterns of similarity or difference •
deepen their understanding of today’s complex and dynamic economic environment •
approach concepts and content in different ways through multiple perspectives •
make connections with other subjects to enhance interdisciplinary learning.
Conceptual understanding therefore enhances the student’s overall understanding of the course, making
the subject more meaningful. This understanding assists students in showing clear evidence of synthesis
and evaluation in their responses to questions asked in the external assessment (even though the questions
may not be explicitly concept based). In the internal assessment, however, students must use the concepts
as a lens through which to analyse their commentaries.
The definition, relative importance and relationship of each of the nine key concepts to the subject of
economics may be the subject of debate. Teachers should explore how in different contexts these concepts
may be understood and applied differently. The table in Figure 4 provides brief understandings of how the
key concepts may be initially understood in relation to the course.
Figure 4
The relationships between the key concepts and the course
Key concept
Understanding in relation to the course
Scarcity
The central concept in economics, scarcity refers to the limited availability of
economic resources relative to society’s unlimited demand for goods and
services. Thus, economics is the study of how to make the best possible use of
scarce or limited resources to satisfy unlimited human needs and wants.
Choice
Since resources are scarce, economics is a study of choices. It is clear that not all
needs and wants can be satisfied; this necessitates choice and gives rise to the
idea of opportunity cost. Economic decision-makers continually make choices
between competing alternatives, and economics studies the consequences of these choices, both present and future.
Efficiency
Efficiency is a quantifiable concept, determined by the ratio of useful output to
total input. Allocative efficiency refers to making the best possible use of scarce

Key concept
Understanding in relation to the course
resources to produce the combinations of goods and services that are
optimum for society, thus minimizing resource waste.
Equity
In contrast to equality, which describes situations where economic outcomes
are similar for different people or different social groups, equity refers to the
concept or idea of fairness. Fairness is a normative concept, as it means
different things to different people. In economics, inequity is often interpreted
to refer to inequality, which may apply to the distribution of income, wealth or
human opportunity. Irrespective of economic system, inequity or inequality
remain significant issues both within and between societies. The degree to
which markets versus governments should, or are able to, create greater equity
or equality in an economy is an area of much debate.
Economic well-being
Economic well-being is a multidimensional concept relating to the level of
prosperity and quality of living standards enjoyed by members of an economy.
It includes:
• present and future financial security • the ability to meet basic needs •
the ability to make economic choices permitting achievement of personal satisfaction •
the ability to maintain adequate income levels over the long term.
There are broad disparities in economic well-being both within and across nations.
Sustainability
Sustainability in economics refers to the ability of the present generation to
meet its needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet
their own needs. It refers to limiting the degree to which the current
generation’s economic activities create harmful environmental outcomes
involving resource depletion or degradation that will negatively affect future
generations. Sustainability is proving increasingly important in all economic
analysis as planetary boundaries are pushed to the limit.
Change
An understanding of the concept of change is essential in economics. The
economic world is in a continual state of flux and economists must be aware of
this and adapt their thinking accordingly. The concept of change is important
both in economic theory and the empirical world that economics studies. In
economic theory, economics focuses not on the level of the variables it
investigates, but on their change from one situation to another. Empirically,
the world that is studied by economists is always subject to continuous and
profound change at institutional, structural, technological, economic and social levels.
Interdependence
Individuals, communities and nations are not self-sufficient. Consumers,
companies, households, workers, and governments, all economic actors,
interact with each other within and, increasingly, across nations in order to
achieve economic goals. The greater the level of interaction, the greater will be
the degree of interdependence. In a highly interdependent economic world,
decisions by certain economic actors are likely to generate many, and often
unintended, economic consequences for other actors. A consideration of
possible economic consequences of interdependence is essential when conducting economic analysis.
Intervention
Intervention in economics usually refers to government involvement in the
workings of markets. While markets are considered the most efficient
mechanism to organize economic activity, it is recognized that they may fail to Approaches to teaching and learning in economics 13

Key concept
Understanding in relation to the course
achieve certain societal goals, such as equity, economic well-being, or
sustainability. Failure to achieve such goals may be considered sufficient
reason for government intervention. In the real world, there is often
disagreement among economists and policymakers on the need for, and
extent of, government intervention. There is a considerable debate about the merits of intervention versus the free market.
The Economics teacher support material (TSM) provides further guidance on the approaches to teaching and learning in the course.
Engaging with sensitive topics
The study of economics provides students with an opportunity to engage with exciting, stimulating and
personally relevant topics and issues. However, it should be noted that often such topics and issues can also
be sensitive and personally challenging. Teachers should be aware of this and provide guidance to students
on how to approach and engage with such topics and issues in a responsible and inclusive manner,
providing due consideration to questions and issues that may arise.
Prior learning
The economics course requires no specific prior learning of economics. No particular background in terms
of specific subjects studied for national or international qualifications is expected or required. The specific
skills of the economics course are developed within the context of the course itself. However, the ability to
understand and explain abstract concepts, and write in a logically structured manner are distinct
advantages in economics as is completing the individuals and societies course in the Middle Years
Programme (MYP).
Links to the Middle Years Programme
The MYP individuals and societies subject group involves inquiry into historical, contemporary,
geographical, political, social, economic, religious, technological and cultural contexts that influence and
impact on the lives and environments of people and communities. This subject group therefore provides a
very useful foundation for students who go on to study economics in the DP.
The concept-based approach to teaching adopted in the MYP is also relevant to this economics course, with
several of the same concepts explored in a more comprehensive, in-depth and critical manner than
expected in the MYP. These concepts are woven through the entire economics syllabus and are meant to
provide a common framework for exploring micro, macro and global economics.
Inquiry-based learning is central to individuals and societies courses in both the MYP and the DP providing
students with opportunities to independently and collaboratively investigate and analyse global issues. As
inquiry develops curiosity and promotes critical and creative thinking, it is important to emphasize that
pedagogically, the Diploma Programme economics learning environment should emulate, as far as
possible, the MYP experience—students should explore economics in action through the investigation of
relevant issues, utilizing real-world data and examples.
MYP students in individuals and societies are required to hone their critical thinking and communication
skills, two of the MYP’s four assessment objectives. This establishes an important foundation for the internal
assessment component in Diploma Programme economics. As part of their internal assessment, students
are expected to write clear and concise analytical commentaries on current news articles utilizing the language and tools of economics.
Thus, the study of economics naturally extends the skills developed in MYP individuals and societies
courses. Furthermore, students’ organization, collaboration, and communication strategies that began in
MYP will become more sophisticated as they move through the Diploma Programme economics course.

Links to the Career-related Programme
In the IB Career-related Programme (CP), students study at least two DP subjects, a core consisting of four
components and a career-related study, which is determined by the local context and aligned with student
needs. Courses can be chosen from any group of the DP, and it is possible to study more than one course
from the same group (for example, visual arts and film).
Economics develops the student’s logical reasoning skills which are highly desired across a range of career related pursuits. Economics may be an ideal choice for CP students considering careers in management,
finance, law, research, government and non-governmental organizations, international relations/ development, and so on.
The DP economics course emphasizes the development of: strong written, verbal, and diagrammatic
communication skills; critical and complex thinking; and ethical considerations that will assist students in
preparing for the future global workplace. This in turn fosters the IB learner profile attributes that are
transferable to the entire CP, providing relevance and support for the student’s learning.
For CP students, DP courses can be studied at SL or HL. Schools can explore opportunities to integrate CP students with DP students.

Individuals and societies aims
The aims of all subjects in individuals and societies are to:
•
encourage the systematic and critical study of: human experience and behaviour; physical, economic
and social environments; the history and development of social and cultural institutions •
develop in the student the capacity to identify, analyse critically and evaluate theories, concepts and
arguments about the nature and activities of the individual and society •
enable the student to collect, describe and analyse data used in studies of society, and to test
hypotheses and interpret complex data and source material •
promote the appreciation of the way in which learning is relevant to both the culture in which the student lives and the culture of other societies •
develop an awareness in the student that human attitudes and opinions are widely diverse and that a
study of society requires an appreciation of such diversity •
enable the student to recognize that the content and methodologies of the individuals and societies
group are contestable and that their study requires the tolerance of uncertainty.
Economics aims
The aims of the economics course at SL and HL are to enable students to:
•
develop a critical understanding of a range of economic theories, models, ideas and tools in the areas
of microeconomics, macroeconomics and the global economy •
apply economic theories, models, ideas and tools and analyse economic data to understand and
engage with real-world economic issues and problems facing individuals and societies •
develop a conceptual understanding of individuals’ and societies’ economic choices, interactions,
challenges and consequences of economic decision-making.

Conceptual understandings •
Economics is a social science characterized by interdependence, which focuses on how people
interact with each other to improve their economic well-being, influenced and enabled by their values and their natural surroundings.
•
The economic world is dynamic in nature and constantly subject to change.
•
Economic theories are based on logic and empirical data, using models to represent and analyse this
complex reality. Individual and collective motivations and behaviours are complex and diverse, and
their understanding entails the interaction of a variety of disciplines such as philosophy, politics, history, and psychology.
•
Economic decision-making impacts the relative economic well-being of individuals and societies.
•
The central problems of economics are scarcity and choice. This forces societies to face trade-offs,
opportunity costs and the challenge of sustainability.
•
Debates exist in economics regarding the potential conflicts between economic growth and equity
and between free markets and government intervention.
•
Endless economic growth, based on the consumption of finite resources, cannot continue
indefinitely. New economic models and social movements have challenged mainstream opinion
about the purpose of growth and how the economy could be redesigned to support long-term prosperity.
Key concepts: scarcity, choice, efficiency, equity, economic well-being, sustainability, change, interdependence, intervention.

21st century: increasing dialogue with other
disciplines such as psychology and the growing role of behavioural economics; increasing awareness of the interdependencies that exist between the economy, society and environment and the need to appreciate the compelling reasons for moving toward a circular economy
Theory of knowledge questions •
How realistic are economic models? How can we know what to include or exclude in a model?
•
What assumptions do economists make when they apply economic theories to the real world?
•
Many economists argue that economics as a social science is in its infancy, and that with time, as
empirical testing methods and the quality of data improve, it will become more reliable in making
accurate predictions. Do you agree with this statement?
•
To what extent does the distinction between positive and normative statements exist in other academic disciplines?
•
To what extent have individuals shifted the paradigms of economics?

Real-world issue 1
How do consumers and producers make choices in trying to meet their economic objectives?
Conceptual understandings •
Interaction between consumers and producers in a market is the main mechanism through which
resources are directed to meet the needs and wants in an economy.
•
Consumer and producer choices are the outcome of complex decision-making.
•
Welfare is maximized if allocative efficiency is achieved.

General
Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most important aims of assessment in the
Diploma Programme are that it should support curricular goals and encourage appropriate student
learning. Both external and internal assessments are used in the Diploma Programme. IB examiners mark
work produced for external assessment, while work produced for internal assessment is marked by teachers and externally moderated by the IB.
There are two types of assessment identified by the IB.
•
Formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is concerned with providing accurate and
helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of learning taking place and the nature of
students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop students’ understanding and capabilities.
Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide information to
monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives.
•
Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring
student achievement at, or towards the end of the course of study.
A comprehensive assessment plan is viewed as being integral with teaching, learning and course
organization. For further information, see the IB Programme standards and practices document.
The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not norm-referenced. This approach to
assessment judges students’ work by their performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, and
not in relation to the work of other students. For further information on assessment within the Diploma
Programme please refer to the publication Assessment: principles and practice—Quality assessments in a digital age.
To support teachers in the planning, delivery and assessment of the Diploma Programme courses, a variety
of resources can be found on the programme resource centre or purchased from the IB store (store.ibo.org).
Additional publications such as specimen papers and markschemes, TSMs, subject reports and grade
descriptors can also be found on the programme resource centre. Past examination papers as well as markschemes can be purchased from the IB store.
Methods of assessment
The IB uses several methods to assess work produced by students.
Assessment criteria
Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended. Each criterion concentrates on a
particular skill that students are expected to demonstrate. An assessment objective describes what
students should be able to do, and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do it. Using
assessment criteria allows discrimination between different answers and encourages a variety of responses.
Each criterion comprises a set of hierarchically ordered level descriptors. Each level descriptor is worth one
or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The maximum marks for each
criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are added
together to give the total mark for the piece of work.
Markbands
Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance against which responses are judged.
They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds to Assessment
Assessment in the Diploma Programme 55
Economics guide

=== Page 62 ===
a range of marks to differentiate student performance. A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which
particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.
Analytic markschemes
Analytic markschemes are prepared for those examination questions that expect a particular kind of
response and/or a given final answer from students. They give detailed instructions to examiners on how to
break down the total mark for each question for different parts of the response.
Marking notes
For some assessment components marked using assessment criteria, marking notes are provided. Marking
notes give guidance on how to apply assessment criteria to the particular requirements of a question.
Inclusive access arrangements
Inclusive access arrangements are available for candidates with access requirements. Standard assessment
conditions may put candidates with assessment access requirements at a disadvantage by preventing them
from demonstrating their attainment level. Inclusive access arrangements enable candidates to
demonstrate their ability under assessment conditions that are as fair as possible.
The IB document Access and inclusion policy (updated 2018) provides details on all the inclusive access
arrangements available to candidates. The IB document Learning diversity in IB programmes: Removing
barriers to learning (updated 2019) outlines the position of the IB with regard to candidates with diverse
learning needs in the IB programmes. For candidates affected by adverse circumstances, the IB documents
General regulations: Diploma Programme (September 2016) and the Diploma Programme Assessment
procedures (updated annually) provide details on access consideration.
Responsibilities of the school
The school is required to ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided
to candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Access and
inclusion policy and Learning diversity and inclusion in the IB programmes.

Two different methods are used to assess students.
•
Analytic markschemes •
Markbands
For all three examination papers, there are analytic markschemes and markbands. The markbands are
related to the assessment objectives established for the economics course and the individuals and societies
grade descriptors and are published in the guide. The analytic markschemes are specific to each
examination and are published separately in a markscheme document.
Written papers
The external assessment in economics consists of two examination papers at SL and three examination
papers at HL that are externally set and externally moderated. They are designed to allow students to
demonstrate their competencies in relation to the economics assessment objectives and specific parts of
the economics syllabus, namely the common topics and the HL extension material. All questions on the
examination papers will be based on the topics in this guide.
The external components contribute 70% to the final assessment at SL, and 80% to the final assessment at
HL.
In common with all examination papers, students at SL and HL are given five minutes of reading time before they begin answering the papers.
Command terms
Teachers and students must be familiar with the command terms used at each assessment objective level
to understand the depth of treatment required in examination questions. Cognitive demands terms
progress from AO1 to AO3, while AO4 terms are specific to particular skills.
Examination questions may use any command term from the assessment objective level specified in the
“Syllabus” section or a less demanding command term from a lower level. For example, if the assessment
objective level for a topic is AO2, an examination question could contain any of the command terms for
AO2, such as “explain”, “distinguish” and so on. Alternatively, the examination question could contain a
command term from AO1, such as “describe”. However, a more demanding command term, such as
“evaluate”, from a higher level (AO3 in this case), cannot be used.
The command terms used in each question (or part thereof) indicate the depth required. The command
terms are organized by assessment objective level in the “Assessment objectives” section earlier in the
guide and defined in the “Glossary of command terms” in the appendix.
Use of diagrams
Students are expected, where appropriate, to include correctly labelled and clearly drawn diagrams.
Sometimes individual questions specify that the use of diagrams is essential because more detailed
information is required from the students in order to show specific knowledge and understanding.
Use of examples
Students are expected, where appropriate, to illustrate their answers with real-world examples in order to
reach the highest markbands. Examples should be used to highlight economic concepts, theories and
relationships in the real world. When examples are used, students should not just state the example (as this
is too limited) but should also offer some explanation of the example in relation to the question asked.

Use of economic terms
Students are expected to demonstrate the ability to appropriately define, use and apply the economics terms included in the “Syllabus” section.
Use of calculators
Paper 1 (SL/HL)
Calculators are not permitted.
Paper 2 (SL/HL) and Paper 3 (HL only)
While all questions requiring a calculator can be answered fully using a four function (plus, minus, multiply,
divide) calculator, graphic display calculators (GDCs) are allowed during the examination. The graphing
functions on these calculators may assist students and it is therefore recommended that all students are familiar with the use of GDCs.
Teachers and schools must adhere to the regulations regarding the use of electronic calculators in
examinations, and students must be made aware of these. This information can be found in “Annex 2:
Calculators guidance” of the Diploma Programme Assessment procedures.

Purpose of internal assessment
Internal assessment is an integral part of the course and is compulsory for both SL and HL students. It
enables students to demonstrate the application of their skills and knowledge, and to pursue their personal
interests, without the time limitations and other constraints that are associated with written examinations.
The internal assessment should, as far as possible, be woven into normal classroom teaching and not be a
separate activity conducted after a course has been taught.
The internal assessment requirements at SL and at HL are the same for the economics course. Both SL and
HL economics students produce a portfolio of three commentaries based on articles from published news media.
Guidance and authenticity
The portfolio submitted for internal assessment must be the student’s own work. However, it is not the
intention that students should decide on the appropriate articles and then be left to work on the internally
assessed component without any further support from the teacher. The teacher should play an important
role during both the planning stage and the period when the student is working on the internally assessed
work. It is the responsibility of the teacher to ensure that students are familiar with:
•
the requirements of the type of work to be internally assessed—the nature of the sources of the
articles, and the formal requirements of the portfolio—and the IB’s academic honesty policy •
the assessment criteria; students must understand that the work submitted for assessment must address these criteria effectively.
Teachers and students must discuss the internally assessed work. Students should be encouraged to initiate
discussions with the teacher to obtain advice and information, and students must not be penalized for
seeking guidance. As part of the learning process, teachers should read and give advice to students on one
draft of the work. The teacher should provide oral or written advice on how the work could be improved
but must not edit the draft. The next version handed to the teacher must be the final version for submission.
It is the responsibility of teachers to ensure that all students understand the basic meaning and significance
of concepts that relate to academic honesty, especially authenticity and intellectual property. Teachers
must ensure that all student work for assessment is prepared according to the requirements and must
explain clearly to students that the internally assessed work must be entirely their own. Where
collaboration between students is permitted, it must be clear to all students what the difference is between collaboration and collusion.
All work submitted to the IB for moderation or assessment must be authenticated by a teacher and must
not include any known instances of suspected or confirmed malpractice. Each student must confirm that
the work is his or her authentic work and constitutes the final version of that work. Once a student has
officially submitted the final version of the work it cannot be retracted. The requirement to confirm the
authenticity of work applies to the work of all students, not just the sample work that will be submitted to
the IB for the purpose of moderation. For further details refer to the IB publication Academic honesty in the IB
educational context, The Diploma Programme: From principles into practice and the relevant articles in General
regulations: Diploma Programme.
Authenticity may be checked by discussion with the student on the content of the work and scrutiny of one or more of the following:
• the student’s initial choice of articles
Assessment
Internal assessment 67
Economics guide

=== Page 74 ===
• the first draft of the written work • the references cited •
the style of writing compared with work known to be that of the student •
the analysis of the work by a web-based plagiarism detection service (for example, turnitin.com.)
The same piece of work cannot be submitted to meet the requirements of both the internal assessment and the EE.
Time allocation
Internal assessment is an integral part of the economics course, contributing 30% to the final assessment in
the SL course and 20% to the final assessment in the HL course. This weighting should be reflected in the
time that is allocated to teaching the knowledge, skills and understanding required to undertake the work,
as well as the total time allocated to carry out the work.
It is recommended that a total of approximately 20 hours should be allocated to the portfolio at both SL and HL. This should include:
•
time for the teacher to explain to students the requirements of the internal assessment •
class time for students to work on the internal assessment component •
time for consultation between the teacher and each student •
time to review and monitor progress and to check authenticity.
Requirements and recommendations
It is important for the integrity of the moderation process that the internal assessment by the teacher is
based on the same evidence as that available to the moderator. When there is more than one teacher
teaching students in this component, internal standardization must take place.
Using assessment criteria for internal assessment
For internal assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion
has level descriptors describing specific achievement levels, together with an appropriate range of marks.
The level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement although, for the lower levels, failure to achieve may be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL against the criteria using the level descriptors.
•
The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.
•
The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by
the student, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be made
when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark awarded
should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is not
necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.
•
When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors for each criterion until
they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a
piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the
one that more appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.
•
Where there are two or more marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper marks if
the student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent; the work may be close to
achieving marks in the level above. Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work
demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in the level below.
•
Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.
Internal assessment 68

=== Page 75 ===
•
Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary but should concentrate on identifying the
appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.
•
The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by a
student. Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of the work being assessed.
•
A student who attains a high achievement level in relation to one criterion will not necessarily attain
high achievement levels in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a student who attains a low
achievement level for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the other
criteria. Teachers should not assume that the overall assessment of the students will produce any particular distribution of marks.
•
It is recommended that the assessment criteria be made available to students.
Internal assessment details—SL and HL
Portfolio
Duration: 20 hours
Weighting: 30% (SL), 20% (HL)
Rationale
Internal assessment in economics enables students to demonstrate the application of their knowledge and
understanding of economic theory in relation to real-world situations.
Requirements
Both SL and HL economics students produce a portfolio of three commentaries based on articles from
published news media. Each article must be based on a different unit of the syllabus (excluding Unit 1:
Introduction to economics): Unit 2: Microeconomics, Unit 3: Macroeconomics and Unit 4: The global economy.
Articles
The articles may be from a newspaper, a journal or the internet, but must not be from television or radio
broadcasts. If a student includes a relatively lengthy article, which is discouraged, the student must
highlight the section(s) of the article upon which the commentary is based. Articles used must have been
published no earlier than one year before the writing of the commentary.
The article on which the commentary is based should, where possible, be in the same language as the
commentary. If an extract in another language is used, the student must provide an accurate translation of
the whole article. Students must also include the original article in their portfolio.
Individual work
Students must select their own articles to discuss. It may happen that more than one student bases his or
her commentary on the same article, but the article must not be given to the class by the teacher, and the
production of the commentary must be each student’s individual work. A commentary must not be prepared collaboratively.
Key concepts
Each of the three commentaries must use a different key concept as a lens through which to analyse the
published extracts. Students will risk losing 3 marks in criterion D if they use the same key concept in two
commentaries and up to 6 marks if the same key concept is used in three commentaries. Please refer to the
Economics teacher support material for further guidance.
Focus
Each commentary must:
Internal assessment 69
Economics guide

=== Page 76 ===
•
explain the links between the article, a key concept and economic theory taken from the unit of the syllabus on which the article is based •
demonstrate economic insights into the implications of the article (that is, it should provide evidence
of the student’s ability to discuss current events from the point of view of an economist).
On each commentary students must record:
• the title of the article •
the source of the article (including date of access to the site if from the internet) • the date the article was published • the date the commentary was written • the word count of the commentary •
the unit of the syllabus to which the article relates • the key concept being used
Each commentary in the portfolio is assessed individually against the internal assessment criteria. The
teacher will initially assess each student’s work. Please note that internal standardization must take place if
more than one teacher is assessing the work. A sample of the work will then be moderated by the IB.
Please refer to Diploma Programme Assessment procedures for details on how to present the work for moderation.
Word limit
Students must produce a portfolio of three commentaries. Each commentary must not exceed 800 words.
Note: Moderators will not read beyond 800 words for each commentary.
The following are not included in the word count.
•
Acknowledgments •
Contents page •
Diagrams •
Labels—of five words or fewer •
Headings on diagrams—of 10 words or fewer •
Tables of statistical data •
Equations, formulae and calculations •
Citations (which, if used, must be in the body of the commentary) •
References (which, if used, must be in the footnotes/endnotes)
Please note that footnotes/endnotes may be used for referencing purposes only. Definitions of economic
terms and quotations, if used, must be in the body of the work and are included in the word count. Please
note that a citation is a shorthand method of making a reference in the body of the commentary, which is
then linked to the full reference in the footnotes/endnotes.
Rubric requirements
If students do not adhere to the following requirements, they can lose marks under criterion F: Rubric requirements.
1. Articles
Each article must be based on a different unit of the syllabus (excluding Unit 1: Introduction to economics).
2. Sources
Students must use a different source for each commentary.
Internal assessment 70
Economics guide

=== Page 77 ===
3. Contemporary articles
Students need to look for articles relating to current events, and these must be published no earlier than one year before the writing of the commentary.
Internal assessment criteria—SL and HL
Overview
There are five internal assessment criteria for each commentary.
Criterion
Commentary section
Marks
Criterion A
Diagrams 3 marks
Criterion B
Terminology 2 marks
Criterion C
Application and analysis 3 marks
Criterion D
Key concept 3 marks
Criterion E
Evaluation 3 marks
Total 14 marks
There is one internal assessment criterion for the whole portfolio.
Criterion F
Rubric requirements 3 marks
Each commentary is assessed individually for the first five assessment criteria (criteria A–E) and then criterion F is applied to the whole portfolio.
The maximum for the portfolio is 45 marks: (14 marks x 3 commentaries) + 3 marks = 42 + 3 marks. The
assessment criteria are related to the assessment objectives.
•
Criterion A: AO2 and AO4 •
Criterion B: AO1 •
Criterion C: AO2 •
Criterion D: AO2 •
Criterion E: AO3 •
