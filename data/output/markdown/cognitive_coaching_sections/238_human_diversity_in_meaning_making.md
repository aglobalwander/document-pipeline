## Human Diversity in Meaning Making

Where Cognitive Coaching provides a cognitive framework for our work as educators, the tools of Cultural Proficiency provide a moral framework. The culturally proficient educator recognizes that the disparities that exist among demographic groups are human-made and human-maintained. Recognizing these human-made disparities, the culturally proficient educator sees it as her moral obligation to create and influence change both within herself and her school.

When you pass strangers on the street, the unfamiliar faces blur. When you let your lives touch and make the effort of asking questions and listening to the stories they tell, you discover the intricate patterns of their differences and, at the same time, the underlying themes that all members of our species have in common.

-Mary Catherine Bateson

H umans differ in culture, temperament, tempo, signature, thumbprint, and patterns of veins in the hand. We hold different values, like different books, people, music, work, and leisure. Some of us are casual; some of us are fastidious. Many of us are serene; others among us are stressed. We are light skinned, dark skinned, slim and stout, young and old. Genetic, family, cultural, and environmental histories combine to make each of us truly unique (Markus and Conner 2013).

In this chapter, we present information about seven of the human variables that influence the human quest for meaning with a caution to the reader. It seems almost all comments related to this territory, unless exceptions are elaborately specified, are generalizations. Such is the nature

of being human; in all dimensions, no single statement can represent everyone in any category being addressed. Readers are invited to keep this in mind as you read the discussions about (1) representational systems, (2) cognitive styles, and (3) educational belief systems. Naturally, generalizations also occur in the accounts of (4) gender, (5) race, ethnicity, nationality, and culture, (6) adult stages of development, and (7) career stages. These final four set the broader context within which humans interact. Skilled coaches are sensitive to differences in each of these areas, and they adapt the coaching interactions for each person with whom they work. No person can attend to all these variations at once nor possibly know each of them in a detailed way. Curiosity, openness, and a willingness to learn from others is a start.

Coaching effectiveness increases with each new perceptual filter held by the coach. We've found that having multiple filters to consider, we can try on various perspectives as we work with others, testing which might apply.

Skillful coaches draw upon the states of mind of flexibility and consciousness to enhance coaching effectiveness by attending and adapting to differences in the ways that humans process and make meaning. For the first three filters, we describe ways coaches expand their repertoire and match style to a variety of situations and individuals.

We start by exploring the vagaries of perception and describe three perceptual filters common to all educators: representational systems (the way we represent thoughts in our minds), cognitive style (a biologically informed way of taking in information), and five educational belief systems representing differing orientations toward learning that inform teacher practices and that, for decades, have been the background for each phase of 'educational reform' and federally funded programs in education. When coaches are attentive to these three variables-their own and those of the person they are coaching-they gain influence by attending to preferences within the systems of the person they are coaching.
