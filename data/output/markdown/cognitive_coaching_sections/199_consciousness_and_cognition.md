## CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION

Until recently the quality of consciousness, the awareness of processing information, was not studied. However, new studies reveal several striking phenomena. People apparently process and retain information without awareness. The essence of these studies shows 'that people may deny seeing or remembering something-that is, be unaware of it-while at the same time showing through their behavior that they do see or remember the thing in question' (Shettleworth 1998).

As stated earlier, current views of information processing hold that memories are stored within the cognitive system in three forms: linguistic, nonlinguistic, and affective. Information is acquired, stored, retrieved, and acted upon according to the types of memories held in these systems.
