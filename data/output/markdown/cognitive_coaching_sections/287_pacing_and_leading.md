## PACING AND LEADING

Imagine that your friend says the following: 'I feel awful. I lost my temper during seventh period today. I was exhausted and, when Alex acted up, I just lost it. I know I embarrassed him in front of his peers, but I had just had it.'

Our well-intentioned human tendency is to respond in the following ways-each of them not helpful and, indeed, counterproductive if the intention is to assist a colleague in feeling better about, learning from, and

being able to resolve the problem with Alex:

- Provide sympathy and comfort
- Share similar experiences to let your friend know this happens to others
- Identify a silver lining
- Blame the student

There is a more effective way through a conversation that can actually trigger physical and emotional changes in the brain that open one up to optimism, resourcefulness, and creative energy (Glaser 2014). Cognitive Coaches, working with another person who has temporally lost access to his or her resourcefulness, use a pattern of pacing and leading. The problem-resolving conversation uses this pattern to mediate the other person's capacity to liberate and use the efficacy, craftsmanship, consciousness, flexibility, or interdependence that has been temporarily obscured. The long-range intent of the problem-resolving map is to help the other person become self-accessing of internal resources, even when the coach is not present. To be clear, pacing and leading is not the map, rather it is a structure on which the map is built.
