The Diploma Programme
The Diploma Programme is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19
age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and
inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to
develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The Diploma Programme model
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core (see figure 1). It encourages the
concurrent study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study two modern languages (or a modern
language and a classical language), a humanities or social science subject, an experimental science,
mathematics and one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma
Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance.
In each of the academic areas students have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can
choose subjects that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.

Introduction

The Diploma Programme
Visual arts guide 3
Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they can, instead
of an arts subject, choose two subjects from another area. Normally, three subjects (and not more than four)
are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends 240 teaching
hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than at SL.
At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of
the course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some element of coursework assessed by teachers.
The core of the Diploma Programme model
All Diploma Programme students participate in the three course elements that make up the core of the model.
Theory of knowledge (TOK) is a course that is fundamentally about critical thinking and inquiry into the process
of knowing rather than about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines the nature
of knowledge and how we know what we claim to know. It does this by encouraging students to analyse
knowledge claims and explore questions about the construction of knowledge. The task of TOK is to emphasize
connections between areas of shared knowledge and link them to personal knowledge in such a way that an
individual becomes more aware of his or her own perspectives and how they might differ from others.
Creativity, activity, service (CAS) is at the heart of the Diploma Programme. The emphasis in CAS is on
helping students to develop their own identities, in accordance with the ethical principles embodied in
the IB mission statement and the IB learner profile. It involves students in a range of activities alongside
their academic studies throughout the Diploma Programme. The three strands of CAS are Creativity (arts,
and other experiences that involve creative thinking), Activity (physical exertion contributing to a healthy
lifestyle) and Service (an unpaid and voluntary exchange that has a learning benefit for the student).
Possibly, more than any other component in the Diploma Programme, CAS contributes to the IB’s mission to
create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect.
The extended essay, including the world studies extended essay, offers the opportunity for IB students to
investigate a topic of special interest, in the form of a 4,000-word piece of independent research. The area of
research undertaken is chosen from one of the students’ six Diploma Programme subjects, or in the case of
the interdisciplinary world studies essay, two subjects, and acquaints them with the independent research
and writing skills expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally presented, structured
writing, in which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent manner, appropriate to
the subject or subjects chosen. It is intended to promote high-level research and writing skills, intellectual
discovery and creativity. An authentic learning experience, it provides students with an opportunity to
engage in personal research on a topic of choice, under the guidance of a supervisor.
Approaches to teaching and learning
Approaches to teaching and learning (ATL) across the Diploma Programme refers to deliberate strategies,
skills and attitudes which permeate the teaching and learning environment. These approaches and
tools, intrinsically linked with the learner profile attributes, enhance student learning and assist student
preparation for the Diploma Programme assessment and beyond. The aims of approaches to teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme are to:
•
empower teachers as teachers of learners as well as teachers of content •
empower teachers to create clearer strategies for facilitating learning experiences in which students
are more meaningfully engaged in structured inquiry and greater critical and creative thinking

=== Page 14 ===
The Diploma Programme
Visual arts guide 4 •
promote both the aims of individual subjects (making them more than course aspirations) and linking
previously isolated knowledge (concurrency of learning) •
encourage students to develop an explicit  variety of skills that will equip them to continue to be
actively engaged in learning after they leave school, and to help them not only obtain university
admission through better grades but also prepare for success during tertiary education and beyond •
enhance further the coherence and relevance of the students’ Diploma Programme experience •
allow schools to identify the distinctive nature of an IB Diploma Programme education, with its blend of idealism and practicality.
The five approaches to learning (developing thinking skills, social skills, communication skills, self management skills and research skills) along with the six approaches to teaching (teaching that is inquiry based, conceptually focused, contextualized, collaborative, differentiated and informed by assessment)
encompass the key values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy.
The IB mission statement and the IB learner profile
The Diploma Programme aims to develop in students the knowledge, skills and attitudes they will need
to fulfill the aims of the IB, as expressed in the organization’s mission statement and the learner profile.
Teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme represent the reality in daily practice of the organization’s educational philosophy.
Academic honesty
Academic honesty in the Diploma Programme is a set of values and behaviours informed by the attributes
of the learner profile. In teaching, learning and assessment, academic honesty serves to promote personal
integrity, engender respect for the integrity of others and their work, and ensure that all students have an
equal opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquire during their studies.
All coursework—including work submitted for assessment—is to be authentic, based on the student’s
individual and original ideas with the ideas and work of others always fully acknowledged at point of use
and included in a list of sources. Assessment tasks that require teachers to provide guidance to students
or that require students to work collaboratively must be completed in full compliance with the detailed
guidelines provided by the IB for the relevant subjects.
For further information on academic honesty in the IB and the Diploma Programme, please consult the IB
publications Academic honesty in the IB educational context, The Diploma Programme: From principles into
practice and the General regulations: Diploma Programme. Specific information regarding academic honesty
as it pertains to external and internal assessment tasks of this Diploma Programme subject can be found in this guide.
Acknowledging the ideas or work of another person
Coordinators and teachers are reminded that candidates must acknowledge all sources used in work
submitted for assessment. The following is intended as a clarification of this requirement.
Diploma Programme candidates submit work for assessment in a variety of forms that may include audio visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print or electronic sources. If a candidate uses

=== Page 15 ===
The Diploma Programme
Visual arts guide 5
the work or ideas of another person the candidate must acknowledge the source using a standard style of
referencing in a consistent manner. A candidate’s failure to acknowledge a source will be investigated by the
IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.
The IB does not prescribe which style(s) of referencing or in-text citation should be used by candidates; this
is left to the discretion of appropriate faculty/staff in the candidate’s school. The wide range of subjects,
three response languages and the diversity of referencing styles make it impractical and restrictive to insist
on particular styles. In practice, certain styles may prove most commonly used, but schools are free to
choose a style that is appropriate for the subject concerned and the language in which candidates’ work is
written. Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a given subject, it is expected that the
minimum information given includes: name of author, date of publication, title of source, and page numbers as applicable.
Candidates are expected to use a standard style and use it consistently so that credit is given to all sources
used, including sources that have been paraphrased or summarized. When writing text a candidate must
always clearly distinguish between their words and those of others by the use of quotation marks (or other
method, such as indentation) followed by an appropriate citation that denotes an entry in the bibliography.
If an electronic source is cited, the date of access must be indicated. Candidates are not expected to show
faultless expertise in referencing, but are expected to demonstrate that all sources have been acknowledged.
Candidates must be advised that audio-visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print
or in electronic sources that is not their own must also always attribute the source. Again, an appropriate style of referencing/citation must be used.
Learning diversity and learning support requirements
Schools must ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided to
candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Candidates with
assessment access requirements and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes.

Nature of the subject
Visual arts
The visual arts are an integral part of everyday life, permeating all levels of human creativity, expression,
communication and understanding. They range from traditional forms embedded in local and wider
communities, societies and cultures, to the varied and divergent practices associated with new, emerging
and contemporary forms of visual language. They may have sociopolitical impact as well as ritual, spiritual,
decorative and functional value; they can be persuasive and subversive in some instances, enlightening and
uplifting in others. We celebrate the visual arts not only in the way we create images and objects, but also
in the way we appreciate, enjoy, respect and respond to the practices of art-making by others from around
the world. Theories and practices in visual arts are dynamic and ever-changing, and connect many areas of
knowledge and human experience through individual and collaborative exploration, creative production and critical interpretation.
The IB Diploma Programme visual arts course encourages students to challenge their own creative
and cultural expectations and boundaries. It is a thought-provoking course in which students develop
analytical skills in problem-solving and divergent thinking, while working towards technical proficiency and
confidence as art-makers. In addition to exploring and comparing visual arts from different perspectives
and in different contexts, students are expected to engage in, experiment with and critically reflect upon a
wide range of contemporary practices and media. The course is designed for students who want to go on to
study visual arts in higher education as well as for those who are seeking lifelong enrichment through visual arts.
Supporting the International Baccalaureate mission statement and learner profile, the course encourages
students to actively explore the visual arts within and across a variety of local, regional, national,
international and intercultural contexts. Through inquiry, investigation, reflection and creative application,
visual arts students develop an appreciation for the expressive and aesthetic diversity in the world around
them, becoming critically informed makers and consumers of visual culture.
Distinction between SL and HL
The visual arts syllabus demonstrates a clear distinction between the course at SL and at HL, with additional
assessment requirements at HL that allow for breadth and greater depth in the teaching and learning. The
assessment tasks require HL students to reflect on how their own work has been influenced by exposure
to other artists and for them to experiment in greater depth with additional art-making media, techniques
and forms. HL students are encouraged to produce a larger body of resolved works and to demonstrate a
deeper consideration of how their resolved works communicate with a potential viewer.

Visual arts and the Diploma Programme core
Visual arts and the extended essay
Writing an extended essay in visual arts provides students with an opportunity to undertake independent
research into a topic of special interest. Students are encouraged to apply a range of skills in order to develop
and explore a focused research question appropriate to visual arts in an imaginative and critical way, and to
test and validate their research by considering its effect on the particular visual arts area.
The outcome of the research should be a coherent and structured piece of writing (with appropriate visuals)
that effectively addresses a particular issue or research question, appropriate to the visual arts (broadly
defined to include architecture, design and contemporary forms of visual culture). The research may be
generated or inspired by the student’s direct experience of artwork, craftwork or design, or interest in the
work of a particular artist, style or period. This might be related to the student’s own culture or another
culture. Personal contact with artists, curators and so on is strongly encouraged, as is the use of local and other primary sources.
Examples of suitable extended essays in visual arts include the following titles:
•
A critical evaluation of the ways in which Wassily Kandisky used colour •
An analysis of the extent to which African influences are evident in the work of Henry Moore (b.1898) •
An analysis of the term “apartment art” examined through the work of Xiao Lu.
Detailed guidance on extended essays in visual arts can be found in the Extended essay guide.
Visual arts and CAS
Studying visual arts provides excellent opportunities for students to make links with their CAS activities.
The practical and experiential nature of the subject combines effectively with a range of CAS activities
that complement and counterbalance the academic rigour of the Diploma Programme. The challenge and
enjoyment of CAS activities can often have a profound effect on visual arts students, who might choose to engage with CAS in the following ways.
•
Participation in a range of creative activities within the school, such as art projects for school
productions, designing publications and promotional materials, and exhibiting at showcase events—
there is great scope for students to extend their creative thinking through participation in the
planning, development and presentation of a wide range of school-based arts activities and events involving different audiences.
•
Participation in a range of artistic activities, workshops and exhibitions in collaboration with others
outside of the school context—these might include designing projects with organizations in the local
community or creating artworks with other local schools targeted at a specific audience with specific needs.
It is important to note that CAS must be distinct from, and may not be included or used in, any aspect of the student’s course requirements for any subject.
Teacher support material
Further opportunities for making links between the visual arts course and CAS can be found in the
Visual arts teacher support material.

Visual arts and TOK
The TOK course requires students to reflect on the nature of knowledge and on how we know what we
claim to know. The course identifies eight ways of knowing: reason, emotion, language, sense perception,
intuition, imagination, faith and memory. Students explore these means of producing knowledge within
the context of various areas of knowledge: the natural sciences, the social sciences, the arts, ethics, history,
mathematics, religious knowledge systems and indigenous knowledge systems. The course also requires
students to make comparisons between the different areas of knowledge, reflecting on how knowledge
is arrived at in the various disciplines, what the disciplines have in common and the differences between them.
Students of the arts subjects study the various artistic ways through which knowledge, skills and attitudes
from different cultural contexts are developed and transmitted. These subjects allow students to investigate
and reflect on the complexities of the human condition. By exploring a range of materials and technologies,
students should aim to develop an understanding of the technical, creative, expressive and communicative aspects of the arts.
Students of the arts subjects have the opportunity to analyse artistic knowledge from various perspectives,
and they acquire this knowledge through experiential means as well as more traditional academic methods.
The nature of the arts is such that an exploration of the areas of knowledge in general, and knowledge of
the different art forms specifically, can combine to help us understand ourselves, our patterns of behaviour
and our relationship to each other and our wider environment.
The arts subjects complement the TOK ethos by revealing interdisciplinary connections and allowing
students to explore the strengths and limitations of individual and cultural perspectives. Studying the arts
requires students to reflect on and question their own bases of knowledge. In addition, by exploring other
Diploma Programme subjects with an artistic bias, students can gain an understanding of the interdependent
nature of knowledge through which they are encouraged to become, “active, compassionate and lifelong
learners who understand that other people, with their differences, can also be right” (IB mission statement).
Questions related to TOK that a visual arts student might consider include the following.
•
To what extent is artistic knowledge something which cannot be expressed in any other way?
•
Are ways of knowing employed in radically different ways in the arts than in other areas of knowledge?
•
To what extent does imagination play a special role in the visual arts?
•
What moral responsibilities do artists have?
•
How can the subjective viewpoint of an individual contribute to knowledge in the arts?
•
What are the standards by which we judge artworks?
•
Why might we be more concerned with process rather than product in the search for knowledge?
•
Do the arts have a social function?
•
To what extent is truth different in the arts, mathematics and ethics?
Visual arts and international-mindedness
International-mindedness represents an openness and curiosity about the world and its people. It begins
with students understanding themselves in order to effectively connect with others. The arts provide a
unique opportunity for students to recognize the dynamic cultural influences around them. The IB Diploma
Programme visual arts course gives students the opportunity to study a wide variety of visual arts disciplines
and forms. Students are expected to explore and engage with art from a variety of contexts. Through
making, investigating and critically analysing and appreciating differing art forms, students deepen their

=== Page 19 ===
Nature of the subject
Visual arts guide 9
understanding of the visual arts, as well as their knowledge, understanding and experience of the visual
arts within the global community. They become more informed and reflective, and develop their abilities to
become enriched practitioners, communicators and visual thinkers. They learn to acknowledge the aspects
that appear in all art forms and art cultures, and also to recognize the unique ways in which particular
cultures express and represent their values and identity visually.
Culture
For the purposes of this visual arts guide, “culture” is defined as learned and shared beliefs, values,
interests, attitudes, products and all patterns of behaviour created by society. This view of culture
includes an organized system of symbols, ideas, explanations, beliefs and material production that
humans create and manipulate in their daily lives. Culture is dynamic and organic, operating on many
levels in the global context—international, national, regional and local, as well as among different social
groups within a society. Culture is seen as fluid and subject to change.
Culture can be seen as providing the overall framework within which humans learn to organize their
thoughts, emotions and behaviours in relation to their environment, and within this framework “cultural
context”, which specifically appears in both the taught syllabus and assessment tasks of the visual arts
course, refers to the conditions that influence and are influenced by culture. These include historical,
geographical, political, social and technological factors.
Engaging with sensitive topics
Studying visual arts gives students the opportunity to engage with exciting, stimulating and personally
relevant topics and issues. However, it should be noted that often such topics and issues can also be sensitive
and personally challenging for some students. Teachers should be aware of this and provide guidance on
how to approach and engage with such topics in a responsible manner. Consideration should also be given
to the personal, political and spiritual values of others, particularly in relation to race, gender or religious beliefs.
As part of the collective consideration of the school, visual arts students must be supported in maintaining
an ethical perspective during their course. Schools must be vigilant in ensuring that work undertaken by the
student does not damage the environment, include excessive or gratuitous violence or reference to explicit sexual activity.
Prior learning
The visual arts course at both SL and HL requires no previous experience. The course is designed to
enable students to experience visual arts on a personal level and achievement in this subject is reflected
in how students demonstrate the knowledge they have gained as well as the skills and attitudes they
have developed that are necessary for studying visual arts. Students’ individual abilities to be creative and
imaginative and to communicate in artistic form will be developed and extended through the theoretical and practical content of the visual arts course.
The visual arts course provides a relevant learning opportunity for a diverse range of students as it lays
an appropriate foundation for further study in visual arts, performing arts and other related subjects. In
addition, by instilling discipline and refining creative communication and collaborative skills, it offers a
valuable course of study for students who may wish to pursue a career or further education studies in areas unconnected to the arts.

Links to the Middle Years Programme
Although the visual arts course requires no formal prior learning, the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) arts
subject area provides a valuable grounding that students might find beneficial.
The MYP is designed for students aged 11 to 16. It provides a framework of learning that encourages students
to become creative, critical and reflective thinkers. The MYP emphasizes intellectual challenge, encouraging
students to make connections between their studies in traditional subjects and the real world. It fosters the
development of skills for communication, intercultural understanding and global engagement—essential
qualities for young people who are becoming global leaders.
The arts subject area in the MYP gives students the opportunity to develop as artists as well as learning
about the arts through conceptual understandings essential to the discipline. Learning takes place within
contexts relevant to the student, whether personal, local, national, international or globally significant.
Throughout the MYP, arts students are required to use knowledge, develop skills, think creatively and
respond to a variety of artworks. The MYP arts subject area, and specifically the MYP discipline of visual arts,
provides a solid foundation for the Diploma Programme visual arts course.
In MYP arts, students are provided opportunities to prepare for the Diploma Programme visual arts course by:
•
understanding the role of visual arts in context and using this understanding to inform their work and artistic decisions •
discovering the aesthetics of visual arts, and analysing and expressing this in various forms •
acquiring, developing and applying skills in the process of making and communicating visual arts •
being encouraged to think laterally, develop curiosity and purposefully explore and challenge boundaries •
responding to their world, to their own art and its audience, and to the visual arts of others.
In the MYP, students not only learn about the arts, they are provided with opportunities to develop
themselves as artists. The MYP Arts guide fosters autonomous experimentation and understanding which
is valued and developed further in the Diploma Programme. In thinking creatively the students become
successful learners of visual arts through inquiry and problem-solving. Emphasis is placed on the artistic
process allowing the students to plan, create, present, reflect and evaluate on the process of communicating
visual arts. Students further develop their repertoire to engage and convey feelings, experiences and ideas and build on the skills developed in the PYP.
Visual arts and academic honesty
Academic honesty
Key opportunities for guiding students on academic honesty issues are highlighted in each of the assessment tasks later in this guide.
Assessment components across the arts vary considerably, from oral presentations to formal written work,
from the presentation of finished works to the collection of ideas and stimuli that inspire the creative process.
Although guidelines for maintaining academic honesty are consistent for all subjects and components

=== Page 21 ===
Nature of the subject
Visual arts guide 11
across the Diploma Programme, the variety and richness of tasks in the arts means that each component
raises its own challenges for maintaining academic honesty. For more information please see IB publications relating to academic honesty.
Referencing sources
If a candidate uses content from any source, including the internet, these sources must be acknowledged
consistently in accordance with the school’s academic honesty policy. These should be recorded in a style
that clearly identifies exactly what in the student’s work has been taken from another source and its origin.
When a student is aware that another person’s work, ideas or images have influenced their own but it has
not been referred to directly in their work, the source must be cited at point of use in the student’s work and
then included as a list of sources. This is particularly relevant to the arts where the creative process will be
the result of a contrasting range of stimuli, influences and sources of inspiration.
Meeting formal requirements
Most of the assessment tasks in the arts are completed as coursework, and as such have strict conditions
under which student work must be completed, presented and, in the case of internally assessed work,
assessed. There are formal requirements that must be followed to ensure that the work received by
examiners and moderators is consistent and can be assessed against the marking criteria. Since these
conditions and formal requirements are designed to ensure that each candidate is given an equal
opportunity to demonstrate achievement, failure to follow them is a form of academic misconduct as it can lead to candidates having an unfair advantage.
Submitting exhibition works
Please note that any work selected for final assessment in the visual arts course must have been made or
constructed by the student. For example, a piece of clothing designed as part of a student’s study of fashion
or a piece of jewelry cannot be presented for assessment in realized form if the student did not create it
themselves. Where a student has taken found objects and created a new artwork with those found objects,
the resulting artwork would be considered as a piece constructed by the student. The same principle must
be applied to the use of additional elements used to create an atmosphere or a specific experience for an
audience (even though any audio component will not be assessed in this visual course). If the student uses
music or sound effects, for instance, they must be copyright free with appropriate citations provided or have been created by the student.
When submitting artworks for assessment, students are required to include exhibition text for each selected
piece. The exhibition text outlines the title, medium, size and provides an outline of intentions and/or
references to sources of inspiration for each piece. Students should identify if objects are self-made, found
or purchased under the “medium” section when compiling exhibition text.
Authenticity
Most of the assessment tasks in the arts are completed as coursework, and so have strict conditions under
which student work must be completed, presented and—in the case of internally assessed work—assessed.
There are also formal requirements that must be followed to ensure that the work received by examiners
and moderators is consistent and can be assessed against marking criteria. Since these conditions and
formal requirements are designed to provide each student with equal opportunity to demonstrate achieve ment, failure to follow them is a form of academic misconduct as it can lead to students being unfairly advantaged.

=== Page 22 ===
Nature of the subject
Visual arts guide 12
Coursework authentication form (6/VACAF)
During the creation of assessment work in visual arts, teachers are required to meet with students at various
intervals in order to discuss the progress being made by each student and to verify the origin and credibility
of the coursework being created. These one-to-one interactions, which might be formal meetings and/
or informal discussions in the classroom, provide the teacher with the necessary evidence to authenticate each student’s work.
For some of the assessment tasks for the DP visual arts course, teachers must provide a written summary of
the authentication conversations using the DP visual arts Coursework authentication form (6/VACAF), which
is submitted to the IB as part of the upload of external assessment material. Further details regarding the
authentication requirements for each assessment task are identified later in this guide.
By the very practical nature of arts subjects, the creation and progress of student work for some of the
assessment tasks is continually witnessed by teachers. Therefore, not all components will require written
teacher comments on the 6/VACAF. However, it is expected that the teacher will continue to scrutinize the
ongoing work of each candidate and seek assurance that every element of the work is authentic.

Approaches to teaching and learning in visual arts
Approaches to the teaching of visual arts
The Diploma Programme visual arts course has been designed to reflect the dynamic nature of visual
arts. When designing and delivering their own visual arts curriculum, it is important to note that teachers
have a free choice in the selection of artists and art media, forms and studies through which to meet the
requirements of the guide and from within the art-making forms table (see section “Art-making forms”).
Although the core syllabus is identified in this guide through subdivided segments, teachers are
encouraged to approach the teaching of the visual arts course in a holistic way. Suggestions for taught
activities are included in this guide with the intention of stimulating a broad range of exciting and engaging
approaches. These approaches are not intended to be prescriptive nor restrictive activities, but are included
to illustrate some of the many possible pathways that can fully prepare students for the demands of the
assessment tasks. Teachers are encouraged to interpret this holistic syllabus creatively according to their
local circumstances and the context of the individual school. This is an international visual arts course and
how teachers choose to explore art and artists from various cultural contexts is left to their own discretion.
Teachers should not only teach practices with which they themselves are familiar and about which they
are knowledgeable, but should also be risk-takers and expose their students to unfamiliar traditions from around the world.
Visual arts teachers are not expected to be sources of all knowledge, deliverers of information or experts.
Their role should be to actively and carefully organize learning experiences for the students, directing their
study to enable them to reach their potential and satisfy the demands of the course. Students should be
empowered to become autonomous, informed and skilled visual artists. No time allocation is given for
any individual area of the syllabus because art-making activities will invariably cover various parts of the
course. Careful planning of class activities and, where feasible, visits to exhibitions and workshops with
practitioners, however, are needed to make the best use of the time and resources available.
Although the course is designed to stand on its own, some schools may wish to arrange extra-curricular
activities for visitors to teach skills in some media, or for activities that may be better undertaken over a
longer period of time, such as observational drawing, perhaps from life.
Teacher support material
Key resources to underpin the delivery of this course can be found in the Visual arts teacher support material.
Approaches to learning in visual arts
The visual arts course is student-centred and places student exploration at the heart of a holistic learning
experience. Students have a free choice to identify, select and explore artists, artworks, cultural contexts,
and media and forms for study which interest and excite them. They also have freedom to present their
studies in a variety of creative ways, including presentations, demonstrations and exhibitions.
Introduction

=== Page 27 ===
Approaches to teaching and learning in visual arts
Visual arts guide 17
Learning about visual arts relies on action and the course must be experienced practically. Communication
is essential to the visual arts and students should experience and reflect on the processes of communicating
their work, and the benefits and challenges of doing so. Organization, self-management and independent
study skills are important, as well as higher-order thinking skills, such as analysis and synthesis. Students
should also learn to make decisions about what is relevant and useful for their own investigations and how
to put their knowledge and understanding into practice, transforming ideas into action.
Through this course students should learn not only about visual arts from a variety of cultural contexts,
but also about the importance of making their own practical work with integrity, informed by theory and
research, with an awareness of the impact their work and ideas may have on the world.
The visual arts course encourages students to research using not only traditional academic methods but
also by experimenting and coming to understandings through their own embodied experiences. The
visual arts embody many of the approaches to teaching and learning (ATL) skills (social, research, thinking,
communication and self-management) that empower teachers and students to facilitate meaningful
learning experiences. For example, the visual arts journal, a central element of the visual arts course,
brings together a number of ATL skills through the process of reflection, which features as a taught activity throughout the course.

Syllabus
Syllabus outline
Core areas
The visual arts core syllabus at SL and HL consists of three equal interrelated areas as shown in figure 2.
Figure 2
These core areas, which have been designed to fully interlink with the assessment tasks, must be central to the
planning of the taught course that is designed and delivered by the teacher. Students are required to understand
the relationship between these areas and how each area informs and impacts their work in visual arts.
Visual arts in context
The visual arts in context part of the syllabus provides a lens through which students are encouraged to
explore perspectives, theories and cultures that inform and influence visual arts practice. Students should
be able to research, understand and appreciate a variety of contexts and traditions and be able to identify links between them.
Through the visual arts in context area, students will:
•
be informed about the wider world of visual arts and they will begin to understand and appreciate the
cultural contexts within which they produce their own works •
observe the conventions and techniques of the artworks they investigate, thinking critically and
experimenting with techniques, and identifying possible uses within their own art-making practice •
investigate work from a variety of cultural contexts and develop increasingly sophisticated, informed responses to work they have seen and experienced.
Visual arts methods
The visual arts methods part of the syllabus addresses ways of making artwork through the exploration and
acquisition of skills, techniques and processes, and through engagement with a variety of media and methods.
Through the visual arts methods area, students will:
•
understand and appreciate that a diverse range of media, processes, techniques and skills are required
in the making of visual arts, and how and why these have evolved

=== Page 29 ===
Syllabus outline
Visual arts guide 19 •
engage with the work of others in order to understand the complexities associated with different art making methods and use this inquiry to inspire their own experimentation and art-making practice •
understand how a body of work can communicate meaning and purpose for different audiences.
Communicating visual arts
The communicating visual arts part of the syllabus involves students investigating, understanding and
applying the processes involved in selecting work for exhibition and public display. It engages students in
making decisions about the selection of their own work.
Through the communicating visual arts area, students will:
•
understand the many ways in which visual arts can communicate and appreciate that presentation
constructs meaning and may influence the way in which individual works are valued and understood •
produce a body of artwork through a process of reflection and evaluation and select artworks for
exhibition, articulating the reasoning behind their choices and identifying the ways in which selected works are connected •
explore the role of the curator; acknowledging that the concept of an exhibition is wide ranging and
encompasses many variables, but most importantly, the potential impact on audiences and viewers.
Mapping the course
Students are required to investigate the core syllabus areas through exploration of the following practices:
• theoretical practice • art-making practice • curatorial practice.
The table below shows how these activities link with the core syllabus areas at both SL and HL.
Visual arts in context
Visual arts methods
Communicating visual arts
Theoretical practice
Students examine and compare the work of artists from different cultural contexts.
Students consider the contexts influencing their own work and the work of others.
Students look at different techniques for making art.
Students investigate and compare how and why different techniques have evolved and the processes involved.
Students explore ways of communicating through visual and written means.
Students make artistic choices about how to most effectively communicate knowledge and understanding.
Art making practice
Students make art through a process of investigation, thinking critically and experimenting with techniques.
Students apply identified techniques to their own developing work.
Students experiment with diverse media and explore techniques for making art.
Students develop concepts through processes that are informed by skills, techniques and media.
Students produce a body of artwork through a process of reflection and evaluation, showing a synthesis of skill, media and concept.

Syllabus outline
Visual arts guide 20
Visual arts in context
Visual arts methods
Communicating visual arts
Curatorial practice
Students develop an informed response to work and exhibitions they have seen and experienced.
Students begin to formulate personal intentions for creating and displaying their own artworks.
Students evaluate how their ongoing work communicates meaning and purpose.
Students consider the nature of “exhibition” and think about the process of selection and the potential impact of their work on different audiences.
Students select and present resolved works for exhibition.
Students explain the ways in which the works are connected.
Students discuss how artistic judgments impact the overall presentation.
To fully prepare students for the demands of the assessment tasks teachers should ensure that their
planning addresses each of the syllabus activities outlined above, the content and focus of which is not
prescribed. The connections between the syllabus areas and the assessment tasks can be seen in the table
in the section “Linking the visual arts core syllabus areas to the assessment tasks”.
The visual arts journal
Throughout the course students at both SL and HL are required to maintain a visual arts journal. This is their
own record of the two years of study and should be used to document:
•
the development of art-making skills and techniques • experiments with media and technologies •
the investigation of their own art development in the context of related art genres • personal reflections • their responses to first-hand observations • creative ideas for exploration and development •
their evaluations of art practices and art-making experiences •
their responses to diverse stimuli and to artists and their works, especially in relation to their own art • detailed evaluations and critical analysis • records of valued feedback received •
challenges they have faced and their achievements.
Students should be encouraged to find the most appropriate ways of recording their development and have
free choice in deciding what form the visual arts journal should take. The aim of the visual arts journal is to
support and nurture the acquisition of skills and ideas, to record developments, and to critique challenges
and successes. It is expected that much of the written work submitted for the assessment tasks at the end of
the course will have evolved and been drawn from the contents of the visual arts journal.
Although sections of the journal will be selected, adapted and presented for assessment, the journal itself is
not directly assessed or moderated. It is, however, regarded as a fundamental activity of the course.
Using the visual arts journal in assessment tasks
Key opportunities for using the visual arts journal within assessed elements of this course are
highlighted in each of the assessment tasks later in this guide.

=== Page 31 ===
Syllabus outline
Visual arts guide 21
Art-making forms
Throughout the course students are expected to experience working with a variety of different art-making
and conceptual forms. SL students should, as a minimum, experience working with at least two art-making
forms, each selected from separate columns of the table below. HL students should, as a minimum,
experience working with at least three art-making forms, selected from a minimum of two columns of the
table below. The examples given are for guidance only and are not intended to represent a definitive list.
Two-dimensional forms
Three-dimensional forms
Lens-based, electronic and screen-based forms •
Drawing: such as charcoal, pencil, ink, collage •
Painting: such as acrylic, oil, watercolour, murals •
Printmaking: such as relief, intaglio, planographic, chine collé •
Graphics: such as illustration and design, graphic novel, storyboard •
Carved sculpture: such as carved wood, stone, block •
Modelled sculpture: such as wax, polymer clays •

such as vector graphics, software developed painting, design and illustration
Interaction and engagement with local artists or collections as well as visits to museums, galleries,
exhibitions and other kinds of presentations provide valuable first-hand opportunities for investigation and
should be used to inform student work wherever possible. Personal responses to these experiences should be documented in the visual arts journal.
Research
When carrying out research, students should be encouraged to consult a suitable range of primary and
secondary sources. As well as the more obvious sources (books, websites, videos, DVDs, articles) research
may also include art-making experiences and encounters such as workshops, lectures, correspondence
with experts and visits to exhibitions. All sources consulted during the course must be cited following the
protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school and be presented both at point of use and, when required, in a list of sources.

Syllabus
The visual arts course provides a framework that allows teachers to choose content and activities appropriate
to the school context with the precise taught activities and subject materials generated by the teacher
and students. When constructing a holistic course of study, the teacher must understand and appreciate
how the assessment tasks are drawn from the syllabus areas and design a curriculum which ensures
that students are fully equipped and informed in accordance with the visual arts aims and assessment
objectives. An integrated relationship between the core areas of visual arts in context, visual arts methods
and communicating visual arts is essential throughout the course. The connections between the visual arts
syllabus areas and the assessment tasks can be seen in the table “Linking the visual arts core syllabus areas to the assessment tasks”.
Visual arts in context
The visual arts in context area provides a framework for understanding the contexts of visual arts through
theoretical practice, art-making practice and curatorial practice. Students are encouraged to consider works
of artists from a variety of cultural contexts and consider how these contexts have influenced their creation
and informed how meaning and significance is transferred to an audience. Students investigate and identify
the techniques and conventions used by artists when making art and consider how the range of forms,
media, processes and techniques are used to realize artistic intentions. Students are required to view
artworks and respond to them in exhibition and other settings, considering how curatorial interventions
can also contribute to the ways works are perceived. Students are required to explore this area through a variety of art-making forms.
The visual arts in context area should provide a range of opportunities for students to explore theoretical
practice, art-making practice and curatorial practice.
Theoretical practice
Teachers must ensure that students at SL and HL have experience of examining and comparing the work
of artists from different times, places and cultures, using a range of critical methodologies, considering the
cultural contexts influencing their own work and the work of others.
Students should develop the ability to research and analyse art-making practices from a variety of cultural
contexts and to make informed comparisons between them. Students should be guided through the
process of critical analysis, identifying and critiquing the formal qualities of a range of artworks, objects and
artifacts from a range of origins. They should interpret the function and purpose of works, evaluate their
significance within the cultural contexts in which they were created, and compare and contrast different
pieces, demonstrating that they are able to articulate their understanding in both visual and written forms.
Within the “cultural context”, students should be encouraged to consider the historical, political, social,
aesthetic and intellectual contexts from which art can evolve and to which it can contribute.
Cultural context
For this visual arts guide “cultural context” refers to the conditions that influence and are influenced
by culture. These include historical, geographical, political, social and technological factors.

Taught activities for this area might include:
•
an introduction to the use of the visual arts journal as a record of individual inquiry and investigation,
with particular emphasis on how to appropriately cite sources •
demonstrations, discussions, oral and written presentations about how to begin critiquing artworks,
with reference to various cultural contexts, differing art forms and artists •
lessons in art history—these might include an overview of developments and movements from earliest
times to the present day, the provision of timelines for reference, with accompanying contextual
background (such as historical and sociopolitical influences, cultural and technological achievements and events) •
identifying and engaging with available secondary sources (such as books and audio-visual materials)
through the use of the art department library, school resource centre or appropriate art-specific internet sites •
identifying and discussing the formal qualities of particular works as a whole class •
providing an introduction to a range of models for analysing, critiquing, interpreting and
deconstructing artworks, offering opportunities for students to engage with these and become familiar with them •
identifying and engaging with primary and secondary sources such as galleries, libraries and working artists •
learning models for engaging in arts based research •
learning how to engage in art criticism or responding to art •
learning specialist art vocabulary and terms through the use of a glossary.
Art-making practice
Teachers must ensure that students at SL and HL have experience of making art through a process of
investigation, thinking critically and experimenting with techniques, applying identified techniques to their own developing work.
Students should be given the opportunity to experiment with art-making practices they have identified
in their research and their analysis of art-making practices from a variety of cultural contexts. They should
engage with artists and artworks that particularly inspire them and experiment with the skills, media,
materials, techniques and processes involved. These can take the form of simple transcriptions, through
which the students seek to find out how particular elements of artworks have been created or how specific
effects have been achieved, or more in-depth studies through which students follow a process through
to creating a larger body of work inspired by the artist, artwork or artifact. To enable students to develop
proficiency in their own preferred areas of expertise as they progress through the course it is expected that
they will have been exposed to a breadth of contrasting skills, techniques, media, production processes,
materials and practices and incorporate these into their own repertoire of art-making strategies.
Taught activities for this area might include:
•
technical instruction and demonstrations in the use of particular media (such as oil painting, ink
drawing, clay modeling, digital techniques and so on) with reference to particular artists •
investigating the historical and technological changes and developments of particular media and techniques •
hands-on, guided workshop sessions for students in the use of media and techniques, supported by visiting specialists where appropriate

=== Page 34 ===
Syllabus content
Visual arts guide 24 •
guided projects influenced by particular artists, with particular reference to the media and techniques used and the methods involved •
associated relevant class theory lessons (such as colour theory, history of pigments and so on).
Curatorial practice
Teachers must ensure that students at SL and HL have experience of developing an informed response to work,
with students beginning to formulate personal intentions for creating and displaying their own artworks.
Students must be encouraged to develop their own informed individual responses to work and exhibitions
they have seen and experienced. They should begin to formulate their own intentions for making original
artworks and identify inspirations from a variety of different sources. Students should be capable of clearly
expressing their own unique voice through their art-making.
Taught activities for this area might include:
•
guided visits to local galleries and community arts initiatives, with particular attention to the curatorial
aspects and to identifying individual artists’ purposes, influences and inspirations through their artist statements •
sharing feedback after such visits in a variety of forms (teacher-led, pair and group discussions and
presentations, written reflections in the visual arts journal and occasionally more formal assignments) •
consideration of how students’ own work will be affected by that of other artists. Discussions might
include the use of transcription as a valid learning tool and the role of appropriation in visual arts work •
creating Mind Maps® of individual ideas for artwork as inspired by work seen elsewhere.
Visual arts methods
The visual arts methods area of the course allows students to explore the different processes involved in
art-making. It should provide students with the opportunity to develop the necessary skills and techniques
required to make art as well as to observe and reflect upon their own developing art practice. Students
should be encouraged to identify their preferred modes of working, their preferred use of media, techniques
and processes and begin to realize their strengths and intentions. Students are required to explore this area through a variety of different art-making forms.
The visual arts methods area should provide a range of opportunities for students to explore theoretical
practice, art-making practice and curatorial practice.
Theoretical practice
Teachers must ensure that students at SL and HL have experience of looking at different techniques for making
art, investigating and comparing how and why different techniques have evolved and the processes involved.
Students should look at different practices for making art from a variety of cultural contexts. They should
investigate how different techniques and practices have evolved and through this be able to articulate an
understanding of the range of possible approaches to creating original artwork.
Taught activities for this area might include:
•
investigating how processes in art have changed and how media or techniques have developed or technologically evolved over time •
familiarization with various art genres, styles, regional schools and associations

=== Page 35 ===
Syllabus content
Visual arts guide 25 •
presentation of the range of media, techniques and equipment available to students within the art department and elsewhere within the school •
identification of expertise available to students, within the school and locally (such as local practising
artists, the areas of special interest of art department staff and other relevant staff expertise in ICT, design technology and so on) •
demonstrations of available practices and techniques as used by a range of artists and provision of
practical guides (such as books, audio-visual material and so on) which deal with specific techniques.
Art-making practices
Teachers must ensure that students at SL and HL have experience of experimenting with diverse media,
exploring techniques for making art and developing concepts through processes that are informed by skills, techniques and media.
Students should experiment with a variety of different media, techniques and processes that are appropriate
to their own contexts, conceptual development and intentions.
Taught activities for this area might include:
•
group or whole-class workshops and demonstrations as well as individual studio practice to facilitate
individual experiences in media and techniques (including two-dimensional forms, three-dimensional
forms and lens-based, electronic and screen-based forms) with particular reference to the historical
development of processes and techniques and different cultural and traditional uses of these •
guiding students to consider and record the potential of these experiences in the visual arts journal,
reflecting on students’ individual intentions and ideas •
visual recordings of individual student practical processes •
exploring digital means of capturing art-making practice as it occurs and creating a record of
experimentation and exploration with acquired skills.
Curatorial practice
Teachers must ensure that students at SL and HL have experience of evaluating how their ongoing work
communicates meaning and purpose, considering the nature of “exhibition” and thinking about the process
of selection and the potential impact of their work on different audiences.
Students should be encouraged to reflect upon their developing work with particular focus on how the
intended meaning and purpose are communicated. Students need to identify opportunities for further
development in the work being undertaken. Students should be encouraged to consider the nature of
“exhibition” and consider the role and functions of galleries and museums. They should critique their
successes and failures in relation to their intentions and consider how their developing work might impact on an audience if presented for public display.
Taught activities for this area might include:
•
talks given by visiting artists about how they put together exhibitions of their own work, with
particular emphasis on deciding what to include, what to leave out and why •
looking at and critiquing exhibition reviews in journals •
TOK-linked discussions about the ethics of museums and curatorial artifacts •
exemplar sessions led by the teacher or visiting artist which detail art projects from inquiry and ideas,
action and development, application of techniques to concepts, through to evaluation and reflection
upon work in progress and/or final product—students are taught to critique in terms of meaning,
purpose and success in communication of the idea(s) and development of technique

=== Page 36 ===
Syllabus content
Visual arts guide 26 •
student presentations in the same vein, with group discussions and feedback •
renewed approaches and application to individual studio work following these review sessions •
use of the visual arts journal to identify not only successes, but also reflecting on “finest failures” within
the art-making process and considering how these might drive further experimentation and inquiry.
Communicating visual arts
The communicating visual arts area of the course leads on from, and is informed by, the visual arts in context
and visual arts methods core syllabus areas. As students begin to resolve a range of developing pieces of
art, it encourages them to engage with the breadth of curatorial strategies that underpin exhibitions and
the presentation of work for an audience. It involves them thinking about the process of selecting and
rejecting works for exhibition, and considering how they can best be displayed. Students can consider
chronological or thematic methods of display, making technical or conceptual connections between
works and considering how this may influence the way the audience perceive the works of art. They will
demonstrate understanding of how form, media and composition affect meaning.
The communicating visual arts area should provide a range of opportunities for students to explore
theoretical practice, art-making practice and curatorial practice.
Theoretical practice
Teachers must ensure that students at SL and HL have experience of exploring ways of communicating
through visual and written means, making artistic choices about how to most effectively communicate knowledge and understanding.
Students are encouraged to identify how their own work or that of others fulfills stated intentions and what
meanings are communicated and how. They will understand that the concept of an exhibition is broad and
encompasses many variables. They will investigate where and why finished pieces are selected for public
display, explore the role of the curator and curatorial practices, and begin to understand and appreciate
the decision-making process involved in communicating with audiences and presenting work. This syllabus
area also examines the impact that diverse modes of presentation can have on an audience or viewers.
Taught activities for this area might include:
•
guided investigations into the role of the curator and curatorial practices through visits to galleries
and artists’ studios, reviewing catalogues for local exhibitions, presentations by visiting artists and
exploration of alternative display spaces—this is supported by individual research with entries in the visual arts journal and shared oral feedback •
the study of artist statements and accepted conventions for titling and annotating exhibited works •
practice in applying the knowledge gained to their own work and that of others through the creation
of mini-exhibitions of students’ own work supported by appropriate artist statements, with attention to display and labeling •
curating an imaginary exhibition, identifying an appropriate exhibition context, selecting a particular
artist’s work or using artwork from a selected movement, culture or tradition and producing appropriate accompanying documentation.
Art-making practice
Teachers must ensure that students at SL and HL have experience of producing a body of artwork through a
process of reflection and evaluation, showing a synthesis of skill, media and concept.

=== Page 37 ===
Syllabus content
Visual arts guide 27
Students will develop their own work for presentation, consider what messages they want to communicate
about it to an audience and begin selecting a sample for exhibition. Students will produce a body of
their own resolved and unresolved artworks that demonstrate both technical proficiency and conceptual strengths.
Taught activities for this area might include:
•
reviewing resolved and unresolved works, individual reflection and guided decision-making •
regular individual drafting and redrafting of artist statements of intention •
ongoing individual guided studio work, in the light of student’s own developing artist statements •
workshops in presentation techniques which include refining personal statements, matting, mounts, layout and producing exhibition text.
Curatorial practice
Teachers must ensure that students at SL and HL have experience of selecting and presenting resolved
works for exhibition, explaining the ways in which the works are connected and discussing how artistic judgments impact the overall presentation.
Students will select a sample of resolved work and reflect on what makes these effective pieces for
exhibition, particularly in response to their own clearly stated intentions and the messages they wanted to
communicate about their artwork. The taught syllabus should be flexible enough to ensure that students
can create and display a range of artworks. An integral part of this experience is the process of self-reflection
and an awareness of how viewers can engage with artwork in different kinds of exhibition contexts and venues.
Taught activities for this area might include:
•
learning how to engage in art criticism or responding to art via various models •
practice in compiling reflective commentaries on individual artworks •
individual presentations supported by group and class discussions which consider work for
exhibition—this process involves identifying projects and pieces which communicate and interest the
viewer as well as critiquing work from a technical point of view; discussions focus on improving and developing work in progress •
modeling and monitoring student compilation of exhibition text and other accompanying written
material; students identify, contextualize and justify their selections for exhibition.
Teacher support material
The suggestions for taught activities outlined above are intended to stimulate a broad range of
exciting and engaging approaches to fulfilling the requirements of the course. These are not intended
to be prescriptive nor restrictive activities, but to illustrate some of the many possible pathways to
fully preparing students for the demands of the assessment tasks. Further resources to underpin the
planning and delivery of this course can be found in the Visual arts teacher support material.

Assessment
Assessment in the Diploma Programme
General
Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most important aims of assessment in the
Diploma Programme are that it should support curricular goals and encourage appropriate student
learning. Both external and internal assessments are used in the Diploma Programme. IB examiners mark
work produced for external assessment, while work produced for internal assessment is marked by teachers and externally moderated by the IB.
There are two types of assessment identified by the IB.
•
Formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is concerned with providing accurate
and helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of learning taking place and the nature of
students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop students’ understanding and capabilities.
Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide information to
monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives.
•
Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring student achievement.
The Diploma Programme primarily focuses on summative assessment designed to record student
achievement at, or towards the end of, the course of study. However, many of the assessment instruments
can also be used formatively during the course of teaching and learning, and teachers are encouraged to
do this. A comprehensive assessment plan is viewed as being integral with teaching, learning and course
organization. For further information, see the IB Programme standards and practices document.
The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not norm-referenced. This approach to
assessment judges students’ work by their performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, and
not in relation to the work of other students. For further information on assessment within the Diploma
Programme please refer to the publication Diploma Programme assessment: principles and practice.
To support teachers in the planning, delivery and assessment of the Diploma Programme courses, a variety
of resources can be found on the OCC or purchased from the IB store (http://store.ibo.org). Additional
publications such as specimen papers and markschemes, teacher support materials, subject reports and
grade descriptors can also be found on the OCC. Past examination papers as well as markschemes can be purchased from the IB store.
Methods of assessment
The IB uses several methods to assess work produced by students.
Assessment criteria
Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended. Each criterion concentrates on
a particular aspect of knowledge, understanding or skill that students are expected to demonstrate. An
assessment objective describes what students should be able to do, and assessment criteria describe
how well they should be able to do it. Using assessment criteria allows discrimination between different

=== Page 41 ===
Assessment in the Diploma Programme
Visual arts guide 31
answers and encourages a variety of responses. Each criterion comprises a set of hierarchically ordered level
descriptors. Each level descriptor is worth one or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using
a best-fit model. The maximum marks for each criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance.
The marks awarded for each criterion are added together to give the total mark for the piece of work.
Markbands
Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance against which responses are judged.
They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds
to a range of marks to differentiate student performance. A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which
particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.
Analytic markschemes
Analytic markschemes are prepared for those examination questions that expect a particular kind of
response and/or a given final answer from students. They give detailed instructions to examiners on how to
break down the total mark for each question for different parts of the response.
Marking notes
For some assessment components marked using assessment criteria, marking notes are provided. Marking
notes give guidance on how to apply assessment criteria to the particular requirements of a question.
Inclusive assessment arrangements
Inclusive assessment arrangements are available for candidates with assessment access requirements.
These arrangements enable candidates with diverse needs to access the examinations and demonstrate
their knowledge and understanding of the constructs being assessed.
The IB document Candidates with assessment access requirements provides details on all the inclusive assessment
arrangements available to candidates with learning support requirements. The IB document Learning diversity and
inclusion in IB programmes outlines the position of the IB with regard to candidates with diverse learning needs
in the IB programmes. For candidates affected by adverse circumstances, the IB documents General regulations:
Diploma Programme and the Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Programme provide details on access consideration.
Responsibilities of the school
The school is required to ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided
to candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Candidates with
assessment access requirements and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes .
Teacher support material
Please note that the advice for structuring assessment materials contained within each of the
assessment tasks is for guidance only and is not intended to be prescriptive nor restrictive. Further
examples of how to structure assessment work can be found in the Visual arts teacher support material.

External assessment tasks—SL and HL
Part 1: Comparative study
Weighting: 20%
Students are required to analyse and compare artworks, objects or artifacts by different artists. This
independent critical and contextual investigation should explore artworks, objects and artifacts from differing cultural contexts.
Throughout the course, students will have investigated a range of artists, styles, images and objects from
a range of cultural contexts, through an integrated approach to exploring the three syllabus areas: visual
arts in context, visual arts methods and communicating visual arts. Students select artworks, objects and
artifacts for comparison from differing cultural contexts that may have been produced across any of the
art-making forms, and that hold individual resonance for the student and have relevance to their own art making practice. This is of particular importance to HL students.
Students at both SL and HL must examine and compare at least three pieces, at least two of which should
be by different artists. It is valuable for students to have experienced at least one of the works in real time
and space, such as a painting at a gallery, a sculpture in a park or an artifact from the local community that is
brought into the school, although this is not essential. Good quality reproductions can be referred to when
a student’s location limits their access to such works first hand. The works selected for comparison and
analysis should come from contrasting cultural contexts.
Students use research and inquiry skills to investigate and interpret the selected pieces, applying aspects of
critical theory and methodologies to the works examined and presenting their findings as a personal and
critically reflective analysis, using both visual and written forms of notation. Students must support their
interpretation with references to sound and reliable sources. Candidates are required to submit the list of
sources used and in-text referencing is required throughout the comparative study. A recognized system of
academic referencing must be used in line with the school’s academic honesty policy. A candidate’s failure
to acknowledge a source will be investigated by the IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result in
a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.

Preparation process
In preparation for this task, within the core syllabus students at SL and HL must have had experience of the following.
Visual arts in context
Visual arts methods
Communicating visual arts
Theoretical practice
Examining and comparing the work of artists from different cultural contexts using a range of critical methodologies.
Considering the contexts influencing their own work and the work of others.
Looking at different techniques for making art.
Investigating and comparing how and why different techniques have evolved and the processes involved.
Exploring ways of communicating through visual and written means.
Making artistic choices about how to most effectively communicate knowledge and understanding.
Visual arts journal
Recording their experiences and learning, together with impressions, reflections and
any relevant research that they need to be able to reference, in the visual arts journal.
Students then undertake the process outlined below for assessment.
Task details
Students at both SL and HL must select at least three artworks, objects or artifacts, at least two of which
should be by different artists. For each of the selected pieces, students should:
•
carry out research from a range of different sources (that they must be able to reference) •
analyse the cultural contexts in which the selected pieces were created •
identify the formal qualities of the selected pieces •
interpret the function and purpose of the selected pieces •
evaluate the material, conceptual and cultural significance of the selected pieces to the cultural contexts within which they were created.
Students at both SL and HL should then:
•
compare the selected pieces, identifying links in cultural context, formal qualities, function, purpose, material, conceptual and cultural significance • present a list of sources used during the study.
Students at HL should also reflect on the investigation outcomes and the extent to which their own art making practices and pieces have subsequently been influenced by artworks, objects or artifacts examined in the comparative study.

Visual arts guide 38
The role of the teacher
Teachers must ensure that their students are appropriately prepared for the demands of this task through
the careful planning and delivery of the core syllabus activities outlined above. This assessment task must
not be teacher led and students must be made fully aware of the assessment criteria against which their work will be judged.
Teachers are required to meet with students at each stage of inquiry, action and reflection to discuss the
progress made to date, and to verify the authenticity of the coursework being created by each student. The
key outcomes of these one-to-one interactions, which might be formal meetings and/or informal discussions
in the classroom, must be summarized by the teacher on the DP visual arts Coursework authentication form
(6/VACAF), which is submitted to the IB as part of the upload of external assessment material. This form can be found on the visual arts page of the OCC.
The teacher should discuss the choice of selected artworks, objects and artifacts with each student. It is
important that the selected pieces are the student’s own choice. Teachers should also ensure that the
students are acknowledging all sources used and referencing them appropriately.
Teachers should read and give advice to students on one draft of the comparative study. The teacher should
provide oral or written advice on how the comparative study could be improved, but should not edit the
draft. The next version handed to the teacher must be the final version for submission.
Structuring the comparative study
Students should articulate their understanding through both visual and written forms, depending on the
most appropriate means of presenting and communicating their findings. While the comparative study
may include text-based analysis, it may also include diagrammatic and graphic elements such as annotated
sketches and diagrams, annotations on copies of artworks as well as other visual organizing techniques
(such as flowcharts, relative importance graphs, concept webs and Mind Maps®). An introduction to the
study should summarize the scope of the investigation from which the focus artworks, objects and artifacts
have been selected. Students should aim for a balance of visual and written content, and use an appropriate
means of acknowledging sources. Students must ensure that their work makes effective use of subject specific language where appropriate.
For each of the selected artworks, objects or artifacts, students at both SL and HL are encouraged to focus
their analysis and interpretation of works through consideration of the role of the artist, the artwork, the
audience and the cultural context. The scope and scale of the comparative study task will depend largely on
the materials selected for investigation. Students may wish, however, to adapt the following structure to suit
their needs. This structure is for guidance only and is neither prescriptive nor restrictive.
Using the visual arts journal in this task
Students should use their visual arts journal to specifically document their investigation and responses
to the selected pieces. This includes their detailed interpretations, evaluations and comparisons.
Students will select, adapt and present what they have recorded in their journal as the basis for the comparative study task.

=== Page 49 ===
External assessment
Visual arts guide 39
Introduction
Students summarize the scope of the investigation from which the focus artworks, objects and artifacts
have been selected, and any thematic or conceptual framework used to draw the investigation together.
The artworks, objects or artifacts and their contexts
Students summarize their research from a range of different sources and present their inquiry into the
identification and interpretation of selected artworks, objects and artifacts. They also explain how they
have applied a range and combination of critical theories and methodologies to the works. Areas of investigation might include:
•
identification of the cultural contexts of the selected pieces •
identification and analysis of the formal qualities of the selected pieces (elements such as shape/
form, space, tone, colour, line, texture and principles such as balance, rhythm, proportion, emphasis, pattern, variety) •
analysis and understanding of the function and purpose of the selected pieces (such as the
meanings of motifs, signs and symbols used in the work) •
analysis and evaluation of the material, conceptual and cultural significance of the pieces and the cultural contexts in which they were created.
Making connections
Students present their comparisons of the different pieces, clearly identifying links between them.
These comparisons might include:
•
comparing and contrasting the cultural contexts of the selected pieces •
comparing and contrasting the formal qualities of the selected pieces •
comparing and contrasting the function and purpose of the selected pieces •
comparing and contrasting the material, conceptual and cultural significance of the pieces.
Connecting to own art-making practice (HL only)
Students analyse and evaluate their research outcomes and the extent to which their own art-making
practices and pieces have subsequently been influenced by artworks, objects, artifacts and their
creators examined in the comparative study. These influences and personal connections, which should
be evidenced in both visual and written forms, might include:
• cultural context • formal qualities • function and purpose • materials, conceptual and cultural significance.
When referring to their own artwork and practices, HL students must be sure to identify and
acknowledge their own artworks with the same rigorous attention to detail as with images from other sources.
Sources
Students must cite any source at point of use and include a list of sources used during the study.
Academic honesty
Every image used within the comparative study must be appropriately referenced to
acknowledge the title, artist, medium and date (where this information is known) and the
source, following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school. When HL
students include any images of their own original work, these must also be identified and
acknowledged in the same way. Candidates are required to submit the list of sources that they
used and in-text referencing is required throughout the comparative study.

Formal requirements of the task—SL •
SL students submit 10–15 screens which examine and compare at least three artworks, objects or
artifacts, at least two of which need to be by different artists. The works selected for comparison and
analysis should come from differing cultural contexts.
•
SL students submit a list of sources used.
Formal requirements of the task—HL •
HL students submit 10–15 screens which examine and compare at least three artworks, objects or
artifacts, at least two of which need to be by different artists. The works selected for comparison and
analysis should come from differing cultural contexts.
•
HL students submit 3–5 additional screens which analyse the extent to which their work and practices
have been influenced by the art and artists examined.
•
HL students submit a list of sources used.
Submitting assessment work
The size and format of screens submitted for assessment is not prescribed. Submitted materials are assessed
on screen and students must ensure that their work is clear and legible when presented in a digital, on screen format. Students should not scan multiple pages of work from their journals and submit them as a
single screen, for example, as overcrowded or illegible materials may result in examiners being unable to
interpret and understand the intentions of the work.
The procedure for submitting work for assessment can be found in the Handbook of procedures for the
Diploma Programme. Where submitted materials exceed the prescribed screen limits examiners are
instructed to base their assessment solely on the materials that appear within the limits.

External assessment tasks—SL and HL
Part 2: Process portfolio
Weighting: 40%
Students at SL and HL submit carefully selected materials which demonstrate their experimentation,
exploration, manipulation and refinement of a variety of visual arts activities during the two-year course.
The work, which may be extracted from their visual arts journal and other sketch books, notebooks, folios
and so on, should have led to the creation of both resolved and unresolved works. The selected process
portfolio work should show evidence of their technical accomplishment during the visual arts course and an
understanding of the use of materials, ideas and practices appropriate to visual communication. They should
be carefully selected to match the requirements of the assessment criteria at the highest possible level.
The work selected for submission should show how students have explored and worked with a variety of
techniques, effects and processes in order to extend their art-making skills base. This will include focused,
experimental, developmental, observational, skill-based, reflective, imaginative and creative experiments which may have led to refined outcomes.
Preparation process
In preparation for this task, within the core syllabus students at SL and HL must have had experience of the following.
Visual arts in context
Visual arts methods
Communicating visual arts
Art making practice
Making art through a process of investigation, thinking critically and experimenting with techniques.
Applying identified techniques to their own developing work.
Experimenting with diverse media and explore techniques for making art.
Developing concepts through processes that are informed by skills, techniques and media.
Producing a body of artwork through a process of reflection and evaluation, showing a synthesis of skill, media and concept.
Visual arts journal
Recording their experiences and learning, together with impressions, reflections and any
relevant research that they need to be able to reference, in the visual arts journal.
Students then undertake the process outlined below for assessment.
Task details
Students at SL and HL should:
•
explore and work with a variety of techniques, technologies, effects and processes in order to extend
their skills base, making independent decisions about the choices of media, form and purpose that are appropriate to their intentions •
reflect on their own processes as well as learning about the processes of experimenting, exploring,
manipulating and refining the use of media in a variety of ways •
develop a body of work that evidences investigation, development of ideas and artworks and demonstrates a synthesis of ideas and media.

The role of the teacher
Teachers must ensure that their students are appropriately prepared for the demands of this task through
the careful planning and delivery of the core syllabus activities outlined above. This assessment task must
not be teacher led and students must be made fully aware of the assessment criteria against which their work will be judged.
Teachers are required to meet with students at each stage of inquiry, action and reflection to discuss the
progress made to date, and to verify the authenticity of the coursework being created by each student.
While the student is working on the process portfolio task the teacher should discuss with each student
their experimentation with techniques, effects and processes. It is important that the submitted screens of
the process portfolio are the student’s own choice. Teachers must ensure that students are acknowledging
all sources used and referencing them appropriately. Teachers should also ensure that students have worked
in the correct number of art-making forms, as outlined in the art-making forms table.
Structuring the process portfolio
Students will have pursued their own interests, ideas and strengths, and their submitted work should
highlight the key milestones in this journey. The submission may come from scanned pages, photographs
or digital files. The process portfolio screens may take a variety of forms, such as sketches, images, digital
drawings, photographs or text. While there is no limit to the number of items students may wish to
include on each screen, students should be reminded that overcrowded or illegible materials may result in
examiners being unable to interpret and understand their intentions.
The selected screens should evidence a sustained inquiry into the techniques the student has used for making
art, the way in which they have experimented, explored, manipulated and refined materials, technologies and
techniques and how these have been applied to developing work. Students should show where they have made
independent decisions about the choices of media, form and purpose that are appropriate to their intentions. The
portfolio should communicate their investigation, development of ideas and artworks and evidence a synthesis
of ideas and media. This process will have inevitably resulted in both resolved and unresolved artworks and
candidates should consider their successes and failures as equally valuable learning experiences.
Examiners are looking to reward evidence of the following:
•
sustained experimentation and manipulation of a variety of media and techniques and an ability to
select art-making materials and media appropriate to stated intentions •
sustained working that has been informed by critical investigation of artists, artworks and artistic
genres and evidence of how these have influenced and impacted own practice •
how initial ideas and intentions have been formed and how connections have been made between skills, chosen media and ideas •
how ideas, skills, processes and techniques are reviewed and refined along with reflection on the
acquisition of skills and analysis of development as a visual artist •
how the submitted screens are clearly and coherently presented with competent and consistent use of appropriate subject-specific language.
Using the visual arts journal in this task
All students should use their visual arts journal to carry out their explorations with techniques,
technologies, effects and processes and to record their discoveries. They should chart and reflect on
their experiments with media, their decision-making and formation of artistic intentions. Students will
select, adapt and present what they have recorded in their journal as the basis for material submitted for the process portfolio task.

Submitted work might well include experiments undertaken during (and reflections upon) taster sessions
in particular media, demonstrations of techniques, workshops, master classes, guided experimentation and
studio practice experienced as part of the core syllabus activities outlined above.
Academic honesty
Every image used within the process portfolio must be appropriately referenced to acknowledge the
title, artist, medium and date (where this information is known) and the source, following the protocol
of the referencing style chosen by the school. Students must ensure their own original work is identified
and acknowledged in the same way to ensure examiners are clear about the origins of the materials.
When the student is aware that another person’s work, ideas or images have influenced their conceptual
or developmental work, the source must be cited at point of use and must also be included in a list of
sources. Students should declare when an image in the final version of the work is also used in
part 3: exhibition assessment task.

Formal requirements of the task—SL •
SL students submit 9–18 screens which evidence their sustained experimentation, exploration,
manipulation and refinement of a variety of art-making activities. For SL students the submitted work
must be in at least two art-making forms, each from separate columns of the art-making forms table.
Formal requirements of the task—HL •
HL students submit 13–25 screens which evidence their sustained experimentation, exploration,
manipulation and refinement of a variety of art-making activities. For HL students the submitted work
must have been created in at least three art-making forms, selected from a minimum of two columns of the art-making forms table.
Submitting assessment work
The submitted screens may include resolved works that are also submitted for part 3: exhibition assessment
task, but these must be clearly labelled to identify them as such.
The size and format of screens submitted for assessment is not prescribed. Submitted materials are assessed
on screen and students must ensure that their work is clear and legible when presented in a digital, on screen format. Students should not scan multiple pages of work from their journals and submit them as a
single screen, for example, as overcrowded or illegible materials may result in examiners being unable to
interpret and understand the intentions of the work.
The procedure for submitting work for assessment can be found in the Handbook of procedures for the
Diploma Programme. Where submitted materials exceed the prescribed screen limits examiners are
instructed to base their assessment solely on the materials that appear within the limits.

Internal assessment
Purpose of internal assessment
Internal assessment is an integral part of the visual arts course and is compulsory for both SL and HL students.
Guidance and authenticity
The SL and HL tasks submitted for internal assessment must be the student’s own work. However, it is not
the intention that students should decide upon a title or topic and be left to work on the internal assessment
task without any further support from the teacher. The teacher should play an important role during both
the planning stage and the period when the student is working on the internally assessed work. It is the
responsibility of the teacher to ensure that students are familiar with:
•
the requirements of the type of work to be internally assessed •
the assessment criteria; students must understand that the work submitted for assessment must address these criteria effectively.
Teachers and students must discuss the internally assessed work. Students should be encouraged to initiate
discussions with the teacher to obtain advice and information, and students must not be penalized for
seeking guidance. As part of the learning process, teachers should read and give advice to students on one
draft of the work. The teacher should provide oral or written advice on how the work could be improved,
but must not edit the draft. The next version handed to the teacher must be the final version for submission.
It is the responsibility of teachers to ensure that all students understand the basic meaning and significance
of concepts that relate to academic honesty, especially authenticity and intellectual property. Teachers must
ensure that all student work for assessment is prepared according to the requirements and must explain
clearly to students that the internally assessed work must be entirely their own. Where collaboration between
students is permitted, it must be clear to all students what the difference is between collaboration and
collusion. Teachers should consider that while there is value in working on collaborative projects in the first
year of the course, work submitted for assessment needs to demonstrate how well an individual student has
achieved against the marking criteria and collaborative projects might risk to make this unclear.
All work submitted to the IB for moderation or assessment must be authenticated by a teacher, and must
not include any known instances of suspected or confirmed academic misconduct. Each student must
confirm that the work is his or her authentic work and constitutes the final version of that work. Once a
student has officially submitted the final version of the work it cannot be retracted. The requirement to
confirm the authenticity of work applies to the work of all students, not just the sample work that will be
submitted to the IB for the purpose of moderation.
Authenticity may be checked by discussion with the student on the content of the work, and scrutiny of one or more of the following:
• the student’s initial proposal •
compare the style of the work with work known to be that of the student •
compare the final submission with the first draft of the work
Assessment

=== Page 62 ===
Internal assessment
Visual arts guide 52 •
check the references cited by the student and the original sources •
interview the student in the presence of a third party •
analyse the work using a web-based plagiarism detection service such as www.turnitin.com.
It is the responsibility of supervisors to ensure that all candidates understand the basic meaning and
significance of concepts that relate to academic honesty, especially authenticity and intellectual property.
Supervisors must ensure that all student work for assessment is prepared according to the requirements
and must explain clearly to candidates that any work submitted for assessment must be entirely their own work.
The same piece of work cannot be submitted to meet the requirements of an assessed component and the extended essay.
For further guidance on this issue and the procedures for confirming authenticity please refer to the IB
publication Academic honesty in the Diploma Programme and the relevant articles in the General regulations:
Diploma Programme, as well as the Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Programme.
Time allocation
Internal assessment is an integral part of the visual arts course, contributing 40% to the final assessment in
the SL and the HL courses. This weighting should be reflected in the time that is allocated to teaching the
knowledge, skills and understanding required to undertake the work, as well as the total time allocated to carry out the work. This should include:
•
time for the teacher to explain to students the requirements of the internal assessment •
class time for students to work on the internal assessment component and ask questions •
time for consultation between the teacher and each student •
time to review and monitor progress, and to check authenticity.
Requirements and recommendations
It is important for the integrity of the moderation process that the internal assessment by the teacher
considers and refers to the same evidence as that available to the moderator. Teachers should therefore
always refer to the digital, on-screen version of the submitted work when marking the exhibition.
Using assessment criteria for internal assessment
For internal assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion has
level descriptors describing specific achievement levels, together with an appropriate range of marks. The
level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure to achieve may be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL against the criteria using the level descriptors.
•
The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL students, with some additional criteria for HL only.

=== Page 63 ===
Internal assessment
Visual arts guide 53 •
The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained
by the student, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be
made when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark
awarded should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is
not necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.
•
When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors for each criterion until
they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a
piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the
one that more appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.
•
Where there are two or more marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper marks
if the student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent; the work may be close
to achieving marks in the level above. Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work
demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in the level below.
•
Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.
•
Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying
the appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.
•
The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance and should be achievable by a
student. Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of the work being assessed.
•
A student who attains a high achievement level in relation to one criterion will not necessarily
attain high achievement levels in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a student who attains a low
achievement level for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the other
criteria. Teachers should not assume that the overall assessment of the students will produce any particular distribution of marks.
•
It is strongly recommended that the assessment criteria be made available to students.
Internal assessment details—SL and HL
Part 3: Exhibition
Weighting: 40%
Students at SL and HL submit for assessment a selection of resolved artworks for their exhibition. The
selected pieces should show evidence of their technical accomplishment during the visual arts course
and an understanding of the use of materials, ideas and practices to realize their intentions. Students also
evidence the decision-making process which underpins the selection of this connected and cohesive body
of work for an audience in the form of a curatorial rationale.
During the course students will have learned the skills and techniques necessary to produce their own
independent artwork in a variety of media. In order to prepare for assessment in this component, students
will select the required number of pieces to best match the task requirements and demonstrate their
highest achievement. Students at SL select 4–7 artworks for submission while students at HL select 8–11 artworks for submission.
The final presentation of the work is assessed in the context of the presentation as a whole (including the
accompanying text) by the teacher against the task assessment criteria.

=== Page 64 ===
Internal assessment
Visual arts guide 54
Preparation process
In preparation for this task within the core syllabus students at SL and HL must have had experience of the following.
Visual arts in context
Visual arts methods
Communicating visual arts
Curatorial practice
Developing an informed response to work and exhibitions they have seen and experienced.
Beginning to formulate personal intentions for creating and displaying their own artworks.
Evaluating how their ongoing work communicates meaning and purpose.
Considering the nature of “exhibition” and thinking about the process of selection and the potential impact of their work on different audiences.
Selecting and presenting resolved works for exhibition. Explaining the ways in which the works are connected.
Discussing how artistic judgments impact the overall presentation.
Visual arts journal
Recording their experiences and learning, together with impressions, reflections and any
relevant research that they need to be able to reference, in the visual arts journal.
Students then undertake the process outlined below for assessment.
Task details
For the exhibition task students at SL and HL should select and present their own original resolved artworks which best evidences:
• technical competence •
appropriate use of materials, techniques, processes •
resolution, communicating the stated intentions of the pieces • cohesiveness • breadth and depth •
consideration for the overall experience of the viewer (through exhibition, display or presentation).
Students will be assessed on their technical accomplishment, the conceptual strength of their work and the
resolution of their stated intentions. To support their selected resolved artworks, students at SL and HL must
also submit:
•
exhibition text which states the title, medium, size and a brief outline of the original intentions of each selected artwork •
two photographs of their overall exhibition. While the photographs will not be used to assess
individual artworks, they may give the moderator insight into how a student has considered the overall
experience of the viewer in their exhibition. Only the selected artworks submitted for assessment should appear in the exhibition photographs.
Students at SL must also develop a curatorial rationale which accompanies their original artworks (400
words maximum). This rationale explains the intentions of the student and how they have considered the
presentation of work using curatorial methodologies

=== Page 65 ===
Internal assessment
Visual arts guide 55
Students at HL must also develop a curatorial rationale which accompanies their original artworks (700
words maximum). This rationale explains the intentions of the student and how they have considered the
presentation of work using curatorial methodologies, as well as considering the potential relationship between the artworks and the viewer.
Using the visual arts journal in this task
All students should use their visual arts journal to record their intentions for their original artworks
and to reflect on the process of resolving them. Students will select, adapt and present what they
have recorded in their journal as the basis for material submitted for the curatorial rationale. Students
could also use their visual arts journal to plan their exhibitions, using floor plans of available spaces
to decide which artworks they will display where. They might consider where the audience will enter
from and how they might order the works. Students may wish to consider what relationships need to
be established between works and their placement within the exhibition, along with consideration of
the exhibition environment and factors which may affect the way in which their work is experienced.
Structuring the exhibition
It is expected that work developed for the exhibition will overlap or have grown from initial or in-depth
investigations within part 1: comparative study and part 2: process portfolio.
Work developed for the exhibition will have been carefully supported and facilitated by both teacher directed learning activities and independent studies by the student. In preparing for this task students will
need to have engaged with a variety of skills, techniques and processes that will have enabled them to
manipulate materials, media, techniques and processes in order to discover strengths and work towards technical excellence.
Art-making forms
Having worked within a range of art-making forms for part 2: process portfolio, students at both SL and
HL may submit work created in any preferred art-making form for part 3: exhibition. The submitted pieces
must be selected by the student from their total body of resolved works and should represent their most
successful achievements against the assessment criteria. They should be presented in a manner suitable for an audience.
Exhibition text (500 characters maximum per artwork)
Each submitted artwork should be supported by exhibition text which outlines the title, medium and size
of the artwork. The exhibition text should also include a brief outline of the original intentions of the work
(500 characters maximum per artwork). The exhibition text must contain reference to any sources which
have influenced the individual piece. Students should indicate if objects are self-made, found or purchased
within the “medium” section of the exhibition text, where applicable. Where students are deliberately
appropriating another artist’s image as a valid part of their art-making intentions, the exhibition text must acknowledge the source of the original image.
Collective pieces
Students are required to submit individual artworks for assessment. Where students wish to submit portions
of work in the form of one collective piece (such as diptych, triptych, polyptych or series), this must be
clearly stated as part of the title of the submitted piece in the exhibition text, presented in parentheses. For
example: Title of the piece (diptych). The requirements for capturing and submitting collective pieces is the
same as with other standard submissions, however students deciding to submit collective pieces need to be
aware that there is a compromise in the size an image can be viewed when submitted as part of a collective
piece which may prevent examiners from taking details that cannot be seen into account. Collective pieces

=== Page 66 ===
Internal assessment
Visual arts guide 56
that are presented without the appropriate exhibition text will be considered as distinct artworks and could
lead to a student exceeding the maximum number of pieces.
The role of the teacher
Teachers must ensure that their students are appropriately prepared for the demands of this task through
the careful planning and delivery of the core syllabus activities outlined above. This assessment task must
not be teacher led and students must be made fully aware of the assessment criteria against which their work will be judged.
Teachers are required to meet with students at each stage of inquiry, action and reflection to discuss the
progress made to date, and to verify the authenticity of the coursework being created by each student. The
key outcomes of these one-to-one interactions, which might be formal meetings and/or informal discussions
in the classroom, must be summarized by the teacher on the DP visual arts Coursework authentication form
(6/VACAF), which is submitted to the IB as part of the upload of external assessment material. This form can be found on the visual arts page of the OCC.
While the student is working on the assessment task the teacher should discuss each student’s choice of
selected artworks for submission. It is important that the selected pieces are the student’s own choice. The
teacher should encourage the students to review the digital documentation of their artwork and advise
them about the best ways to obtain an accurate and true representation of their work.
Teachers should read and give advice to students on one draft of the supporting documents. The teacher
should provide oral or written advice on how the supporting documents could be improved, but should not
edit them. The next version handed to the teacher must be the final version for submission. Teachers should
also ensure that students accurately complete and submit the exhibition text for each of their submitted pieces.
Structuring the curatorial rationale
The curatorial rationale requires SL and HL students to explain why specific artworks have been chosen
and presented in a particular format. It provides students with an opportunity to explain any challenges,
triumphs, innovations or issues that have impacted upon the selection and presentation of the artworks.
Students should use the curatorial rationale to explain the context in which particular artworks were made
and presented in order to connect the work with the viewer. In addition to this, students at HL should also
explain how the arrangement and presentation of artworks contributes to the audience’s ability to interpret
and understand the intentions and meanings within the artworks exhibited.
Academic honesty
Artworks presented for assessment will have been made or constructed by the student. For instance,
a piece of fashion design cannot be presented for assessment in realized form if the student did not
create it themselves. Where the student has not created the realized piece themselves, they would
still be able to submit the design of the piece as an artwork for assessment in the exhibition, but the
realized piece cannot be included. Where a student has taken found objects and created art with
them this is considered as constructed by the student. Students should identify if objects are self made, found or purchased under the “medium” section when compiling the exhibition text for each
of their submitted pieces. When the student is aware that another person’s work, ideas or images have
influenced their selected pieces for exhibition the source must be acknowledged within the exhibition
text or in the curatorial rationale, following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the
school. In-text referencing is required for sources used to write the curatorial rationale.

SL students may find the following questions helpful when approaching this task. This structure is for
guidance only and is neither prescriptive nor restrictive.
•
What are you hoping to achieve by presenting this body of work? What impact will this body of work
have on your audience? What are the concepts and understandings you initially intend to convey?
•
How have particular issues, motifs or ideas been explored, or particular materials or techniques used?
•
What themes can be identified in the work, or what experiences have influenced it?
•
How does the way you have exhibited your artwork contribute to the meanings you are trying to convey to an audience?
HL students may find the following questions helpful when approaching this task. This structure is for
guidance only and is neither prescriptive nor restrictive.
•
What is the vision for presenting this body of work?
•
How have particular issues, motifs or ideas been explored, or particular materials or techniques used?
•
What themes can be identified in the work, or what experiences have influenced it?
•
How does the way you have exhibited your artwork contribute to the meanings you are trying to convey to an audience?
•
What strategies did you use to develop a relationship between the artwork and the viewer, for example, visual impact?
•
How does the way you have arranged and presented your artworks support the relationship and connection between the artworks presented?
•
What do you intend your audience to feel, think, experience, understand, see, learn, consider from the work you have selected for exhibition?
Formal requirements of the task—SL •
SL students submit a curatorial rationale that does not exceed 400 words.
•
SL students submit 4–7 artworks.
•
SL students submit exhibition text (stating the title, medium, and size of the artwork as well as an
outline of intentions and/or reference to sources of inspiration) for each selected artwork.
•
SL students submit two exhibition photographs: only the selected artworks submitted for assessment should appear in the exhibition photographs.
Formal requirements of the task—HL •
HL students submit a curatorial rationale that does not exceed 700 words.
•
HL students submit 8–11 artworks.
•
HL students submit exhibition text (stating the title, medium and size of the artwork as well as an outline
of intentions and/or reference to sources of inspiration) for each selected artwork.
•
HL students submit two exhibition photographs: only the selected artworks submitted for assessment should appear in the exhibition photographs.
The exhibition photographs provide an understanding of the context of the exhibition and the size and
scope of the works. While the photographs will not be used to assess individual artworks, they may give the
moderator insight into how a student has considered the overall experience of the viewer in their exhibition.

=== Page 68 ===
Internal assessment
Visual arts guide 58
Submitting assessment work
Students may choose to capture and submit individual artworks for assessment in a variety of ways,
depending on the nature of the artwork and the resources available. The work should ideally be captured
in whatever electronic means is most appropriate for the selected art-making form. A two-dimensional
artwork, for example, might be best captured through a still photograph, while a three-dimensional artwork
might be best captured through a short video recording. Lens-based, electronic or screen-based artwork
such as animation, however, might call for more unusual file types. Please note that time-based submissions
such as these are limited to a maximum duration of five minutes. Clarification on the acceptable file types for
capturing the assessment materials can be found in the Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Programme.
Additional supporting photographs
Whatever the chosen means of capturing each individual artwork, students are permitted to submit
up to two additional photographs in support of each submitted artwork. These additional supporting
photographs or screenshots are intended to enable students to provide an enhanced sense of scale or
specific detail to the submitted artwork. These additional photographs are optional. This option should
be used only when candidates find that one image is insufficient and more photographs are needed
to document a single artwork. In the majority of cases this should not be necessary. Photographs of
2D objects should be taken prior to any mounting or framing. Clarification on how to submit the
supporting photographs and the accepted file types can be found in the Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Programme.
The procedure for submitting work for assessment can be found in the Handbook of procedures for the
Diploma Programme. Where submitted materials exceed the prescribed limits examiners are instructed to
base their assessment solely on the materials that appear within the limits.
