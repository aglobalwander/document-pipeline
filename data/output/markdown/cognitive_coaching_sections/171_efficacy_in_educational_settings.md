## Efficacy in Educational Settings

To act with confidence, meet challenges, and cope with situations that are new to them, teachers must feel that they are competent to control these situations-to overcome difficulties, become familiar with the new and the unknown, and approach these with the expectation they will master them (Feuerstein, Feuerstein, and Falik 2010, 80). Such teachers:

- Have an internal locus of control
- Operationalize concepts and translate them into deliberate actions
- Pose problems
- Make causal links
- Produce new knowledge
- As continuous learners, establish feedback spirals and continue to learn how to learn seeking to modify themselves through feedback (Bandura 1982)
- Are optimistic and resourceful-self-actualizing and self-modifying
- Implement curriculum in collegial environments and translate concepts into action

Consider the state of mind of efficacy in the following example. Schools A and B serve low-income, minority children. Teachers in each school have similar years of teaching and academic preparation. Both work in old buildings with the same instructional materials. School A's teachers share a growth mind-set, are collaborative, visionary, and upbeat. School B's teachers share a fixed mind-set, believing that intelligence is fixed and cannot be modified. They are frustrated and stressed from the standards and evaluative measures being imposed upon them. They believe

that if their textbooks matched their curriculum, if parents would be more supportive, and if students were better motivated, reading achievement would be higher. In School A, most teachers feel confident in their knowledge about reading and believe that if they work hard enough-and smart enough-students will learn. Test scores at each school reflect teachers' beliefs.

School A's teachers have personal efficacy (the belief that they have the knowledge and skills to teach reading) and outcome efficacy (the conviction that when they use their teaching skills, students achieve). Teachers in School B have low efficacy and, as a result, are more prone to blame others for poor student achievement. They also feel more stress and are less positive about teaching (Hoy, Tarter, and Woolfolk Hoy 2006).
