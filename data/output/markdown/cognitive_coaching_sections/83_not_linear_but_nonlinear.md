## NOT LINEAR BUT NONLINEAR

Dilts presented the elements of identity, beliefs, values, capabilities, behavior, and environment as a hierarchal model with a cascading effect. In his early work, he arranged them in ladder form with elements higher on the ladder informing the lower regions. Identity rests on the top, informing beliefs and values that in turn inform capabilities and so on. Others have conceptualized these not as a ladder but as a set of nested building blocks, as shown in figure 2.1, with identity the largest holding all the other elements.

In our current practices, we are finding it useful to regard Dilts's model not as a hierarchal, linear map that assumes clocklike operation in which the same inputs will consistently produce the same result. Rather, we are seeing it as describing a complex system made of many moving parts operating within environmental systems that are constantly changing. Complex systems (also called dynamical systems) are those in which everything affects everything else, tiny inputs cause major disturbances,

more data are not a greater predicator of results, and both things and energy matter. Larry Cuban (2010) likens complex systems to raising a child or getting children to succeed in school. Complicated systems, he says, have many interacting parts, like the engine in your car, but use linear logic to operate and repair. Figure 2.2 shows the Dilts elements as conceptualized by Garmston as operating within a dynamical system.

In Garmston's view (figure 2.3) of the elements of learning, we see the elements as dynamical in which everything affects everything else. Yet there are two dominant players within this system. Identity, we believe, is the major influence on all the elements within the system, informing beliefs, values, capabilities, and behavior. Next, environment can modify the expressions of identity. To show this idea, we have placed environment as the surround and note that one's environment has a modifying effect on the expression of beliefs, values, capabilities, and behaviors. Changing the environment-say, from one in which mediation is a primary leadership activity to one in which command and control is more common-modifies not only behaviors but also the potential for learning.

This view of ways in which elements of learning most likely interact with one another is less authentic than the earlier image but more like a collage of photographs in figure 2.3. Garmston attempts to mechanically represent the ways in which the different elements interact. Again, identity, shown at the left, is characterized as the primary actor providing direct influence on beliefs and values. This is consistent with the observations by countless Cognitive Coaches to be the case as they assume identities as mediators. When this occurs, beliefs about ways of being helpful to another inevitably shift from advising, recommending, or telling to attentively listening, supporting the other in attaining goal clarity and coaching. Values, capabilities, and behaviors shift.

Figures 2.2 and 2.3 display the elements as being relational, existing within a dynamical system in which everything affects everything else. In these views, affecting identity still fosters the greatest change within the individual as it promotes dramatic effects at all the other parts of the system.

Consistent with the Cognitive Coaching goal of being self-directed, one can self-coach oneself into a temporary identity perspective. In one example, an administrator revealed to us that he was distressed at his own committee behaviors as being egocentric, defensive, and argumentative. He resolved to improve this at a subsequent meeting and searched for a strategy to release him from these behaviors. He hit upon the notion of assuming an identity as a student and found he could easily be more responsive to the ideas of others, put his own ideas on the table as 'wonderings,' and thereby become more interdependent and effective.
