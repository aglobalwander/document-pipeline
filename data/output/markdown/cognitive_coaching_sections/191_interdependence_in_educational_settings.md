## Interdependence in Educational Settings

Interdependence is an essential state of mind for modern schools. For example, Rosenholtz (1989), in her study of elementary schools in Tennessee, found that the single most important characteristic of successful schools was goal consensus. Saphier, Haley-Spica, and Gower (2008) of Research for Better Teaching report that the issue of good schools is so simple that it's embarrassing: In good schools, people have common goals, and they work together toward those goals.

Interdependence modifies working relationships. Sarason (1991) suggests that among the most complex tasks humans undertake is recognizing and trying to change power relationships. Sarason believes this is especially true in complicated traditional institutions. The schoolimprovement agenda of the new millennium is moving all educators into more interactive and professional roles. So from the perspective of what's good for schools as well as the perspective of what's good for individuals within the schools, we find that interdependence is a rich and essential resource.

There is great educational value in sharing our emotional and cognitive/mental treasury of behaviors. In some large schools and institutions, however, several hundred, or even thousand, adults and children can spend time in the same building in the closest of physical proximity and not know one another or greet one another when they meet by chance. Interdependent teachers

- Know that they will benefit from working collaboratively
- Are altruistic and willing to change relationships to benefit the larger good
- Value consensus, while being able to hold their own values and actions in abeyance
- Lend their energies and resources to the achievement of group goals
- Contribute to a common good
- Seek collegiality
- Draw on the resources of others
- Regard conflict as valuable and manage group differences in productive ways
- Seek collaborative engagement, knowing that we are more effective together than individually
