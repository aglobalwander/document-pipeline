## WHAT and WHY?

5th Meeting Standard

2 types of conflict -- cognitive and affective

1 -- meetings productive

1 -- meetings unproductive

Cognitive conflict -&gt; disagreements among group members about substantive issues like goals , values , assumptions .

productive tensions tend to improve team effectiveness

Why: Meetings safe -not necessarily comfortable . Always comfortablenot talking about right things .

Encouraging cognitive conflict supports group focus , creativity , communication , and decision-making .

## HOW?

Reading

ENGAGE COGNITIVE CONFLICT

LG, p. 94-95

ENGAGE COGNITIVE CONFLICT

## WHAT?

One of the 5 Meeting Standards. Cognitive Conflict is disagreements among group members about substantive issues like goals, values, and assumptions.

## WHY?

Recognizing productive tensions tend to improve team effectiveness.

HOW?

Read directions on the screen.

## Suggested Language:

The fifth meeting standard is Engage Cognitive Conflict. We're differentiating between two kinds of conflict: cognitive and affective. One makes meetings productive; one makes meetings unproductive.

On pp. 76-77, you'll see descriptions of the two kinds of conflict.

Designate A &amp; B with your partner.

## GRID

## WHAT?

A 'hot' strategy for engaging cognitive conflict: Disagreement Grid

## WHY?

When we anticipate conflict or affective conflict arrives in a group, we need to be prepared to embrace it.

## HOW?

## Suggested Language

I'm going to teach you this strategy as I would teach it to a group at the beginning of a meeting where I was anticipating conflict.

Show slide or draw on chart 4 X 4 grid. (If drawing, ask participants to assume that each square is equal in dimension to the other squares.)

Ask participants, ' How many squares do you see?'

As each number is offered, write it on a chart without comment.

OPTIONAL: After several numbers are recorded, stop and ask people who saw different

## LG, p. 96 WHAT?

Phrases to use to engage cognitive conflict

## WHY?

To have a variety of ways to engage cognitive conflict.

When encouraging cognitive conflict, group members use such stems of connection to promote psychological safety and to create connectivity and integration among ideas and group members.

Allows for the expression of diverse and divergent ideas

## HOW?

## Suggested Language:

When encouraging cognitive conflict, group members use such stems of connection to promote psychological safety and to create connectivity and integration among ideas and group members. This also allows for the expression of diverse and divergent ideas. In order to keep the connection between the speakers and the ideas, pausing, paraphrasing, and sometimes posing questions are necessary before using a stem of connection.

Trainer may verbally review the points made in the What? and Why? of Engage Cognitive Conflict above.

Pairs read/practice stems of connection in Learning Guide and select one that might work for them. Also, Pairs can share which Stems might be useful in an upcoming meeting. Trainer can model use of Stems of Connection with a participant.

How do you know someone is in Affective Conflict Raised voice, shutting down, push back, nonverbals

Skill going to use first?  Default behavior always to paraphrase-is answer to everything. Why paraphrase is default?  What is intention of paraphrase?  to show understanding.

Can't say don't be mad…too late.  Not ask question, can't hear question.

Give value paraphrase.  'What's important to you is…' non-judgment, presume positive intentions

'What's being stepped on for you is…'

Gotta get good at it.  De-escalate emotion.

Name 3 strategies:

Paraphrasing-doesn't count, is your default behavior

Yellow light

## WHAT?

Metaphor for importance of conflict

## WHY?

without cognitive conflict , no true community

## HOW?

community as coin --&gt; look at two sides Scott Peck calls ' pseudo-community ' --&gt;

play nice COIN OF COMMUNITY

WHAT?

Metaphor for the importance of conflict

## WHY?

To reinforce the idea that without conflict, there is no community.

## HOW?

Show slide.

## Suggested Language

If we think of community as a coin and look at the two sides, we'll see that one side is collaboration and the other is conflict. So without conflict, we cannot have true community. We will have what Scott Peck calls 'pseudo-community' in which people play nice. To attain true community, we have to engage cognitive conflict.

Given our exploration this morning, how has what you have explored, clarified the coin of community for you?

## WHY?

David Perkins (Smart Schools, 1992) meeting room features --&gt; very presence mediate thinking and behaviors

## WHAT?

Design the Surround is a Structure for Successful Meetings. It is about the physical arrangement of the meeting room to support the group's purposes and tasks. This includes the seating arrangements, placement of visuals, and creating the emotional climate for productive group work.

## WHY?

David Perkins, in his book Smart Schools (1992), describes the surround as the meeting room features which by their very presence mediate thinking and behaviors.

## HOW?

Using slide, cross stitch back to STRUCTURES FOR SUCCESSFUL MEETINGS

## Offer examples

## Space

facilitator -- greatest control over physical arrangements in meeting room workspace structures --&gt; desired interaction

comfortable accommodate collaboration -- participants, charts, physical movement, and subgrouping.

## Seating

see / hear each other

spacious to meet the group's needs , but no larger

too large &amp; empty chairs --&gt; ' leaks energy ' --&gt; cohesive conversations are more difficult

## Charting --&gt; learning / retention

group memory / graphic processes becomes visual voice --&gt; always in room --influences thinking .

## Emotional Space

space holds emotion contaminated --&gt; experiences evoke negative emotions

Degree of Structure needed to complete tasks effectively

## Factors :

- 1. group development --more novice --&gt; more structured processes
- 2. group diversity
- 3. potentially controversial topics
- 4. group fatigue , etc.

## HOW?

Presenter briefly comments on selected principles of Design the Surround, after participants share what they notice.

## Suggested Language:

Space: Although psychological, emotional and cognitive elements significantly contribute to the surroundings, the facilitator has the greatest control over the physical arrangements in the meeting room. The work space communicates and structures the desired interaction. The work space should comfortably accommodate collaborative participants, charts, physical movement, and subgrouping.

Seating

: All participants and facilitator need to be able to see and hear each other. Seating arrangements should be spacious enough to meet the group's needs, but no larger. When

## Multi-step strategy for actualizing meeting success structures and standards

## TRAINERS NOTE:

It is recommended that this strategy be modeled by the trainers and that the video be purchased and used as a resource for the group. You may choose to do the model as a Fishbowl or with the whole group.

## WHAT?

The Focusing Four is a prioritizing strategy; a discussion tool for getting consensus in a brief amount of time, resulting in all voices being heard and respected in decision-making strategies.

## WHY?

The more successful groups are at getting important work done in meetings, the greater their collective efficacy, a can-do sense that is undeniably linked to student success.

## HOW?

## Suggested Language

The Focusing Four is a prioritizing strategy; a discussion tool for getting consensus in a brief amount of time, resulting in all voices being heard and respected in decision-making strategies It is usually preceded by dialogue. Facilitators working with groups require a repertoire of strategies ranging from low structure to high structure, depending upon the task and/or nature of the group. The Focusing Four is a highly structured strategy. Decisions by 100 percent consensus are rare. Focusing Four operates on the principle of 'sufficient consensus' (introduced on Day 3) in which every member doesn't need to be in agreement for a decision to be reached but rather a critical mass, such as 75 to 80 percent is achieved. With sufficient consensus each person's views are expressed and understood by the group.

Focusing Four is another multi-step strategy (as Assumptions Wall) for actualizing the structures for successful meetings.

Prime the pump. Quiet reflection on what was most valuable to you and record.

Demonstrate with a group. You may choose to conduct the model with the whole group or a fishbowl group of about 10 participants (e.g., ask for one volunteer per table to come to the front for the demonstration).

## Suggested Language:

We're going to model this strategy, as well as model for you the role of facilitator and recorder. Also you will see many of the standards used that you learned about on Day 3. For those of you observing, please pair up and designate one person who will watch the facilitator and one person who will watch the recorder.

Conduct demonstration/model, beginning with PAG/PAU, then TAG/TAU.

Suggested topic: Of all the tools, concepts, and strategies addressed in this four day training, which will be the most valuable to take back and develop with your work groups?
