## 10. Constructivists Invite Metacognition

Constructivist teachers invite students to think about their thinking. Time is taken to monitor and discuss thinking skills and problem-solving processes. They are invited to share their metacognition-to reveal their

intentions, strategies, and plans for solving a problem; to describe their mental maps for monitoring their strategy during the problem-solving; and to reflect on the strategy to determine its adequacy (Costa and Kallick 2008, 23-25).
