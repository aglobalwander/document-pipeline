'when you can, where you can, what you can'\n\nBrief inclusion strategy:  As I work to sustain this work, generate one word-who will you be?\n\nWrite it down.  Don't share yet.\n\nWELCOME\n\nTHE TRAINERS NOTES ARE IN REGULAR TYPE. SUGGESTED LANGUAGE THE TRAINER SAYS TO THE GROUP IS PROVIDED IN ITALICS. TRAINERS NOTE:\n\nTHE IMAGES USED IN THESE POWERPOINTS HAVE BEEN PURCHASED BY THINKING COLLABORATIVE TO PROVIDE AUTHORIZED TRAINERS THE RIGHT TO USE THESE IMAGES ROYALTY FREE.  IF TRAINERS WISH TO USE THESE IMAGES FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES, TRAINERS WILL NEED TO PURCHASE THE IMAGES PERSONALLY TO PROVIDE THE TRAINERS' RIGHT TO USE THEM OUTSIDE THINKING COLLABORATIVE.\n\nWHAT? Continuing exploration of the Five Meeting Standards and the structure of Design the Surround. Organizing, integrating, and prioritizing seminar content. WHY?\n\nThis supports participants in applying research-based, best practices in meetings and in transferring knowledge, skills, and strategies to work sites in ways that develop and sustain collaborative communities.\n\nHOW? Suggested Language: Today's work is about continuing exploration of the Five Meeting Standards-which includes a focus on strategies and structures that support using conflict as a resource. It's also about paying attention to the environment in which we hold our meetings. We will reflect on all of the content in this four-day seminar and prioritizing application with your work groups in ways that support building and sustaining collaborative communities. As you scan the surround of this room there is a tremendous amount of content. You will be making decisions about how to decide where to best begin for your staff/ work groups.\n\nToday -last day, moving forward -&gt; momentum Meetings -&gt;in context of 5 meeting standards\n\nResearchersDoyle and Strauss 100s of meetings -when adults held to 5 meeting standards\n\nProductive -most done , shortest amount of time with greatest group satisfaction\n\nBanner-&gt; Enter work through meeting standards\n\nand moving forward!\n\n## FOUR DAY OVERVIEW:\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nDay 1 - Entering the Territory-Research base on effective professional communities learning; focus areas of the Adaptive Schools work\n\nDay 2 - Developing Identity and Capacity-The how-to, nuts and bolts of building effective collaborative groups\n\nDay 3 - Transforming Meetings-The best practices of meetings\n\nDay 4 -Sustaining Community-Continuing the work with effective meetings with a focus on engaging cognitive conflict, then planning to transfer learning from the workshop to the workplace\n\n## Inclusion\n\nGround people in\n\nspace nonconfrontive way\n\nbring everyone present\n\nbuild community\n\nvoices heard in\n\nset norm of participation -says this will be interactive\n\n## STIR THE CLASSROOM OPTION #2\n\n## WHAT?\n\nInclusion, Homework review\n\n## WHY?\n\nHave participants process reading assignment on the Meeting Standards. To go from theoretical to concrete by applying Meeting Standards to real team situations.\n\n## HOW?\n\nOrganize large group into small groups of 4 arranged in a circle around the room. Number off in each small group.\n\nDo several rounds of the following: Give small groups a question to talk about. At the end of a few minutes, draw a playing card with a number on it. The person whose number corresponds to the number drawn rotates clockwise to the next small group and shares the previous group's dialogue. After another few minutes, give another question and continue the process.\n\nAt the end of a few minutes, draw a playing card with a number on it. The person whose number corresponds to the number drawn rotates clockwise to the next small group and shares the previous group's dialogue. After another few minutes, give another question and continue the process.\n\nSelect 3 of the question slides to conduct the Stir the Classroom based on the needs of the participants.\n\nAt the end of a few minutes, draw a playing card with a number on it. The person whose number corresponds to the number drawn rotates clockwise to the next small group and shares the previous group's dialogue. After another few minutes, give another question and continue the process.\n\nAt the end of a few minutes, draw a playing card with a number on it.

After another few minutes, give another question and continue the process.\n\n## 1-Will continue with structures\n\n- 1-decide on decision-making (yesterday)\n- 2-develop standards (5 standards-most work done, least amount of time, greatest satisfaction)\n- 3-design the surround\n- 2-continue with tools for decision-making\n- 3-will study Focusing Four with dual purpose-learn how to facilitate focusing four and to determine next steps\n\n## OUTCOMES, LG p. 79\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nOutcomes for today are:\n\nHave each one appear on screen and pause for reading after each.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nPlease turn to an elbow partner and share which outcome is most meaningful for your work.\n\n- 2-will study 5 meeting standards (reading from last night)\n- 3-creating environment for greatest safety / greatest learning\n- 4-structure for discussion -&gt; reaching consensus (general agreement)\n- 5-'now what' with strategies. What to implement?\n\nWhich interests you most (outcomes and agenda)\n\nElbow partner and share-&gt;greatest importance for you and why.\n\nWhen you can, where you can, what you can. Don't underestimate what 'little' things have done. May be that 1 degree that changes things. Change your life-&gt;somebody else's life Not know what fires you are starting\n\nTiny events create major disturbances. Everything influences everything else. Both things and energy matter.\n\n## AGENDA\n\nDescribe agenda, purposes of items and how they relate. Indicate lunch and break times.\n\n## CLOCK PARTNERS LG, p. 14 WHAT?\n\nA new set of learning partners - clock partners - a strategy for grouping.\n\n## WHY?\n\nGive participants an opportunity to connect with others in the room and create energy through movement\n\nSuggested Language : On day 3 you established a clock partner for 12, 3, 6, and 9. You will be looking for your 9:00 partner.\n\nWhat:  Develop Standards\n\n## Why\n\nMichael Doyle and David Strauss , How to Make Meetings Work filmed and analyzed hundreds of hours of meetings Highly effective groups -High productivity , minimum amount of time , high group member satisfaction\n\n## -&gt; USED 5 standards as organizing principles\n\nUsed by successful parent groups, Girl Scouts, etc.\n\nUpdated one standard to be consistent with recent research on conflict.\n\n## STRUCTURES FOR SUCCESSFUL MEETINGS\n\nLG, pp. 81-85 WHAT?\n\nStructures for Successful Meetings\n\n## WHY?\n\nReconnect with Structures and Standards. Like 'Station Naming' with the agenda, this slide visually orients participants to where they've been and where they are going next. It places 'Meeting Standards' within the larger frame of 'Structures from Successful\n\nMeetings.'\n\n## HOW?\n\nBriefly remind participants where the standards are located within the Structures for Successful Meetings.\n\nLG, p. 86\n\nHOW? Suggested Language: We will begin with Use One Process at a Time.\n\n## Structures for Successful Meetings, Use One Process at a Time, p. 86\n\n## Strategy:\n\n- \u00b7 PAG/PAU - Process As Given, Process As Understood\n\n## Facilitator's Moves:\n\n- \u00b7 Attention First\n- \u00b7 Credible Voice\n- \u00b7 Visual Paragraph\n- \u00b7 Frozen Gesture\n- \u00b7 Approachable Voice\n\n'2025 Adaptive Schools Seminars\n\nTake GOOD notes on pp. 84-85 will need them later\n\nWHY: Often violated and major time waster in meetings .\n\n## Always give WHAT WHY HOW , ,\n\nJust because give process , doesn't mean understood .\n\n## Moves\n\nsingle act several moves --&gt; strategy\n\n## PAG/PAU might use these 'moves'\n\nFrozen Body/Gesture\n\nCredible Voice verbalization\n\nVisual Paragraph\n\nApproachable Voice\n\nTransition statement\n\n## How\n\n## Strategies/moves include:\n\nAttention first -- credible voice, call for attention.\n\nTeachers talking over students.  Be still, eye contact-Show me your eyes.\n\nAttention -&gt; break eye contact, breathe , new space approachable , voice, next direction\n\nCredible voice -Factual , believable , true Looks like this ... Punctuates down . Wrong voice (model) hard to listen to, too.\n\n## WHAT?\n\nStructures for Successful Meetings\n\n## WHY?\n\nBig picture slide to re-acclimate the participants to the part to whole relationship of the various standards of the second structure:  Develop Standards.\n\n## Suggested Language :\n\nYou will now focus on the second standard, 'Address One Topic at a Time.'\n\n## Structures for Successful Meetings,\n\nAddress One Topic at a Time, p. 86\n\nStrategies:\n\n- \u00b7 TAG/TAU - Topic As Given, Topic As Understood\n\n'2025 Adaptive Schools Seminars\n\n## Take GOOD notes on p. 86-87\n\nMEETING STANDARD #2: ONE TOPIC (AT A TIME) What &amp; WhyLike #1, violation is major time waster / source of frustration .\n\n## How\n\n## Strategies include:\n\nTAG/TAU -Exact same as PAG-PAU\n\nPublic agenda -we are here . Focus on 1 topic at a time\n\nOPTIONAL HOW?\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nAs you watch this short clip with your partner, notice the verbals, non-verbals, and sequencing used by Bob Garmston.\n\nTake notes on p. 86-87\n\nWhat is sequence of visual paragraph ?\n\nModel:  It is recommended that trainers use the model done by Bob Garmston on The Focusing Four DVD ('Highlighted Strategies'), which takes a total of four minutes. Trainers may opt to offer their own model.\n\nPairs:  'Observe Dr. Garmston demonstrating PAG/PAU. Partner A notes the verbal moves, and Partner B notes the non-verbal moves he makes.'\n\n.\n\nWhat &amp; Why-Like #1, violated --&gt; major time waster / source of frustration\n\nHow-Strategies include:\n\n1-TAG/TAU- same as PAG-PAU\n\nPublic agenda-Share personal focus for today\n\n-use as 3rd point.  we are here.\n\nfocus on 1 topic at a time\n\nClassroom: Give topic-today we will be constructing deeper understanding of democracy That means:  understand what is, spend some time talking about original thinking of writers of constitution / connections with today's definition Explain to partner OR what questions...\n\n## 2-Relevancy Check\n\nAgenda topic: ordering new books-'We need to clean out closet.'\n\n'What connections you are making between that and our topic?' 'Before order, have to clean out closet and inventory.'\n\nPresumes positive intentions.\n\nIf not relevant, can hold onto it until later.\n\n3-Caping (Parking Lot)-matador cape. Can use with Relevancy Check\n\nTo hold related issues that emerge\n\nParking Lot been abused-has become way to shut people up.  Remember to respond to items later (48 hours).\n\nCluster items-&gt;next agenda.  Too many-need to talk, need time\n\nKeep chart away from official recording charts\n\n4-Stop and Redirect-(credible voice) 'Please hold on to that idea. We will come back to it in a moment.'\n\nWhen in doubt, strip pronouns out! (NEUTRALIZE your facilitation)\n\nSay the task is, the work is, the protocol will be, or the first step will be.\n\n## MEETING STRUCTURES AND MEETING STANDARDS\n\nLG, p. 90\n\n## WHAT?\n\nBig Picture of Meeting Structures and Meeting Standards\n\n## WHY?\n\nHelps participants, especially big picture participants, put part to whole relationships together\n\nAnchors participants in the next standard - Balance Participation\n\nSpace for notes, p. 88\n\nKnow, New, Next\n\nin meeting what to do when someone holds group hostage?\n\nStructures / strategies won't allow that\n\nWith big talkers, even the most heroic member can lose interest, become passive Need to keep everyone engaged and thoughtfully productive\n\nBalance participation does not mean everyone talks same amount instead has opportunities for all to participate\n\nNeed to offer information with engagement with concepts\n\ntake notes, p. 88\n\nKnow, New, Next\n\nin meeting what to do when someone holds group hostage?\n\nStructures / strategies won't allow that\n\nWith big talkers, even the most heroic member can lose interest, become passive Need to keep everyone engaged and thoughtfully productive\n\nBalance participation does not mean everyone talks same amount instead has opportunities for all to participate\n\nNeed to offer information with engagement with concepts\n\nExamples: partner report, first turn last turn, corners, read and cross teach, 30-second summary, stop redirect, satisfy satisfy delay, relevancy check, journal\n\n## equity maps\n\nWHAT? Strategies to Balance Participation: Strategy Harvest WHY?\n\nStrategy Harvest itself is structured to Balance Participation\n\nStrategy Harvest offers a review of other strategies they have experienced that Balance Participation.\n\nAn intention also is to support you in expanding your toolkit.\n\nHOW?\n\nGive directions from slide.\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nAfter giving directions from the slide--\n\nAs you and your partner review the strategies, if there are any strategies neither of you remembers, raise your hand and a trainer will answer your questions.\n\nSo please find your eye contact partner and begin.\n\nOPTIONAL: Ask: What questions might you still have?\n\n## What?\n\n4th of the 5\n\nMeeting Standards.\n\n## MEETING ROLES\n\nLG, p. 91\n\n## WHAT?\n\nBig Picture of Meeting Structures and Meeting Standards\n\n## WHY?\n\nHelps participants, especially big picture participants, put part to whole relationships together\n\nAnchors participants in the next standard - Understand and Agree on Roles\n\nWhy Group works most effectively when members know one another's responsibilities.\n\n## 4 most typically needed right people present\n\n## WHAT?\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nUnderstanding and Agreeing on Meeting Roles is one of the 5 Meeting Standards. The roles are Engaged Participant; Facilitator; Recorder; and Person with Role or Knowledge Authority.\n\n## WHY?\n\nAny group works most effectively when its members know one another's responsibilities. These four roles are most typically needed and frequently found in collaborative work groups.\n\n## OPTION 2: FOCUSED READING\n\n## WHAT and WHY?\n\nindividually --&gt; collectively construct meaning from text\n\n## WHAT?\n\nFocused Reading Strategy\n\n## WHY?\n\nProcess homework reading Technique for quick scan of material\n\n## HOW?\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nIn your homework assignment you read about the fourth Meeting Standard, Understand and Agree on Roles.\n\nYou will have an opportunity to review these roles using the Focused Reading process. Focused Reading is a paired reading strategy that allows readers to individually and then collectively construct meaning from text. It is particularly useful for quickly scanning material to find important/relevant pieces of information. Show directions on slide.\n\n## WHAT?\n\nStanding Stars\n\n## WHY?\n\nShared understandings of text\n\nMovement for energy\n\nFresh perspective from a new partner\n\n## HOW?\n\nAfter participants have marked text:\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nMake eye contact with someone from across the room. In a standing conversation, share your stars.\n\n## Facilitating in Small Groups The Citizen Facilitator, pp. 91-94\n\n## WHAT?\n\nOpportunity to synthesize learning about Facilitating in Small Groups: The Citizen Facilitator\n\n## WHY?\n\nTo clarify how facilitation works in small group settings\n\n## HOW\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nIn small groups, facilitation is required, but a full-time facilitator who functions in a fixed role is not necessarily needed. Facilitation becomes more of a function than a role and the citizen facilitator becomes a fluid function that bridges the role of facilitator and engaged participant.\n\nDebrief whole group. Allow about 20 minutes for task.\n\n## OPTIONAL STRATEGY SYNTHESIZING STATEMENT (if time) WHAT?\n\nOpportunity to synthesize learning about meeting roles\n\n## WHY?\n\nTo bring closure to this piece and practice charting\n\n## HOW\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nCraft a synthesizing statement about Meeting Roles and using the markers in your supply box, write it on the piece of chart paper we will bring to your table. Remember to use earth tones for the body of the text, red and black for titles, and yellow as highlight. If you would like to add graphics, you can come up and select from some of the pages of Chart Art. Please go to break when your chart is finished and posted on the wall.\n\nAllow about 10 minutes for task.\n\nDiscover process.  Go into experience without explanation of cognitive conflict and affective conflict\n\nMeeting Standards slide/banner\n\nWHY?\n\nTo visually alert participants to Standards 1, 3, and 5 embedded in the Assumptions Wall strategy.\n\n## HOW?\n\nReference those identified standards and forecast that the Assumptions Wall will incorporate them.\n\n## What\n\nMulti-step strategy for actualizing meeting structures and standards\n\nTight structure --&gt; assigned roles , process , and small numbers\n\n- --&gt; for clarity\n- --&gt; psychological safety\n\n## WHY?\n\nassumption --unexplored belief that one takes for granted\n\n## ASSUMPTIONS WALL\n\nLG, p. 92\n\n## WHAT?\n\nAssumptions Wall is a facilitation strategy to explore beliefs about potentially difficult topics\n\n## TRAINERS NOTE:\n\nIn this work we are differentiating between an assumption and belief as follows: an assumption is an unexplored belief that one takes for granted.\n\n## HOW?\n\nGroups of 4 or 5\n\n## TRAINERS NOTE :\n\nThis version of Assumptions Wall offers high structure in assigned roles, process, and small numbers. The Sourcebook offers a less structured version.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nTo begin the learning about conflict, we're going to introduce a strategy called Assumptions Wall.\n\nShow Slide. Reveal and read the What? and Why?\n\nIt is a strategy for exploring potentially difficult topics. It is a 3-part strategy that is highly structured for clarity and to promote psychological safety. We'll take you through the steps, then come back and process the strategy.\n\nStep 1\n\nIndividual reflective writing\n\nWrite 3 minutes on this topic.\n\nAssumptions : beliefs, values, ideas about how things should work Anything you write is okay\n\nChoose an assumption that most influences their behavior during conflict Darkest marker color possible\n\nWrite so others can read.\n\nNumber off for groups of 4-5.\n\nTrainer uses slides to give directions.\n\nAllow time for writing assumptions on sentence strips.\n\n## TRAINERS NOTE :\n\nAssumptions can be written as sentences or phrases. You may suggest that participants reread their assumptions before selecting one. They may select and write exactly what they wrote, or a summary/paraphrase, or what they wrote might trigger another thought.\n\nWhat's most important is that they choose an assumption that most influences their behavior during conflict.\n\nNumber assumptions.\n\nStep 2: Trainer continues to give directions from the slides.\n\n- 1. will designate 1st interviewer\n- 2. interviewer --select one assumption\n- 3. author --identify self\n- 4. interviewer --pattern of pausing , posing questions , pausing, paraphrasing --&gt; author / group gain deeper understanding of assumption\n\n## 5. 2-3 questions max\n\nStep 3: Trainer continues to give directions from the slides.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nNow you will engage in a Round-Robin dialogue, structured in this way. In each round there will be 3 roles: Author, Interviewer, &amp; Audience Member.\n\nShow slide to explain process.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nI will indicate who is the first interviewer. S/he will select one of the assumptions and the author will identify him/herself. Then the interviewer will use a pattern of pausing, posing questions, pausing and paraphrasing to help the author and the group gain deeper understanding of that assumption.\n\nWhen talking about beliefs and values -&gt;need to be safe .\n\nImportant to pay attention to given you will be talking about assumptions about conflict?\n\ninterviewer use 1st 3 norms to more deeply understand assumptions Show norms of collaboration on screen and refer to banner in room .\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nThe interviewer will use Norms, (especially the first three) to more deeply understand the assumptions .\n\nHIGH structure -getting ready to mess with someone's assumptions Language scaffolds purpose --&gt; focus on author's thinking / perceptions behind behavior rather than behavior itself\n\nTurn to group and make sure of task and process\n\nInterviewer - I'm curious about #___ Author -that's mine Dance begins-Author and inquirer.  Everyone else is listening. Inquirer-questions on screen. ask in approachable voice.\n\n1 st question is non-negotiable . Then can select.\n\nSee letters p,p,p,p.  Pause, paraphrase, pause, pose question\n\nRound 1 done.\n\nAuthor becomes inquirer .\n\n## PAU\n\nWho starts? Inquirer. How do they start?  On screen blue .\n\nHere's starter . Wearing most Inquirers wave .\n\nTo support you with posing questions, here are questions from which to draw.\n\nRead from screen .\n\nYou can also refer to the questions at the bottom of p. 92 in your learning guide. The purpose is to focus on the author's thinking and perceptions behind behavior, rather than behavior itself.\n\n## TRAINERS NOTE :\n\nIt is helpful to display interview question examples on screen and/or charts during this part of the strategy.\n\nYou may suggest that the interviewer pose 2-3 questions.\n\nRemind participants to also use the Norms of Pausing and Paraphrasing.\n\nPeople more willing to put ideas out there - safety\n\nMore reflective , self-reflective\n\n.  Around\n\nimportant topic\n\nHave to practice and model - comfortable .\n\nNow real work begins.  Daily basis, at home, too.  Identity, old practices.\n\nBuilt in- develop and establish rapport / relationships . Forgiving and helpful .  What learning community does.\n\nFastest way to change behavior -&gt; change identity . Identity is as listener . Behaviors align with identity . Groups finish at different rates. As groups begin to finish, display the Reflection Questions.\n\nGroups may begin dialoguing.\n\nStep 4: Group Reflection. Trainer continues to give directions from slide.\n\nDebrief: Whole group sharing on reflection questions.",
