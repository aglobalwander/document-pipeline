The Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the
16 to 19 age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be
knowledgeable and inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis
on encouraging students to develop intercultural understanding, open‑mindedness, and
the attitudes necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core. Students
study two modern languages (or a modern language and a classical language),
a ­humanities or social science subject, an experimental science, mathematics
and one of the creative arts. Instead of an arts subject, students can choose two
subjects from another area. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes
the Diploma Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare
students effectively for university entrance. In each of the academic areas students
have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can choose subjects
that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.
Normally, three subjects (and not more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and
the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends 240 teaching hours for HL
subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than
at SL. In addition, three core elements—the extended essay, theory of knowledge and creativity,
activity, service—are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.

First assessment 2026
I. Course description and aims
DP global politics is a course for students who want to understand more about how the world they
live in works, and what makes it change (or prevents it from changing). The course draws on a variety
of disciplinary traditions in the study of politics and international relations, and more broadly in the
social sciences and humanities. Students build their knowledge and understanding of the local, national,
international, and global dimensions of political activity and processes by critically engaging with contemporary political issues and challenges.
The course integrates concepts, content and contexts through inquiry.
•
Concepts such as power, sovereignty, legitimacy and interdependence are explored and examined critically throughout the course.
•
Content informs inquiries through a variety of global politics topics, encompassing political
systems and actors, power interactions, frameworks, treaties and conventions, terminology, and analysis models.
•
Contexts diversify, shape and channel inquiries through contemporary real-world examples and cases.
The flexible syllabus allows educators to build the course around their students’ contexts and interests,
as well as contemporary events and developments in global politics. Thinking, analysis and research
skills are fostered through guided and independent inquiries into political issues and challenges, with a
special focus on identifying and engaging with diverse perspectives.
