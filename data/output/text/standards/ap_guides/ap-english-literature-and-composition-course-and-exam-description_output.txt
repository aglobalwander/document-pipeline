AP Equity and Access Policy
College Board strongly encourages educators to make equitable access a guiding
principle for their AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared
students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination
of barriers that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and
socioeconomic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented. Schools
should make every effort to ensure their AP classes reflect the diversity of their
student population. College Board also believes that all students should have
access to academically challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes,
which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to
equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.

About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking
AP courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and
AP Exams are developed and scored by college faculty
and experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges
and universities in the United States grant credit,
advanced placement, or both on the basis of successful
AP Exam scores; more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the content
and skills that are the focus of the corresponding
college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also
organizes the content and skills into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many AP teachers have
told us they follow in order to focus their instruction.
The intention of this publication is to respect teachers’
time and expertise by providing a roadmap that they
can modify and adapt to their local priorities and
preferences. Moreover, by organizing the AP course
content and skills into units, the AP Program is able to provide teachers and students with formative assessments—Personal Progress Checks—that
teachers can assign throughout the year to measure
student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students:
Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically
challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to equitable preparation and
access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses:
The AP Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP courses
must participate in the AP Course Audit, a process through which AP teachers’ course materials are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.

﻿ V.1 | 1
AP English Literature and Composition Course and Exam Description

=== Page 9 ===
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the
AP teacher and the school principal (or designated
administrator) to confirm awareness and understanding
of the curricular and resource requirements. A syllabus
or course outline, detailing how course requirements
are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The
AP Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor;
all AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision,
piloting, and analysis to ensure that questions are
accurate, fair, and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development,
College Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher
education institutions. This feedback is carefully
considered to ensure that AP courses and exams are
able to provide students with a college-level learning
experience and the opportunity to demonstrate their
qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam
development process, relies on the expertise of both
AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice
questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course performance
assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands
of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are
scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion
is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained,
and their work is monitored throughout the Reading
for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief
Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers
in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of
the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a curve.
Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which means that
every student who meets the criteria for an AP score of
2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no matter how many
students that is. The criteria for the number of points
students must earn on the AP Exam to receive scores
of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently
validates for credit and placement purposes—include:
§Bullet The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
§Bullet The number of points researchers have found to be predictive that an AP student will succeed when placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
§Bullet Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP scores as follows:
AP Score
Credit

College Grade
Equivalent 5
Extremely well qualified
A 4

AP English Literature and Composition Course and Exam Description

=== Page 10 ===
While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and
universities. To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/ placement policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/creditpolicies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score the free-response sections of the AP Exams.
Ninety-eight percent of surveyed educators who took
part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an
AP Reader, including opportunities to:
§Bullet Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
§Bullet Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure
to the quality and depth of the responses from the
entire pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
§Bullet Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
§Bullet Score from home: AP Readers have online
distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects.
Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
§Bullet Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs):
AP Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide suggests a
sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds skill instruction across units, and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.asterisk
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course topics and skills, create
customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.
*To report misuses, please call 877-274-6474  (International: +1-212-632-1781).

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
§Bullet Teachers and students sign in to or create their College Board accounts.
§Bullet Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
§Bullet Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
§Bullet Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP Coordinator.
§Bullet Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and
AP Coordinators to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following
additional benefits:
§Bullet Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
§Bullet Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
§Bullet Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student pack.
The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for preadministration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
§Bullet Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

About the AP English
Literature and Composition Course
The AP English Literature and Composition course focuses on reading, analyzing, and writing
about imaginative literature (fiction, poetry, drama) from various periods. Students engage
in close reading and critical analysis of imaginative literature to deepen their understanding
of the ways writers use language to provide both meaning and pleasure. As they read,
students consider a work’s structure, style, and themes, as well as its use of figurative
language, imagery, and symbolism. Writing assignments include expository, analytical, and
argumentative essays that require students to analyze and interpret literary works.
College Course Equivalent
The AP English Literature and Composition course aligns to an introductory college-level literature and writing curriculum.
Prerequisites
There are no prerequisite courses for AP English Literature and Composition. Students
should be able to read and comprehend college-level texts and write grammatically correct, complete sentences.

Introduction
In the AP English Literature and Composition course, students devote
themselves to the study of literary works written in—or translated into—English.
Careful reading and critical analysis of such works of fiction, drama, and poetry,
selected locally by responsible educators, provide rich opportunities for students
to develop an appreciation of ways literature reflects and comments on a range
of experiences, institutions, and social structures. Students will examine the
choices literary writers make and the techniques they utilize to achieve purposes and generate meanings.
To support these objectives, this AP English Literature and Composition Course and Exam Description delineates the knowledge and skills colleges and
universities typically expect students to demonstrate
in order to receive credit for an introductory college
literature course and placement into a higher-level literature course.
This publication is not a curriculum. Teachers create
their own curricula by selecting and sequencing the
texts and tasks that will enable students to develop the
knowledge and skills outlined in this document. In some
cases, teachers also need to meet certain state or local
requirements within the AP curriculum they develop
for their school. The objective of this publication is to
provide teachers with clarity regarding the content and
skills students should learn in order to qualify for college
credit and placement. The AP Program recognizes that
the  real craft is in the skill with which teachers develop and deliver instruction.
Students develop the skills of literary analysis and composition as they repeatedly practice analyzing poetry and prose, then compose arguments about an
interpretation of a literary work. As a model for teachers,
the course content and skills are presented in nine units.
Across these nine units, the content and skills increase
in challenge and complexity, with students receiving
repeated opportunities to develop and apply analysis
and composition skills to specific genres of literature
(short fiction, poetry, novels, and plays). The objective
of this unit structure is to respect new AP teachers’ time
by suggesting one possible sequence they can adapt rather than build from scratch.
An additional benefit is that these units enable the
AP Program to provide interested teachers with formative assessments—the Personal Progress Checks—that
they can assign their students at the end of each unit to gauge progress toward success on the AP Exam.
However, experienced AP teachers who are pleased with
their current course organization and results should feel
no pressure to adopt these units, which comprise an
optional, not mandatory, sequence for this course.
Teachers who prefer to organize their course by themes,
integrating works of poetry and short and long prose
in several thematic investigations of their choice
(e.g., humanity and nature; industry and technology;
family and community), can easily combine two or more
of the units in this volume. They can avail themselves of
the scaffolded skill progressions detailed in each unit
to help focus their students’ learning and practice and
then assign students the relevant Personal Progress
Checks for that group of units.

AP ENGLISH LITERATURE
AND COMPOSITION
Big Ideas and Enduring
Understandings
The big ideas serve as the foundation of the AP English Literature and Composition
course and enable students to create meaningful connections among course
concepts. They are threads that run throughout the course and revisiting them
and applying them in a variety of contexts helps students to develop deeper
conceptual understanding. Below are the big ideas of the course, along with the enduring understanding associated with each one:
CHARACTER (CHR)
Enduring Understanding CHR-1: Characters in literature allow readers
to study and explore a range of values, beliefs, assumptions, biases, and cultural norms represented by those characters.
SETTING (SET)
Enduring Understanding SET-1: Setting and the details associated with
it not only depict a time and place, but also convey values associated with that setting.
STRUCTURE (STR)
Enduring Understanding STR-1: The arrangement of the parts and sections
of a text, the relationship of the parts to each other, and the sequence in
which the text reveals information are all structural choices made by a writer
that contribute to the reader’s interpretation of a text.
NARRATION (NAR)
Enduring Understanding NAR-1: A narrator’s or speaker’s perspective
controls the details and emphases that affect how readers experience and interpret a text.

AP English Literature and Composition Course and Exam Description

=== Page 23 ===
FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE (FIG)
Enduring Understanding FIG-1: Comparisons, representations, and
associations shift meaning from the literal to the figurative and invite readers to interpret a text.
LITERARY ARGUMENTATION (LAN)
Enduring Understanding LAN-1: Readers establish and communicate their
interpretations of literature through arguments supported by textual evidence.
UNITS
The course content is organized into units that have
been arranged in a logical sequence. This sequence
has been developed through feedback from educators
as well as analysis of high school and college courses and textbooks.
The nine units in AP English Literature and Composition
scaffold skills and knowledge through three genre based, recurring units. The units are listed below along with their approximate weighting on the exam.
Pacing recommendations shown within the Course at
a Glance and the unit guides provide suggestions for
how to teach the course content and administer the
Personal Progress Checks. The suggested class periods are based on a schedule in which the class meets
five days a week for 45 minutes each day. While these recommendations have been made to aid planning,
teachers should of course adjust the pacing based on
the needs of their students, alternate schedules (e.g.,
block scheduling), or their school’s academic calendar.
Units
Exam Weighting
Short Fiction (Units 1, 4, 7) 42–49%

Characters in literature allow readers to study and explore a range of values, beliefs, assumptions, biases, and cultural norms represented by those characters.
Setting and the details associated with it not only depict a time and place, but also convey values associated with that setting.
The arrangement of the parts and sections of a text, the relationship of the parts to each other, and the sequence in which the text reveals information are all structural choices made by a writer that contribute to the reader’s interpretation of a text.
A narrator’s or speaker’s perspective controls the details and emphases that affect how readers experience and interpret a text.
Comparisons, representations, and associations shift meaning from
the literal to the figurative and invite readers to interpret a text.
Readers establish and communicate their interpretations of literature through arguments supported by textual evidence.

UNIT OVERVIEW
While the skills outlined in this unit represent the required course content, teachers are free to teach the skills
within the unit in any order they choose. Teachers should strategically select literary works that will provide
students with good opportunities to develop these skills, keeping in mind that a single literary work might be used to teach a range of skills.

Knowledge
CHR-1
Characters in literature allow readers to study and explore a range of values, beliefs, assumptions, biases, and cultural norms represented by those characters.
1.A  Identify and describe what specific textual details reveal about a character, that character’s perspective, and that character’s motives.
CHR-1.A
Description, dialogue, and behavior reveal characters to readers.
CHR-1.B
Descriptions of characters may come from a speaker, narrator, other characters, or the characters themselves.
CHR-1.C
Perspective is how narrators, characters, or speakers
understand their circumstances, and is informed by
background, personality traits, biases, and relationships.
CHR-1.D
A character’s perspective is both shaped and revealed by
relationships with other characters, the environment, the
events of the plot, and the ideas expressed in the text.
SET-1
Setting and the details associated with it not only depict a time and place, but also convey values associated with that setting.
2.A  Identify and describe specific textual details that convey or reveal a setting.
SET-1.A
Setting includes the time and place during which the events of the text occur.
STR-1
The arrangement of the parts and sections of a text, the relationship of the parts to each other, and the sequence in which the text reveals information are all structural choices made by a writer that contribute to the reader’s interpretation of a text.
3.A  Identify and describe how plot orders events in a narrative.
STR-1.A
Plot is the sequence of events in a narrative; events throughout a narrative are connected, with each
event building on the others, often with a cause-and effect relationship.
STR-1.B
The dramatic situation of a narrative includes the setting
and action of the plot and how that narrative develops to
place characters in conflict(s), and often involves the rising
or falling fortunes of a main character or set of characters.
3.B  Explain the function of a particular sequence of events in a plot.
STR-1.C
Plot and the exposition that accompanies it focus readers’
attention on the parts of the narrative that matter most to
its development, including characters, their relationships,
and their roles in the narrative, as well as setting and the relationship between characters and setting.

~10 CLASS PERIODS
Building Course Skills
Too often, students are rushed into writing full essays without having honed the skills of crafting a claim and defending it with textual evidence. Students will benefit from frequent practice during this unit writing paragraphs that include a claim that demands defense and the textual evidence that furnishes that defense. Have students practice a variety of strategies for capturing the details they glean from a text about the character, setting, plot, or narrator, and teach them how to then examine that cluster of potential evidence for patterns or relationships that could enable them to make a claim that such details could then be used to defend.
When students have begun to generate patterns of evidence and a related claim, have them practice various paragraph structures, such as placing the claim at the start of the paragraph, followed by the evidence, and placing the claim at the end of the paragraph, as the culmination of the evidence.
Preparing for the AP Exam
One of the greatest initial challenges for students in literature classes is developing claims that are an interpretation of the text and thus require defense with textual evidence rather than mere statements of fact that require no defense. In other words, many students have difficulty moving beyond simplistic claims that require no defense, like “In ‘Everyday Use,’ Maggie is shy,” to writing claims that are less obvious and require a defense with textual evidence, like “In ‘Everyday Use,’ Maggie values her heritage more than Dee does.” By keeping the writing tasks in this unit focused on paragraphs rather than full essays, the likelihood of students receiving specific, consistent, and sustained feedback on the quality of the claims they are developing vastly increases. Until students can read closely for evidence and then use that evidence to construct a claim that requires defending, it will be difficult for them to develop full essays with thesis statements and clear lines of reasoning. Each day, students should practice assembling evidence and developing claims, starting with one paragraph consisting of a claim with evidence, and then generating several claims about a short story, each communicated in its own paragraph with supporting evidence.
Teachers can use this unit to teach students standard punctuation for incorporating details from the text into evidence sentences— how to introduce and quote specific words and phrases from a text, and how to reference the text without unnecessary or diffuse summarizing of nonessential information.
In fact, summarizing rather than brief citation of relevant evidence to defend a claim is one of the most common weaknesses students demonstrate on the AP English Literature and Composition Exam.

Developing Understanding provides an overview that
contextualizes the content of the unit within the scope of the course.
The big ideas serve as the focus of the course; they are
categories that provide students with a repertoire of skills and
approaches to analyzing literature and composing arguments about interpretations of literature.
Building Course Skills describes specific aspects of the skills that are valuable to focus on in that unit.
Preparing for the AP Exam provides helpful tips and common
student misunderstandings identified from prior exam data.
Enduring understandings are important concepts that a
student should retain long after the completion of the course.
Skills define what a student should be able to do with
content knowledge in order to progress toward the enduring
understandings. These skills are the targets of assessment for the AP Exam.
Essential knowledge statements describe the knowledge
required to perform the skills. Some essential knowledge
statements are repeated in subsequent units to help students develop a solid understanding of them.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page provide possible ways to integrate the content from the unit into
classroom instruction. Teachers do not need to use these activities and are free to alter or edit them. The
examples below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways they
approach teaching some of the skills in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional Approaches section
beginning on p. 113 for more examples of activities. Any texts referenced are not required but are used here simply to provide a context for activities.
Activity
Skill
Sample Activity 1
Skill 1.A
Identify and describe what specific textual details reveal about a character, that character’s perspective, and that character’s motives.
Instruct students to divide Chopin’s “The Story of an Hour” into four short
sections: (1) hearing the news, (2) holding back, (3) letting go, and (4) the
revelation. Have students explain how each section of the story reveals additional information about Mrs. Mallard.
Identify a text (e.g., “The Story of an Hour”) that is accessible to students, is
rich in its ability to address multiple facets of course content, and provides
opportunities for students to practice multiple skills. Each time students are
introduced to new knowledge and skills—regarding character, for example— they return to the mentor text.
2
Skill 2.A
Identify and describe specific textual details that convey or reveal a setting.
Divide students into small groups, and assign each group a section of
Faulkner’s “A Rose for Emily.” Have students list the specific details (e.g.,
physical descriptions, daily manner of living, etc.) from the text that indicate
the setting. Each group then writes a brief explanation of the details of
setting in their section, including textual evidence. Students do a gallery
walk and then connect the setting details from the whole story to draw conclusions about the meaning of setting.
3
Skill 4.A
Identify and describe the narrator or speaker of a text.
As they read, have students individually take notes on the point of view and
perspective of the narrator in “A Rose for Emily.” In their notes, they should
consider Faulkner’s choice to involve a townsperson in the story rather than write in third person.
4
Skill 7.A
Develop a paragraph that includes
1) a claim that requires defense with evidence from the text and
2) the evidence itself.
Have students read “Girl” by Jamaica Kincaid. Then, as you model prewriting
and drafting a paragraph that makes a claim about “Girl” accompanied by
textual evidence that supports that claim, have students write with you and
contribute ideas. Then, have them follow the same writing process to
draft their own paragraph that establishes a claim and supports that claim with evidence.

Developing Understanding
Understanding character, setting, plot, and narrator are fundamental to interpreting fiction.
Unit 1 builds on student understandings of these fundamentals from previous courses while
establishing a foundation for the skills and knowledge necessary for this course. Students
begin to examine how these fundamental elements function in a text.
Building Course Skills
Too often, students are rushed into writing full essays without having honed the skills of crafting a claim and defending it with textual evidence. Students will benefit from frequent practice during this unit writing paragraphs that include a claim that demands defense and the textual evidence that furnishes that defense. Have students practice a variety of strategies for capturing the details they glean from a text about the character, setting, plot, or narrator, and teach them how to then examine that cluster of potential evidence for patterns or relationships that could enable them to make a claim that such details could then be used to defend.
When students have begun to generate patterns of evidence and a related claim, have them practice various paragraph structures, such as placing the claim at the start of the paragraph, followed by the evidence, and placing the claim at the end of the paragraph, as the culmination of the evidence.
Preparing for the AP Exam
One of the greatest initial challenges for students in literature classes is developing claims that are an interpretation of the text and thus require defense with textual evidence rather than mere statements of fact that require no defense. In other words, many students have difficulty moving beyond simplistic claims that require no defense, like “In ‘Everyday Use,’ Maggie is shy,” to writing claims that are less obvious and require a defense with textual evidence, like “In ‘Everyday Use,’ Maggie values her heritage more than Dee does.” By keeping the writing tasks in this unit focused on paragraphs rather than full essays, the likelihood of students receiving specific, consistent, and sustained feedback on the quality of the claims they are developing vastly increases. Until students can read closely for evidence and then use that evidence to construct a claim that requires defending, it will be difficult for them to develop full essays with thesis statements and clear lines of reasoning. Each day, students should practice assembling evidence and developing claims, starting with one paragraph consisting of a claim with evidence, and then generating several claims about a short story, each communicated in its own paragraph with supporting evidence.
Teachers can use this unit to teach students standard punctuation for incorporating details from the text into evidence sentences— how to introduce and quote specific words and phrases from a text, and how to reference the text without unnecessary or diffuse summarizing of nonessential information.
In fact, summarizing rather than brief citation of relevant evidence to defend a claim is one of the most common weaknesses students demonstrate on the AP English Literature and Composition Exam.

Sample Activity 1
Skill 1.A
Identify and describe what specific textual details reveal about a character, that character’s perspective, and that character’s motives.
Instruct students to divide Chopin’s “The Story of an Hour” into four short
sections: (1) hearing the news, (2) holding back, (3) letting go, and (4) the
revelation. Have students explain how each section of the story reveals additional information about Mrs. Mallard.
Identify a text (e.g., “The Story of an Hour”) that is accessible to students, is
rich in its ability to address multiple facets of course content, and provides
opportunities for students to practice multiple skills. Each time students are
introduced to new knowledge and skills—regarding character, for example— they return to the mentor text.
2
Skill 2.A
Identify and describe specific textual details that convey or reveal a setting.
Divide students into small groups, and assign each group a section of
Faulkner’s “A Rose for Emily.” Have students list the specific details (e.g.,
physical descriptions, daily manner of living, etc.) from the text that indicate
the setting. Each group then writes a brief explanation of the details of
setting in their section, including textual evidence. Students do a gallery
walk and then connect the setting details from the whole story to draw conclusions about the meaning of setting.
3
Skill 4.A
Identify and describe the narrator or speaker of a text.
As they read, have students individually take notes on the point of view and
perspective of the narrator in “A Rose for Emily.” In their notes, they should
consider Faulkner’s choice to involve a townsperson in the story rather than write in third person.
4
Skill 7.A
Develop a paragraph that includes
1) a claim that requires defense with evidence from the text and
2) the evidence itself.
Have students read “Girl” by Jamaica Kincaid. Then, as you model prewriting
and drafting a paragraph that makes a claim about “Girl” accompanied by
textual evidence that supports that claim, have students write with you and
contribute ideas. Then, have them follow the same writing process to
draft their own paragraph that establishes a claim and supports that claim with evidence.

Developing Understanding
Poetry and prose differ in a variety of ways, with structure often being the most obvious and
notable of these differences. Unit 2 explores these differences and helps students better
understand how the structures of poetry contribute to meaning and interpretations. To help
students make the transition from prose to poetry, begin the unit with poems that describe
or reveal a character so that students can continue to practice the skill of character analysis
that they began in Unit 1. (Consider including poems in which characters are the speakers, as
in dramatic monologues like Browning’s “My Last Duchess” and Tennyson’s “Ulysses,” and
poems in which characters are the subjects of the poem, as in Bishop’s “The Prodigal.”) In this
unit, students will also explore other fundamentals often associated with—though not unique
to—poetry: word choice and the foundations of simile and metaphor.
Building Course Skills
Because line and stanza breaks in a poem often separate thoughts, images, and ideas, help students slow down and work through a poem part by part to develop a baseline understanding of what a poem is literally communicating. This unit also provides students with opportunities to study comparisons and contrasts within a poem;
such patterns in a text often contribute to the poem’s meanings and can inform students’ interpretations. Because so many texts convey meaning through metaphor, students should develop a strong ability in this unit to recognize a metaphor and what it is comparing. In later units, students will move from recognizing what the metaphor is comparing to explaining the way specific metaphors contribute to the student’s interpretation of the text.
Continue to focus on paragraph-length writing tasks in which students craft a claim that requires defense with evidence from the text.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The poetry essay often has lower scores than the other essays, suggesting that students find reading and interpreting poetry challenging. Since the consistent difference between poetry and prose is the arrangement of the text into lines and stanzas, it is important that students experience a variety of different ways poets organize poems. Help students gain confidence by looking carefully at each stanza within the overarching structure.
This will also help them gain a basic understanding of how poems are built.
Then, by examining comparisons, specific word choices, and the differences between stanzas, students can begin to assemble a body of evidence from which they can generate a claim that requires defense.

setting. Explain to them how the two objects are compared, paying particular
attention to the specific compared traits of the objects. Then, explain how
the comparison conveys associations and contributes to meaning. Next, in
pairs, students identify another simile or metaphor in the poem. The pairs
work together to explain how the two objects are compared and then explain
how particular associations convey meaning. Finally, have students work on
their own to identify another simile or metaphor in the poem and repeat the same process.

Longer Fiction or Drama I
Developing Understanding
Unit 3 focuses on one or more extended narratives of the teacher’s selection, exploring
the development of characters, conflicts, and plots and how these relate and contribute
to the representation of values. To help students continue to develop the skill of analyzing
characters, select one or more novellas, novels, or plays in which a character’s perspective
shifts over the course of the narrative, and in which the character’s actions or inactions
reveal the character’s motives. Select the text(s) to provide examples of conflict between a
character and outside forces that obstruct as well as examples of internal conflict between competing values within a character.
Building Course Skills
By studying a longer literary work, students have an opportunity to analyze character and how multiple literary elements contribute to the development of character.
In this unit, students build their ability to analyze how characters’ incompatible perspectives and motives contribute to conflict. Understanding these relationships allows students to develop interpretations about them. Having practiced claim-and evidence paragraphs in Units 1 and 2, Unit 3 adds significant complexity as students learn to develop a thesis statement about an overarching interpretation of the text.
Students will then organize the various claim and-evidence paragraphs to follow a line of reasoning, enriching those paragraphs with commentary that consistently explains how each specific paragraph—and specific evidence within each paragraph—relates to the argument as a whole. This development of a full essay becomes the focus of this unit and all subsequent units of the course.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Going into the exam, students need to know a few texts very well. The literary argument question is written to accommodate a wide range of novels and dramas. There is no canon of expected texts, nor are students rewarded or penalized for choosing texts included on the question’s accompanying list. Often, essays that perform well are written by students who clearly have an interest in the text they choose. Help students navigate longer works by focusing on details important to interpretations of the work as a whole, not just facts for summary. Many students make the mistake of summarizing too much of a text and then simply telling the reader that it means something. Though a particular idea or detail in a summary may be appropriate to the analysis, students should focus on the most relevant aspects of that detail and be certain to explain how it relates to an interpretation of the work as a whole.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page provide possible ways to integrate the content from the unit into
classroom instruction. Teachers do not need to use these activities and are free to alter or edit them. The
examples below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways they
approach teaching some of the skills in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional Approaches section
beginning on p. 113 for more examples of activities. Any texts referenced are not required but are used here simply to provide a context for activities.
Activity
Skill
Sample Activity 1
Skill 1.A
Identify and describe what specific textual details reveal about a character, that character’s perspective, and that character’s motives.
Highlight Polonius’s claim that Hamlet is mad (2.2.223–224). Have one half
of the class select textual evidence for this claim and the other half against
this claim. Use this evidence to support group conclusions and reasoning in a debate.
2 Skill 1.B
Explain the function of a character changing or remaining unchanged.
After having students read Chapter 9 of Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes
Were Watching God, ask them to use a T-chart to describe Janie’s character
(e.g., physical appearance, actions, dialogue, thoughts, reactions to other
characters) before and after Jody’s funeral. Then, have students use this
organizer to explain why Janie changes and the meaning of this change.

Skill 7.C
Develop commentary that establishes and explains relationships among textual evidence, the line of reasoning, and the thesis.
Have students draft a literary argument that analyzes how Hamlet’s “To be
or not to be” soliloquy reveals his conflicting perspectives and motives,
particularly through the contrasting ideas and images in the soliloquy. In pairs,
ask students to read each other’s arguments and critique the degree to
which the peer has justified their claims through clear, logical explanations
that articulate relationships among textual evidence, the line of reasoning, and the thesis.

Developing Understanding
Characters, plots, and dramatic situations—like people and events in the real world—
are complex and nuanced. While previous units have established and examined the
fundamentals of fiction, Unit 4 introduces the complexities of characters, the nuances of
dramatic situations, and the complications of literary conflicts. The various contrasts an
author introduces necessarily affect the interpretations that students make; therefore,
students should learn to account for these elements as they choose evidence and develop the commentary that explains their thinking.
Building Course Skills
Students should practice tracing characters’ choices, perspectives, and relationships throughout a text to become adept at identifying patterns and breaks in patterns.
In developing this skill, students can explore character complexity in this unit as well as prepare for later units in which they will examine characters’ inconsistencies and interpret possible meanings those inconsistencies convey.
Through formal and informal writing exercises, let students practice explaining how different details or literary elements in a text interact and how their relationships contribute to the students’ interpretations.
As students write, help them develop body paragraphs that articulate explicit relationships among their claims, reasoning, and evidence.
Preparing for the AP Exam
As students make claims in essays about their interpretations and explain how details from a text support those claims, they often fail to see how different parts of a text or elements in a text work together and affect one another. This understanding is essential to the multiple-choice section of the exam as some questions may require a student to consider multiple elements as they choose their answer. For example, an image embedded in a metaphor affects the interpretation of that metaphor. In addition, this unit explores several aspects of narration, such as tone and stream of consciousness. Accordingly, be sure to select short fiction that will provide students with good examples of the essential knowledge statements.

Developing Understanding
In this unit, students will continue to practice the interpretation of poetry, with a focus on the
ways word choice, imagery, and comparisons can reveal meanings and shape interpretations
of the text. Accordingly, choose poems for this unit that provide students with opportunities
to identify, understand, and interpret imagery, extended metaphors, personification, and allusion.
Building Course Skills
Students expand their understanding of metaphor by examining the traits of compared objects and their significance in conveying meaning. This unit also introduces extended metaphor; therefore, students will need not only a proficient understanding of metaphor, but also skill in recognizing related patterns of images and/or other metaphors that work together. Skills related to extended metaphor are important to master here because students will examine conceits in Unit 8.
Students should encounter both closed and open poetic structures, and they will need multiple opportunities to practice recognizing structural patterns and analyzing the relationship between poetic structure and meaning. This unit is the perfect context to remind students that there is no single “correct” interpretation. Give students opportunities to compare their claims about an interpretation of a text to others’ claims and to evaluate whether the reasoning and evidence of another’s argument justify an alternative interpretation of the text.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The Sample Instructional Activities page for this unit, as well as the “Developing
Course Skills” section in the Instructional
Approaches section, provide a number of suggestions for increasing students’ facility with the act of reading and interpreting poetry.

3.C  Explain the function of structure in a text.
STR-1.U
Closed forms of poetry include predictable patterns in
the structure of lines, stanzas, meter, and rhyme, which develop relationships among ideas in the poem.
Note: The AP Exam will not require students to label or
identify specific rhyme schemes, metrical patterns, or forms of poetry.
STR-1.V
Open forms of poetry may not follow expected or
predictable patterns in the structure of their lines or
stanzas, but they may still have structures that develop relationships between ideas in the poem.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page provide possible ways to integrate the content from the unit into
classroom instruction. Teachers do not need to use these activities and are free to alter or edit them. The
examples below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways they
approach teaching some of the skills in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional Approaches section
beginning on p. 113 for more examples of activities. Any texts referenced are not required but are used here simply to provide a context for activities.
Activity
Skill
Sample Activity 1
Skill 5.D
Identify and explain the function of an image or imagery.
Using Elizabeth Bishop’s “The Fish,” have students highlight what they
consider to be four or five of the most important images in the poem. Then,
have students identify an abstract noun (thematic idea) that each highlighted
image conveys. Finally, have them explain how the individual images work
together to convey meaning in the poem and explain relationships among the abstract nouns they identified.
2
Skill 3.C
Explain the function of structure in a text.
Have students examine the structure of Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s “How
Do I Love Thee?” through a jigsaw strategy. After being assigned their “base”
groups, students work with their various “expert” groups to explore one
of the following: the closed-form characteristics of the poem, shifts and
contrasts in the poem, ideas in the octave, and ideas in the sestet. In the
base groups, students share with peers what they have learned about their
particular topic in order to explain how the poem’s structure emphasizes certain ideas and concepts.
3
Skill 6.B
Identify and explain the function of a metaphor.
Using John Donne’s “The Sun Rising,” have students mark the individual
metaphors throughout the poem. For each metaphor, have students explain
how the compared traits convey a particular perspective and contribute to
figurative meaning. Next, have students examine the metaphors again to
determine which individual metaphors seem to work together for a larger
comparison. Students should mark the text to indicate that those metaphors
work together. Finally, students should explain how the metaphors that work
together convey a particular perspective and contribute to an interpretation of the poem.
4
Skill 7.B
Develop a thesis statement that conveys a defensible claim about an interpretation of literature and that may establish a line of reasoning.
After they’ve written a draft of a literary argument about a poem,
have students work in small groups to read their peers’ arguments and
carefully consider the interpretations of the poem presented in each thesis.
Have them compare their own interpretation of the poem with their peers’,
carefully noting similarities and differences. When students revise their
arguments, they may choose to modify their own interpretations and thesis
statements based on these alternative interpretations.
5
Skill 7.E
Demonstrate control over the elements of composition to communicate clearly.
After students have written a literary argument about a poem, have them
engage in a peer review in which they mark places in the drafts where ideas
seem unrelated, there is an abrupt shift, or relationships between ideas are
unclear. When drafts are returned, have students review the marked places in
their drafts and, where appropriate, add transitions that indicate relationships between ideas.

Developing Understanding
Carefully crafted literary texts often contain what appear to be inconsistencies that can be
confusing to students. As teachers know, and as students must learn, inconsistency in the
way characters develop, interruption in the timeline or sequence of a plot, or unreliability of a
character or narrator can all contribute to the complexities in a text and affect interpretation.
Unit 6 provides another opportunity to explore how previously learned skills apply to longer
texts, where characters and plots are usually more developed. At this point in the course,
students may be prepared to explore these myriad possibilities as they begin to refine their
literary arguments. When selecting one or more longer works for this unit, be sure to choose
one that gives students the opportunity to analyze symbols, a skill introduced in this unit and continued in Units 7 and 8.
Building Course Skills
In this course, students will explore and grapple with the complexity of literature.
Students encounter complexity in plot, identify elements that disrupt a chronology, and explore how disruptions affect a reader’s experience. Furthermore, students explore contrasts and inconsistencies in character. To analyze such complexities in plot and character, students should be able to recognize patterns and breaks in patterns before they can explain how such contrasts and inconsistencies convey meaning. Students also explore narrator bias by critically considering the details a narrator provides (or does not provide) and considering how such bias invites complex interpretations.
Students may continue to benefit from practice developing and supporting multiple interpretations of a single text as they examine text complexity. Furthermore, students may begin to acknowledge or respond to alternative interpretations in their own complex arguments; however, they will need support and feedback when writing commentary that explains a text’s complexity and when writing complex arguments.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Nonlinear plots, changing characters, and shifting tones all create complexity that invites interpretation. While complexities in a text provide opportunities for analysis and multiple interpretations, they can often intimidate and confuse students.
Complexities in a text also tend to have nuances that require detailed analysis.
On the exam, the prose and poetry prompts ask that students analyze some complexity in the texts provided. Students who do not explore a text’s complexity and nuance in their essays may not be able to successfully develop an interpretation of the work as a whole.

CHR-1
Characters in literature allow readers to study and explore a range of values, beliefs, assumptions, biases, and cultural norms represented by those characters.
1.A  Identify and describe what specific textual details reveal about a character, that character’s perspective, and that character’s motives.
CHR-1.T
Different character, narrator, or speaker perspectives
often reveal different information, develop different
attitudes, and influence different interpretations of a text and the ideas in it.
1.C  Explain the function of contrasting characters.
CHR-1.U
Foil characters (foils) serve to illuminate, through
contrast, the traits, attributes, or values of another character.
1.E  Explain how a character’s own choices, actions, and speech reveal complexities in that character, and explain the function of those complexities.
CHR-1.V
Inconsistencies between the private thoughts of
characters and their actual behavior reveal tensions and
complexities between private and professed values.
CHR-1.W
A character’s competing, conflicting, or inconsistent
choices or actions contribute to complexity in a text.
STR-1
The arrangement of the parts and sections of a text, the relationship of the parts to each other, and the sequence in which the text reveals information are all structural choices made by a writer that contribute to the reader’s interpretation of a text.
3.A  Identify and describe how plot orders events in a narrative.
STR-1.X
Some narrative structures interrupt the chronology of a
plot; such structures include flashback, foreshadowing, in medias res, and stream of consciousness.
3.B  Explain the function of a particular sequence of events in a plot.

Narrative structures that interrupt the chronology of
a plot, such as flashback, foreshadowing, in medias
res, and stream of consciousness, can directly affect
readers’ experiences with a text by creating anticipation or suspense or building tension.
3.D  Explain the function of contrasts within a text.
STR-1.Z
Contrasts often represent contradictions or
inconsistencies that introduce nuance, ambiguity, or
contradiction into a text. As a result, contrasts make texts more complex.

Sample Activity 1
Skill 1.C
Explain the function of contrasting characters.
After students read Hurston’s Their Eyes Were Watching God, ask them to
form two concentric circles. Have students in the inner circle discuss how
Janie and her grandmother are foil characters and how these contrasting
characters and their perspectives contribute to meaning in the novel. During
this discussion, have students in the outer circle write questions and
responses based on the inner circle’s discussion. Then have the two groups switch roles.
2
Skill 3.A
Identify and describe how plot orders events in a narrative.
Have students consider the question Why did Mary Shelley arrange the
events in Frankenstein as she did? Organize students into groups, and give
each group an envelope containing slips of paper with the major events of
the story. First, have students arrange the events chronologically. Then, have
them arrange the slips in the order they are presented in the novel. Finally,
have students explain how the nonlinear plot structure affects a reader’s
experience and contributes to meaning in the novel.
3
Skill 5.C
Identify and explain the function of a symbol.
Pause at Chapter 13 of Frankenstein to focus on the creature’s musings
on the concept of monstrosity. Have groups develop and discuss
questions about the symbol of monstrosity, such as the following: What is a
monster (literal-level question)? Why does the creature feel like a monster
(interpretive-level question)? How does the way monstrosity is represented
here represent larger thematic ideas about humanity in and beyond the novel (universal-level question)?
4
Skill 7.C
Develop commentary that establishes and explains relationships among textual evidence, the line of reasoning, and the thesis.
After students have developed drafts of their literary arguments for a text,
have them generate a list of questions that might encourage their peers to
more fully and clearly explain the relationships between selected textual
evidence and their claim. During the peer review, have students adapt
questions from the list generated earlier and write them in the margins of
their peers’ essays when they notice a place where commentary is absent,
thin, confusing, incomplete, etc. After the review, students can use the
questions as an opportunity for discussion among peers about their writing
and an opportunity for writers to further consider answers to the questions written in the margins of their essays.

Developing Understanding
Unit 7 looks at how texts engage with a range of experiences, institutions, or social structures.
Students come to understand that literature is complicated because it tries to capture
and comment on the complexities of the real world. Sudden changes in a narrative, such
as a character’s epiphany, a change in setting, manipulation of the pacing of the plot, or
contradictory information from a narrator, are factors that students should learn to consider as they develop their own interpretations.
This unit challenges students to transfer their understanding of figurative language, previously
studied only in relation to poetry, to their interpretations of narrative prose. Students should
come to understand that it is acceptable and sometimes even necessary to revise their initial
interpretations of a text as they gather and analyze more information.
Building Course Skills
The previous unit introduced students to complexity in literary texts; in this unit, students extend their understanding of complexity by examining how it develops over the course of a text, which requires students to develop proficiency in recognizing patterns and breaks in patterns over the course of a text. Students explore complexity in a setting and in a character, for example, and must be able to explain how changes in these elements and the values associated with them convey meaning.
Subsequently, students develop arguments about their interpretations of a text. They should be able to identify patterns in a text that suggest a connection to experiences, institutions, or social structures and then explain the relationship between their evidence and the line of reasoning behind that interpretation. However, students should also learn to recognize when evidence does not support their line of reasoning, and thus their interpretation, and revise accordingly.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The highest performing essays on the exam typically recognize and account for contradictions and complexities in the text being analyzed. Students who reduce a complex setting or character to only a single detail or moment where a shift or change occurs may ignore or fail to consider other details that contribute to complexity.
Experience with texts that include complex relationships among settings, characters, plots, and other aspects provides students with important opportunities to practice the interpretative skills necessary for success on the exam.

CHR-1.X
Often the change in a character emerges directly from a conflict of values represented in the narrative.
CHR-1.Y
Changes in a character’s circumstances may lead to changes in that character.
CHR-1.Z
While characters can change gradually over the course
of a narrative, they can also change suddenly as the
result of a moment of realization, known as an epiphany.
An epiphany allows a character to see things in a new
light and is often directly related to a central conflict of the narrative.
CHR-1.AA
An epiphany may affect the plot by causing a character to act on his or her sudden realization.
1.D  Describe how textual details reveal nuances and complexities in characters’ relationships with one another.
CHR-1.AB
A group or force can function as a character.
CHR-1.AC
When readers consider a character, they should examine how that character interacts with other characters, groups, or forces and what those interactions may indicate about the character.
CHR-1.AD
The relationship between a character and a group,
including the inclusion or exclusion of that character,
reveals the collective attitude of the group toward that
character and possibly the character’s attitude toward the group.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page provide possible ways to integrate the content from the unit into
classroom instruction. Teachers do not need to use these activities and are free to alter or edit them. The
examples below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways that
they approach teaching some of the skills in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional Approaches section
beginning on p. 113 for more examples of activities. Any texts referenced are not required but are used here simply to provide a context for activities.
Activity
Skill
Sample Activity 1
Skill 1.D
Describe how textual details reveal nuances and complexities in characters’ relationships with one another.
Have students analyze how diction, imagery, details, language, and syntax in
certain portions of Faulkner’s “A Rose for Emily” convey the narrator’s and
other community members’ complex relationship with Emily.
2
Skill 4.D
Explain how a narrator’s reliability affects a narrative.
After students read “A Rose for Emily,” have them develop a graphic
organizer that coordinates the following: key details about Emily that the
narrator provides, plausible explanations for how the narrator could know
these key details, and key details about Emily that the narrator does not
provide. Finally, based on their observations, have students explain whether the narrator is reliable.
3
Skill 5.C
Identify and explain the function of a symbol.
Designate certain students as “experts” in analyzing symbolism. In small
groups, have the student experts lead a discussion about the symbolic
settings of China and America in Amy Tan’s “Two Kinds.” Using textual
evidence, the student experts help their group members understand what
these settings symbolize and how this symbolism contributes to meaning in the story.
4
Skill 7.D
Select and use relevant and sufficient evidence to both develop and support a line of reasoning.
Before they draft a literary argument about an interpretation of a short story,
have students outline their theses, lines of reasoning, and evidence. Review
their outlines and determine whether the students’ selected evidence
supports their reasoning. Based on information from the outline, provide
feedback by asking probing questions to help students determine whether
their interpretations and reasoning might require revision.

Poetry III
Developing Understanding
Students continue to develop their understanding of how to read a poem in this unit, focusing
especially on how interpretation of a poem’s parts informs an interpretation of the entire
poem. Unit 8 goes further than any previous unit in exploring ambiguities of language and
unrealized expectations and the ironies they create. In further examining structural contrasts
or inconsistencies, students will recognize how juxtaposition, irony, and paradox in a poem may
contribute to understanding complexity of meanings.
Building Course Skills
This unit requires students to have developed proficiency in analyzing metaphors, contrasts, and complexities in a text in order to tackle more advanced skills.
As students encounter conceits in poetry, they need practice unpacking the individual images, metaphors, and figurative language of the conceit. With this practice, they can analyze the figurative meaning conveyed in individual elements and also interpret how different elements in the conceit work together and contribute to an interpretation of the work as a whole.
Additionally, students should be able to closely analyze a text’s language and structure in order to identify contrasts (e.g., juxtaposition, irony, and paradox) and ambiguities and the effects of both.
More importantly, students need practice explaining how such contrasts convey meaning. When reading, students will need practice identifying the multiple interpretations ambiguous language invites.
When writing arguments, students should understand that considering ambiguous evidence may require revising their reasoning and interpretations rather than only acknowledging alternative interpretations.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Often, texts will rely on irony or a conceit and, while students may recognize either of those, they may not consistently address how other elements in the text affect or are affected by the irony or conceit. The best essays analyze texts by examining parts or elements and explaining how they contribute to an interpretation of the text as a whole. The most astute essays address key nuances in the text and how those nuances may subtly affect students’ interpretation.

Sample Activity 1
Skill 3.C
Explain the function of structure in a text.
Using Elizabeth Bishop’s “The Fish,” have students examine how punctuation
in the poem helps indicate individual images, and how individual images
extend beyond individual lines and work together to contribute to meaning.
Ask students to examine how the unexpected repetition of “rainbow” in this
open-form poem creates emphasis and explain how this emphasis conveys
meaning and contributes to an interpretation of the poem.
2
Skill 3.D
Explain the function of contrasts within a text.
Using John Donne’s “The Sun Rising,” select several images from the poem
that represent antithesis, irony, and paradox. Print these images on strips
of paper. Then, create a graphic organizer that allows students to organize
the poem strips according to those categories. When they have placed the
images on the organizer, discuss together the effect of the antithesis, irony, and paradox on the subject and theme of the poem.
3
Skill 5.B
Explain the function of specific words and phrases in a text.
Have students work in small groups to develop an oral interpretation
of Hughes’s “Theme for English B.” In their oral interpretations, students
should pay attention to how they say particular words and phrases based
on how they understand the speaker’s meaning. As groups present their
oral interpretations, have students identify words and phrases that are
interpreted differently. Finally, as a whole group, discuss how ambiguity in the poem invited the different oral interpretations.
4
Skill 6.B
Identify and explain the function of a metaphor.
Because conceits are complex, students need to comprehend literal
meaning first. Have students summarize chunks of a conceit, or if the
language of the conceit is particularly complex, have them paraphrase the
conceit line by line. After students can comprehend the literal meaning in
the conceit, they can proceed to interpret individual comparisons and begin
examining how these comparisons (or extended comparisons) contribute to an interpretation of the poem.

Developing Understanding
Unit 9 brings understandings from throughout the course to bear on a longer text so students
can explore in depth how literature engages with a range of experiences, institutions, and
social structures. The ways a character changes and the reasons for the change reveal much
about that character’s traits and values, and, in turn, how the character contributes to the
interpretation of the work as a whole. Students should now recognize that the events, conflicts,
and perspectives of a narrative embody different values and the tensions between them. At
this point in the course, students should understand that interwoven and nuanced relationships
among literary elements in a text ultimately contribute to the complexity of the work. As the
course concludes, students should recognize that demonstrating an understanding of a
complex text means developing a nuanced literary analysis. Above all, as students leave the
course, they have hopefully developed an appreciation for a wide variety of genres, styles, and
authors that will motivate them to continue reading and interpreting literature.
Building Course Skills
This final unit requires students to engage in multiple thinking patterns (e.g., recognizing and tracing patterns, identifying breaks in patterns, identifying cause-effect relationships, comparing, contrasting, examining a part’s function and its relationship to a whole) in order to understand relationships among literary elements and how they contribute to meaning. Challenge students to examine these patterns: how these patterns represent interactions among literary elements and how these patterns might describe different part-to-whole relationships in a text. For example, in tracking a character’s development, students might note details about the motives, perspectives, behaviors, conflicts, and relationships that seem inconsistent when compared to that character’s response to a plot’s resolution.
This pattern of comparison and contrast in students’ thinking will lead to a better understanding of that character’s complexity and how it contributes to an interpretation of the work as a whole.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The literary argument on the exam always asks students to address their interpretation of a work as a whole. By the end of the course, students should understand that various parts of a text—from small details to major ideas—can relate to one another and affect their interpretation. Successful essays are cohesive; they regularly connect the analysis of parts of the literary text to the broader interpretation of the text as a whole. In fact, this level of analysis may be the difference between a student scoring in the upper half of essay scores instead of the lower half. Essays that earn the sophistication point on the rubric will often explain the significance or relevance of an interpretation within a broader context in a way that is significant and compelling. As the course comes to a close and students get ready for the exam, encourage them to reflect on the years they have spent reading, thinking, and writing about texts and to be prepared by knowing a few texts very well, not just in summary, but in the ways of critical and nuanced thinking practiced in this course.

(1.2.135–165, 2.2.555–613, 3.1.64–96, 4.4.34–68) to trace Hamlet’s
psychological journey throughout the play. They should consider his
contemplation of life and death, action, his answer to the charge of revenge,
his comparison to other characters, etc. Then, in a panel discussion, ask
panelists to portray various characters from the play, including Hamlet.

Have students develop a graphic organizer in which they list short quotations
as evidence of conflicts within Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes Were
Watching God. For each quotation, have them summarize the conflict
represented. Then, have them indicate in the graphic organizer whether the
conflict is resolved by the end of the novel. Finally, have them indicate how
the resolved or unresolved conflicts contribute to meaning in the novel.

Skill 4.C
Identify and describe details, diction, or syntax in a text that reveal a narrator’s or speaker’s perspective.
Using a jigsaw strategy, organize students into “base” groups in which each
student selects a narrator from Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (i.e., Walton,
Victor, the creature, Alphonse) to examine. In the “expert” groups, have
students who are examining the same narrator work together to note textual
details, diction, or syntax that illustrate the narrator’s unique perspective
and how this perspective contributes to meaning. When students return to
their base groups, have them discuss how the shifting narrators and their
perspectives contribute to the reader’s understanding of multiple literary
elements and invite a range of interpretations of the novel.

Organizing the Course
The AP English Literature and Composition course framework was designed with
instructional flexibility in mind; there are nine units organized in a logical, scaffolded
sequence. The table below illustrates four different ways AP English Literature
and Composition teachers organize their course, but these are not the only four possibilities.
Organizational
Approach
Description
Genres
Following the unit-based model of nine units established in the course framework allows
students to evenly examine short fiction, poetry, and extended literary works and develop
enduring understandings by spiraling the big ideas and scaffolding skills over the course.
Thematic
Grouping texts (representative of diverse authors and from a variety of time periods) by a
shared common concept (e.g., thematic ideas, experiences, institutions, social structures)
helps students develop literary analysis skills and conceptual understandings by making
connections and comparisons among texts that share that concept. Teachers can still use
the nine units in this publication as a guide for text selection that will enable students to
practice and develop the skills required for college credit, but they can easily combine
several of the units in this publication–and their subsequent Personal Progress Checks–into one or more thematic units.
Literature Survey
This organizational approach includes exploring literary concepts and teaching literary
analysis skills through a survey of literature (e.g., American, British) from a variety of authors
and time periods to examine literary movements. Such an organizational approach may
benefit schools where a course in a survey of literature is a requirement. In this model,
teachers can use the nine units to guide text selection of short fiction, poetry, and longer
narratives, and can combine the units so that students are integrating a study of these
various genres of literature within the survey course. The Personal Progress Checks can be
administered after students have practiced the relevant skills on the texts within the survey.
Author Studies
While students should read texts from a variety of diverse authors, students may benefit
from a short-term study of a particular author’s literary works. Such an organizational
approach can offer an intensive study of how an author presents thematic ideas,
experiences, institutions, and/or social structures in their texts through literary elements and
techniques and encourages students to compare these works, noting significant trends.
In this model, teachers should be sure to include poets as well as prose writers of short and
long narratives, selecting authors and texts that will enable students to practice and develop
the skills delineated in the nine units of this publication.

Alternative Sequencing
The course units have been designed with an intentional, scaffolded sequence
across units. If adjustments are made and skills and their corresponding essential
knowledge are moved outside of their assigned unit, the scaffolding of skills over the
course may begin to lose its integrity. Also, Personal Progress Checks are designed
to assess the skills and essential knowledge within a unit. If a skill and corresponding
essential knowledge statement are moved outside of their assigned unit, as
indicated in the course framework, the Personal Progress Check for that particular
unit may not adequately assess what students have actually learned in the unit.

Selecting and Using
Course Materials
Textbooks
While teachers select textbooks locally, an example
textbook list is provided on AP Central to share a
range of texts that have already been found to meet the
AP Course Audit college-level textbook requirement.
Selecting Texts
While students should read a variety of texts in the course, the depth of their reading should not be
sacrificed for breadth. In fact, teachers may want to
evaluate the number of longer literary works they plan to teach in the course to consider whether such a
selection of texts allows students sufficient time and
opportunity to master course content and skills. An
alternate approach is to help students build skills by
examining short fiction and poetry, which can offer
them opportunities for more targeted skill development
and feedback, and then review and extend such skills
in longer literary works. Additionally, a single text can
serve as an anchor text, used to teach multiple concepts
and skills over time and revisited throughout the course.
However, teachers should not feel compelled to teach
every course concept or every skill a text seems to
offer; instead, they can develop a strategic approach for
students to practice a manageable number of targeted skills using a particular text.
Over the course of their literature studies in secondary
school, and by the end of their AP English Literature
and Composition class, students should have studied
a variety of texts by diverse authors from a variety of
time periods ranging from the English Renaissance to
the present. However, students may not be prepared to
read and analyze the most challenging literature from the very beginning of the course because students
have not yet developed proficiency in the content and
skills necessary to engage such literary works. The texts that students read should accommodate their
current reading skill proficiency but also appropriately
challenge them to further develop their reading skills.
Therefore, you may consider scaffolding texts within
instructional units and across the course, selecting
more accessible texts at the beginning of the year or
when introducing concepts in a unit and then gradually
including more challenging texts after students have
developed a degree of skill proficiency and experience reading a variety of texts.
Another instructional choice regarding texts that may
enrich students’ study of literature is text pairing or
grouping. Comparing one or more literary works can
help students examine literature in increasingly complex ways and reinforce their understanding of course
concepts; for example, comparing how related texts of
different genres convey meaning through similar and
different approaches. Additionally, pairing or grouping
a challenging text with a more accessible text may
provide students with opportunities to identify points of comparison between the texts and to promote close reading of the texts, particularly the more challenging one.
Issues that might, from a specific cultural viewpoint,
be considered controversial, including depictions of
nationalities, religions, ethnicities, dialects, gender,
or class, are often represented artistically in works of
literature. AP students are not expected or asked to
subscribe to any one specific set of cultural or political
values, but are expected to have the maturity to analyze
perspectives different from their own and to question the
meaning, purpose, or effect of such content within the literary work as a whole.

Developing Course Skills
Throughout the course, students will develop skills that are fundamental to the study
of literature. Since these skill categories represent the complex skills that adept
readers and writers of literature demonstrate, students will benefit from multiple
opportunities to develop these skills in a scaffolded manner. Through the use of guided
questioning, discussion techniques, and other instructional strategies, teachers
can help your students practice applying these skills in new contexts, providing
an important foundation for their college and career readiness. (Note: The texts
referenced in this section are not course requirements but are used here simply to offer a context for examples)
Skill Category 1: Explain the function of character
By analyzing how a character is portrayed in a text, any change in a character over
the course of a text, contrasting characters, and character relationships, students
explore how characters in a literary work contribute to meaning in a text and are
often vessels for conveying a range of ideas, values, beliefs, assumptions, biases,
and cultural norms. The following table provides examples of questions and
instructional activities for implementing this skill in the course.
Skills
Key Questions
Sample Instructional Activity
1.A: Identify and describe what specific textual details reveal about a character, that character’s perspective, and that character’s motives.
Bullet Which words, phrases, and details contribute to a character’s characterization?
§Bullet How is a character described physically, emotionally, and/or psychologically?
Bullet Which aspects of a character’s background contribute to how the character perceives his or her world?
Bullet What drives the character to think, feel, and/or act in the manner he or she does?
Provide students with a stanza from Hughes’s “Theme for English B.” Have them fold a sheet of paper to form three columns: Column 1 will contain their assigned stanza, column 2 is where they will write information about the speaker based on details from their assigned stanza, and column 3 is where they will interpret and explain what the information in the second column reveals about the speaker.
Once students have completed the graphic organizer, ask them to share their work with a partner. Then engage the class in a whole group discussion of their findings.

Bullet What provokes a character to change or remain unchanged?
Bullet What are the comparable traits of a character before and after he or she changes?
Bullet To what degree does the text convey empathy for those characters who change or for those who remain unchanged?
Bullet To what degree does a character’s changing constitute progress or decline?
Bullet How does a character’s changing or remaining unchanged affect other elements of the literary work and/or contribute to meaning of the work as a whole?
Using chapter 24 of Mary Shelley’s
Frankenstein, have students examine the speech Victor Frankenstein gives to the sailors when they tell Robert Walton they would like to turn the ship around if the ice breaks up. (This speech begins: “Oh! Be men, or be more than men . . .”)
Have students engage in a free-writing exercise for five minutes, considering the degree to which Victor’s speech reveals a change in his character. After the exercise, students should identify specific aspects of Victor’s character that may have changed and offer textual evidence to support their reasoning.
1.C: Explain the function of contrasting characters.
Bullet How do comparable traits of two or more characters contrast?
Bullet What do the differing traits between characters reveal about them individually, their relationships with one another, and their relationships with other characters?
Bullet How does considering the significance of a contrast between characters contribute to meaning in the text?
Ask students to consider the speaker and the instructor of Hughes’s “Theme for English B.” Have them use a Venn diagram to compare and contrast the characters’ comparable traits (e.g., role at the school, location, age, race, perspective) based on details from the poem. After examining some of the characterizing traits in the Venn diagram, students should share their findings with a partner and examine how these contrasts contribute to meaning in the poem.
1.D: Describe how textual details reveal nuances and complexities in characters’ relationships with one another.
Bullet Which particular images, character speech, and textual details are relevant for examining characters’ relationships?
§Bullet How do images, character speech, and other textual details reveal how characters interact?
§Bullet
After students have read the last section of Shelley’s Frankenstein, ask particular students to assume the roles of Victor, the creature, Robert Walton, and Elizabeth. The students assuming these roles should study their assigned characters. Meanwhile, have the other students review the section of the novel and develop questions for the panelists that require panelists to consider how their characters would answer based on evidence from the novel. During the panel discussion, have students maintain the personas of the characters they represent as they answer questions. Engage in a debrief of the conversation after the panel discussion.
How do diction and the details that a narrator or speaker offers (or does not offer) convey a particular perspective, ambiguity, and/or inconsistency and convey nuances and complexities in character relationships?
1.E: Explain how a character’s own choices, actions, and speech reveal complexities in that character, and explain the function of those complexities.
§Bullet Which of a character’s choices, actions, and/or speech seem contradictory or inconsistent?
§Bullet How do a character’s contradictory or inconsistent traits contribute to a reader’s understanding of the character’s complexity?
Bullet How do a character’s contradictory or inconsistent traits contribute to meaning in a text?
Have students review Robert Walton’s letters to his sister in Shelley’s Frankenstein. Then ask them to use a graphic organizer to analyze and note Walton’s motivation (column 1), actions (column 2), reactions to and thoughts about Frankenstein (column 3), and reactions to and thoughts about the creature (column 4).

Skill Category 2: Explain the function of setting
Recognizing the physical or literal aspects of settings in texts is just the
beginning of analyzing how setting contributes to an interpretation of literature.
Exploring how texts develop relationships between setting and other literary
elements and exploring how settings can become associated with or represent
ideas or values are crucial to helping students move from understanding setting at a
literal level to a deeper understanding of how setting contributes to meaning in a
text. The following table provides examples of questions and instructional activities for implementing this skill in the course.
Skills
Key Questions
Sample Instructional Activity
2.A: Identify and describe specific textual details that convey or reveal a setting.
§Bullet How do details in a text convey or reveal one or more aspects of a setting (e.g., location, time of day, year, season, geography, culture)?
Have students identify and mark setting descriptions and details in Hughes’s “Theme for English B.” Then ask them to sketch a map of the setting(s) based on given textual details. Finally, based on the setting details, have students make inferences about and describe the culture of the poem’s setting.
2.B: Explain the function of setting in a narrative.
Bullet What are the relationships between a text’s setting and other literary elements?
§Bullet How does a setting affect readers of that text?
Bullet How do a text’s various settings contribute to meaning and its overall effect?
Ask students to generate a list of the various settings found in Shelley’s Frankenstein and identify—via student votes—what they believe are the four most significant settings in the novel. Students should then develop questions about these settings and engage in a Socratic Seminar to discuss such ideas as the setting’s relationship with other literary elements, how the setting affects readers’ experiences with the text, and how the setting contributes to meaning.
2.C: Describe the relationship between a character and a setting.
Bullet What is the relationship between the aspects (e.g., location, time of day, geography) of a setting and a character?
§Bullet What is the relationship between a setting’s historical time period and a character?
§Bullet What is the relationship between the society or culture of a setting and a character (e.g., what is the character’s role in the society/culture, to what degree is a character accepted by his or her society/ culture, to what degree does the society/ culture esteem a character)?
After reading Hughes’s “Theme for English B,” ask students to develop a double-entry journal with the poetry text on the left side.
On the right side, students should write questions about the speaker’s relationship with the various settings of the poem. Then they should prepare their initial responses to those questions using textual evidence.

Skill Category 3: Explain the function of plot and structure
A deeper understanding of plot and structure in texts includes examining how
the ordering of events in narratives affect readers’ interpretations of texts.
Additionally, exploring the relationships of particular events or a series of events
to other literary elements, such as conflict, provides opportunities to examine how
these plot relationships contribute to meaning. Furthermore, students develop a
more sophisticated understanding of structure as they analyze part-to-part and
part-to-whole relationships in texts, which may involve contrasts, and develop
interpretations considering these structural relationships. The following table
provides examples of questions and instructional activities for implementing this skill in the course.
Skills
Key Questions
Sample Instructional Activity
3.A: Identify and describe how plot orders events in a narrative.
Bullet To what degree does a plot’s ordering of events reflect a chronological sequence?
§Bullet Which plot event(s) seems to break an established chronological sequence, and where does this event fit into the chronology of other events?
Divide students into groups of three or four and give them a list of plot events from
Shelley’s Frankenstein. The events should be in the order in which they appear in the novel and include the chapter in which they appear.
Have students discuss and work together to create a chronological timeline, placing the events in the appropriate position on the timeline. Students should frequently refer to the novel to help them determine placement of events relative to one another. Then, on their timelines, have students indicate with a symbol events that were presented outside the chronology established in chapter 1.
3.B: Explain the function of a particular sequence of events in a plot.
Bullet How does a particular sequence of events affect the presentation and/or development of characters and conflict?
Bullet How does a particular sequence of events and the manner in which a text presents those events to a reader affect a reader’s experience with the text?
Bullet What is the relationship between a particular sequence of events and a text’s structure as a whole?
As students read chapters 11–16 of Shelley’s
Frankenstein (the creature’s account after his creation), have them use a double-entry journal to analyze the events of these chapters. Ask students to select particular events from these chapters that seem to have significant relationships to characters and conflicts, placing summaries or excerpts of
these events on the left side of the journal entry, and then use the space on the right to respond to the events. After completing the double-entry journals, have students form small groups to discuss how the sequence of events they identified in their journals contributed to their understanding of the creature and the role of these particular chapters in the overall structure of the novel.

3.C: Explain the function of structure in a text.
§Bullet How does a text’s organization and arrangement of ideas and details in lines, stanzas, sentences, paragraphs, chapters, or other sections of text contribute to a text’s structure?
Bullet How does a poem’s rhythm and/or rhyme contribute to its structure?
§Bullet What is the organizing principle in a section of text that makes it a cohesive unit?
Bullet What is the relationship of a section of a text to the text’s setting, character, plot, conflict, point of view, thematic idea, or other literary elements?
Bullet What is the relationship of a section of a text to other sections of the text?
Bullet What is the relationship of a section of a text to the text as a whole?
Divide the text of Hughes’s “Theme for English B” according to its stanzas, with larger stanzas subdivided according to idea development. Then place the divided text on strips of paper and put the strips in an envelope. Before students read the poem in its proper organizational structure, give them the envelope and have them, in small groups, analyze the strips of paper to determine how to organize the poem’s ideas.
As they organize, students should discuss the ideas represented in each stanza and their relationship to those in surrounding stanzas.
After organizing the poem, have students read their versions of the poem and discuss the organization. Finally, ask them to read the poem in its actual order and discuss the differences between their arrangement of the poem and the original and the function of the stanzas.
3.D: Explain the function of contrasts within a text.
§Bullet What are some striking contrasts in a text?
Bullet How do you identify contrasts, shifts, and juxtapositions in a text?
§Bullet How might a contrast indicate a conflict of values?
Bullet What ideas, traits, or values are emphasized in a contrast?
Bullet How does a contrast contribute to complexity in a text?
§Bullet How does a contrast contribute to meaning in a text?
Shelley’s Frankenstein is filled with meaningful contrasts, such as Professors Krempe and Waldman, the laboratory and nature, light and dark, Clerval and Victor, Geneva and Inglostadt, etc. As students read Frankenstein, ask them to note in a double-entry journal the contrasts they encounter, noting the contrasts on the left side, and on the right side of the journal, asking inferential questions about how those contrasts emphasize ideas, traits, or values and contribute to meaning.
3.E: Explain the function of a significant event or related set of significant events in a plot.
§Bullet Which event in a plot has a significant relationship to a character, conflict, another event, thematic idea, etc., and what is the relationship?
Bullet How is an event in a plot a cause or effect of another event?
§Bullet How does an event or related set of events cause, develop, or resolve a conflict?
§Bullet How can an event or related set of events represent competing value systems?
§Bullet How does an event create anticipation or suspense in a reader?
§Bullet How does an event or related set of events contribute to meaning in the whole work?
Using Frankenstein, ask students to analyze the most significant event of the novel. Divide students into four or five groups. In their small groups, have them brainstorm a list of events and choose one event they consider to be the most significant. Then ask students to use textual evidence from the novel to develop an argument that declares the event to be the most significant in the novel. Finally, in an informal debate, have students present their arguments for their most significant event, using textual evidence as support for their reasoning.

Bullet How might a conflict represent opposing motivations or values?
Bullet How might a conflict arise from a contrast?
§Bullet What is the relationship of a particular conflict to other conflicts?
Bullet How does the resolution or continuation of a conflict affect a character, plot, narrator, or speaker, etc.?
Bullet How does the resolution or continuation of a conflict affect a reader’s experience with the text?
Bullet How does a conflict contribute to meaning in the whole work?
After they’ve read Frankenstein, divide students into small groups. Assign each group particular characters from the novel.
Then ask them to create a tableau of these characters that portrays the conflicts among the characters. Before creating the tableau, have students engage in close reading of the novel and use a graphic organizer to gather ideas about the characters’ conflicts.
Next, ask students to determine how to portray these conflicts through body poses and placement among each other. As each group performs the tableau, other students should attempt to determine the characters and conflicts in the tableau. Have the group performing the tableau conduct a debrief to discuss how their portrayal demonstrates particular conflicts and how the conflicts contribute to meaning in the novel.

Skill Category 4: Explain the function of the narrator or speaker
Analyzing the narrators and speakers of texts includes more than the simpler tasks
of identifying and describing narrators and speakers or identifying the points of view
in which texts are narrated. Through their analysis of texts’ narrators and speakers,
students explore how the points of view in texts contribute to interpretations.
Furthermore, students build an understanding that narrators and speakers reveal
their perspectives (which also inform their reliability) in the texts they narrate
and influence readers’ interpretations. The following table provides examples of
questions and instructional activities for implementing this skill in the course.
Skills
Key Questions
Sample Instructional Activity
4.A: Identify and describe the narrator or speaker of a text.
§Bullet Who is the narrator or speaker of a text?
Bullet Which details from the text indicate the identity of the narrator or speaker?
After students read Hughes’s “Theme for English B,” place them in pairs to role-play a conversation between the speaker and the instructor. After the process, students should make a T-chart of details about the speaker’s life and attributes of his character on one side and his instructor and classmates on the other. How is this speaker different from the instructor and other classmates? What does the speaker conclude about his observations?
4.B: Identify and explain the function of point of view in a narrative.
§Bullet What is the difference between a first person point of view and third-person point of view, and how does the particular point of view used in a text affect the details and information presented to a reader?
§Bullet How does a narrator’s distance from the events of a narrative affect the details and information presented to a reader?
§Bullet How does a shift in point of view contribute to the development of a literary element (e.g., character, conflict, tone, theme) and contribute to meaning?
After students read chapters 11–16 of Shelley’s Frankenstein, which detail the creature’s account of events, divide students into small groups and assign a chapter to analyze. Have each group develop a series of questions that focus on the details the creature offers in his account. Have each group use its questions to facilitate a large group discussion that ultimately focuses on how the novel’s shift in point of view affects the creature’s characterization.
4.C: Identify and describe details, diction, or syntax in a text that reveal a narrator’s or speaker’s perspective.

§Bullet What is a narrator’s or speaker’s tone toward a particular subject, and which diction, imagery, details, and syntax in the text contribute to that tone?
Bullet What is the relationship between a narrator’s or speaker’s tone toward a particular subject and their perspective, more generally?
§Bullet How does a narrator’s or speaker’s background and perspective shape a tone toward a particular subject?
Bullet How do the diction, imagery, details, and syntax in a text support multiple tones?
Bullet How might a change in tone toward a particular subject over the course of a text indicate a narrator’s or speaker’s change?
As students read “Theme for English B,” ask them to identify the diction, imagery, details, connotative and figurative language, and syntactical elements that contribute to the speaker’s tone throughout the poem, noting these aspects on a graphic organizer.
Then have groups discuss the relationship of these tones to the speaker’s perspective and what information from the poem contributes to the reader’s understanding of the speaker’s perspective.

Bullet To what extent can a narrator or speaker of a first-person point of view narrative be trusted?
Bullet How might a third-person point of view narrator or speaker be more reliable than a first-person point of view narrator or speaker?
§Bullet How does a narrator’s or speaker’s inclusion or exclusion of particular details affect their reliability?
Bullet To what degree is the narrator or speaker of a first-person point of view narrative aware of their own biases?
Bullet What is the relationship of a narrator’s or speaker’s reliability and a reader’s understanding of a character’s motivations?
Using the jigsaw strategy, have students analyze how Frankenstein offers three narrators, all of whom offer a first-person account of events in the novel. The “expert” groups should analyze the separate narrative accounts, and the base groups should discuss the experts’ findings. Then have the base groups explore the complexity of Walton relaying the entire account and Victor presenting his and the creature’s accounts to Walton.

Skill Category 5: Explain the function of word choice, imagery, and symbols
Developing an interpretation of literature includes an understanding of how words
and phrases denote literal meaning and connote associations and representations
that convey figurative meaning. Always attending to the literal meaning conveyed
in the texts they analyze, students develop interpretations of literature by exploring
how word choice, imagery, and symbols propose particular associations and
representations beyond the physical and into the abstract. The following table
provides examples of questions and instructional activities for implementing this skill in the course.
Skills
Key Questions
Sample Instructional Activity
5.A: Distinguish between the literal and figurative meanings of words and phrases.
§Bullet What are the denotations of specific words and phrases in a text?
§Bullet How does knowing the denotative meaning of specific words and phrases in a text facilitate a literal understanding of the text?
Bullet What are the connotations, representations, and associations of specific words or phrases in a text?
§Bullet How does considering the connotations, representations, and associations of specific words or phrases in a text convey figurative meaning and facilitate an interpretation of the text?
Bullet Which literal objects, images, and events in a text convey figurative meaning through representations and associations?
Bullet How do multiple literal and/or figurative meanings in a text create ambiguity?
Using Hughes’s “Theme for English B,” have students engage in sentence unpacking by highlighting phrases in the poem in which a literal reading seems incomplete or unusual (e.g., “hear you, hear me—we two—you, me, talk on this page”). For each marked phrase, have students explain a figurative meaning of the phrase and how they arrived at that meaning.
5.B: Explain the function of specific words and phrases in a text.
Bullet Which repeated sound, word, or phrase in a text emphasizes an idea or association, and what is the emphasized idea or association?
Bullet How do you trace a referent to its antecedent, and how might ambiguous referents affect an interpretation of a text?
Bullet How do the relationships between adjectives and adverbs and the words they modify affect a reader’s interaction with the text?
§Bullet How does the use of hyperbole and understatement convey a particular perspective of their subjects?
§Bullet How do words and phrases create ambiguous meanings and invite multiple interpretations of a text?
After reading Hughes’s “Theme for English B,” give each student an index card with a phrase written on the front. Some of the phrases on the index cards should include the following:
“And let that page come out of you—” “Then, it will be true,” “hear you, hear me—we two—you, me, talk on this page,” “(I hear New
York, too.)” and “Me—who?” Give students five minutes to fill the back of the index card with their explanation of literal and figurative meanings of these phrases.

Bullet How can an object, action, or event represent multiple ideas or concepts?
Bullet Which symbol in a text is present in other texts, and how is the symbol’s meaning(s) in this text similar to or different from its meaning(s) in other texts?
Bullet How do these symbolic objects, actions, events, characters, and settings contribute to a text’s complexity and to the meaning of the work as a whole?
After they’ve read Frankenstein, divide students into small groups. Have each group brainstorm what the creature symbolizes, analyzing the images, figurative language, tones, and thematic ideas to inform and support their interpretations. After developing ideas, each group should then use large poster paper and markers to create a visual that captures the creature’s symbolic function in Frankenstein.
5.D: Identify and explain the function of an image or imagery.

§Bullet Which words contribute to the sensory details in an image?
Bullet How might an image form a comparison through associations made with the senses?
Bullet What does a set of images have in common so that the images work together?
Bullet What associations do images or imagery evoke?
Bullet How do images and/or imagery emphasize ideas in a portion of text or throughout a text?
Pose the following question about
Frankenstein: “How might the glacier serve as the ‘appropriate’ meeting point for Victor and the creature?” Help students identify descriptions and images in chapter 10 they find significant. Then help them explore ideas about how the imagery might be associated with Victor’s frame of mind and the confrontation that occurs.

Skill Category 6: Explain the function of comparison
So often literature depends on comparison to convey figurative meaning; yet,
because it is frequently assumed that they can easily interpret comparisons,
students may not receive instruction in how comparisons work. By breaking
down—and thus, demystifying—the reasoning processes involved in interpreting
comparisons, teachers can help students’ understanding of texts move from literal
comprehension to interpreting figurative meaning. The following table provides
examples of questions and instructional activities for implementing this skill in the course.
Skills
Key Questions
Sample Instructional Activity
6.A: Identify and explain the function of a simile.
§Bullet Which two elements are being compared in a particular simile?
Bullet What is significant about the selection of the objects being compared?
Bullet How does a comparison through a simile contribute to meaning in the text?
After they’ve read Shelley’s Frankenstein, provide students with a double-entry journal that contains several similes from the novel in the first column. In the second column, have students explain the figurative meaning each simile conveys in its excerpt, the significance of the selected objects for comparison, and how they arrived at their interpretations.
6.B: Identify and explain the function of a metaphor.
§Bullet Which two elements are being compared in a particular metaphor?
Bullet What is significant about the selection of the objects being compared and their particular traits, qualities, or characteristics?
Bullet How does a comparison through a metaphor contribute to meaning in the text?
Bullet How might the figurative meaning of a metaphor depend on the context in which it is presented?
Bullet How does an extended metaphor continue a comparison in several portions of text?
Bullet How does a metaphorical comparison contribute to the figurative meaning of a character, conflict, setting, theme, etc.?
Have students read several Frankenstein excerpts in which the creature is called a daemon. Ask them to then examine definitions of the word daemon and demon.
Next, ask student pairs to prepare for a literary argument in which they will analyze the meaning of the creature’s comparison to a daemon (demon) and how this metaphor contributes to meaning in the work.
6.C: Identify and explain the function of personification.
Bullet Which nonhuman entity is described with or ascribed human traits, and what are the specific human traits?
§Bullet How does making a comparison between a nonhuman entity and some human trait characterize the nonhuman entity and convey meaning?
Bullet How does a narrator, speaker, or character convey an attitude toward a nonhuman entity by personifying it?
Have students analyze Hughes’s “Theme for English B,” focusing their attention on the “connotation” portion of the strategy.
Students should examine the following lines:
“I feel and see and hear, Harlem, I hear you.
/ hear you, hear me—we two—you, me, talk on this page.” Ask them to engage in a close reading of these lines to understand how the personification of Harlem and New York in these lines conveys meaning.

§Bullet Where does the text make a direct or subtle reference to a person, place, object, event, literary work, or idea that is culturally, historically, and/or literarily consequential?
§Bullet What is the background of the person, place, object, event, literary work, or idea that is referenced in the text?
Bullet What are the points of comparison between the person, place, object, event, literary work, or idea that is referenced in the text and some aspect of the text?
Bullet How does an allusion affect a reader’s experience with a text? What is the effect of an allusion on a reader who understands it? What aspects of meaning are lost by readers who fail to recognize or comprehend an allusion?
Write on the board the following allusions in Shelley’s Frankenstein: Adam, Dante, fallen angel, and Prometheus. Then ask students to work in small groups to consult online reference websites to gather further background information for each word.

Skill Category 7: Develop textually substantiated arguments about interpretations of part or all of a text
Throughout the course, students develop textually substantiated arguments about
the literature they read. To build the skills necessary to develop arguments
about literature, students will need multiple opportunities to practice these skills
by approaching writing as a recursive process. Additionally, students will benefit
from an instructional approach that integrates writing instruction with the study
of literature, rather than an approach to writing instruction that disjoins or isolates
reading from writing. The following table provides examples of questions and
instructional activities for implementing this skill in the course.

Key Questions
Sample Instructional Activity
7.A: Develop a paragraph that includes
1) a claim that requires defense with evidence from the text and
2) the evidence itself.
§Bullet How do you analyze a text to develop a defensible claim about that text?
Bullet How do you develop a claim that requires a defense with evidence from the text—and is not simply an assertion of fact or statement of the obvious?
§Bullet How do you develop a claim that you can defend with logical reasoning and textual evidence?
§Bullet How do you develop a claim that acknowledges that contradictory evidence or alternative interpretations exist?
§Bullet How do you develop a claim that articulates how a text explores concepts related to a range of experiences, institutions, and/or social structures?
After they’ve read “Theme for English B,” have students create a T-chart. On the left side of the T-chart, they should list three to five thematic ideas (abstract nouns) conveyed in the poem. On the right side of the T-chart, for each thematic idea, students should identify and describe the specific ways (e.g., literary element, technique, structure) the poem conveys that thematic idea. Next, ask students to select the thematic idea with the most evidence to develop a statement that makes a claim about how the poem conveys that thematic idea. Finally, in a well-developed paragraph, each student should present their claim and explain, using textual evidence as support, how “Theme for English B“ develops the thematic idea presented in the claim.
7.B: Develop a thesis statement that conveys a defensible claim about an interpretation of literature and that may establish a line of reasoning.
§Bullet How do you write a thesis statement that clearly articulates a claim about an interpretation of literature?
Bullet
Using Frankenstein, have students create a claim that argues whether Victor or the creature is the villain of the novel. Then ask them to develop a thesis statement that includes their claim and a clause or phrase that argues for the meaning conveyed by their chosen character being the villain rather than the other character. Students should add to their thesis statements a clause or phrase that previews their reasoning—the “why” of their interpretation.
How do you preview the reasoning of your argument in your thesis statement, perhaps by considering how your reasoning is organized?

7.C: Develop commentary that establishes and explains relationships among textual evidence, the line of reasoning, and the thesis.
Bullet What are the logical reasons, inferences, and/or conclusions that justify your claim?
Bullet How do you develop commentary that does more than restate plot details?
Bullet How do you develop commentary that explicitly articulates your critical thinking and relationships among ideas rather than leaving it to readers to make inferences or connections on their own?
§Bullet How do you develop commentary that carefully explains your reasons, inferences, and/or conclusions; how textual evidence supports your reasoning; and how your reasoning justifies your claim?
Bullet How do you develop commentary that conveys your complex argument about an interpretation of literature?
Using “Theme for English B,” ask students to create an outline of their body paragraphs for a literary analysis argument. The outline should present their thesis statements and the following components of their body
paragraphs: topic sentence, evidence, commentary that explains the relationship of the evidence to the reasoning and that explains connections to the claim of the argument, and clincher sentence.
7.D: Select and use relevant and sufficient evidence to both develop and support a line of reasoning.
Bullet How can an interpretation of a text emerge from analyzing evidence and then forming a line of reasoning or from forming a line of reasoning and then identifying relevant evidence?
Bullet Which information from a text can serve as evidence to develop and support your line of reasoning?
Bullet How do you know when evidence is relevant to your reasoning?
Bullet How do you introduce evidence into your argument and indicate the purpose of the evidence as it relates to your argument?
Bullet How do you know when your evidence is sufficient to support a line of reasoning and justify your claim?
Bullet How do you address evidence that contradicts your reasoning or your claim?
Using Frankenstein, have students first evaluate the selection and use of evidence in their own drafts of literary arguments by referring to a checklist with items such as:
Bullet Textual evidence is introduced.
Bullet Commentary develops relevant connections among textual evidence, the line of reasoning, and the claim.
§Bullet The quantity and quality of textual evidence adequately supports the line of reasoning and the argument’s thesis.

7.E: Demonstrate control over the elements of composition to communicate clearly.
§Bullet How do you revise an argument’s grammar and mechanics so that they follow established conventions of language to ensure clear communication of ideas?
§Bullet How can you select organizational patterns (e.g., chronological, compare-contrast, cause-effect, general to specific, order of importance, part-to-whole) to organize your reasoning and support?
§Bullet How do you organize clauses, sentences, and paragraphs to create coherence?
Bullet How do you select and place transitions in sentences to create particular relationships between ideas and create coherence?
§Bullet How do you write sentences that convey equality/inequality of importance or balance/imbalance between ideas?
Bullet How do you select words that clearly communicate ideas?
§Bullet How do you use punctuation to indicate clear relationships among ideas?
After they’ve drafted a body paragraph for their arguments, have students type or rewrite that paragraph so that each sentence begins on a new line. Then ask students to evaluate the coherence of each sentence with its surrounding sentences. When the sentences do not demonstrate coherence, the students should add transitions. Then have students place the sentences back in paragraph structure.

Section I: Multiple-Choice
Questions 1–10 refer to the passage.
The following passage is excerpted from a novel first published in 1853.
There is an assize-town1 a locus of judicial authority in Great Britain in one of the eastern counties
which was much distinguished by the Tudor sovereigns,
and, in consequence of their favour and protection,
attained a degree of importance that surprises the modern traveler.
A hundred years ago, its appearance was that of
picturesque grandeur. The old houses, which were the
temporary residences of such of the county-families as
contented themselves with the gaieties of a provincial
town, crowded the streets and gave them the irregular but
noble appearance yet to be seen in the cities of Belgium.
The sides of the streets had a quaint richness, from the
effect of the gables, and the stacks of chimneys which cut
against the blue sky above; while, if the eye fell lower down, the attention was arrested by all kinds of projections in the shape of balcony and oriel2 a type of window ; and it was
amusing to see the infinite variety of windows that had
been crammed into the walls long before Mr Pitt’s3
William Pitt the Younger was a British prime minister.
days
of taxation. The streets below suffered from all these
projections and advanced stories above; they were dark,
and ill-paved with large, round, jolting pebbles, and with
no side-path protected by kerbstones; there were no
lamp-posts for long winter nights; and no regard was
paid to the wants of the middle class, who neither drove
about in coaches of their own, nor were carried by their
own men in their own sedans into the very halls of their
friends. The professional men and their wives, the
shopkeepers and their spouses, and all such people,
walked about at considerable peril both night and day.

The broad unwieldy carriages hemmed them up against
the houses in the narrow streets. The inhospitable houses projected their flights of steps almost into the
carriage-way, forcing pedestrians again into the danger
they had avoided for twenty or thirty paces. Then, at
night, the only light was derived from the glaring, flaring
oil-lamps hung above the doors of the more aristocratic
mansions; just allowing space for the passers-by to
become visible, before they again disappeared into the
darkness, where it was no uncommon thing for robbers to be in waiting for their prey.
The traditions of those bygone times, even to the
smallest social particular, enable one to understand more
clearly the circumstances which contributed to the
formation of character. The daily life into which people
are born, and into which they are absorbed before they
are well aware, forms chains which only one in a hundred
has moral strength enough to despise, and to break when the right time comes—when an inward necessity for
independent individual action arises, which is superior to
all outward conventionalities. Therefore it is well to know
what were the chains of daily domestic habit which were
the natural leading-strings of our forefathers before they learnt to go alone.
The picturesqueness of those ancient streets has departed now. The Astleys, the Dunstans, the
Waverhams—names of power in that district—go up duly to London in the season, and have sold their
residences in the county-town fifty years ago, or more.
And when the county-town lost its attraction for the
Astleys, the Dunstans, the Waverhams, how could it be
supposed that the Domvilles, the Bextons, and the Wildes would continue to go and winter there in their second-rate houses, and with their increased expenditure? So the grand old houses stood empty
awhile; and then speculators ventured to purchase, and to
turn the deserted mansions into many smaller dwellings,
fitted for professional men, or even (bend your ear lower,
lest the shade of Marmaduke, first Baron Waverham, hear) into shops!

Questions 11–19 refer to the passage.
The following poem was published in 1999.
To be of use
The people I love the best jump into work head first without dallying in the shallows
and swim off with sure strokes almost out of sight.
They seem to become natives of that element, the black sleek heads of seals bouncing like half-submerged balls.
I love people who harness themselves, an ox to a heavy cart,
who pull like water buffalo, with massive patience,
who strain in the mud and the muck to move things forward, who do what has to be done, again and again.
I want to be with people who submerge in the task, who go into the fields to harvest and work in a row and pass the bags along, who are not parlor generals and field deserters but move in a common rhythm
when the food must come in or the fire be put out.
The work of the world is common as mud.
Botched, it smears the hands, crumbles to dust.
But the thing worth doing well done has a shape that satisfies, clean and evident.
Greek amphoras for wine or oil,
Hopi vases that held corn, are put in museums but you know they were made to be used.
The pitcher cries for water to carry and a person for work that is real.
11. The poem as a whole is best understood as a (A) eulogy for a lost age of real work (B) plea for work to be less burdensome (C)	 vindication of the humanity of workers (D) celebration of earnest work and workers (E) defense of unusual types of work and workers
12. In context, “dallying in the shallows” (line 3) most nearly means (A)	misunderstanding an assignment (B) waiting for worthwhile work (C) lingering over satisfying labor (D) pretending to complete a job (E) hesitating to perform a task 5 10 15 20 25

(A) Rapid movement versus wearied stasis (B) Supple grace versus undisciplined power (C) Eager activity versus plodding exertion (D) Measured patience versus hopeless resignation

Literary Argument (Free-Response Question 3 on the
AP Exam)
In many works of literature, characters who have been away from home return and
find that they no longer have the same feelings about home as they once did. As
novelist James Agee writes in A Death In the Family, “You can go home, it’s good to
go home, but you never really get all the way home again in your life.”
Either from your own reading or from the list below, choose a work of fiction in which
a character’s return home is problematic: “home” is not what it once was perceived
to be. Then, in a well-written essay, analyze how the character’s response to his or
her “home” contributes to an interpretation of the work as a whole. Do not merely summarize the plot.
In your response you should do the following:
Bullet Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents an interpretation and may establish a line of reasoning.
§Bullet Select and use evidence to develop and support your line of reasoning.
§Bullet Explain the relationship between the evidence and your thesis.
§Bullet Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.

Terminus1 the Roman god of boundaries
It is time to be old,
To take in sail:—
The god of bounds,
Who sets to seas a shore,
Came to me in his fatal rounds,
And said: “No more!
No farther shoot
Thy broad ambitious branches, and thy root.
Fancy departs: no more invent;
Contract thy firmament
To compass of a tent.

There’s not enough for this and that,
Make thy option which of two;
Economize the failing river, 15
Not the less revere the Giver,
Leave the many and hold the few.
Timely wise accept the terms,
Soften the fall with wary foot;
A little while 20
Still plan and smile,
And,—fault of novel germs,—
Mature the unfallen fruit.
Curse, if thou wilt, thy sires,
Bad husbands of their fires, 25
Who, when they gave thee breath,
Failed to bequeath
The needful sinew stark as once,
The Baresark2 marrow to thy bones,
But left a legacy of ebbing veins, 30
Inconstant heat and nerveless reins,—
Amid the Muses, left thee deaf and dumb,
Amid the gladiators,3 halt and numb.”
As the bird trims4 her to the gale,
I trim myself to the storm of time, 35
I man the rudder, reef the sail,
Obey the voice at eve obeyed at prime:
“Lowly faithful, banish fear,
Right onward drive unharmed;
The port, well worth the cruise, is near, 40
And every wave is charmed.”
2A Baresark was an ancient Scandinavian warrior who fought without armor, was frenzied in battle, and was thought to be invulnerable.
3In ancient Rome, gladiators fought to the death for the public’s entertainment.

Scoring Criteria
Row A
Thesis (0-1 points) 7.B 0 points
For any of the following:
•
There is no defensible thesis.
•
The intended thesis only restates the prompt.
•
The intended thesis provides a summary of the issue with no apparent or coherent claim.
•
There is a thesis, but it does not respond to the prompt.
1 point
Responds to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible interpretation of the poem.
Decision Rules and Scoring Notes
Responses that do not earn this point:
•
Only restate the prompt.
•
Make a generalized comment about the poem that doesn’t respond to the prompt.
•
Describe the poem or features of the poem rather than making a claim that requires a defense.
Responses that earn this point:
•
Provide a defensible interpretation of the speaker’s complex perspective on aging.
Examples that do not earn this point:
Restate the prompt •
“Emerson directly addresses this process through different poetic elements
and techniques that convey complexity of the subject.” •
“In the poem ‘Terminus,’ by Ralph Waldo Emerson, the speaker has a complex perspective on the process of aging.”
Do not relate to the prompt •
“Death comes to us all and it is that fact which Emerson addresses in his
Poem ‘Terminus’.”
Describe the poem or features of the poem •
“Throughout the poem, Emerson expresses growing old as if he were sailing.
He spent his young life in port, and as he got older and older, he readies his
ship and sailed on the ocean blue. The ocean blue represented growing
older for Emerson, each breeze and each wave bringing him closer to the ‘port well worth the cruise’.”

Examples that earn this point:
Provide a defensible interpretation •
“While many people view aging as a progression toward the pain and loss of
death, the speaker in Emerson’s poem ‘Terminus’ views aging as “well worth
the cruise” as death approaches and the ship of life comes home to port.” •
“The poem describes aging as a lengthy, and a rather daming process.
However, aging and death should not be feared, the speaker views it as returning home.” •
Throughout his poem ‘Terminus’ Emerson coveys his perspective that aging is
a time to settle down through an extended metaphor, similies, metaphors,
diction, imagery and personification. Emerson explores the idea that aging is a calm time at the end of a chaotic life.”
Additional Notes:
•
The thesis may be more than one sentence, provided the sentences are in close proximity.
•
The thesis may be anywhere within the response.
•
For a thesis to be defensible, the poem must include at least minimal evidence that could be used to support that thesis; however, the student need not cite that evidence to earn the thesis point.
•
The thesis may establish a line of reasoning that structures the essay, but it needn’t do so to earn the thesis point.
•
A thesis that meets the criteria can be awarded the point whether or not the rest of the response successfully supports that line of reasoning.

Decision Rules and Scoring Notes
Responses that do not earn this point:
•
Only restate the prompt.
•
Make a generalized comment about the selected work that doesn’t respond to the prompt.
Responses that earn this point:
•
Provide a defensible interpretation of the character’s response to his or her “home” in the selected work.
OR •
Make a claim about how the character’s response to his or her “home” contributes to the meaning of the work as a whole.
Examples that do not earn this point:
Restate the prompt •
“Things are always changing—this includes places and
people. A character who leaves their home can never really
return to it as it and they are always changing. What matters is how they react to it when they do return.”
Do not respond to the prompt but make a generalized comment about the selected work •
“In Anthem, Equality leaves what he has known as his home and never looks back.” •
“Leaving home is never easy. Coming back home is even
harder. Many characters face these problems in a number of books.”
Examples that earn this point:
Provides a defensible interpretation •
“Orestes is an example of someone who returns home only to find that home no
longer fits the day to day description. …Orestes is disgusted by this and feels a need to save the city.” [Minimally acceptable thesis] •
“Whether the home represents an absence or a fulfillment, it affects how a character
reacts to certain situations. In One Day in the Life Ivan Denisovich, both extremes are
exhibited. While Shukov feels alienated by his “home,” Tsezar relies on his as a source of physical and intellectual strength.” •
“In Jean-Paul Sartre’s The Flies, the main protagonist, Orestes, experiences a
disillusionment with the idea of home when he makes his return to the city of Argos.
Orestes’ anger and frustration with the state of Argos upon his return informs every
decision he makes for the duration of the play, and it highlights Sartre’s greater
point: allowing one’s decisions to be influenced by external establishments without
independent determination is the ultimate disservice to oneself.” •
“Ultimately, Santiago from Coelho’s The Alchemist is disappointed when he comes
home to find that things aren’t the same as they once were year prior. Santiago’s
disappointment helps Coelho display his message: Focus on the present and look forward, never back.”
Additional Notes:
•
The thesis may be more than one sentence, provided the sentences are in close proximity.
•
The thesis may be anywhere within the response.
•
For a thesis to be defensible, the selected work must include at least minimal evidence that could be used to support that thesis; however, the student
need not cite that evidence to earn the thesis point.
•
The thesis may establish a line of reasoning that structures the essay, but it needn’t do so to earn the thesis point.
•
A thesis that meets the criteria can be awarded the point whether or not the rest of the response successfully supports that line of reasoning.

Scoring Criteria
Row C
Sophistication (0-1 points) 0 points
Does not meet the criteria for one point.
1 point
Demonstrates sophistication of thought and/or develops a complex literary argument.
Decision Rules and Scoring Notes
Responses that do not earn this point:
•
Attempt to contextualize their interpretation, but such attempts
consist predominantly of sweeping generalizations (“Human
experiences always include…” OR “In a world where…” OR “Since the beginning of time…”).
•
Only hint at or suggest other possible interpretations (“While another
reader may see… OR “Though the text could be said to…”).
•
Oversimplify complexities of the topic and/or the selected work.
•
Use complicated or complex sentences or language that is ineffective
because it does not enhance the student's argument.
Responses that earn this point may demonstrate a sophistication of thought or
develop a complex literary argument by doing any of the following:
1. Identifying and exploring complexities or tensions within the selected work.
2. Illuminating the student’s interpretation by situating it within a broader context.
3. Accounting for alternative interpretations of the text.
4. Employing a style that is consistently vivid and persuasive.
Additional Notes:
•
This point should be awarded only if the sophistication of thought or complex understanding is part of the student’s argument, not merely a phrase or reference.7.C7.D7.E 166
