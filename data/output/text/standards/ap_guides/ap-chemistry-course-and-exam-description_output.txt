AP Equity and Access Policy
College Board strongly encourages educators to make equitable access a guiding
principle for their AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared
students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination
of barriers that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and
socioeconomic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented. Schools
should make every effort to ensure their AP classes reflect the diversity of their
student population. College Board also believes that all students should have
access to academically challenging course work before they enroll in AP classes,
which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to
equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.

About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills
that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking AP
courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and AP
Exams are developed and scored by college faculty and
experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges and
universities in the United States grant credit, advanced placement, or both on the basis of successful AP
Exam scores—more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the content
and skills that are the focus of the corresponding
college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also
organizes the content and skills into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many AP teachers have
told us they follow in order to focus their instruction.
The intention of this publication is to respect teachers’
time and expertise by providing a roadmap that they
can modify and adapt to their local priorities and
preferences. Moreover, by organizing the AP course
content and skills into units, the AP Program is able
to provide teachers and students with free formative assessments—Personal Progress Checks—that
teachers can assign throughout the year to measure
student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students:
Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been traditionally underserved. College Board also believes that all students should have access to academically challenging coursework before they
enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP
success. It is only through a commitment to equitable
preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses:
The AP Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP
courses must participate in the AP Course Audit, a
process through which AP teachers’ course materials
are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.

=== Page 9 ===
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the AP teacher
and the school principal (or designated administrator) to
confirm awareness and understanding of the curricular
and resource requirements. A syllabus or course outline,
detailing how course requirements are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The AP
Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor; all
AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision, piloting,
and analysis to ensure that questions are accurate, fair,
and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges) and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development, College
Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher education
institutions. This feedback is carefully considered to
ensure that AP courses and exams are able to provide
students with a college-level learning experience and
the opportunity to demonstrate their qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam development process, relies on the expertise of both AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course
performance assessments, as applicable, are scored by
thousands of college faculty and expert AP teachers.
Most are scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small
portion is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly
trained, and their work is monitored throughout the
Reading for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves
as Chief Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP
Readers in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy
of the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a
curve. Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which
means that every student who meets the criteria for an
AP score of 2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no matter
how many students that is. The criteria for the number
of points a student must earn on the AP Exam to receive
scores of 3, 4, or 5—the scores research consistently
validates for credit and placement purposes—include:
Bullet The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
Bullet The number of points researchers have found to
be predictive that an AP student will succeed when placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
Bullet Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP
scores as follows:
AP Score

College Grade
Equivalent 5
Extremely well qualified
A 4

While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for
scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and universities.
To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/placement
policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/ creditpolicies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for
seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score
the free-response sections of the AP Exams. Ninety eight percent of surveyed educators who took part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an AP
Reader, including opportunities to:
Bullet Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
Bullet Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure
to the quality and depth of the responses from the entire pool of AP Exam takers and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
Bullet Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
Bullet Score from home: AP Readers have online distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects. Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
Bullet Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs): AP
Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide suggests
sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds skill instruction across units, organizes content
into topics, and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course topics and skills, create
customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.
* To report misuses, please call, 877-274-6474 (International: +1 212-632-1781).

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
Bullet Teachers and students sign in to or create their College Board accounts.
Bullet Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
Bullet Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
Bullet Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP coordinator.
Bullet Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and AP coordinators
to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following additional benefits:
Bullet Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
Bullet Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
Bullet Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student
pack. The AP ID connects student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
Bullet Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

Instructional Model
Integrating AP resources throughout the course can help students develop skills and
conceptual understandings. The instructional model outlined below shows possible ways to incorporate AP resources into the classroom.
Plan
Teachers may consider the following approaches as they plan their instruction before teaching each unit.
Bullet Review the overview at the start of each unit guide to identify essential questions,
conceptual understandings, and skills for each unit.
Bullet Use the Unit at a Glance table to identify related topics that build toward a common
understanding and then plan appropriate pacing for students.
Bullet Identify useful strategies in the Instructional Approaches section to help teach the concepts and skills.
Teach
When teaching, supporting resources could be used to build students’ conceptual understanding and their mastery of skills.
Bullet Use the topic pages in the unit guides to identify the required content.
Bullet Integrate the content with a skill, considering any appropriate scaffolding.
Bullet Employ any of the instructional strategies previously identified.
Bullet Use the available resources on the topic pages to bring a variety of assets into the classroom.
Assess
Teachers can measure student understanding of the content and skills covered in the unit and provide actionable feedback to students.
Bullet At the end of each unit, use AP Classroom to assign students the online Personal
Progress Checks as homework or an in-class task.
Bullet Provide question-level feedback to students through answer rationales; provide unit- and
skill-level feedback using the progress dashboard.
Bullet Create additional practice opportunities using the AP Question Bank and assign them through AP Classroom.

About the AP
Chemistry Course
The AP Chemistry course provides students with a college-level foundation to support
future advanced coursework in chemistry. Students cultivate their understanding of
chemistry through inquiry-based investigations, as they explore content such as: atomic
structure, intermolecular forces and bonding, chemical reactions, kinetics, thermodynamics, and equilibrium.
College Course Equivalent
The AP Chemistry course is designed to be the equivalent of the general chemistry course usually taken during the first college year.
Prerequisites
Students should have successfully completed a general high school chemistry course and Algebra II.
Lab Requirement
This course requires that 25 percent of instructional time engages students in lab
investigations. This includes a minimum of 16 hands-on labs (at least six of which are
inquiry-based). It is recommended that students keep a lab notebook throughout.

Introduction
Given the speed with which scientific discoveries and
research continuously expand scientific knowledge, many educators are faced with the challenge of
balancing breadth of content coverage with depth of understanding. The AP Chemistry course addresses
this challenge by focusing on a model of instruction which promotes enduring conceptual understandings and the content that supports them. This approach
enables students to spend less time on factual recall
and more time on inquiry-based learning of essential concepts, and it helps them develop the reasoning
skills necessary to engage in the science practices used throughout their study of AP Chemistry.
To foster this deeper level of learning, the
AP Chemistry content is defined in a way that distinguishes content essential to support the enduring understandings from the many examples or
applications that can overburden the course. Content
that is outside the scope of the course and exam is also identified.
This framework encourages student development of
inquiry and reasoning skills, such as designing a plan
for collecting data, analyzing data, creating models
and representations, applying mathematical routines, developing a scientific argument, and connecting concepts in and across domains.
Students who receive a qualifying score on the AP
Chemistry Exam may be able to take second-year chemistry coursework in their first year at their
undergraduate institution. Or, their score may fulfill
their institution's lab science requirements thereby freeing time for other courses.

Course Framework
Components
Overview
This course framework provides a clear and detailed description of the course
requirements necessary for student success. The framework specifies what
students must know, be able to do, and understand to qualify for college credit or placement.
The course framework includes two essential components:
1   SCIENCE PRACTICES
The science practices are central to the study and practice of chemistry.
Students should develop and apply the described practices on a regular basis over the span of the course.
2   COURSE CONTENT
The course content is organized into commonly taught units of
study that provide a suggested sequence for the course. These units
comprise the content and conceptual understandings that colleges and
universities typically expect students to master to qualify for college
credit and/or placement. This content is grounded in big ideas, which are
cross-cutting concepts that build conceptual understanding and spiral throughout the course.

Practices
The AP Chemistry science practices describe what a student should be able
to do while exploring course concepts. The table that follows presents these
practices, which students should develop during the AP Chemistry course.
These practices are categorized into skills, which form the basis of the tasks on the AP Exam.
The unit guides later in this publication embed and spiral these practices
throughout the course, providing teachers with one way to integrate skills in
the course content with sufficient repetition to prepare students to transfer
those skills when taking the AP Exam. Course content may be paired with a variety of skills on the AP Exam.

AP CHEMISTRY
Course
Content
Based on the Understanding by Design® (Wiggins and McTighe) model, this course
framework provides a clear and detailed description of the course requirements
necessary for student success. The framework specifies what students must
know, be able to do, and understand, with a focus on big ideas that encompass
core principles and theories of the discipline. The framework also encourages
instruction that prepares students for advanced chemistry coursework.
Big Ideas
The big ideas serve as the foundation of the course and allow students to create
meaningful connections among concepts. They are often abstract concepts
or themes that become threads that run throughout the course. Revisiting the
big ideas and applying them in a variety of contexts allows students to develop
deeper conceptual understanding. Below are the big ideas of the course and a brief description of each.
BIG IDEA 1: SCALE, PROPORTION, AND QUANTITY (SPQ)
Quantities in chemistry are expressed at both the macroscopic and atomic
scale. Explanations, predictions, and other forms of argumentation in
chemistry require understanding the meaning of these quantities, and the
relationship between quantities at the same scale and across scales.
BIG IDEA 2: STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES (SAP)
Properties of substances observable at the macroscopic scale emerge
from the structures of atoms and molecules and the interactions between
them. Chemical reasoning moves in both directions across these scales.
Properties are predicted from known aspects of the structures and
interactions at the atomic scale. Observed properties are used to infer aspects of the structures and interactions.

=== Page 25 ===
BIG IDEA 3: TRANSFORMATIONS (TRA)
At its heart, chemistry is about the rearrangement of matter. Understanding
the details of these transformations requires reasoning at many levels as
one must quantify what is occurring both macroscopically and at the atomic
level during the process. This reasoning can be as simple as monitoring
amounts of products made or as complex as visualizing the intermolecular
forces among the species in a mixture. The rate of a transformation is also of
interest, as particles must move and collide to initiate reaction events.
BIG IDEA 4: ENERGY (ENE)
Energy has two important roles in characterizing and controlling chemical
systems. The first is accounting for the distribution of energy among the
components of a system and the ways that heat exchanges, chemical
reactions, and phase transitions redistribute this energy. The second is
in considering the enthalpic and entropic driving forces for a chemical
process. These are closely related to the dynamic equilibrium present in
many chemical systems and the ways in which changes in experimental
conditions alter the positions of these equilibria.

UNITS
The course content is organized into commonly
taught units. The units have been arranged in a logical sequence frequently found in many college courses and textbooks.
The nine units in AP Chemistry, and their weighting
on the multiple-choice section of the AP Exam, are listed below.
Pacing recommendations at the unit level and on the
Course at a Glance provide suggestions for how to teach the required course content and administer
the Personal Progress Checks.  The suggested class
periods are based on a schedule in which the class meets five days a week for 45 minutes each day.
While these recommendations have been made to
aid planning, teachers should of course adjust the
pacing based on the needs of their students, alternate
schedules (e.g., block scheduling), or their school’s academic calendar.
TOPICS
Each unit is broken down into teachable segments
called topics. The topic pages (starting on p. 36)
contain the required content for each topic. Although
most topics can be taught in one or two class periods,
teachers should pace the course to suit the needs of their students and school.
Units
Exam Weighting
Unit 1: Atomic Structure and Properties 7–9%
Unit 2: Molecular and Ionic Compound Structure and Properties 7–9%
Unit 3: Intermolecular Forces and Properties 18–22%

Guides
Introduction
Designed with extensive input from the community of AP Chemistry
educators, the unit guides offer teachers helpful guidance in building
students’ skills and knowledge. The suggested sequence was identified
through a thorough analysis of the syllabi of highly effective AP teachers
and the organization of typical college textbooks.
This unit structure respects new AP teachers’ time by providing one
possible sequence they can adopt or modify rather than having to build
from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units enable the AP
Program to provide interested teachers with formative assessments—the
Personal Progress Checks—that they can assign their students at the end
of each unit to gauge progress toward success on the AP Exam. However,
experienced AP teachers who are satisfied with their current course
organization and exam results should feel no pressure to adopt these
units, which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

Science Practices

5.A
5.B
5.D
In Unit 1, students will practice identifying components of commonly used models and representations to illustrate chemical phenomena. They will construct models and representations and explain whether they are consistent with chemical theories.
Students will also practice translating between data and various representations (e.g., photoelectron spectroscopy data and electron configurations). Students should then be able to use representations (e.g., PES graphs, electron configurations, periodic table, drawings) to explain atomic structure, which is the foundation for all subsequent units.
Many of the most useful concepts in chemistry relate to patterns in the behavior of chemical systems, such as periodic trends in atomic and molecular properties. In this unit and all subsequent units, students should learn to analyze data presented graphically to identify patterns and relationships. Once a pattern is identified, students should be able to examine evidence to determine if it supports the pattern or hypothesis pertaining to a testable question.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Exam, students must be able to justify claims with evidence. This starts when students can identify the evidence needed to solve a problem or support a claim and then connect that evidence to known chemical theories. However, many students consistently demonstrate difficulty with this skill. For example, while students can memorize periodic trends, they struggle to explain the electrostatic interactions within an atom that produces period trends as well as exceptions to these trends. Further, students often have difficulty connecting periodic trends to the shell model, Coulomb’s law, and elements of quantum theory.
To combat these challenges, teachers can ensure that students have a strong foundation in identifying mathematical relationships or patterns from graphical or tabular information and that they can explain how those patterns are consistent with chemical theories and models.
Developing Understanding
This first unit sets the foundation for the course by examining the atomic theory of matter,
the fundamental premise of chemistry. Although atoms represent the foundational level
of chemistry, observations of chemical properties are made on collections of atoms.
Macroscopic systems involve such large numbers that they require moles as a unit of
comparison. The periodic table provides information about each element’s predictable
periodicity as a function of the atomic number. The electronic structure of an atom can
be described by an electron configuration that provides a method for describing the
distribution of electrons in an atom or ion.  In subsequent units, students will apply their
understanding of atomic structure to models and representations of chemical phenomena
and explain changes and interactions of chemical substances.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
SPQ-1.A
Calculate quantities of a substance or its relative number of particles using dimensional analysis and the mole concept.
SPQ-1.A.1
One cannot count particles directly while performing laboratory work. Thus, there must be a connection between the masses of substances reacting and the actual number of particles undergoing chemical changes.
SPQ-1.A.2
Avogadro’s numberN A  equals 6.022 times 1 0 to the power of 23 per mole.
provides the connection between the number of moles in a pure sample of a substance and the number of constituent particles (or formula units) of that substance.
SPQ-1.A.3
Expressing the mass of an individual atom or molecule in atomic mass units (amu) is useful because the average mass in amu of one particle (atom or molecule) or formula unit of a substance will always be numerically equal to the molar mass of that substance in grams. Thus, there is a quantitative connection between the mass of a substance and the number of particles that the substance contains.

UNIT 2
Developing Understanding
In Unit 2, students apply their knowledge of atomic structure at the particulate level and
connect it to the macroscopic properties of a substance. Both the chemical and physical
properties of materials can be explained by the structure and arrangement of atoms, ions,
or molecules and the forces between them. These forces, called chemical bonds, are
distinct from typical intermolecular interactions. Electronegativity can be used to make
predictions about the type of bonding present between two atoms. In subsequent units,
students will use the periodic table and the atomic properties to predict the type of bonding present between two atoms based on position.
Building the
Science Practices
3.A
3.B
4.C
6.A
6.C
In this unit, students will learn how to interpret simple graphical representations of changes in potential energy as two atoms approach each other to explain optimal bond length as well as why bonds may or may not occur. Students should also practice constructing representations and models for chemical phenomena (e.g., ionic and metallic solids) and using representations to make claims or predictions. For example, students can use VSEPR theory to draw Lewis structures of molecules and predict their three-dimensional geometry and polarity.
Instead of simply connecting chemical theories to phenomena occurring at the atomic level, it is important to provide explanations across scales. For example, teachers can ask students to explain the connection between electronegativity and ionization energy with the type of bond formed and the macroscopic properties of a particular substance. Students should also work with several chemical concepts (Coulomb’s law, formal charge, and resonance) to evaluate the accuracy of a model in representing both the particulate-level structure and macroscopic observations. In future units, students will use the practice of constructing and understanding molecular representations to make predictions and claims about interparticle interactions, intermolecular forces, and their connections to macroscopic observations.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Exam, students must be able to construct Lewis structures and make predictions or claims based on them.
However, students often struggle to predict the correct molecular shape or bond angle based on VSEPR and the use of formal charge. Mistakes include: using the incorrect number of valence electrons, violating the octet rule, or confusing molecular geometry with bond angles. Teachers can students with multiple opportunities to practice drawing
Lewis electron-dot diagrams, including resonance structures. Students should also practice predicting and describing molecular shapes, bond angles, and polarities from Lewis structures, and calculating and connecting formal charges in Lewis structures to the predicted structure of a molecule.

The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples

After a review of the graph of potential energy versus internuclear distance in a
hydrogen molecule, have students pair up and describe what they believe the graph would look like for various other molecules.
2 2.3
Explore Representations
Demonstrate a model of ionic bonding. Put opaque adhesive tape on top of disk
magnets to make “+” and “−” signs. Be sure to affix the tape on opposite sides for
the differing charges (so that opposite ions have opposite magnetic polarity when
arranged on a flat surface). Arrange the ions in an alternating array on the overhead
projector to show the structure of an ionic crystal. Engage students in a discussion
about malleability/brittleness, and ask why distorting an ionic crystal causes
shattering. This also introduces Coulombic forces in a visual and memorable way.
Then have students predict and identify the bonding in binary compounds using periodic trends.

Manipulatives
Have students use various sized/colored paper plates to illustrate a particular type of
alloy (interstitial and/or substitutional). Then have them engage in a gallery walk around
the room to listen to others explain the connection between the structure of the different alloys and the properties of each.

Simulations
Construct various VSEPR shapes using balloons to show the three-dimensional
arrangement of atoms in various bonding arrangements. Then use a PhET simulation
to help students see the effects of lone pairs and bonding pairs on molecular shape.
Students can work on this individually after being shown how to use the interface, or
it can be projected and examined as a class. Have students work with the simulation
to add/remove bonds and add/remove lone pairs to determine the most likely three dimensional shape and bond angles in a molecule.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
SAP-3.A
Explain the relationship between the type of bonding and the properties of the elements participating in the bond.
SAP-3.A.1
Electronegativity values for the representative elements increase going from left to right across a period and decrease going down a group. These trends can be understood qualitatively through the electronic structure of the atoms, the shell model, and Coulomb’s law.
SAP-3.A.2
Valence electrons shared between atoms of similar electronegativity constitute a nonpolar covalent bond. For example, bonds between carbon and hydrogen are effectively nonpolar even though carbon is slightly more electronegative than hydrogen.
SAP-3.A.3
Valence electrons shared between atoms of unequal electronegativity constitute a polar covalent bond.
a. The atom with a higher electronegativity will develop a partial negative charge relative to the other atom in the bond.
b. In single bonds, greater differences in electronegativity lead to greater bond dipoles.
c.  All polar bonds have some ionic character, and the difference between ionic and covalent bonding is not distinct but rather a continuum.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
SAP-3.A.4
The difference in electronegativity is not the only factor in determining if a bond should be designated as ionic or covalent. Generally, bonds between a metal and nonmetal are ionic, and bonds between two nonmetals are covalent. Examination of the properties of a compound is the best way to characterize the type of bonding.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
SAP-3.B
Represent the relationship between potential energy and distance between atoms, based on factors that influence the interaction strength.
SAP-3.B.1
A graph of potential energy versus the distance between atoms is a useful representation for describing the interactions between atoms.
Such graphs illustrate both the equilibrium bond length (the separation between atoms at which the potential energy is lowest) and the bond energy (the energy required to separate the atoms).
SAP-3.B.2
In a covalent bond, the bond length is influenced by both the size of the atom’s core
and the bond order (i.e., single, double, triple).
Bonds with a higher order are shorter and have larger bond energies.
SAP-3.B.3
Coulomb’s law can be used to understand the strength of interactions between cations and anions.
a. Because the interaction strength is proportional to the charge on each ion, larger charges lead to stronger interactions.
b. Because the interaction strength increases as the distance between the centers of the ions (nuclei) decreases, smaller ions lead to stronger interactions.

Molecular and Ionic Compound Structure and Properties
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
X  AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DERIVATION
AND DEPICTION OF HYBRID ORBITALS
WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM.
Rationale: The course includes the distinction between sigma and pi bonding, the use of VSEPR to explain the shapes of molecules, and the sp, sp2, and sp3 nomenclature. Additional aspects
related to hybridization are both controversial and do not substantially enhance understanding of molecular structure.
X  HYBRIDIZATION INVOLVING D ORBITALS
WILL NOT BE ASSESSED ON THE AP EXAM.
WHEN AN ATOM HAS MORE THAN FOUR
PAIRS OF ELECTRONS SURROUNDING THE
CENTRAL ATOM, STUDENTS ARE ONLY
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SHAPE OF THE
RESULTING MOLECULE.
Rationale: Current evidence suggests that main-group hybridization involving d orbitals
does not exist, and there is controversy about the need to teach any hybridization. Until agreement is reached in the chemistry community, we will continue to include only sp, sp2, and sp3 hybridization on the AP Exam.
SAP-4.C.4
Bond formation is associated with overlap between atomic orbitals. In multiple bonds, such overlap leads to the formation of both sigma and pi bonds. The overlap is stronger in sigma than pi bonds, which is reflected in sigma bonds having greater bond energy than pi bonds. The presence of a pi bond also prevents the rotation of the bond and leads to structural isomers.
X  MOLECULAR ORBITAL THEORY IS
RECOMMENDED AS A WAY TO PROVIDE
DEEPER INSIGHT INTO BONDING.
HOWEVER, THE AP EXAM WILL NEITHER
EXPLICITLY ASSESS MOLECULAR ORBITAL
DIAGRAMS, FILLING OF MOLECULAR
ORBITALS, NOR THE DISTINCTION
BETWEEN BONDING, NONBONDING, AND

are key factors in determining the nature of physical changes. The properties of solids, liquids,
and gases reflect the relative orderliness of the arrangement of particles in those states, their
relative freedom of motion, and the nature and strength of the interactions between them. There
is a relationship between the macroscopic properties of solids, liquids, and gases, as well as the
structure of the constituent particles of those materials on the molecular and atomic scale. In
subsequent units, students will explore chemical transformations of matter.

This unit requires students to draw upon claims made in Unit 2 about molecular geometry and polarity to support claims about intermolecular forces between molecules. Further, students will practice illustrating such claims by constructing particle representations of pure solids, liquids, gases, and solutions.
This unit also requires students to build proficiency with mathematical reasoning skills, essential for success in the remainder of the course. Students should be able to explain relationships between variables in an equation (e.g., the ideal gas law) and then estimate the approximate value of one variable within an equation when the value of another variable changes. Students will practice these skills when choosing and implementing experimental procedures, making observations, and/or collecting data to address a question. Students can then determine the accuracy and precision of the data as well as manipulate it with known mathematical equations to support their claims (e.g., concentration of a substance, properties of substances in a mixture).
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Exam (in both the multiple-choice and the free-response section), students must be able to compare the physical properties of substances and relate them to their intermolecular attractive forces.
Students often struggle with questions that require them to determine the forces of attraction that are present between molecules. Moreover, it can be challenging for them to determine which forces are most important in explaining the differences in physical properties, such as melting and boiling points and vapor pressures of molecules in the solid and/or liquid state.
Students also confuse the terms intramolecular and intermolecular forces.
Another common mistake students make is to simplify their explanations about governing intermolecular forces in a substance by using terms such as “strong” and “weak.” Teachers can ensure that students can identify an actual intermolecular force and explain its strength in relation to other forces at play.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples
below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways
that they approach teaching some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional
Approaches section beginning on p. 197 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 3.1
Demo with Q&A
Fill a long glass tube halfway with water and then layer ethanol over the top and
fill the tube, leaving one inch at the top. Have a student mark the liquid level with a
permanent marker and invert the tube (with thumb pressed firmly over the top) several
times. A noticeable volume decrease occurs, and students should hypothesize why.
Introduce a model showing the interparticle spacing between ethanol molecules and
water molecules. The model takes into account the spacing between molecules and
why volume is not a conserved quantity (unlike mass). Review hydrogen bonding as a
relevant interparticle force for this demonstration.
2 3.3
Explore Representations
Have students create particle representations for samples of solid, liquid, and
gaseous H2O. Each diagram should contain 10 molecules, and students should show
how the placement and motion of the particles varies in each phase.
4 3.7 3.8
Explore Representations
Begin by telling students that hexane does not mix with water, but ethanol does. Then
have them create a particulate representation of each of the mixtures (which illustrate
the interactions between the molecules that allow/disallow the solubility).
5 3.9
Post-Lab Discussion
After investigating three different dyes using chromatography, have students
determine which of the three dyes is the most polar based on macroscopic
observations and an understanding of the interactions between the dyes and the
solvent, or between the dyes and the paper. Then have them discuss their answers
(based on evidence) and evaluate the strengths of each other’s claims using both the
evidence and understanding of intermolecular forces.
7 3.13
Predict and Confirm
Have students use a Sep-Pak C18 Cartridge (Flinn Scientific AP8917) to separate Grape
Kool-Aid into its component red and blue dyes. Then have them compare the separated dyes
to reference solutions of common food dyes using a spectrophotometer and measure the
percent transmittance at 25 nm intervals across the range of 400 nm–750 nm.

Intermolecular forces can explain the physical properties of a material.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
SAP-5.A
Explain the relationship between the chemical structures of molecules and the relative strength of their intermolecular forces when:
a.  The molecules are of the same chemical species.
b.  The molecules are of two different chemical species.
SAP-5.A.1
London dispersion forces are a result of the
Coulombic interactions between temporary, fluctuating dipoles. London dispersion forces are often the strongest net intermolecular force between large molecules.
a. Dispersion forces increase with increasing contact area between molecules and with increasing polarizability of the molecules.
b.  The polarizability of a molecule increases with an increasing number of electrons in the molecule; and the size of the electron cloud.
It is enhanced by the presence of pi bonding.
c.  The term “London dispersion forces” should not be used synonymously with the term “van der Waals forces.”
SAP-5.A.2
The dipole moment of a polar molecule leads to additional interactions with other chemical species.
a. Dipole-induced dipole interactions are present between a polar and nonpolar molecule. These forces are always attractive.
The strength of these forces increases with the magnitude of the dipole of the polar molecule and with the polarizability of the nonpolar molecule.

Intermolecular Forces and Properties
UNIT 3
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE b. Dipole-dipole interactions are present between polar molecules. The interaction strength depends on the magnitudes of the dipoles and their relative orientation.
Interactions between polar molecules are typically greater than those between nonpolar molecules of comparable size because these interactions act in addition to London dispersion forces.
c. Ion-dipole forces of attraction are present between ions and polar molecules.
These tend to be stronger than dipole dipole forces.
SAP-5.A.3
The relative strength and orientation dependence of dipole-dipole and ion-dipole forces can be understood qualitatively by considering the sign of the partial charges responsible for the molecular dipole moment, and how these partial charges interact with an ion or with an adjacent dipole.
SAP-5.A.4
Hydrogen bonding is a strong type of intermolecular interaction that exists when hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to the highly electronegative atoms (N, O, and F) are attracted to the negative end of a dipole formed by the electronegative atom (N, O,
and F) in a different molecule, or a different part of the same molecule.
SAP-5.A.5
In large biomolecules, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

SAP-5
Intermolecular forces can explain the physical properties of a material.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
SAP-5.B
Explain the relationship among the macroscopic properties of a substance, the particulate-level structure of the substance, and the interactions between these particles.
SAP-5.B.1
Many properties of liquids and solids are determined by the strengths and types of intermolecular forces present. Because intermolecular interactions are broken when a substance vaporizes, the vapor pressure and
boiling point are directly related to the strength of those interactions. Melting points also tend to correlate with interaction strength, but because the interactions are only rearranged, in melting, the relations can be more subtle.
SAP-5.B.2
Particulate-level representations, showing multiple interacting chemical species, are a useful means to communicate or understand how intermolecular interactions help to establish macroscopic properties.
SAP-5.B.3
Due to strong interactions between ions, ionic solids tend to have low vapor pressures, high melting points, and high boiling points.
They tend to be brittle due to the repulsion of like charges caused when one layer slides across another layer. They conduct electricity only when the ions are mobile, as when the ionic solid is melted or dissolved in water or another solvent.

Intermolecular Forces and Properties
UNIT 3
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
SAP-5.B.4
In covalent network solids, the atoms are covalently bonded together into a three dimensional network (e.g., diamond) or layers of two-dimensional networks (e.g., graphite).
These are only formed from nonmetals:
elemental (e.g., diamond, graphite) or binary compounds of two nonmetals (e.g., silicon dioxide and silicon carbide). Due to the strong covalent interactions, covalent solids have high melting points. Three-dimensional network solids are also rigid and hard, because the covalent bond angles are fixed. However, graphite is soft because adjacent layers can slide past each other relatively easily.
SAP-5.B.5
Molecular solids are composed of distinct, individual units of covalently-bonded molecules attracted to each other through relatively weak intermolecular forces. Molecular solids generally have a low melting point because of the relatively weak intermolecular forces present between the molecules. They do not conduct electricity because their valence electrons are tightly held within the covalent bonds and the lone pairs of each constituent molecule. Molecular solids are sometimes composed of very large molecules or polymers.
SAP-5.B.6
Metallic solids are good conductors of electricity and heat, due to the presence of free valence electrons. They also tend to be malleable and ductile, due to the ease with which the metal cores can rearrange their structure. In an interstitial alloy, interstitial atoms tend to make the lattice more rigid, decreasing malleability and ductility. Alloys typically retain a sea of mobile electrons and so remain conducting.
SAP-5.B.7
In large biomolecules or polymers, noncovalent interactions may occur between different molecules or between different regions of the same large biomolecule. The functionality and properties of such molecules depend strongly on the shape of the molecule, which is largely dictated by noncovalent interactions.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE

SAP-6
Matter exists in three states: solid, liquid, and gas, and their differences are
influenced by variances in spacing and motion of the molecules.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
SAP-6.A
Represent the differences between solid, liquid, and gas phases using a particulate level model.
SAP-6.A.1
Solids can be crystalline, where the particles are arranged in a regular three-dimensional structure, or they can be amorphous, where the particles do not have a regular, orderly arrangement. In both cases, the motion of the
individual particles is limited, and the particles do not undergo overall translation with respect to each other. The structure of the solid is influenced by interparticle interactions and the ability of the particles to pack together.
SAP-6.A.2
The constituent particles in liquids are in close contact with each other, and they are continually moving and colliding. The arrangement and movement of particles are influenced by the nature and strength of the forces (e.g., polarity, hydrogen bonding, and temperature) between the particles.

SAP-6.A.3
The solid and liquid phases for a particular substance typically have similar molar volume because, in both phases, the constituent particles are in close contact at all times.
SAP-6.A.4
In the gas phase, the particles are in constant motion. Their frequencies of collision and the average spacing between them are dependent on temperature, pressure, and volume. Because of this constant motion, and minimal effects of forces between particles, a gas has neither a definite volume nor a definite shape.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
SAP-7.A
Explain the relationship between the macroscopic properties of a sample of gas or mixture of gases using the ideal gas law.
SAP-7.A.1
The macroscopic properties of ideal gases are related through the ideal gas law:
EQN: PV = nRT.
SAP-7.A.2
In a sample containing a mixture of ideal gases, the pressure exerted by each component (the partial pressure) is independent of the other components. Therefore, the total pressure of the sample is the sum of the partial pressures.
Two equations for E Q

Developing Understanding
This unit explores chemical transformations of matter by building on the physical
transformations studied in Unit 3. Chemical changes involve the making and breaking of
chemical bonds. Many properties of a chemical system can be understood using the concepts
of varying strengths of chemical bonds and weaker intermolecular interactions. When chemical
changes occur, the new substances formed have properties that are distinguishable from
the initial substance or substances. Chemical reactions are the primary means by which
transformations in matter occur. Chemical equations are a representation of the rearrangement
of atoms that occur during a chemical reaction. In subsequent units, students will explore rates at which chemical changes occur.

In Unit 3, students constructed particulate level representations of compounds and molecules and explained the forces that come into play when particles interact. In Unit 4, students will describe and construct equations of chemical systems and learn to balance those equations. Students should be able to identify and effectively represent types of reactions (e.g., acid-base, redox, precipitation) and then use that knowledge to make hypotheses or predictions about the outcome of a reaction. Additionally, students should be able to support their claims about the identity and amount of product yield through evidence gained with both experimentation and the principles of stoichiometry. Further, students should be able to determine the output of a reaction when the number of moles of reactants change or are in limited/excess supply. This practice of effectively representing balanced chemical equations and using stoichiometry to calculate outcomes of such reactions is critical to student success in the remainder of the course.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Exam, students must be able to demonstrate proficiency in writing and balancing chemical equations (molecular, complete, net ionic) and calculating quantities in multiple contexts using more
than just 1:1 stoichiometric ratios. Students often struggle with questions that require them to justify their identification of a particular type of reaction using an equation.
They also struggle with determining the limiting reactant using stoichiometry. For example, with stoichiometric calculations, students often make the mistake of comparing mass to mass instead of mole to mole when determining the limiting reactant.
Teacher can ensure that students practice writing balanced equations (for net ionic and molecular) and that they develop a strong understanding of the mole concept and gain proficiency with dimensional analysis. This will help them correctly calculate required quantities using stoichiometric ratios.

SPQ-4.B.1
Titrations may be used to determine the concentration of an analyte in solution. The titrant has a known concentration of a species that reacts specifically and quantitatively with the analyte. The equivalence point of the titration occurs when the analyte is totally consumed by the reacting species in the titrant. The equivalence point is often indicated by a change in a property (such as color) that occurs when the equivalence point is reached.
This observable event is called the endpoint of the titration.

Developing Understanding
Unit 4 focused on chemical changes; in Unit 5 students will develop an understanding of the
rates at which chemical changes occur and the factors that influence the rates. Those factors
include the concentration of reactants, temperature, catalysts, and other environmental
factors. Chemical changes are represented by chemical reactions, and the rates of chemical
reactions are determined by the details of the molecular collisions. Rates of change in
chemical reactions are observable and measurable. When measuring rates of change,
students are measuring the concentration of reactant or product species as a function of
time. These chemical processes may be observed in a variety of ways and often involve
changes in energy as well. In subsequent units, students will describe the role of energy in changes in matter.
Building the
Science Practices
1.B
5.B
5.C
5.E
6.E
In prior units, students developed their ability to describe symbolic and quantitative information from representations (e.g.,
Lewis structures, chemical reactions) that illustrate both the particulate and macroscopic level of a chemical phenomenon. In Unit 5, students will build on these explanations and representations by constructing and describing rate laws consistent with experimental evidence.
To that end, students will collect data by spectrophotometry and choose an appropriate mathematical routine to determine how concentration varies with time during the course of a reaction. In addition, students will examine proposed reaction mechanisms to determine if there is a match between observed experimental data and constructed rate law expressions.
Students will learn to identify any intermediates or catalysts that are included in the reaction mechanism, as well as the rate-determining step, and be able to justify their claims. To do so, students must learn to construct and analyze energy profiles for chemical reactions and identify how such profiles may change with the addition of a catalyst.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Exam, students must be able to navigate between experimental data (tabular or graphed), a given or constructed rate law, and a proposed mechanism. Students generally struggle with reading a graph of reactant concentration versus time and drawing appropriate conclusions (i.e., order and rate constant) from the graphed data.
Specifically, students confuse the units of the graphs with the units represented in the chemical equation. Teachers can ensure that students have multiple opportunities to graph concentration versus time or concentration versus rate data (using appropriate increments and units for the axes). Once students learn how to graph this data, teacher can help them analyze the graphs to determine the order of a reaction.

ENE-1
The speed at which a reaction occurs can be influenced by a catalyst.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENE-1.A
Explain the relationship between the effect of a catalyst on a reaction and changes in the reaction mechanism.
ENE-1.A.1
In order for a catalyst to increase the rate of a reaction, the addition of the catalyst must increase the number of effective collisions and/
or provide a reaction path with a lower activation
energy relative to the original reaction coordinate.
ENE-1.A.2
In a reaction mechanism containing a catalyst,
the net concentration of the catalyst is constant.
However, the catalyst will frequently be consumed in the rate-determining step of the reaction, only to be regenerated in a subsequent step in the mechanism.
ENE-1.A.3
Some catalysts accelerate a reaction by binding to
the reactant(s). The reactants are either oriented more favorably or react with lower activation
energy. There is often a new reaction intermediate
in which the catalyst is bound to the reactant(s).
Many enzymes function in this manner.
ENE-1.A.4
Some catalysts involve covalent bonding between the catalyst and the reactant(s). An example is acid-base catalysis, in which a reactant or intermediate either gains or loses a proton. This introduces a new reaction intermediate and new elementary reactions involving that intermediate.

UNIT 6
Developing Understanding
The laws of thermodynamics describe the essential role of energy and explain and predict the
direction of changes in matter. The availability or disposition of energy plays a role in virtually
all observed chemical processes. Thermodynamics provides tools for understanding this key
role, particularly the conservation of energy, including energy transfer in the forms of heat and
work. Chemical bonding is central to chemistry. A key concept to know is that the breaking of a
chemical bond inherently requires an energy input, and because bond formation is the reverse
process, it will release energy. In subsequent units, the application of thermodynamics will
determine the favorability of a reaction occurring.
Building the
Science Practices
5.F
6.D
6.E
The ability to link atomic- and particulate level phenomena and models to macroscopic phenomena is central to the study of chemistry. In previous units, students used representations, equations, and reasoning to demonstrate this ability. In Unit 6, students will develop justifications for claims made about the direction of thermal energy transfer of a system in relation to its surroundings when a temperature change, physical change, or a chemical reaction occurs. Students will construct representations of energy using appropriate diagrams with arrows showing the direction of energy transfer between the system and the surroundings. They will continue to develop their explanations of chemical phenomena by explaining how the change in energy of a system is balanced by transfer of energy by either heat or work into or out of the system.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Exam, students must be able to translate between a balanced chemical reaction and a calculation involving the energies of bonds broken and bonds formed within the reaction. In addition, students will be required to analyze calorimetry data and apply mathematical routines to calculate or estimate the heat transferred and the overall enthalpy of a reaction. In a question that asks students to apply mathematical routines to estimate or calculate the overall enthalpy of a reaction, students often struggle to determine the number of bonds that were broken and made in the reaction. Teachers can ensure that students are able to identify the bonds broken and formed in the reaction and use the enthalpies for such to determine the overall enthalpy for the reaction, in addition to their ability to represent a chemical reaction with its associated equation.

After working a few practice problems in groups with theq equals m c delta T.equation,
demonstrate that heating 40 g of copper pellets to 80°C and placing them into 40 g of
20°C water does not result in 50°C as a final temperature. Have students reason why

about the energy transfers involved in the evaporation process. Next, two beakers are
heated side by side on a hot plate. Heating a beaker with 100 g of water on the same hot
plate alongside a beaker with 100 g of 1-propanol results in very different changes in

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENE-2.E
Explain changes in the heat q absorbed or released by a system undergoing a phase transition based on the amount of the substance in moles and the molar enthalpy of the phase transition.
ENE-2.E.1
Energy must be transferred to a system to cause a substance to melt (or boil). The energy of the system therefore increases as the system undergoes a solid-to-liquid (or liquid to-gas) phase transition. Likewise, a system releases energy when it freezes (or condenses).
The energy of the system decreases as the system undergoes a liquid-to-solid (or gas to-liquid) phase transition. The temperature of a pure substance remains constant during a phase change.
ENE-2.E.2
The energy absorbed during a phase change is equal to the energy released during a complementary phase change in the opposite direction. For example, the molar heat of condensation of a substance is equal to the negative of its molar heat of vaporization.

ENE-3.A
Calculate the enthalpy change of a reaction based on the average bond energies of bonds broken and formed in the reaction.
ENE-3.A.1
During a chemical reaction, bonds are broken and/or formed, and these events change the potential energy of the system.
ENE-3.A.2
The average energy required to break all of the bonds in the reactant molecules can be estimated by adding up the average bond energies of all the bonds in the reactant molecules. Likewise, the average energy released in forming the bonds in the product molecules can be estimated. If the energy released is greater than the energy required, the reaction is exothermic. If the energy required is greater than the energy released, the reaction is endothermic.

ENE-3.C
Represent a chemical or physical process as a sequence of steps.
ENE-3.C.1
Although the concept of “state function” is not required for the course, two principles of Hess’s law should be understood. First, when a reaction is reversed, the enthalpy change stays constant in magnitude but becomes reversed in mathematical sign. Second, when two (or more) reactions are added to obtain an overall reaction, the individual enthalpy changes of each reaction are added to obtain the net enthalpy of the overall reaction.
ENE-3.D
Explain the relationship between the enthalpy of a chemical or physical process and the sum of the enthalpies of the individual steps.
ENE-3.D.1
When the products of a reaction are at a different temperature than their surroundings, they exchange energy with the surroundings to reach thermal equilibrium. Thermal energy is transferred to the surroundings from the products of an exothermic reaction. Thermal energy is transferred from the surroundings to the products of an endothermic reaction.

UNIT 7
Developing Understanding
Chemical equilibrium is a dynamic state in which opposing processes occur at the same
rate. In this unit, students learn that any bond or intermolecular attraction that can be
formed can be broken. These two processes are in a dynamic competition, sensitive to
initial conditions and external perturbations. A change in conditions, such as addition of a
chemical species, change in temperature, or change in volume, can cause the rate of the
forward and reverse reactions to fall out of balance. Le Châtelier’s principle provides a means
to reason qualitatively about the direction of the shift in an equilibrium system resulting from
various possible stresses. The expression for the equilibrium constant, K, is a mathematical
expression that describes the equilibrium state associated with a chemical change. An
analogous expression for the reaction quotient, Q, describes a chemical reaction at any point,
enabling a comparison to the equilibrium state. Subsequent units will explore equilibrium constants that arise from acid-base chemistry.

Science Practices
2.D
2.F
3.A
3.C  4.D
6.D
6.F
Building on practices from earlier units where students translated between representations of chemical systems, they will now construct equilibrium expressions from reaction equations. Students should also illustrate the dynamic nature of the chemical reaction through particulate level representations, portraying both the forward and reverse rates of the reaction equations. They will construct and describe graphs that represent a chemical system in equilibrium and connect them to their particulate-level representations and equilibrium expressions. In conjunction with their constructed equilibrium expressions, students will practice using experimental data to calculate the reaction quotient (Q) and equilibrium constant (K ) for a reaction.
Using Le Châtelier’s principle, they will also support claims made about the dominant direction of a reaction once stresses like changes in concentration, pressure, volume, or temperature are introduced.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Exam, students must be able to connect what is happening at the molecular level to a model for a system at equilibrium.
For example, when students are asked to connect the value of the equilibrium constant (K ) from the equilibrium expression to the dominant direction of the reaction, they struggle to connect the value of a large
K to a reaction proceeding essentially to completion. This lack of connection leads students to use ineffective mathematical routines and then incorrectly calculate the concentration of the product in solution.
To help students avoid this type of misunderstanding, teachers can ensure that students connect the value of the equilibrium constant to the experimental data or observations provided. Additionally, teachers can help students visualize the effects of a large or small equilibrium constant on the concentrations of all species in equilibrium.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples
below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways
that they approach teaching some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional
Approaches section beginning on p. 197 for more examples of activities and strategies.

Topic
Sample Activity 1 7.3
Manipulatives
Give groups of students containers that hold objects representing particles in
an equilibrium mix (beads work well here). Each bead represents a molecule in a
reversible synthesis reaction. The law of mass action is introduced, and students are
asked to calculate K. Each group should get the same value for K, even though the
number of particles in each container is different. Each group of students then gets
a new container that represents a mixture not at equilibrium, and they calculate the
ratio using the law of mass action. The concept of Q is introduced and then students
determine if and how they could get the ratio of reactants and products to be equal to K by attaching or detaching beads.

Demo with Q&A
Prepare a solution of cobalt (II) chloride in dry ethanol. Demonstrate various methods to
shift the equilibrium position: adding water, heating, cooling, layering with dry acetone,
adding silver nitrate to precipitate chloride ions from solution, and measuring the
temperature change of the solution as concentrated hydrochloric acid is added. As a
class, have students analyze what each change does to the predominant species in the
equilibrium mixture and then generalize patterns for Le Châtelier’s principle.

Post-Lab Discussion
After examining the K s ptables for patterns (including ion charge, ionic radius,
polyatomic vs. monoatomic ions, etc.), have students investigate the K s p of lead (II)
iodide. One drop of 0.1 M potassium iodide is added to 250 mL of 0.01 M lead (II)
nitrate. A precipitate forms but then dissolves as it dissipates through the solution.
Based on K s p,have students calculate whether the precipitate should have formed
and connect this calculation with what was initially observed. Have them determine
how many milliliters of the 0.1 M KI solution would need to be added for a lasting
precipitate to be formed. Then have them share their calculated values and agree as a class which is the best answer.

The free energy change (Delta G naught)(Delta G naught) for dissolution of a substance reflects a number of factors:
the breaking of the intermolecular interactions that hold the solid together, the reorganization of the solvent around the dissolved species, and the interaction of the dissolved species with the solvent. It is possible to estimate the sign and relative magnitude of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to each of these factors. However, making predictions for the total change in free energy of dissolution can be challenging due to the cancellations among the free energies associated with the three factors cited.

UNIT 8
Developing Understanding
This unit builds on the content about chemical equilibrium studied in Unit 7. Chemical
equilibrium plays an important role in acid-base chemistry and solubility. The proton-exchange
reactions of acid-base chemistry are reversible reactions that reach equilibrium quickly,
and much of acid-base chemistry can be understood by applying the principles of chemical
equilibrium. Most acid-base reactions have either large or small values of K, which means
qualitative conclusions regarding equilibrium state can often be drawn without extensive
computations. The dissolution of a solid in a solvent can also be understood by applying
the principles of chemical equilibrium because it is a reversible reaction that often reaches
equilibrium quickly. In the final unit, the equilibrium constant is related to temperature and the
difference in Gibbs free energy between the reactants and products.

In Unit 8, students will apply the explanations and calculations they learned in Unit 7 to the acid-base equilibrium system. Students will collect titration data and develop titration curves to represent a variety of acid-base systems. They will analyze these titration curves to describe the similarities and differences between a strong acid strong base and a weak acid-strong base titration, identify the equivalence points and the half-equivalence points, and identify the buffering regions of the curves.
Students will use the information presented graphically in the titration curves to complete calculations to find the equilibrium constant for the reactions( K a or K b) determine the concentration of an unknown, and support claims about how a particular buffer system may work when an acid or base is introduced. From these calculations and what is known about the chemical system, students will then develop explanations for how potential sources of error may have affected experimental results and associated calculations.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Exam, students must be able to use experimental data to make calculations and support claims. Students often struggle with questions that require them to use titration curves to identify the equivalence and half-equivalence points or to complete calculations or estimations of either the concentration or pH of an unknown at a particular point on the curve. They also struggle to justify the selection of an appropriate indicator for the end point of the titration. In these situations, students can struggle with unit conversion, or they can confuse half-equivalence, equivalence, and endpoint. Or, they may struggle to understand what general types of titration curves represent. Teachers can provide students with multiple opportunities to describe why titration curves have characteristic shapes for certain acid base equilibrium systems. Teachers can also provide opportunities to choose and implement mathematical routines to manipulate and interpret titration data and connect that interpretation to chemistry concepts. Practicing using the half-titration point helps to visualize and clarify ratios between acid/conjugate base.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
SAP-9.A
Calculate the values of pH and pOH, based onK w and the concentration of all species present in a neutral solution of water.
SAP-9.A.1
The concentrations of hydronium ion and hydroxide ion are often reported as pH and pOH, respectively.
Two equations for E Q N are depicted. In the first equation, E Q N: p H equals negative log concentration of hydronium ion. In the second equation, p O H equals negative log concentration of hydroxide ion.
Two equations for E Q N are depicted. In the first equation, E Q N: p H equals negative log concentration of hydronium ion. In the second equation, p O H equals negative log concentration of hydroxide ion.
The terms “hydrogen ion” and “hydronium ion” and
the symbolsH positive (in aqueous state) and H 3 O positive (in aqueous state).are often used interchangeably for the aqueous ion of hydrogen.
Hydronium ion andH 3 O positive (in aqueous state) are preferred, but
H positive (in aqueous state) is also accepted on the AP Exam.
SAP-9.A.2
Water autoionizes with an equilibrium constant K w,
E Q N: K W equals concentration of H 3 O positive times concentration of O H negative equals 1.0 times 10 to the power of negative 14 at 25 degrees Celsius.
SAP-9.A.3
In pure water, pH = pOH is called a neutral solution. At 25°C, p K W equals 14.0 and thus pH = pOH = 7.0.
E Q N: p K W equals 14 equals p H plus p O H at 25 degrees Celsius.
SAP-9.A.4
The value of K w is temperature dependent, so the pH of pure, neutral water will deviate from 7.0 at temperatures other than 25°C.

Calculate pH and pOH based on concentrations of all species in a solution of a strong acid or a strong base.
SAP-9.B.1
Molecules of a strong acid  (e.g., H C l, H
B r, H I, H C l O 4, H 2 S O 4, and H N O 3. will completely ionize in aqueous solution to produce hydronium ions. As such, the concentration
ofH 3 O positive in a strong acid solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong acid, and thus the pH of the strong acid solution is easily calculated.
SAP-9.B.2
When dissolved in solution, strong bases (e.g., group I and II hydroxides) completely dissociate to produce hydroxide ions. As such, the
concentration of O H negative in a strong base solution is equal to the initial concentration of the strong base, and thus the pOH (and pH) of the strong base solution is easily calculated.

SAP-9.C
Explain the relationship among pH, pOH, and concentrations of all species in a solution of a monoprotic weak acid or weak base.
SAP-9.C.1
Weak acids react with water to produce hydronium ions. However, molecules of a weak acid will only partially ionize in this way.
In other words, only a small percentage of the molecules of a weak acid are ionized in a
solution. Thus, the concentration ofH 3 O positive is much less than the initial concentration of the molecular acid, and the vast majority of the acid molecules remain un-ionized.
SAP-9.C.2
A solution of a weak acid involves equilibrium between an un-ionized acid and its conjugate base. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is K a often reported as p K a.The pH of a weak acid solution can be determined from the initial acid concentration and thep K a.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
SAP-9.E
Explain results from the titration of a mono- or polyprotic acid or base solution, in relation to the properties of the solution and its components.
SAP-9.E.1
An acid-base reaction can be carried out under controlled conditions in a titration. A titration curve, plotting pH against the volume of titrant added, is useful for summarizing results from a titration.
SAP-9.E.2
At the equivalence point, the number of moles of titrant added is equal to the number of moles of analyte originally present. This relationship can be used to obtain the concentration of the
analyte. This is the case for titrations of strong acids/bases and weak acids/bases.
SAP-9.E.3
For titrations of weak acids/bases, it is useful to consider the point halfway to the equivalence point, that is, the half-equivalence point. At this point, there are equal concentrations of each species in the conjugate acid-base pair,
for example, for a weak acidConcentration of H A equals concentration of A negative.

Becausep H equals p K a and bas a when the conjugate acid e have equal concentrations, the p K a can be determined from the pH at the half equivalence point in a titration.

Rationale: Such computations for titration of monoprotic acids are within the scope of the course, as is qualitative reasoning regarding what species are present in large versus small concentrations at any point in titration of a polyprotic acid. However, additional computations of the concentration of each species

The pH of the buffer is related to thep K aof the acid and the concentration ratio of the conjugate acid-base pair. This relation is a consequence of the equilibrium expression associated with the dissociation of a weak acid, and is described by the Henderson-
Hasselbalch equation. Adding small amounts of acid or base to a buffered solution does not significantly change the ratio of

Concentration of A negative over concentration of H A. and thus does not significantly change the solution pH. The change in pH on addition of acid or base to a buffered solution is therefore much less than it would have been in the absence of the buffer.

UNIT 9
Developing Understanding
This unit allows students to connect principles and calculations across Units 5–8. The
thermodynamics of a chemical reaction is connected to both the structural aspects of the
reaction and the macroscopic outcomes of the reaction. All changes in matter involve some
form of energy change. One key determinant of chemical transformations is the change in
potential energy that results from changes in electrostatic forces. Chemical systems undergo
three main processes that change their energy: heating/cooling, phase transitions, and
chemical reactions. Applying the laws of thermodynamics will allow students to describe the
essential role of energy and explain and predict the direction of changes in matter.
Building the
Science Practices
5.F
6.D
6.E
To achieve success in AP Chemistry and in Unit 9 specifically, students must connect principles and calculations across the areas of kinetics, thermodynamics, equilibrium, and electrochemistry to explain and support claims about what is happening in chemical systems. Sometimes support of such claims comes from students being able to estimate an approximate value of a required characteristic of a chemical system rather than use a routine application of an algorithm.
Students are introduced to entropy as a factor that is necessary to explain why some endothermic reactions occur in spite of the lower energy that products may have in exothermic changes. Students will use particulate representations and graphical distribution of kinetic energy to describe the increase in entropy with increasing temperature. In addition, students will explore how to use Gibbs free energy for determining the thermodynamic favorability by considering the change in both enthalpy and entropy. Students will use the concepts of thermodynamics to generate more comprehensive claims about what is happening in a galvanic or electrolytic cell.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Exam, students must be able to provide an appropriate explanation of the connection between entropy, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy and the thermodynamic favorability of a chemical reaction. Students often struggle with questions that require them to reason about whether enthalpy, entropy, or both drive a reaction. They will state that both enthalpy and entropy drive the reaction by using the equation for Gibbs free energy instead of reasoning about which might be more of a driving factor than the other. Further, some students fail to connect macroscopic observational data to the concepts of entropy and enthalpy to support claims about which concept was driving the reaction. Teachers can ensure that students understand that the first step in making thermodynamic favorability predictions is to define and interrelate enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy in relation to driving chemical or physical processes. Students should be shown how the concepts of kinetics, equilibrium, and thermodynamics are connected in order to explain why thermodynamically favorable reactions might produce small concentrations of product and why unfavorable reactions can produce large concentrations of product.

Think-Pair-Share
Given a problem pertaining to thermodynamic favorability, have students think
through how enthalpy and/or entropy is driving the thermodynamic favorability of the
reaction. Have them pair up and explain their reasoning for whether or not the reaction
is thermodynamically favorable and what is driving that favorability. After the pairs
have discussed their responses, have them share with other pairs to get feedback on their rationale.

to ask as many questions as they can while the clock is running. Allow the clock to run
for as long as possible and then examine the magnesium anode after a day to see if
it corrodes away. As a class, examine the table of standard reduction potentials and
discuss where the electrons are coming from and going to in order to power the clock.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE

ENE-4.A
Identify the sign and relative magnitude of the entropy change associated with chemical or physical processes.
ENE-4.A.1
Entropy increases when matter becomes more dispersed. For example, the phase change
from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas results in a dispersal of matter as the individual particles become freer to move and generally occupy a larger volume. Similarly, for a gas, the entropy increases when there is an increase in volume (at constant temperature), and the gas molecules are able to move within a larger space. For reactions involving gas-phase reactants or products, the entropy generally increases when the total number of moles of gas-phase products is greater than the total number of moles of gas-phase reactants.
ENE-4.A.2
Entropy increases when energy is dispersed.
According to kinetic molecular theory (KMT), the distribution of kinetic energy among the particles of a gas broadens as the temperature increases. As a result, the entropy of the system increases with an increase in temperature.

Explain, in terms of kinetics, why a thermodynamically favored reaction might not occur at a measurable rate.
ENE-4.D.1
Many processes that are thermodynamically favored do not occur to any measurable extent, or they occur at extremely slow rates.
ENE-4.D.2
Processes that are thermodynamically favored, but do not proceed at a measurable rate, are under “kinetic control.” High activation energy is a common reason for a process to be under kinetic control. The fact that a process does not proceed at a noticeable rate does not mean that the chemical system is at equilibrium. If a process is known to be thermodynamically favored, and yet does not occur at a measurable rate, it is reasonable to conclude that the process is under kinetic control.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENE-5.A
Explain whether a process is thermodynamically favored using the relationships between K, Delta G naught, and T.
ENE-5.A.1
The phrase “thermodynamically favored”
Delta G naught less than 0. means that the products are favored at equilibrium( K greater than 1)
ENE-5.A.2
The equilibrium constant is related to free energy by the equations
E Q N: K equals e to the power of negative Delta G naught over R T.
and
E Q N: Delta G naught equals negative R T natural log K.

ENE-6.A
Explain the relationship between the physical components of an electrochemical cell and the overall operational principles of the cell.
ENE-6.A.1
Each component of an electrochemical cell (electrodes, solutions in the half-cells, salt bridge, voltage/current measuring device) plays a specific role in the overall functioning of the cell. The operational characteristics of the cell
(galvanic vs. electrolytic, direction of electron flow, reactions occurring in each half-cell, change in
electrode mass, evolution of a gas at an electrode,
ion flow through the salt bridge) can be described at both the macroscopic and particulate levels.
ENE-6.A.2
Galvanic, sometimes called voltaic, cells involve a thermodynamically favored reaction, whereas electrolytic cells involve a thermodynamically unfavored reaction. Visual representations of galvanic and electrolytic cells are tools of analysis to identify where half-reactions occur and in what direction current flows.

ENE-6.C
Explain the relationship between deviations from standard cell conditions and changes in the cell potential.
ENE-6.C.1
In a real system under nonstandard conditions, the cell potential will vary depending on the concentrations of the active species. The cell potential is a driving force toward equilibrium;
the farther the reaction is from equilibrium, the greater the magnitude of the cell potential.
ENE-6.C.2
Equilibrium arguments such as Le Châtelier’s principle do not apply to electrochemical systems, because the systems are not in equilibrium.
ENE-6.C.3
The standard cell potential E naught corresponds to
the standard conditions ofQ equals 1.As the system approaches equilibrium, the magnitude (i.e., absolute value) of the cell potential decreases, reaching zero at equilibrium (when Q equals K).
Deviations from standard conditions that take
the cell further from equilibrium than Q equals 1 will increase the magnitude of the cell potential relative toE naught.Deviations from standard
conditions that take the cell closer to equilibrium thanQ equals 1 will decrease the magnitude of the
cell potential relative toE naught. In concentration cells, the direction of spontaneous electron flow can be determined by considering the direction needed to reach equilibrium.

Lab Experiments
Student-directed, inquiry-based lab experience
supports the AP Chemistry course and the AP Course
Audit curricular requirements. It provides opportunities
for students to design experiments, collect data, apply
mathematical routines and methods, and refine testable
explanations and predictions. Teachers are expected
to devote a minimum of 25% of instructional time to lab
investigations and to conduct at least 16 hands-on lab
investigations to support the learning objectives in the
course framework. Additionally, teachers are expected
to provide guided inquiry-based labs for at least 6 of the 16 lab investigations.
Note: Virtual labs do not count towards the 25 percent
of instructional time spent conducting hands-on labs.
Lab Manuals
The College Board publishes AP Chemistry Guided-
Inquiry Experiments: Applying the Science Practices
to support the guided inquiry lab requirement for the
course. This lab manual isn’t required, but the teacher
manual is free and available online. Publishers of
chemistry textbooks also typically offer an associated
lab manual. Science classroom supply companies may
also offer them. Teachers should consider the course
audit requirements, student needs, and cost before purchasing or requiring students to purchase.
Lab Notebooks and Student
Workbooks
Many publishers and science classroom material
distributors offer affordable lab notebooks and student workbooks with associated practice problems and
solutions. Students can use any type of notebook to
fulfill the lab notebook requirement, even an online
document. Teachers should consider their own needs
and those of their students when deciding what type
of lab notebook to use. The ACS Style Guide, available from the American Chemical Society, is another
important resource for the lab notebook (acs.org).
Lab Materials
AP Chemistry is a college-level course, but the equipment and chemicals needed for the labs are
comparable to those required for a high school-level
chemistry course. A list of commonly used instruments,
lab bench equipment, and chemicals for AP Chemistry can be found in the appendix of the AP Chemistry
Guided-Inquiry Experiments: Applying the Science
Practices lab manual. A supportive school and district
will help provide an adequate learning environment in
which to conduct lab investigations. Most lab manuals
provide a list of materials and equipment needed for
each lab investigation. Before purchasing, teachers should consult their lab manual and calculate how
much of a particular substance may be needed for the number of students they have.
It is important that the AP Chemistry lab program be
adapted to local conditions and funding even while it
aims to offer students a well-rounded experience with
experimental chemistry. Adequate lab facilities should be provided so that each student has a work space
where equipment and materials can be left overnight
if necessary. Students will need access to basic lab equipment and glassware (e.g., beakers, Bunsen
burners, and balances) in addition to some specialized equipment, such as spectrophotometers and pH meters, to complete the recommended labs. None of
the recommended labs requires the use of probes or
computer sensors for data collection, which are more
expensive tools, though they can be used if available.
It’s recommended that teachers have a computer and projector to show computer-based animations and
simulations for many of the prelab activities for lab
investigations. However, a paper-based alternative
can easily be provided if the equipment is unavailable.
Students may use computers or graphing calculators to
analyze data and present their findings, but they do not need to do so.
There are avenues that teachers can explore as a
means of getting access to more expensive equipment,
such as computers, spectrophotometers, high-quality analytical balances, and probes. Equipment like spectrophotometers can often be rented for short
periods of time from instrument suppliers. Chemical
companies often have equipment that classrooms can borrow; company representatives should have this
information. Alternatively, local colleges or universities
may allow high school students to complete a lab as a
field trip on their campus, or they may allow teachers to borrow their equipment. They may even donate

their old equipment. Some schools have partnerships
with local businesses that can help with lab equipment and materials. There are many grant programs that
teachers can apply to for funds to purchase equipment
and supplies, including Hach grants from the American
Chemical Society. Teachers can also utilize online donation sites such as Donors Choose and Adopt-A-
Classroom.
Lab Time
To qualify for accreditation by the American Chemical
Society, college chemistry departments typically
schedule a weekly lab period of three hours. It is
critical that lab work is an important part of an AP
Chemistry course so that it is comparable to a college
general chemistry course. Data shows that increased
lab time is correlated with higher AP scores. Flexible or
modular scheduling must be implemented in order to meet the time requirements.
Recommended Experiments
The AP Chemistry Exam directly assesses the learning
objectives of the course framework, which means the
inclusion of appropriate experiments aligned with those
learning objectives is important for student success.
Teachers should select experiments that provide
students with the broadest lab experience possible.
The following is a list of recommended labs that
includes the associated techniques that students will
practice in that particular lab. Upon completion of
the lab program, students should be able to describe
how to collect data, reduce data to form conclusions,
and identify and discuss relevant sources of error.
Students should report recorded data and quantitative conclusions drawn from the data with appropriate
precision (i.e., significant figures). Students should
also develop an understanding of how changes in the
design of the experiments would impact the validity
and accuracy of their results. Many questions on the
AP Exam are written in an experimental context, so
these skills will prove invaluable for both concept comprehension and exam performance.
Use the absorption of light to determine the identity
and/or concentration of an analyte in solution. This
includes understanding how the quantities in Beer’s law
relate to the experimental setup, selecting a wavelength that will generate unambiguous data regarding the chemical species of interest, and using standard
solutions to generate a calibration curve or measure the molar absorptivity.
Use differences in intermolecular forces to separate a mixture into its components or to determine the
identity of components of a mixture. This includes
using chromatography to separate and quantitatively identify the various components of a mixture.
Determine the formula of a compound by measuring
the stoichiometry of the reaction of that compound with known reagents. This includes understanding
how the product will be collected and massed (e.g.,
collection of evolved gas or filtering and washing of a
solid) and how the data collected allows determination of the reaction stoichiometry.
Use gravimetric analysis to determine the amount
of an analyte in a mixture. This includes selecting a
reagent that will selectively precipitate the chemical species of interest and understanding how the
solubility of the precipitate influences the experimental
uncertainty and how to collect and mass the precipitate.
Use titration to determine the concentration of an
analyte in a solution. This includes understanding
how precise volumes of reactants can be effectively
dispensed, knowing how to evaluate when the end point
of the titration is reached from various means (e.g.,
change in color or conductivity), and understanding
how to utilize reaction stoichiometry to determine analyte concentrations.
Determine the rate law of a chemical reaction. This
includes selecting an appropriate measure of reaction
rate or concentration (e.g., pressure, mass, color) and
determining the rate law from either the time trace of
concentration versus time or the dependence of initial rate on initial concentrations.
Use calorimetry to determine the change in enthalpy
of a process. Experiments may be limited to constant
pressure and include heating/cooling, phase transition,
dissolution of a solid, and chemical reactions. Students should understand how to identify the subsystems
involved in the heat exchange, how to use the measured
temperature changes to determine the amount of heat exchanged, and how to determine the enthalpy of the process.
Build electrochemical cells to determine the characteristics of an electrochemical reaction.
This includes preparation of a cell corresponding to the reaction of interest, measuring voltages
and other quantities to characterize a voltaic cell,
and utilizing external power sources to perform an electrolysis experiment.

Explore the impact of disturbances on an equilibrium
system. This includes determining factors that impact
the position of equilibrium and measuring how these disturbances impact the position of equilibrium.
Use titration to characterize an acid or base solution.
In addition to the aspects discussed above regarding
titrations, this includes using the data to determine
concentrationp K a or p K b,of a monoprotic or polyprotic acid or base.
Prepare a buffer solution. This includes selecting appropriate buffer components and determining the concentrations needed to meet the target pH and buffer capacity, selecting the reagents needed to
prepare the solution, and characterizing the resulting solutions to confirm that it meets the targets.
Note: Many of these labs can be broken down into two
or more labs to meet the 16 labs requirement and to
satisfy the 25% instructional time required. This is not
an exhaustive list. Teachers should feel free to build in
additional lab work that helps students develop strong procedural, safety, and instrumentation skills.

How to Set Up a Lab Program
Getting Students Started
It is possible to modify any traditional lab in order to
make it a structured, guided, or open inquiry experiment.
Designing and implementing inquiry-based labs that
support student learning can be challenging. Teachers
may want to consider collaborating with other teachers,
attending workshops about inquiry-based labs (e.g.,
POGIL, SWH, or other chemistry education conferences
or workshops) or consulting resources related to inquiry
in the lab in order to become more skilled in implementing inquiry in their classrooms and labs.
For teachers who currently do verification lab activities,
a first step toward including more inquiry in their
curriculum is to do structured-inquiry lab activities.
For example, teachers can have students work in
groups investigating a variable (mass, concentration,
temperature) over a range. Students can then observe
what effect it has on a factor, data, make a graph, and
ultimately infer an answer based on the graph of the pooled data.
To modify a cookbook lab, teachers can think
the question: What characteristics make this lab
“cookbook” rather than inquiry? Other good questions
include: At what inquiry level is the lab currently?
Toward what inquiry level should this lab move? Even
small changes to the lab can provide students with
more of an inquiry experience. Three examples of how teachers can modify common cookbook experiments
follow. Note that these are not detailed prescriptions
for complete experiments but suggestions for how to
think about inquiry modifications. For more detailed
guided inquiry labs, see AP Chemistry Guided-Inquiry
Experiments: Applying the Science Practices.
1. Molar volume of a gas. A traditional version of this lab asks students to determine the molar volume of a gas by combining hydrochloric acid with magnesium. Students are given a set amount of magnesium and a set procedure. A possible guided inquiry question could be: How does the mass of magnesium ribbon used affect the molar volume of a gas? In a guided inquiry version, all students use a different amount of magnesium
to do the reaction; they can do several trials with different amounts. Students then put their end results and calculated data on the board and analyze the data.
2. Qualitative analysis of ions in solution. In a typical version of this lab, students are given a series of known solutions and a set procedure for identifying various ions. After observing the reactions of the known solutions, students repeat the same procedure with an unknown solution. In a possible inquiry-based version of this lab, give students a set of test reagents and a series of known solutions and ask them to design procedures to distinguish between three or four ions. Different student groups will work with different known ions. Next, students share their data and the procedures they designed in a class discussion. They then use their combined data and work together to design a procedure to identify the ions in an unknown solution containing several ions.
3. Electrochemistry—galvanic cells. Traditionally, students are given a set procedure to construct a number of galvanic cells from various metals and solutions and measure the cell potential of each one. An inquiry-based way to conduct this
lab entails student groups investigating different
factors that affect cell potential, such as electrode identity or concentration of reactant solutions.
Each group studies only one factor and then groups come together to share data and discuss patterns. Students would then be challenged to
apply their learning to create the battery with the greatest cell potential.
Observations and Data
Manipulation
Students must practice making careful observations and accurately recording what they observe. Too
frequently students confuse what they see with what they think they are supposed to see. They should be encouraged to be accurate reporters, even when
Laboratory Investigations V.1 | 194
AP Chemistry Course and Exam Description
Return to Table of Contents © 2022 College Board

=== Page 202 ===
their findings seem to conflict with what they are led
to expect by the textbook or lab procedure. Proper interpretation of observations is also important.
Students should be able to find evidence of chemical change (color change, precipitate formation, temperature change, gas evolution, etc.) and its
absence (in the identification of spectator ions, for example). Students should know how to make and interpret quantitative measurements correctly.
This includes knowing which piece of apparatus is appropriate for making the measurement.
Communication and Group
Collaboration
Lab work is an excellent means through which students can develop and practice communication skills.
Success in subsequent work in the field of chemistry
depends heavily on an ability to communicate chemical
observations, ideas, and conclusions. Working in a truly
collaborative manner to plan and execute experiments
will help students learn oral communication skills and
practice teamwork. Students should be encouraged to
take individual responsibility for the success or failure of the collaboration.
Lab Safety
A successful AP Chemistry lab program will instill
in each student a lifelong “safety sense” that will
ensure their safe transition into more advanced work
in college or university labs or into the industrial
workplace environment. It is important that certain
concerns regarding lab safety be addressed in every chemistry course.§
Bullet All facilities should conform to federal, state, and
local laws and guidelines pertaining to the safety of students and teachers.§
Bullet Teachers with a limited background in chemistry
should receive additional safety training specific to chemistry labs before teaching AP Chemistry. §
Bullet Lab experiments and demonstrations should not be carried out if they could expose students to unnecessary risks or hazards.§
Bullet Students should be fully informed of potential lab hazards relating to chemicals and apparatuses before performing specific experiments. §
Bullet Storage and disposal of hazardous chemicals must be done in accordance with local regulations and policies. Teachers and students should know what these regulations are.
Basic lab safety instruction should be an integral
part of each lab experience. Topics that should be
covered include:§
Bullet Simple first aid for cuts and thermal and chemical burns§
Bullet Use of safety goggles, eye washes, body showers, fire blankets, and fire extinguishers§
Bullet Safe handling of glassware, hot plates, burners and other heating devices, and electrical equipment§
Bullet Proper interpretation of Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) and hazard warning labels§
Bullet Proper use and reuse practices (including proper
labeling of interim containers) for reagent bottles
Material and Equipment Use
Students must learn the skills necessary to use the
following ordinary equipment: beakers, flasks, test
tubes, crucibles, evaporating dishes, watch glasses,
burners, plastic and glass tubing, stoppers, valves, spot
plates, funnels, reagent bottles, wash bottles, droppers, and measuring equipment.
The list of measuring equipment includes: balances
(single pan, double pan, triple beam), thermometers (ºC),
barometers, graduated cylinders, burets, volumetric
pipets, graduated pipets, volumetric flasks, ammeters, voltmeters, pH meters, and spectrophotometers.
Processes and Procedures
Students should be familiar with the following general types of chemical lab work:§
Bullet Synthesis of compounds (solid and gas)§
Bullet Separations (precipitation and filtration, dehydration, centrifugation, distillation, chromatography)§
Bullet Titration using indicators and meters§
Bullet Spectrophotometry/colorimetry§
Bullet Gravimetric analysis

Microscale Experiments
One important change in chemistry lab instruction in
recent years has been the introduction of microscale experiments. Teachers can determine whether microscale experiments are appropriate for their students and classroom/lab space. Here are some benefits to consider: §
Bullet Decreased cost of chemicals acquisition and disposal§
Bullet Reduced storage space requirements and safer storage§
Bullet Less need for elaborate lab facilities in schools§
Bullet Greater care needed by students to obtain and observe results§
Bullet Shorter experiment times as well as easier and faster cleanup§

Selecting and Using Course Materials
In addition to using a college-level textbook that
will cover the required course content, students are required to perform lab investigations for 25% of
instructional time (with a mix of both teacher-directed
and guided inquiry investigations). Students are also required to keep a lab notebook to document all
of their lab work. Further, it is common practice for
students to work several practice problems that may or may not be provided in their textbook. See the
Laboratory Investigation section starting on page 189 for more details on lab materials.
Teachers who are beginning or adapting lab
programs can also find helpful resources online at AP
Central and the AP Chemistry Teacher Community.
The resource section of the AP Chemistry Teacher
Community offers reviews of textbooks, articles, websites, and other teaching resources. Teachers can also request advice or opinions regarding all
issues relating to AP Chemistry, including the labs.
Textbooks
The AP Chemistry course requires the use of a
college-level textbook. It is unlikely that a high
school-level textbook will cover the content and skills of the course in the depth necessary to succeed
on the AP Exam. It is important to select a textbook
that covers the content of the AP Chemistry course
as detailed in the course framework. Additionally, a textbook that focuses on skill instruction will help provide students opportunities to practice
constructing particulate representations of matter, solving single- and multi-step problems, and explaining chemical phenomena.
AP Central has a list of textbook examples that meet the resource requirements.

Guided Inquiry in AP Chemistry
Inquiry-based instruction is encouraged in both the
chemistry classroom and the lab. However, the guided
inquiry model of instruction differs substantially from
the traditional model of lab and/or classroom learning.
Instead of seeking confirmation of concepts, inquiry based labs and classroom activities allow students, with
guidance, to observe phenomena, explore ideas, and
find patterns. This allows students to answer questions they have developed themselves.
Here are some essential features of guided inquiry instruction in both the classroom and the lab.§
Bullet Learner selects among questions and poses new questions.§
Bullet Learner is directed to collect certain data.§
Bullet Learner is given data and asked to analyze it.§
Bullet Learner is given the data and told how to analyze it.§
Bullet Learner is guided in the process of formulating explanations from evidence.§
Bullet Learner is directed toward areas and sources of scientific knowledge.§
Bullet Learner is coached in the development of communication.

Instructional Strategies
The AP Chemistry course framework outlines the concepts and skills students need to master to be successful
on the AP Exam. In order to address those concepts and skills effectively, it helps to incorporate a variety of
instructional approaches into daily lessons and activities. The following table presents strategies that can help
students apply their understanding of course concepts.
Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Critique
Reasoning
Through collaborative discussion, students respond to the arguments of others and question the use of a mathematical routine, assumptions, and/ or conjectures to improve understanding, justify, and communicate conclusions.
Helps students learn from each other as they make connections between mathematical routines and learn to verbalize their understanding and support their arguments with reasoning and data that makes sense to peers.
Give students the series of steps (equations) for a chemical reaction, the rate law for such, and a list of suggested mechanisms and have student groups think about which mechanism is consistent with the rate law and series of steps. Have them discuss their predictions about what the proposed mechanism for the reaction should be. Then have groups share their proposal and reasoning for other groups to evaluate and provide feedback.
Demos with Q&A
Students make a prediction based on prior knowledge or misconceptions.
Then the teacher introduces or reinforces a chemical concept via a demonstration, by which students address their understanding or misconceptions through observations or clarifying questions.
Engages students by quickly gaining their attention and stimulating their curiosity about what is happening with the phenomena being demonstrated and addresses their misconceptions or builds upon their prior knowledge.
Students think boiling liquids will be hot. First put a sample of liquid butane in a sealed container. Then have students cause boiling to occur by touching the outside of the container; the container develops frost on the outside as boiling occurs.
Have students address their initial misconceptions through group discussion.

Representations
Students create, interpret, and/or analyze pictures, tables, graphs, lists, equations, models, and/ or verbal expressions to interpret text or data. Students observe information or create visual representations to find a trend.
Helps students organize information using multiple ways to present data and answer a question or show a problem’s solution.
Builds comprehension and facilitates discussion by representing information in visual form. Helps to identify patterns that may be used to make predictions.
Students are told the boiling point ofC C l 4 is higher than
C H 2 C L 2.Have them create one representation of the interactions of at least twoC C l 4molecules and a second representation of the interactions of at least two C H 2 C l 2 molecules at the boiling point. Have students use their particulate representations to explain why one boiling point is higher than the other.
Identify a
Subtask
Students break a problem into smaller pieces whose outcomes lead to a solution.
Helps students organize the pieces of a complex problem and reach a complete solution.
After providing students with a particular chemical reaction (and associated concentrations of all species), ask them to determine the concentration of all species once the reaction is in equilibrium. Teachers can employ an ICE (initial concentration, change in concentration, and equilibrium concentration) chart to help students work through the subtasks of this complicated problem.
Manipulatives
Students use objects to examine relationships between the objects and information given.
Provides a visual representation of data that supports comprehension of information in a problem.
Have students use molecule building kits to construct
Lewis structures. Then have them use these structures and VSEPR theory to predict the molecular geometry and overall polarity of molecules.
Post-Lab
Discussion
Students discuss the understanding of a concept to lead to a consensus on its meaning. Students discuss the extension of the laboratory protocol to other chemical systems.
Helps clarify misconceptions and deepen understanding of content. Allows students to troubleshoot errors and focus on solutions that may arise when they do the same procedures themselves.
After performing a titration to determine the concentration of an unknown, have students present their answers and compare with the “known” answer. Then have them evaluate each other’s answers and calculations to determine what (if any) errors led to a discrepancy between the experimental value and the known value.

Learning
(POGIL)
Students work in small (self-managed) teams to collaboratively engage in small activities (including data sets and a series of guiding questions) that follow the learning cycle of exploration to build understanding of a concept and then apply that knowledge or process in a new context.
Helps students develop mastery of content through the construction of their own understanding and through the development of reasoning skills as they discuss their thought processes with others.
After students review a data set regarding periodic trends, give them a series of guided questions to rationalize the data in the context of atomic structure. Then have them apply the model they developed with extended questions or additional data.
Simulations
Students interact with chemically realistic simulations and can either enter or alter parameters by which the simulation will reveal the consequences or changes therein.
Helps students visualize, interact with, and manipulate variables associated with difficult chemistry concepts and phenomena as well as particulate representations of matter.
Have students view a simulated reaction (pertaining to a limiting reagent problem).
Each iteration of the simulation provides students with different unknown concentrations of the reactants from which students calculate the amount of product that is dissolved. Have them check their answers upon completion of the simulation.
Think-Pair-Share
Considering and thinking about a topic or question and then writing what has been learned; pairing with a peer or a small group to share ideas; sharing ideas and discussion with a larger group.
Helps students to construct meaning about a topic or question; to test thinking in relation to the ideas of others; to prepare for a discussion with a larger group.
Given a problem pertaining to thermodynamic favorability, have students think through how enthalpy and/or entropy drives the thermodynamic favorability of the reaction.
Then have students pair up and explain their reasoning for whether or not the reaction is thermodynamically favorable and what is driving that favorability. After they have discussed their responses, have them share with other pairs to get feedback on their rationale.

Science Practice 1: Describe models and representations, including across scales
The ability to use models and “pictures” to explain/represent what is happening at the particulate level is
fundamental to understanding chemistry. Before being able to explain or represent what is happening at the
particulate level, students must be able to identify the components of and describe what is happening in a
model, representation, or graph of a chemical system or phenomenon.

Strategies 6.D Provide reasoning to justify a claim using chemical principles or laws, or using mathematical justification.
Students must determine how the percent ionization of a weak acid is altered by the addition of water.
Give students the percent ionization of HF at a particular concentration and volume. Ask them whether the percent ionization is altered once the volume of the solution is doubled after the addition of water.
Have students justify their response qualitatively or quantitatively.
Critique Reasoning 6.E Provide reasoning to justify a claim using connections between particulate and macroscopic scales or levels.
Students must explain in terms of KMT why the rate of a reaction increases as a function of concentration and/or temperature.
Have students observe a simulation of a chemical reaction and measure the rate of formation of product as a function of concentration and/or temperature.
Simulations 6.F Explain the connection between experimental results and chemical concepts, processes, or theories.
Given a particular system at equilibrium, use Le
Châtelier’s principle to explain the direction of shift on the system (toward reactants or toward products) as a result of a particular stress.
Have students will view an online simulation of a chemical system in equilibrium and ask them to explain what direction the reaction will shift prior to simulating a series of stresses.§
Bullet Simulation§
Bullet Predict & Confirm 6.G Explain how potential sources of experimental error may affect the experimental results.
In a particular trial for a titration experiment to determine the concentration of an acid, a student added more N a O H (in aqueous state) than was needed to reach the end point. Would this error increase, decrease, or have no effect on the calculated acid concentration?

After performing a gravimetric analysis experiment to determine the mass percent of I– in a tablet containing KI and an inert, water soluble substance, have students compare calculated values of the mass percent of I– in the tablet and identify sources of experimental error that may account for their varied results. §

Is the magnitude ofDelta H naught for the reaction to formS O 3 (in liquid state).represented above, greater than, less than, or
equal to the magnitude of Delta H naught for the reaction to form S O 3 (in gaseous state)Justify your answer.
One point for indicating greater magnitude with a valid justification:.
Bullet Greater, because the enthalpy of S O 3 (in liquid state) is lower than the enthalpy ofS O 3 (in gaseous state)(by an amount equal to the
enthalpy of vaporization of S O 3 (in liquid state)),which makes the difference between the enthalpy of the reactants and the enthalpy of the products a larger amount.

ENE-3.D (h)
Based on the information above, how does the thermodynamic favorability of the reaction change as the
temperature of the reaction system is decreased? Justify your answer.
One point for indicating an increased thermodynamic favorability along with a valid justification.
Bullet Delta G reaction equals delta H reaction minus T delta S reaction.Assuming that bothDelta H reaction and delta S reaction. are constant, as the value of T is decreased,
the smaller in value the term(T delta S reaction)becomes, making the term(Delta H reaction minus T delta S reaction)more negative. Thus
Delta G reactionbecomes more negative, increasing the thermodynamic favorability of the reaction.
