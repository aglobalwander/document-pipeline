What AP ® Stands For
Thousands of Advanced Placement teachers have contributed to the principles
articulated here. These principles are not new; they are, rather, a reminder of how AP
already works in classrooms nationwide. The following principles are designed to ensure
that teachers’ expertise is respected, required course content is understood, and that
students are academically challenged and free to make up their own minds.
1. AP stands for clarity and transparency. Teachers and students deserve clear
expectations. The Advanced Placement Program makes public its course
frameworks and sample assessments. Confusion about what is permitted in the
classroom disrupts teachers and students as they navigate demanding work.
2.  AP is an unflinching encounter with evidence. AP courses enable students to develop
as independent thinkers and to draw their own conclusions. Evidence and the
scientific method are the starting place for conversations in AP courses.
3. AP opposes censorship. AP is animated by a deep respect for the intellectual
freedom of teachers and students alike. If a school bans required topics from their
AP courses, the AP Program removes the AP designation from that course and its
inclusion in the AP Course Ledger provided to colleges and universities. For example,
the concepts of evolution are at the heart of college biology, and a course that
neglects such concepts does not pass muster as AP Biology.
4.  AP opposes indoctrination. AP students are expected to analyze different
perspectives from their own, and no points on an AP Exam are awarded for
agreement with a viewpoint. AP students are not required to feel certain ways about
themselves or the course content. AP courses instead develop students’ abilities to
assess the credibility of sources, draw conclusions, and make up their own minds.
As the AP English Literature course description states: “AP students are not
expected or asked to subscribe to any one specific set of cultural or political values,
but are expected to have the maturity to analyze perspectives different from their
own and to question the meaning, purpose, or effect of such content within the literary work as a whole.”
5. AP courses foster an open-minded approach to the histories and cultures of different
peoples. The study of different nationalities, cultures, religions, races, and ethnicities
is essential within a variety of academic disciplines. AP courses ground such studies
in primary sources so that students can evaluate experiences and evidence for themselves.
6.  Every AP student who engages with evidence is listened to and respected. Students
are encouraged to evaluate arguments but not one another. AP classrooms respect
diversity in backgrounds, experiences, and viewpoints. The perspectives and
contributions of the full range of AP students are sought and considered. Respectful
debate of ideas is cultivated and protected; personal attacks have no place in AP.
7. AP is a choice for parents and students. Parents and students freely choose to enroll
in AP courses. Course descriptions are available online for parents and students to
inform their choice. Parents do not define which college-level topics are suitable
within AP courses; AP course and exam materials are crafted by committees of
professors and other expert educators in each field. AP courses and exams are then
further validated by the American Council on Education and studies that confirm
the use of AP scores for college credits by thousands of colleges and universities nationwide.
The AP Program encourages educators to review these principles with parents and
students so they know what to expect in an AP course. Advanced Placement is always
a choice, and it should be an informed one. AP teachers should be given the confidence
and clarity that once parents have enrolled their child in an AP course, they have agreed
to a classroom experience that embodies these principles.

About AP
The Advanced Placement® Program (AP®) enables
willing and academically prepared students to pursue
college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or both—while
still in high school. Through AP courses in 39 subjects,
each culminating in a challenging exam, students learn
to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see
many sides of an issue—skills that prepare them for
college and beyond. Taking AP courses demonstrates
to college admission officers that students have sought
the most challenging curriculum available to them,
and research indicates that students who score a 3
or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater
academic success in college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each
AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by
faculty from some of the nation’s leading colleges and
universities, and AP Exams are developed and scored
by college faculty and experienced AP teachers. Most
four-year colleges and universities in the United States grant credit, advanced placement, or both on the
basis of successful AP Exam scores—more than 3,300
institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the content
and skills that are the focus of the corresponding
college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also
organizes the content and skills into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many AP teachers have
told us they follow in order to focus their instruction.
The intention of this publication is to respect teachers’
time and expertise by providing a roadmap that they
can modify and adapt to their local priorities and
preferences. Moreover, by organizing the AP course
content and skills into units, the AP Program is able
to provide teachers and students with free formative assessments—Progress Checks—that teachers can assign throughout the year to measure student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students:
Equity and Access
The AP Program strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically
prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP.
We encourage the elimination of barriers that restrict
access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been traditionally underserved. The AP Program also believes that all students should have access to academically challenging coursework before they enroll in AP
classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is
only through a commitment to equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses:
The AP Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP
courses must participate in the AP Course Audit, a
process through which AP teachers’ course materials
are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.
﻿ V.1 | 1

AP Precalculus Course and Exam Description

=== Page 10 ===
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the AP teacher and the school principal (or designated administrator) to confirm awareness and understanding of the curricular and resource
requirements. A syllabus or course outline, detailing
how course requirements are met, is submitted by the
AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The AP
Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor; all
AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision, piloting,
and analysis to ensure that questions are accurate, fair,
and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development, College
Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher education
institutions. This feedback is carefully considered to
ensure that AP courses and exams are able to provide
students with a college-level learning experience and
the opportunity to demonstrate their qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam development process, relies on the expertise of
both AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple choice questions are scored by machine, the free response questions and through-course performance
assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands
of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are
scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion
is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained,
and their work is monitored throughout the Reading
for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief
Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers
in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of
the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a
curve. Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which
means that every student who meets the criteria for
an AP score of 2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no
matter how many students that is. The criteria for the
number of points students must earn on the AP Exam
to receive scores of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently validates for credit and placement
purposes—include:
■ The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
■ The number of points researchers have found to
be predictive that an AP student will succeed when
placed into a subsequent higher-level college course.
■ Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP
scores as follows:
AP Score

College Grade
Equivalent 5
Extremely well qualified
A 4

A minus, B plus, B 3

While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for
scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and universities.
To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/placement
policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.
collegeboard.org/creditandplacement/search credit-policies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for
seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score
the free-response sections of the AP Exams. Ninety eight percent of surveyed educators who took part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an AP
Reader, including opportunities to:
■ Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
■ Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP
scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure to the quality and depth of the responses from the
entire pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
■ Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
■ Score from home: AP Readers have online distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects. Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
■ Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs): AP
Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple class selection process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and students, offering opportunities to give and get meaningful feedback on student progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each Unit Guide suggests
a sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds skill instruction across units, organizes content
into topics, and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills through
multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers, and free response questions with scoring information. Because the Progress Checks are formative,
the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher effectiveness or assign
letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
MY REPORTS
My reports provides teachers with a one-stop shop for student results on all assignment
types, including Progress Checks. Teachers can view class trends and see where students
struggle with content and skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their
own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
QUESTION BANK
The Question Bank is a searchable library of all AP questions that teachers use to build
custom practice for their students. Teachers can create and assign assessments with
formative topic questions or questions from practice or released AP Exams.
Class Section Setup and Enrollment
■ Teachers and students sign in to or create their College Board accounts.
■ Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
■ Teachers or AP coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
■ Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP coordinator.
■ Students will be asked for additional information upon joining their first class section.
* To report misuses, please call, 877-274-6474 (International: 212-632-1781).

Instructional Model
Integrating AP resources throughout the course can help students develop skills and
conceptual understandings. The instructional model outlined below shows possible ways to incorporate AP resources into the classroom.
Plan
Teachers may consider the following approaches as they plan their instruction before teaching each unit.
■ Review the overview at the start of each Unit Guide to identify essential questions,
conceptual understandings, and skills for each unit.
■ Use the Unit at a Glance table to identify related topics that build toward a common
understanding, and then plan appropriate pacing for students.
■ Identify useful strategies in the Instructional Approaches section to help teach the concepts and skills.
Teach
When teaching, supporting resources could be used to build students’ conceptual understanding and their mastery of skills.
■ Use the topic pages in the Unit Guides to identify the required content.
■ Integrate the content with a skill, considering any appropriate scaffolding.
■ Employ any of the instructional strategies previously identified.
■ Use the available resources, including AP Daily, on the topic pages to bring a variety of assets into the classroom.
Assess
Teachers can measure student understanding of the content and skills covered in the unit and provide actionable feedback to students.
■ As you teach each topic, use AP Classroom to assign student Topic Questions as a way
to continuously check student understanding and provide just in time feedback
■ At the end of each unit, use AP Classroom to assign students Progress Checks, as homework or an in-class task.
■ Provide question-level feedback to students through answer rationales; provide unit- and skill-level formative feedback using My Reports.
■ Create additional practice opportunities using the Question Bank and assign them through AP Classroom.

About the
AP Precalculus Course
AP Precalculus centers on functions modeling dynamic phenomena. This research-based
exploration of functions is designed to better prepare students for college-level calculus
and provide grounding for other mathematics and science courses. In this course, students
study a broad spectrum of function types that are foundational for careers in mathematics,
physics, biology, health science, business, social science, and data science. Furthermore,
as AP Precalculus may be the last mathematics course of a student’s secondary education,
the course is structured to provide a coherent capstone experience rather than exclusively focusing on preparation for future courses.
Throughout this course, students develop and hone symbolic manipulation skills, including
solving equations and manipulating expressions, for the many function types throughout
the course. Students also learn that functions and their compositions, inverses, and
transformations are understood through graphical, numerical, analytical, and verbal
representations, which reveal different attributes of the functions and are useful for solving
problems in mathematical and applied contexts. In turn, the skills learned in this course are
widely applicable to situations that involve quantitative reasoning.
AP Precalculus fosters the development of a deep conceptual understanding of functions.
Students learn that a function is a mathematical relation that maps a set of input values—
the domain—to a set of output values—the range—such that each input value is uniquely
mapped to an output value. Students understand functions and their graphs as embodying
dynamic covariation of quantities, a key idea in preparing for calculus. With each function
type, students develop and validate function models based on the characteristics of a
bivariate data set, characteristics of covarying quantities and their relative rates of change,
or a set of characteristics such as zeros, asymptotes, and extrema. These models are used
to interpolate, extrapolate, and interpret information with different degrees of accuracy for
a given context or data set. Additionally, students also learn that every model is subject to
assumptions and limitations related to the context. As a result of examining functions from
many perspectives, students develop a conceptual understanding not only of specific
function types but also of functions in general. This type of understanding helps students to engage with both familiar and novel contexts.
College Course Equivalent
AP Precalculus is designed to be the equivalent of a first semester college precalculus
course. AP Precalculus provides students with an understanding of the concepts of college
algebra, trigonometry, and additional topics that prepare students for further college level mathematics courses. This course explores a variety of function types and their
applications—polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, polar, parametric,
vector-valued, implicitly defined, and linear transformation functions using matrices.
Throughout the course, the mathematical practices of procedural and symbolic fluency,
multiple representations, and communication and reasoning are developed. Students
experience the concepts and skills related to each function type through the lenses of
modeling and covariation and engage each function type through their graphical, numerical, analytical, and verbal representations.

=== Page 15 ===
Prerequisites
Before studying precalculus, all students should develop proficiency in topics typically
found in the Algebra 1-Geometry-Algebra 2 (AGA) content sequence. Students should have developed the following:
■ Proficiency with the skills and concepts related to linear and quadratic functions, including
algebraic manipulation, solving equations, and solving inequalities
■ Proficiency in manipulating algebraic expressions related to polynomial functions,
including polynomial addition and multiplication, factoring quadratic trinomials, and using the quadratic formula
■ Proficiency in solving right triangle problems involving trigonometry
■ Proficiency in solving systems of equations in two and three variables ■ Familiarity with piecewise-defined functions
■ Familiarity with exponential functions and rules for exponents
■ Familiarity with radicals (e.g., square roots, cube roots) ■ Familiarity with complex numbers
■ Familiarity with communicating and reasoning among graphical, numerical, analytical, and verbal representations of functions
Technology Needs
Technology should be used throughout the course as a tool to explore concepts. In AP
Precalculus, students should specifically practice using technology to do the following:
■ Perform calculations (e.g., exponents, roots, trigonometric values, logarithms) ■ Graph functions and analyze graphs ■ Generate a table of values for a function ■ ■
Find real zeros of functions
Find points of intersection of graphs of functions ■ Find minima/maxima of functions
■ Find numerical solutions to equations in one variable
■ Find regression equations to model data (linear, quadratic, cubic, quartic, exponential,
logarithmic, and sinusoidal) and plot the corresponding residuals
■ Perform matrix operations (e.g., multiplication, finding inverses)
It is important to note that technology should not replace the development of symbolic
manipulation skills. When algebraic expressions and equations are accessible with
precalculus-level algebraic manipulation, students are expected to find zeros, solve equations,
and calculate values without the help of technology. Most of the AP Exam will need to be
completed without the use of technology. However, selected multiple-choice and free response questions will require students to use a graphing calculator to complete the tasks delineated above.
Accessible technology that has the capabilities expected for AP Precalculus is available
for students who are blind or visually impaired. This technology should be used during the
course, and an accommodation request to use this technology on the AP Exam must be made
through the College Board’s Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD).

Introduction
The course framework for AP Precalculus is
partitioned into four units. Units 1, 2, and 3 are
required and assessed on the end-of-course AP Exam and provide descriptions of what students should
know and be able to do to qualify for college credit or placement. Unit 4 describes additional topics that teachers may include based on state or local requirements. The Unit 4 topics extend and deepen
the function concepts developed in units one through
three. The Unit 4 topics are additional and excluded from the AP Exam.
The framework is organized by commonly taught units
of instruction, informed by extensive research. Teachers may adjust the suggested sequencing of units or
topics, although they will want to carefully consider how to account for such changes as they access course resources for planning, teaching, and assessing.
AP Precalculus Course and Exam Description
Course Framework V.1 | 11
Return to Table of Cont © 2023 College Boar ents d

=== Page 20 ===
The course framework includes two essential components:
1
MATHEMATICA L PRACTICES 

The mathematical practices are central to the study and practice of
precalculus. Students should develop and apply the described skills on a regular basis over the span of the course.
2
COURSE CONTENT 
The course content is organized into units of study that provide a
suggested sequence for the course. Units 1, 2, and 3 topics comprise
the content and conceptual understandings that colleges and
universities typically expect students to be proficient in in order to
qualify for college credit and/or placement, and are therefore included
on the AP Exam. Unit 4 consists of topics that teachers may include based on state or local requirements.
COURSE FRAMEWORK CONVENTIONS:
Common language usage (e.g., “area of a triangle”) replaces precise
mathematical phrasing (e.g., “area of the interior of a triangle”) in the
following instances:
■ When the framework refers to modeling a data set, it is referring to a bivariate data set.
■ When the framework refers to modeling a context or phenomenon,
it is referring to two aspects of the context or phenomenon.
■ When the framework refers to the sine, cosine, and so on of an
angle, it is referring to the sine, cosine, and so on of the measure of the angle.
Course Framework
Components
Overview
The course framework provides clear and detailed descriptions for the
mathematical practices and course content included in the course. Units 1, 2,
and 3, and the mathematical practices, specify what students should know, and
be able to do for college credit or placement as assessed on the AP Exam. Unit
4 topics are additional topics that teachers may include based on state or local requirements and are excluded from the AP Exam.

Course
Content
This course framework provides a clear and detailed description of the course
requirements necessary for student success. The framework specifies what
students must know, be able to do, and understand.
The framework also encourages instruction that prepares students for advanced
coursework in mathematics or other fields engaged in modeling change (e.g.,
pure sciences, engineering, or economics) and for creating useful, reasonable
solutions to problems encountered in an ever-changing world.
UNITS
The AP Precalculus content is subdivided into four units. Units 1, 2, and 3 topics
are included on the AP Exam. Unit 4 topics are at the discretion of the school and
teacher, based on state and local requirements. Pacing recommendations at the
unit level and on the Course at a Glance provide suggestions for how teachers
can teach the required course content. The suggested class periods are based
on a school schedule in which the class meets five days a week for 45 minutes each day, for a full school year.
Many topics within Units 1, 2, and 3 list a range of recommended days. When
a range is listed, the lower value is the recommendation based on a teacher
including all of the topics in Units 1, 2, 3, and 4. The higher value is the
recommendation based on a teacher including topics only in Units 1, 2, and 3.
While these recommendations have been made to aid planning, teachers are free
to adjust the pacing based on the needs of their students, alternate schedules
(e.g., block scheduling), their school’s academic calendar, or the extent to which
Unit 4 topics are included.
TOPICS
Each unit is broken down into teachable segments called topics. The topic pages
(starting on p. 31) contain the required content for each topic. Although most
topics can be taught in one to three class periods, teachers should pace the
course to suit the needs of their students and school.

Introduction
Designed with extensive input from the community of AP Precalculus
educators, the Unit Guides offer teachers helpful guidance in building
students’ skills and knowledge. The suggested sequence was identified
through a thorough analysis of the syllabi of highly effective AP teachers
and the organization of typical college textbooks. This unit structure
respects new AP teachers’ time by providing one possible sequence they
can adopt or modify rather than having to build from scratch. An additional
benefit is that these units enable the AP Program to provide interested
teachers with formative assessments—the Progress Checks—that they
can assign their students at the end of each unit to gauge progress
toward success on the AP Exam. However, experienced AP teachers
who are satisfied with their current course organization and exam results
should feel no pressure to adopt these units, which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

AP Precalculus Course and Exam Description
The Unit at a Glance table shows the topics, and suggested skills.
The suggested skills for each topic show possible ways to link
the content in that topic to specific AP Precalculus skills. The
individual skills have been thoughtfully chosen in a way that
scaffolds the skills throughout the course. The questions on the
Progress Checks are based on this pairing. However, AP Exam
questions can pair the content with any of the skills.
Using the Unit Guides
UNIT OPENERS
Developing Understanding provides an overview that
contextualizes and situates the key content of the unit within the scope of the course.
The essential questions are thought-provoking questions that motivate students and inspire inquiry.
Building the Mathematical Practices describes specific skills
within the practices that are appropriate to focus on in that unit.
Certain practices have been noted to indicate areas of emphasis for that unit.
Preparing for the AP Exam provides helpful tips and common
student misunderstandings identified from prior exam data.
Building the
Mathematical Practices
3.A
3.B
Throughout the course, students should practice communicating mathematics and developing notational fluency—and that practice should begin in Unit 1. Students should use precise language such as, “On the closed interval 0 to 1, as the value of x increases, the value of y increases then decreases.” To the fullest extent possible, students should work on functions presented in contextual scenarios such as graphs showing distance vs. time, tables showing velocity vs. time, or scenarios involving volume vs. time. In these contexts, students should use clear language when referring to variables and functions, including units of measure as appropriate. For example, when considering a problem of filling a pool with water, a student may write, “The input values of the function V are times in minutes, and the output values are volumes in cubic meters. The average rate of change of the function V over the time interval t equals 2 minutes to t equals 5 minutes is 0.4 cubic meters per minute.” Practicing communicating with precise language can help students clarify their thinking and make important connections while revealing misconceptions.
Preparing for the AP Exam
After studying Unit 1, students should be able to describe, represent, and model polynomial and rational functions and their additive and multiplicative transformations. Because part of the exam relies on technology, students should be able to identify zeros, points of intersection, and extrema using graphing calculator technology. Students should be able to calculate linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic regressions to model a data set. In the free-response section of the exam, students will not only be required to arrive at a solution but also explain and provide rationales for their conclusions. Students should practice providing reasons for conclusions throughout the unit in both spoken and written form and continually refine their explanations to improve precision.
Developing Understanding
In Unit 1, students develop understanding of two key function concepts while exploring
polynomial and rational functions. The first concept is covariation, or how output values change
in tandem with changing input values. The second concept is rates of change, including average
rate of change, rate of change at a point, and changing rates of change. The central idea of a
function as a rule for relating two simultaneously changing sets of values provides students with
a vital tool that has many applications, in nature, human society, and business and industry. For
example, the idea of crop yield increasing but at a decreasing rate or the efficacy of a medicine
decreasing but at an increasing rate are important understandings that inform critical decisions.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples
below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways
that they approach teaching some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional
Approaches section beginning on p. 125 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 1.1
Students are given a list of variables such as time, temperature, speed, cost, intensity,
length, height, volume, and air flow. The teacher sketches the graph of a function
curve with unlabeled axes. In pairs, students develop a situation and story involving
two of the variables that can be modeled by the given curve.
2 1.3 1.4
Students are given phrases such as “the function is increasing with a decreasing rate
of change,” “the function has an average rate of change of 4 − on the interval [ ] 2, 5 ,”
“the rates of change of a function are constant,” and “the polynomial function is even and has a local minimum at x 2 = .” Students construct a graph that would be
consistent with each phrase and compare their results.
3 1.7
Each student is given cards containing different rational functions in analytical
representations. Have students use a calculator to graph the function and then
record the intercepts on the card as well as limit expressions to describe the
function’s end behavior and behavior at each vertical or horizontal asymptote (e.g., ( ) ( ) = −∞ = → →∞ + f x f x lim , lim 2 x x 3
). In pairs, students take turns reading their limit
statements to each other. Without seeing the actual rational function and without
using a calculator, students will try to sketch the function’s graph and then check and
discuss. Have students rotate to form new pairs and repeat.
4 1.11
Students are presented with a nonconstant polynomial or rational function in
analytical representations, and they then translate the expression into a variety of
representations: constructing a graph, writing the expression as a product of linear factors x a) ( −
when possible, and verbally describing characteristics such as real
zeros, x-intercepts, asymptotes, and holes. Then have students check their graphs using technology.
5 1.11
Students are given statements and need to classify each statement as whether the
statement is always true, sometimes true, or never true. They should justify or explain
their choices. Sample statements include: “The graphs of all rational functions have a horizontal asymptote,” “If f 1 0 ) ( < and f 3 0 ) ( > , the polynomial function f  must
have a zero between x = 1 and x = 3,” and “The graphs of rational functions have holes and vertical asymptotes.” 6 1.12
Students are given graphs of polynomial and rational functions. Students are then
asked to graph a transformation of one of the provided graphs, such as a vertical
dilation by a factor of 3 and a horizontal translation of 2 units. Students will then
switch with a peer and try to write the new expression for the function transformation.
Students then have time to discuss the new function expressions and adjust as needed.

1.2.A.1
Compare the rates of change at two points using average rates of change near the points.
The average rate of change of a function over an interval of the function’s domain is the constant rate of change that yields the same change in the output values as the function yielded on that interval of the function’s domain. It is the ratio of the change in the output values to the change in input values over that interval.

Describe end behaviors of rational functions.
A rational function is analytically represented as a quotient of two polynomial functions and gives a measure of the relative size of the polynomial function in the numerator compared to the polynomial function in the denominator for each value in the rational function’s domain.
1.7.A.2
The end behavior of a rational function will be affected most by the polynomial with the greater degree, as its values will dominate the values of the rational function for input values of large magnitude. For input values of large magnitude, a polynomial is dominated by its leading term. Therefore, the end behavior of a rational function can be understood by examining the corresponding quotient of the leading terms.
1.7.A.3
If the polynomial in the numerator dominates the polynomial in the denominator for input values of large magnitude, then the quotient of the leading terms is a nonconstant polynomial, and the original rational function has the end behavior of that polynomial. If that polynomial
is linear, then the graph of the rational function has a slant asymptote parallel to the graph of the line.

Examining multiple representations is also powerful in understanding composition of functions and relationships between functions and their inverse functions. In this unit, multiple representations should be used to explore the inverse relationship between exponential and logarithmic functions.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Students should practice clearly delineating the processes that lead to answers when solving equations, finding equivalent expressions, and building function models.
Since manipulating exponential and logarithmic functions requires a great deal of precision, students should avoid “skipping steps” as errors can be easily introduced with these function types. Furthermore, on the free-response section of the AP Exam, answers without supporting work may not be acceptable, so students should practice clear communication throughout the course.
Students will continue to use technology to explore multiple representations in this unit as they did in Unit 1 and will expand their use of calculating regressions to include exponential and logarithmic regressions.
They should practice calculating various regressions on data sets, plot the residuals, and justify the choice of a function model based on analysis of the residuals. Students should be fluent with the practices of entering data, calculating regressions, and plotting residuals with the graphing calculator before the AP Exam.
Developing Understanding
In Unit 2, students build an understanding of exponential and logarithmic functions.
Exponential and logarithmic function models are widespread in the natural and social
sciences. When an aspect of a phenomenon changes proportionally to the existing amount,
exponential and logarithmic models are employed to harness the information. Exponential
functions are key to modeling population growth, radioactive decay, interest rates, and
the amount of medication in a patient. Logarithmic functions are useful in modeling sound
intensity and frequency, the magnitude of earthquakes, the pH scale in chemistry, and the
working memory in humans. The study of these two function types touches careers in
business, medicine, chemistry, physics, education, and human geography, among others.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples
below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways
that they approach teaching some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional
Approaches section beginning on p. 125 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 2.2
Five students randomly choose different integers between  minus 6  and 6 that will be used
as input values for a function. In groups, students determine appropriate output
values for the five input values that illustrate a linear function relationship, then those
that illustrate an exponential function relationship. The groups defend their decisions
to the rest of the class by explaining how they know their values represent linear and exponential functions.
2 2.2
Have students pair up and attempt to walk (in a straight line from a specific starting
point) using the following walking patterns: i) at a constant rate of change of 2 feet
per second based on the model d = 2t; ii) at an increasing rate of change based on
the model  d  equals 2 superscript t . Ask each pair to describe the differences in their two experiences.
Follow up with applied questions such as “How far would you walk in 10 seconds? in
33 seconds?” or “Using each model, how long would it take you to travel around Earth
(tile 25,000 miles) ?, travel to the Moon (~239,000 miles)?” 3 2.5
Student A and Student B are both provided with a context that can be modeled using
exponential functions such as doubling or halving a certain substance. Without
looking at each other’s work, each student generates a graph and an expression to
model the exponential function. Then, the students switch papers to review each other’s solutions.
4 2.6
Students are given multiple tables of data, each of which is well-modeled by a linear,
exponential, or quadratic function. In pairs, students calculate all three regressions,
observe the graphs of the regressions, observe the corresponding residual plots, and
draw conclusions about the relationships between the graphs and the residuals.
5 2.11
Students are given a sheet of paper containing several logarithmic functions
represented analytically and their corresponding graphs, in mixed order, in a separate
column. In small groups, students match the corresponding representations and take
turns explaining how they know each is matched correctly.
6 2.13
Place 10 to 16 index cards around the room. The top of each card contains a problem,
and the bottom of each card contains a solution to a problem from a different card.
Students will start at a card, solve the problem, and then search for the next card with
their solution. The cards should be set up such that the students will find the matches of all of the cards.

Identify key characteristics of exponential functions.
The general form of an exponential function is f
o f  x equals a times b to the power x , with the initial value a, where  a  not equals 0 ,
and the base b, where b > 0, and  b  not equals 1. When a > 0 and b > 1, the exponential function is said to demonstrate exponential growth. When a > 0 and 0 < < b 1, the exponential function is said to demonstrate exponential decay.
2.3.A.2
When the natural numbers are input values in an exponential function, the input value specifies the number of factors of the base to be applied to the function’s initial value. The domain of an exponential function is all real numbers.
2.3.A.3
Because the output values of exponential functions in general form are proportional over equal-length input-value intervals, exponential functions are always increasing or always decreasing, and their graphs are always concave up or always concave down.
Consequently, exponential functions do not have extrema except on a closed interval, and their graphs do not have points of inflection.

2.7.A.1
Evaluate the composition of two or more functions for given values.
If f  and g are functions, the composite function f open circle g maps a set of input values to a set of output values such that the output values of g are used as input values of f . For this reason, the domain of the composite function is restricted to those input values of g for which the corresponding output value is in the domain of  f, f

o pen circle g, of x  can also be represented as  f of, g of x .
2.7.A.2
Values for the composite function f open circle g can be calculated or estimated from the graphical, numerical, analytical, or verbal representations of f  and g by using output values from g as input values for f .
2.7.A.3
The composition of functions is not commutative; that is, f open circle g, and, g open circle f f open circle g, and, g open circle f f open circle g, and, g open circle f are
typically different functions; therefore,  f of, g of x,  a n d g of, f of x  are typically different values.

Determine the inverse of a function on an invertible domain.
The inverse of the graph of the function
y  equals f of x can be found by reversing the roles of the x- and y-axes; that is, by reflecting the graph of the function over the graph of the identity function  h o f  x equals x .
2.8.B.4
The inverse of the function can be found by determining the inverse operations to reverse the mapping. One method for finding the inverse of the function f  is reversing the roles
of x and y in the equation  y  equals f of x , then solving for y e quals f superscript minus 1, of x .
2.8.B.5
In addition to limiting the domain of a function to obtain an inverse function, contextual
restrictions may also limit the applicability of an inverse function.

The way in which input and output values vary together have an inverse relationship in exponential and logarithmic functions. Output values of general-form exponential functions change proportionately as input values increase in equal-length intervals. However, input values of general-form logarithmic functions change proportionately as output values increase in equal-length intervals.
Alternately, exponential growth is characterized by output values changing multiplicatively as input values change additively, whereas logarithmic growth is characterized by output values changing additively as input values change multiplicatively.

2.11.A.1
Identify key characteristics of logarithmic functions.
The domain of a logarithmic function in general form is any real number greater than zero, and its range is all real numbers.
2.11.A.2
Because logarithmic functions are inverses of exponential functions, logarithmic functions are also always increasing or always decreasing, and their graphs are either always concave up or always concave down.
Consequently, logarithmic functions do not have extrema except on a closed interval, and their graphs do not have points of inflection.

However, if the input values of the additive transformation function,  g o f  x e q uals f of x plus k , of any function f are proportional over equal-length output value intervals, then f is logarithmic.

Determine if an exponential model is appropriate by examining a semi-log plot of a data set.
In a semi-log plot, one of the axes is logarithmically scaled. When the y-axis of a semi-log plot is logarithmically scaled, data or functions that demonstrate exponential characteristics will appear linear.

Building the
Mathematical Practices
1.A  1.B  1.C  2.B  3.A
Students should have multiple experiences transitioning among, and communicating about, the various representations of trigonometric functions, especially sinusoidal functions. It is important that, in addition to solving trigonometric equations and finding equivalent trigonometric expressions, students build sinusoidal models with and without technology and practice constructing different representations. As students transition to thinking in the polar plane, they will refine their communications related to characteristics of functions. The more casual language that students may have adopted such as “goes up” and “goes down” will need to be replaced with more careful language that addresses a function’s behavior related to angles and radii.
Preparing for the AP Exam
As sinusoidal function content pairs well with each of the mathematical practices and skills in the course, students should practice applying each skill to each trigonometric function objective. On the
AP Exam, students will need to describe characteristics of sinusoidal functions, such as amplitude, vertical shift, period, and phase shift, give reasons for why chosen values are consistent with information provided, calculate sinusoidal regressions using a graphing calculator, and apply trigonometric function models to contexts.
Students should be practicing these skills in daily activities, so they are able to use them fluently on the AP Exam.
Developing Understanding
In Unit 3, students explore trigonometric functions and their relation to the angles and
arcs of a circle. Since their output values repeat with every full revolution around the circle,
trigonometric functions are ideal for modeling periodic, or repeated pattern phenomena,
such as: the highs and lows of a wave, the blood pressure produced by a heart, and the
angle from the North Pole to the Sun year to year. Furthermore, periodicity is found in human
inventions and social phenomena. For example, moving parts of an analog clock are modeled
by a trigonometric function with respect to each other or with respect to time; traffic flow at
an intersection over the course of a week demonstrates daily periodicity; and demand for
a particular product over the course of a year falls into an annually repeating pattern. Polar
functions, which are also explored in this unit, have deep ties to trigonometric functions
as they are both based on the circle. Polar functions are defined on the polar coordinate
system that uses the circular concepts of radii and angles to describe location instead of
rectangular concepts of left-right and up-down, which students have worked with previously.
Trigonometry serves as the bridge between the two systems.
ESSENTIAL
QUESTIONS ■ Since energy usage goes up and down through the year, how can I use trends in data to predict my monthly electricity bills when I get my first apartment?
■ How do we model aspects of circular and spinning objects without using complex equations from the x-y rectangular-based coordinate system?
■ How does right triangle trigonometry from geometry relate to trigonometric functions?

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples
below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways
that they approach teaching some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional
Approaches section beginning on p. 125 for more examples of activities and strategies.

Sample Activity 1 3.3

pi over 6 and pi over 4
In pairs, students rehearse values of trigonometric functions at multiples of pi over 6 and pi over 4

pi over 6 and pi over 4  using a modified question and answer-type game. Student A privately calculates

sin e o f the negative of pi over 3

t he negative of, square root of 3 over 2 and says, “The answer is ” and Student B asks a question such as
“What is the sine of [some angle]?” or “What is the cosine of [some angle]? If Student
B does not guess

sin e o
f the negative of pi over 3 , they work together to determine if Student B’s question is also valid for the given answer.
2 3.4
Students are given analytical trigonometric functions paired with graphs on a
single sheet of paper or on index cards. Some of the graphs are correct, and others
are incorrect. In pairs, students identify the function for which the analytical and
graphical representations are consistent and those for which the representations are
inconsistent. For graphs that are in error, students construct the appropriate graph.
3 3.6
In pairs, students are given a worksheet containing four functions such as f o f

x eq u a l s ,  3 times s i
n e of ope n  parenthesis, x minus pi, close parenthesis, minus 4, and g of x equals, negative 2 times cosine of open parenthesis, 3 times x, close parenthesis, plus 1  along with a list of instructions
such as: “Determine the midline,” “Determine the period,” “Determine the zeros on

[
0  , 2 pi ] ,” “On what intervals is the function increasing?” The size of the group is equal to the number of questions.
Students take turns answering a question of their choice, passing the worksheet
between turns. If the receiver of the worksheet disagrees with the passer's answer,
they discuss it before the receiver answers a question and returns the worksheet. This
continues until all questions are answered for all functions.
4 3.12
Provide each student with the same worksheet containing four trigonometric
equations that require using equivalent trigonometric forms (such as sum identity or

2 ti m e s s i n e  squared x, plus cosine x, minus 1, equals 0
Pythagorean identity) to solve the equations, such as − . Then,
in an activity similar to the one used for Topic 3.6, arrange students in groups of four.
Each student solves the first equation and then they pass their papers clockwise to the
next student. Each student checks the first equation and, if necessary, discusses any
mistakes with the previous student. Each student now solves the second equation on
the paper, and the process continues until each student has their original paper back.

3.1.A
3.1.A.1
Construct graphs of periodic relationships based on verbal representations.
A periodic relationship can be identified between two aspects of a context if, as the input values increase, the output values demonstrate a repeating pattern over successive equal-length intervals.

3.1.B.1
Describe key characteristics of a periodic function based on a verbal representation.
The period of the function is the smallest positive value k such that  f

o f x  + k equals f of x  for all x in the domain. Consequently, the behavior of a periodic function is completely determined by any interval of width k.
3.1.B.2
The period can be estimated by investigating successive equal-length output values and finding where the pattern begins to repeat.
3.1.B.3
Periodic functions take on characteristics of other functions, such as intervals of increase and decrease, different concavities, and various rates of change. However, with periodic functions, all characteristics found in one period of the function will be in every period of the function.

3.2.A
Determine the sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle using the unit circle.
3.2.A.1
In the coordinate plane, an angle is in standard position when the vertex coincides with the origin and one ray coincides with the positive x-axis. The other ray is called the terminal ray. Positive and negative angle measures indicate rotations from the positive x-axis in the counterclockwise and clockwise direction, respectively. Angles in standard position that share a terminal ray differ by an integer number of revolutions.
3.2.A.2
The radian measure of an angle in standard position is the ratio of the length of the arc of a circle centered at the origin subtended by the angle to the radius of that same circle.
For a unit circle, which has radius 1, the radian measure is the same as the length of the subtended arc.
3.2.A.3
Given an angle in standard position and a circle centered at the origin, there is a point, P, where the terminal ray intersects the circle.
The sine of the angle is the ratio of the vertical displacement of P from the x-axis to the distance between the origin and point P.
Therefore, for a unit circle, the sine of the angle is the y-coordinate of point P.

Determine the sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle using the unit circle.
Given an angle in standard position and a
circle centered at the origin, there is a point, P, where the terminal ray intersects the circle. The
cosine of the angle is the ratio of the horizontal displacement of P from the y-axis to the distance between the origin and point P.
Therefore, for a unit circle, the cosine of the angle is the x-coordinate of point P.
3.2.A.5
Given an angle in standard position, the tangent of the angle is the slope, if it exists, of the terminal ray. Because the slope of the terminal ray is the ratio of the vertical displacement to the horizontal displacement
over any interval, the tangent of the angle is the ratio of the y-coordinate to the x-coordinate of the point at which the terminal ray intersects
the unit circle; alternately, it is the ratio of the angle’s sine to its cosine.

3.15.A
3.15.A.1
Describe characteristics of the graph of a polar function.
If a polar function,  r  equals f of theta , is positive and increasing or negative and decreasing, then
the distance between  f of theta  and the origin is increasing.
3.15.A.2
If a polar function,  r  equals f of theta , is positive and decreasing or negative and increasing, then
the distance between  f of theta  and the origin is decreasing.
3.15.A.3
For a polar function,  r  equals f of theta , if the function changes from increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing on an interval, then the function has a relative extremum on the interval corresponding to a point relatively closest to or farthest from the origin.
3.15.A.4
The average rate of change of r with respect to
theta  over an interval of  theta  is the ratio of the change
in the radius values to the change in  theta  over an
interval of  theta . Graphically, the average rate of change indicates the rate at which the radius is changing per radian.
3.15.A.5
The average rate of change of r with respect to
theta  over an interval of  theta  can be used to estimate values of the function within the interval.

Building the
Mathematical Practices
2.A  2.B  3.A  3.C
When encountering new function types, students should engage with multiple representations of each function type and practice communicating precise characteristics of these function types.
For parametric and vector-valued functions, students will need to use care in communicating about the position or velocity of an object, depending on the function that is given. Students should practice the precise language used with particle motion in the plane and refer specifically to position, direction, and motion. It will be valuable for students to provide clear rationales when setting up and working with matrices as linear transformation functions on vectors.
Students should explain why they took the steps they did.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Unit 4 topics are excluded from the
AP Exam. The AP Exam assesses topics in Unit 1, 2, and 3 as these topics are required for college credit and/or placement. When teachers and schools choose to include topics in Unit 4, students will use technology in ways that are new and unfamiliar. Students should practice setting up appropriate viewing windows and parameter restrictions when graphing parametric functions.
Students should practice building matrices, manipulating matrices, and calculating the inverse of a matrix, where defined, with graphing calculators. Topic Questions and Progress Checks found in AP Classroom provide opportunities to practice with technology. Many of these practices will not only help students learn topics in this unit, but solidify understandings of topics in Units 1, 2, and 3.
Developing Understanding
In Unit 4, students explore function types that expand their understanding of the function
concept. Parametric functions have multiple dependent variables’ values paired with a
single input variable or parameter. Modeling scenarios with parametric functions allows
students to explore change in terms of components. This component-based understanding
is important not only in calculus but in all fields of the natural and social sciences where we
seek to understand one aspect of a phenomenon independent of other confounding aspects.
Another major function type in this unit involves matrices mapping a set of input vectors to
output vectors. The capacity to map large quantities of vectors instantaneously is the basis
for vector-based computer graphics. While students may see their favorite video game
character trip and fall or seemingly move closer or farther, matrices implement a rotation
on a set of vectors or a dilation on a set of vectors. The power of matrices to map vectors is
not limited to graphics but to any system that can be expressed in terms of components of
vectors such as electrical systems, network connections, and regional population distribution
changes over time. Vectors and matrices are also powerful tools of data science as they can
be used to model aspects of complex scientific and social science phenomena.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples
below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways
that they approach teaching some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional
Approaches section beginning on p. 125 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 4.1
In pairs, students discuss why the graphs of parametric functions can fail the “vertical
line test” (and yet they are functions), but the graphs of many other previously studied function types must pass the vertical line test.
2 4.2
Students are put into groups of 3-4 and are given a paper with a parametric function
used to model planar motion. Each group gets a different function. Each person in
the group writes a question on the paper that can be answered based on the given
parametric function. On a separate blank sheet of paper, the group members verify
that each question is answerable. Then, each group trades their question paper with
another group. Each group works together to answer the questions on the received paper.
3 4.6
Students are provided with four graphs: a graph of a parabola that opens up or
opens down with the vertex at the origin, a circle centered at the origin, an ellipse not
centered at the origin, and a hyperbola with center at the origin. In groups, students
develop a reason for why each of the four graphs does not belong to the set of four.
(For example: The parabola is the only one that can be explicitly defined with y as
a function of x; the circle is the only one with infinitely many lines of symmetry; the
ellipse does not belong because it is not symmetric to the y-axis; the hyperbola does
not belong because it has two disconnected pieces.) This type of activity can be
repeated with four different graphs of a parabola, a circle, an ellipse, and a hyperbola, where students come up with the graphs.
4 4.8
Using information about the definition of the dot product, students construct an
argument to explain why two nonzero vectors are perpendicular if, and only if, their dot product is equal to zero.
5 4.12
In pairs, students create a graphic organizer to highlight the similarities and
differences between linear functions and linear transformations.
6 4.14
Students are given scenarios involving transitions between two states that can be
modeled by matrices and linear transformations, such as the number of students
who choose between two lunch options each day. For each model, in pairs, students
explore past and future states for 2 steps using technology. Based on these limited
data, each student tries to predict the steady state. Students then examine their
hypotheses by calculating future states for 10, 100, and 1000 steps.

4.1.A.1
Construct a graph or table of values for a parametric function represented analytically.
A parametric function in  R superscript 2 , the set of all ordered pairs of two real numbers, consists of a set of two parametric equations in which two dependent variables, x and y, are dependent on a single independent variable, t, called the parameter.

Because variables x and y are dependent on the independent variable, t, the coordinates

( x

s

4.1.A.4
A graph of a parametric function can be sketched by connecting several points from the numerical table of values in order of increasing value of t.

4.3.A.1
Identify key characteristics of a parametric planar motion function that are related to direction and rate of change.
As the parameter increases, the direction of planar motion of a particle can be analyzed in terms of x and y independently. If  x of t  is increasing or decreasing, the direction of
motion is to the right or left, respectively. If  y of t is increasing or decreasing, the direction of motion is up or down, respectively.
4.3.A.2
At any given point in the plane, the direction of planar motion may be different for different values of t.
4.3.A.3
The same curve in the plane can be parametrized in different ways and can be traversed in different directions with different parametric functions.
4.3.A.4
Over a given interval [ t s ub 1 , t sub 2 ] within the domain, the average rate of change can be computed
for   x of t a nd  y of t   independently. The ratio of the average rate of change of y to the average rate of change of x gives the slope of the graph between the points on the curve
corresponding to  t sub 1 and t sub 2 , so long as the average rate of change of  x o f  t not equal 0 .

The new vector can be represented graphically as a vector whose tail corresponds to the tail of the first vector and whose head corresponds to the head of the second vector when the second vector’s tail is located at the first vector’s head.
4.8.B.3
The dot product of two vectors is the sum of the products of their corresponding components. That is,

4.8.C
4.8.C.1
Determine a unit vector for a given vector.
A unit vector is a vector of magnitude 1. A unit vector in the same direction as a given nonzero vector can be found by scalar multiplying the vector by the reciprocal of its magnitude.
4.8.C.2
The vector  o p ne angle bracket a, b close angle bracket can be expressed as

a t i m e s vector i plus b times vector j in  R superscript 2 , where

v ector i and vector j  are unit vectors in the x and y directions, respectively. That is,

v e c to r
i equ a ls , open angle bracket, one comma zero, close angle bracket and vector j equals, open angle bracket, zero comma one, close angle bracket .
4.8.D
Determine angle measures between vectors and magnitudes of vectors involved in vector addition.
4.8.D.1
The dot product is geometrically equivalent to the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors and the cosine of the angle between them. Therefore, if the dot product of two nonzero vectors is zero, then the vectors are perpendicular.
4.8.D.2
The Law of Sines and Law of Cosines can be used to determine side lengths and angle measures of triangles formed by vector addition.

Textbooks
While the AP Program provides examples of textbooks to help determine whether a
text is considered appropriate in meeting the AP Precalculus Course Audit curricular
requirement, teachers select textbooks locally. AP Central has a list of textbook examples.
Graphing Calculators and Other Technologies in AP Precalculus
The use of a graphing calculator is considered an integral part of the AP Precalculus
course, and it is required on some portions of the AP Exam. Professional mathematics
organizations such as the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), the
Mathematical Association of America (MAA), and the National Academy of Sciences
(NAS) Board on Mathematical Sciences and Their Applications have strongly endorsed
the use of calculators in mathematics instruction and testing.
Graphing calculators are valuable tools for exploring multiple components of the
mathematical practices, including using technology to develop function models that fit
specified parameters or data, connecting concepts among their graphical, numerical,
analytical, and verbal representations, and identifying and communicating accurate
information. The AP Precalculus course also supports the use of other technologies
that are available to students and encourages teachers to incorporate technology into
instruction in a variety of ways as a means of facilitating discovery and reflection.
Appropriate examples of graphing calculator use in AP Precalculus include but certainly are not limited to:
■ Graphing functions and analyzing their graphs to describe function behaviors (e.g.,
increasing/decreasing, concavity, maxima/minima, zeros, asymptotes).
■ Generating a table of values for a function to develop an understanding of how the
input-values and output-values change with respect to each other.
■ Finding the real zeros of functions or points of intersection of the graphs of two functions to answer questions in context.
■ Finding regressions equations to model data.
■ Using matrix multiplication to explore the impact of a linear transformation on a
vector (e.g., using matrices and inverse matrices to predict future and past states).
Accessible technology that has the capabilities expected for AP Precalculus is
available for students who are blind or visually impaired. This technology should be
used during the course, and an accommodation request to use this technology on
the AP Exam must be made through the College Board’s Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD).

Topic Notes
The following topic notes provide guidance on the following:
■ The level of proficiency teachers should target after certain introductory topics
■ Alternate ways to sequence instruction for certain topics
■ Clarification on subtopics excluded from the framework
Unit 1
■ 1.1 Change in Tandem: Since this topic is introductory, students are not expected
to become proficient in the ideas presented during the days devoted to this topic;
they are revisited in later topics. Students are not expected to communicate
formally within the days devoted to this topic but should grow in fluency as they
progress from Topic Questions to Progress Checks to the AP Exam.
■ 1.2 Rates of Change: Since this topic is also introductory, students are not
expected to become proficient in the ideas presented during the days devoted
to this topic; they are revisited in later topics. Students are not expected to
communicate formally within the days devoted to this topic but should grow in
fluency as they progress from Topic Questions to Progress Checks to the AP Exam.
■ 1.3 Rates of Change in Linear and Quadratic Functions: Students should become
proficient in the ideas presented during the days devoted to this topic. However,
these topics will be revisited throughout the course.
■ 1.4 Polynomial Functions and Rates of Change: Although the formal definition
of a polynomial function and the related terms should be part of the instruction of
this topic, students should be able to recognize polynomial functions rather than provide a formal definition of them.
■ 1.5 Polynomial Functions and Complex Zeros: In this topic, factoring polynomials
without technology is limited to factoring out a common factor and the rules for quadratics.
■ 1.5 Polynomial Functions and Complex Zeros: Special polynomial methods for
finding roots, such as the rational root theorem and Descartes’ rule of signs, are
reserved for Algebra 2 and are not included in this topic.
■ 1.6 Polynomial Functions and End Behavior: Students are not expected to
communicate formally within the days devoted to this topic but should grow in
fluency as they progress from Topic Questions to Progress Checks to the AP Exam.
■ 1.11 Equivalent Representations of Polynomial and Rational Expressions: Partial
fraction decomposition is not included in this course. Synthetic division is not required as part of polynomial long division.
■ 1.12 Transformations of Functions: The topic of transformations comes
immediately before modeling, since, in some instances, students are expected to
construct a model based on a “parent function” and transformations. However, this
topic may occur anywhere in the unit prior to modeling.
■ 1.12 Transformations of Functions: Students will gradually mature into an
understanding of one function being the transformation of another function—
thinking in terms of two separate objects. However, their understanding and
language at the beginning of study will likely be related to an “action view” of Instructional Approaches V.1 | 129

transformation with the preimage being moved and stretched in the xy-plane. This
is a useful tool for an early understanding of transformations. Students should use
the geometric language of translations and dilations within this topic and beyond.
■ 1.14 Function Model Construction and Application: Students should be
proficient in working with simple models within the days devoted to this topic.
Increasingly complex models with other function types will be considered throughout the course.
Unit 2
■ 2.1 Change in Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences: Although series are formally
outside of the scope of this framework, if state or district standards require
instruction on series, this topic would be the appropriate place in the course to add the instruction.
■ 2.6 Competing Function Model Validation: In this topic, it is important for students
to gain experience with using raw data sets and choosing an appropriate function
model without being prompted toward a specific function type.
■ 2.7 Composition of Functions: Composition of functions and inverse functions
could alternatively be addressed at the beginning of the unit, rather than in the
middle. This approach might be preferred by some to avoid disrupting the flow of
student experiences from exponential to logarithmic functions.
■ 2.14 Logarithmic Function Context and Data Modeling: The contextual
interpretation of a and b in a logarithmic model  f o f

x
equa ls, a plus, b times log of x, to base n  is not included as part of the course.
■ 2.15 Semi-log Plots: For semi-log plots, logarithmic scaling will only be applied to
the y-axis to linearize exponential functions, not the x-axis to linearize logarithmic functions.
Unit 3
■ 3.4 Sine and Cosine Function Graphs-3.5 Sinusoidal Functions: These topics
might be intertwined instead of partitioned as the exploration of the graphs may
induce language related to characteristics of the functions.
■ 3.12 Equivalent Representations of Trigonometric Functions: Half-angle
identities, tangent sum/difference identities, and other identities not listed are not
assessed on the AP Exam. However, Pythagorean identities, and sum, difference,
and double-angle identities for sine and cosine are assessed on the AP Exam.
Unit 4: Not Assessed on the AP Exam
■ 4.2 Parametric Functions Modeling Planar Motion: The potential application of
parametric functions is extensive but is limited to planar motion in this course.
■ 4.6 Conic Sections: The implicitly-defined functions study of conic sections does
not include all of the characteristics found in a full analytical treatment of conic
sections. It is limited to quantities found in the equations involving two variables
that are needed to sketch graphs of the functions.
■ 4.6 Conic Sections: Conic sections are limited to those whose graphs have vertical and horizontal lines of symmetry.
■ 4.8 Vectors: The course framework limits matrices, vectors, and linear
transformations to  R superscript 2, but R superscript n  can be explored if desired.
■ 4.12 Linear Transformations and Matrices: Discussion on the basis of a vector
space is bypassed but can be developed if time allows since determining if vectors
are linearly independent reinforces multiple topics such as determinants and inverses.

Developing the Mathematical
Practices
Throughout the course, students will develop mathematical practices that are fundamental to the study of
precalculus. Students will benefit from multiple opportunities to develop these practices in a scaffolded manner.
The tables that follow look at each of the mathematical practices and their associated skills and provide examples of
questions with sample activities for incorporating instruction on that skill into the course.

Questions to Ask Students
Skill
Sample Activities
1.A: Solve equations and inequalities represented analytically, with and without technology.

■ What type of equation/inequality are we solving (linear, quadratic, radical, logarithmic, exponential, etc.)?
■ Can technology help to solve it?
■ What do the solutions represent?
■ Are there any domain restrictions to consider?
■ What strategy did you use to solve this equation/inequality?
■ Does the solution make sense? How could the solution be verified?
■ Can this equation be solved using a different method/ strategy?
Give students a worksheet with a matching activity that has them
match an inequality presented analytically, the solution set on
a number line, and the solution set in interval notation. Include
inequalities where the endpoints of solution intervals are both open, closed, or a combination.
Have students sort a variety of cards containing equations and/or
inequalities based on the type of function given in the problem.
The type of function (i.e., radical, trigonometric, logarithmic, and
exponential functions) will need different strategies to solve.
Then have the students sort the cards into two groups—those
that can be solved without technology vs. those for which the use
of technology is best. Finally, have students pick one or two from
each group and solve with or without technology, as appropriate.
In small groups, have students identify what type of equation
or inequality they are solving based on a running list of function
types that students keep in their notebooks. Also have students
individually try to solve the equation or inequality. Then, have
students work in small groups to compare strategies and
determine which are easier to use or preferred. For equations
with many different paths toward a solution, split the entire class
into teams, give each team a different solving technique, and
conduct a mock debate over which method is better for solving.
Have students work in groups of four where each student has an
identical paper with the same four different equations on it. Have
students complete the first one on their paper, and then pass the
paper clockwise to another member in their group. That student
checks the first problem and then completes the second problem
on the paper. Have students rotate again and the process
continues until each student has their original paper back.

Sample Activities
1.B: Express functions, equations, or expressions in analytically equivalent forms that are useful in a given mathematical or applied context.

■ How could analytical skills be used to change the form of the expression?
■ Why would you want to change the function, equation, or expression into a different form? What would it help to find?
■ What benefits come from alternate forms?
■ How could you express this in a different form that would better convey the context?
■ How do you know that these two forms are equivalent?
Give each student a paper with two columns that have
exponential and logarithmic expressions in the first column and
either an equivalent expression or one that is not in the second
column. Have students state whether the two expressions are
equivalent. This activity can also be done with trigonometric
identities, rectangular and polar coordinates, etc.
Develop a set of cards for several expressions. Some cards
should have equivalent expressions to a starting expression,
some should not. Divide students into small groups and give
each group a set of cards. Groups must decide which cards
display equivalent expressions and which do not belong. As an
extension, have students determine how one form might be more useful than another.
For polynomial and/or rational functions, have students plot the
graph of the function by hand by generating coordinate pairs or
by using graphing technology. Then have students factor the
functions and compare characteristics of the graph to factored
form. From this information, have students make conjectures
about the relationship between the graph of a function and
its factored form. Conclude this activity with instruction that
formally connects the students’ observations and the related mathematical properties of the function.

groups have different assigned transformations of f , called g.

scenario to fit the new function g. As an extension, challenge
students to find the inverse functions for both f  and g,
determine what the inverse functions model, and determine any necessary domain restrictions.
Given a data set, have students work with a partner to c an exponential function model of the form  f o f  x equals a times b to the power x onstruct . Students
then present their data set and explain how they arrived at values for a and b.
Have students use graphing technology to observe the changes
and similarities when graphing a function and its additive and
multiplicative transformations. Then have students generalize the impacts of the transformations to the graphs.
Provide students with a function and have them find the inverse
of their function using appropriate notation. Then have students
use graphing technology to confirm that the two functions appear to be inverses.
Give students the graph of an exponential or logarithmic function
with transformations. Have students identify the parent function,
write down the transformations to the parent function that they
observe in the graph, and then switch with a partner and have
their partner check their work. Working together, have the pair of
students write each of their functions in analytical form. Finally,
have students use graphing technology to confirm that the analytical form produces the correct graph.

■ What information do you need to know? Is there any information available that is not needed?
Give students a verbal description of a real-world scenario
that can be modeled by a sinusoidal function. In groups, have
students identify which aspects of the scenario relate to the
amplitude, period, phase shift, and vertical shift of the related sinusoidal model.
Have students examine a free-response type question that
requires the use of technology to analyze a graph or table of values.
First, have the students underline the questions being asked, and
then have them write the analytical expression or equation that
would be needed to answer each question. Have students switch
papers with a partner so that their partner can check their work. As
an extension, students work together to answer the question.
Give students a representation of a function in a graph or table.
Have each student write down a question that can be answered
from the information in the graph or table. Then have students
trade papers with a partner and answer the question asked. On
the same piece of paper, have each student add another question
that can be answered from the information in the graph or table.
Then have students trade papers again, but with a different
partner, to continue the process. Ensure that students know that
each subsequent question needs to focus on a different aspect
of the graph or table. Monitor student progress and allow the
process to continue for as many times as needed to extract many
key pieces of information from the representation.
As a class, present students with different functions in various
representations. Lead students in asking and answering
questions that help identify the appropriate function type from
the representation provided. Some examples include, but are not
limited to:
■ Graphical representation—What do you notice about the
graph? Is there symmetry? Are the rates of change changing?
Are there local min/max values? Intercepts? Asymptotes? What features do you notice?
■ Numerical representation—Do we see any unusual values? Is
there a pattern? Any symmetry? What are the output values
doing as the input values increase? What does that mean for
the function and what type(s) of function(s) is/are excluded
with that feature? Are there local extrema? Asymptotic behavior?
■ Analytical representation—What is our domain and range of
the function? What other features are “easy” to see from this representation?
■ Verbal representation—What key words/phrases do we see
that might help us narrow down the type of model we need?
Is there an indication about how quantities are changing with
respect to each other? Are there any domain restrictions from this type of scenario?

Mathematical Practice 2: Multiple Representations (cont’d)
Questions to Ask Students
Skill
Sample Activities
2.B: Construct equivalent graphical, numerical, analytical, and verbal representations of functions that are useful in a given mathematical or applied context, with and without technology.
■ Which representation would be the best in the situation?
■ How can a different representation of a function be more useful?
■ What would a graph of this situation look like?
■ How could this graph or table be represented as an equation?
■ How do you know these representations are equivalent?
Choose a function family and make sets of cards for functions
within that family, where each set of cards has different
representations of the functions: graphical, numerical, analytical,
and verbal. Distribute the cards to the class and then have
students find other students that have that same function in its
different forms. Students should end up in small groups when they have all found their matches.
Give students three of the four representations of a given
function (i.e., graphical, numerical, analytical, and verbal). Have
students work in pairs to construct the missing representation
for each set. Have one pair of students collaborate with another
pair to compare answers and make any final adjustments.
Provide a Four Corners activity sheet with a trigonometric
function in the center. If possible, each student should get a
unique function. Ask students to express that trigonometric
function graphically in one corner, numerically in another corner,
analytically in another corner, and verbally in the last corner.
Mathematical Practice 3: Communication and Reasoning:
Communicate with precise language, and provide rationales for conclusions
The table that follows provides examples of questions and example activities for helping students to develop the
skills of communication and reasoning for different topics throughout the course. Well-communicated reasoning validates solutions.
Mathematical Practice 3: Communication and Reasoning (cont’d)
Questions to Ask Students
Skill
Sample Activities
3.A: Describe the characteristics of a function with varying levels of precision, depending on the function representation and available mathematical tools.
■ What does the function’s graph look like?
■ What are the zeros of the function?
■ What are the domain and range of the function?
■ What are the extrema of the function?
■ Where is the function increasing or decreasing?
■ How are the rates of change changing?
■ What mathematical tools are available to help find different aspects of the function?
In groups of 3, have students describe characteristics of a
function. They can include end behavior, zeros, intercepts,
increasing/decreasing intervals, extrema, concavity, etc. Then,
have each group present their characteristics of the function to
the other groups for them to come up with a representation of
the function. This can be done with any of the functions in the various units.
Have students pair up and choose an “A” role and a “B” role.
Let role A be the describer of certain characteristics they see
from a graph they are given, but the role B student cannot see
the graph. Role B must graph the function from A’s description
without A seeing. Then let A see the result and then compare
what could have been worded differently for better results. Then
let A try again with a new function. Finally, students should switch roles and repeat the process.
Have students work in small groups where each student is given
a “secret” polynomial or rational function. Other students ask
yes/no questions (e.g., Does your function’s graph have a vertical
asymptote?) to try to guess the “secret function.” continued on next page

Mathematical Practice 3: Communication and Reasoning (cont’d)
Questions to Skill
Ask Students
Sample Activities
3.B: Apply numerical results in a given mathematical or applied context.
■ Does the answer make sense in the context of the problem?
■ Is the answer in the domain of the function?
■ What does the result mean in the context of the problem?
■ Are there any numerical answers that would not make sense in the context of the problem?
■ What units are appropriate?
■ Is this solution reasonable?
■ What conclusions can we make from our results? Can we use them to make any predictions about other values?
Give students different scenarios with an appropriate function
model and a solution to the function. In groups, have students
discuss what the answer means in terms of the context and function.
Give students a number of scenarios involving units. Instead of
asking students to answer a question, have students work in
pairs to write questions that would have different configurations
of units as appropriate answers. For example, given a velocity
function with units of meters per second, a student might write,
“What is the average rate of change of velocity over a certain 3-second interval?”
Present students with examples of logarithmic equations with
work shown that leads to an erroneous result. Have students
identify and correct the errors and identify the misconception that led to each error.
Pairs of students are given tables of values within a context. The
students calculate regression models with technology and make
predictions about values within the given input-value range and beyond.
3.C: Support conclusions or choices with a logical rationale or appropriate data.
■ What conclusion needs to be supported?
■ How can the conclusion be supported with a mathematical rationale?
■ Does the given data support your conclusion?
■ Can you convince others that your conclusion/ choice makes sense?
■ What line of reasoning did you use to …?
■ What evidence do you have to support …? Is your evidence sufficient so support your conclusion?
■ What can you conclude from the evidence?
■ Is the data set appropriate as a model for the applied context?
■ Does the graph of the residuals appear without pattern?
Put students in groups of 3 and assign one group to be the
“judges.” Then give all of the other groups a question that
requires a reason to support the answer. Have students present
their conclusion and supporting evidence to the judges to see
which group has made the best argument. This activity can be used with any of the course topics.
Give students several conclusions and a related data set. In
pairs, students determine if each conclusion is supported by the
data. Have students write concrete reasons for whether the data do or do not support the conclusion.
Have students complete a fill-in-the-blank template that
explains why not all pairs of matrices have products and the
characteristics these matrices must possess to have a product.
Blanks could include information about dimensions and how matrix multiplication works.
Give the students multiple data sets. For each data set, have
students calculate different regressions on the data set, graph
the residuals, and decide if the function model is appropriate.
Then, have students compare their answers to the results of a partner.

Instructional Strategies
The AP Precalculus course framework outlines the concepts and skills students must master in order to be
successful on the AP Exam. In order to address those concepts and skills effectively, it helps to incorporate a
variety of instructional approaches and best practices into daily lessons and activities. The following table presents
strategies that can help students apply their understanding of course concepts.
Strategy
Definition
Examples
Ask the expert
Students are assigned as “experts” on concepts they understand well; groups rotate through the expert stations to learn about concepts they need to work on, providing students with opportunities to share knowledge and learn from one another.
When learning about regression models, assign students
to become “experts” on the different types of regressions.
Students rotate through stations in groups, working
with the station expert to complete a series of problems
using necessary steps with the technology and develop a
greater understanding of that particular regression type.

Construct an
Argument
Students use mathematical reasoning to present assumptions about mathematical situations, support conjectures with mathematically relevant and accurate data, and provide a logical progression of ideas leading to a conclusion that makes sense. This strategy can be used with word problems that do not lend themselves to immediate application of a formula or mathematical process.
Provide diameters of large oak trees and chainsaw blade
speeds and ask students to construct a mathematical
argument around how quickly a logger can cut up a giant
oak tree, given a required set log length. Students can
make an assumption about which logger will win a log
cutting race if they have different chain saw speeds and
diameters, and then find the solution and argue their case.
Create a Plan
Students analyze the tasks in a problem and create a process for completing the tasks. They find the information needed, interpret data, choose how to solve the problem, communicate the results, and verify accuracy.
Give students a variety of problems involving missing
measurements in contextual settings with vectors that
require the use of the Law of Sines or the Law of Cosines.
Students must make sense of each problem, sketch
the scenario utilizing vector addition, and represent
unknowns. Students determine which law can be used in
the scenario, and then calculate the missing measurement,
making sense of their answer and interpreting the results.
Students may write a general strategy for recognizing
when each law should be applied and the steps to apply it.

=== Page 146 ===
continued on next page
Strategy
Definition
Examples
Create
Representations
Students create pictures, tables, graphs, lists, equations, models, and/ or verbal expressions to interpret text or data.
In order to fully develop an understanding of composite functions, have students create a table for  f of g of x by
directly substituting output values for g as input values for
f . Students should construct graphs of the functions and
composition to see the relationships of the domains and
ranges of the two functions. Students should also explore
the algebraic representation of the composite function to compare to the graph and table.
Critique
Reasoning
Through collaborative discussion, students respond to the arguments of others and question the use of mathematical terminology, assumptions, and conjectures to improve understanding and justify and communicate conclusions.
Given vector-valued functions, have students explain the
direction of an object as it moves towards or away from
another object with as accurate mathematical language as
possible. As students discuss their responses in groups,
they should help each other revise their communication of
specific concepts using proper mathematical notation and terminology as well as justify their responses.

Debriefing
Students discuss their understanding of a concept to lead to a consensus on its meaning.
In order to determine if a function is invertible, have
students discuss domain restrictions. Specifically, when
working with trigonometric functions, students should discuss the domain and range of each function and
address how to restrict the domain so that the function
is invertible. This discussion will clarify misconceptions
around domain and range and solidify the concept of functions and inverses.
Discussion
Groups
Students work within groups to discuss content, create problem solutions, and explain and justify a solution.
Give groups of 3-4 students scenarios that can be
modeled by linear, quadratic, polynomial, and piecewise defined functions. Allow time for them to think
independently and jot down aspects of the scenarios that
would lend themselves to different types of models (i.e.,
how one quantity changes in relation to another) and then
share their reasoning with the group behind their model
selection and discussing potential domain and range restrictions based on contextual clues.
Distractor
Analysis
Students examine answers to a multiple-choice question and determine which answers are incorrect and why.
To help students understand the graphs of rational
functions’ vertical asymptotes and holes, provide multiple choice questions with a set of “distractor answers,” in
addition to the correct answer, along with a separate list of
rationales—one for each answer choice—without telling
students which rationale applies to which answers. For
example, if the question asks for the vertical asymptote of the graph of

f o f x e q u a l s
,  the fraction with numerator x squared, minus 1, and denominator x squared, minus 5 times x, minus 6, end fraction , then one distractor
answer could be  x  equals minus 1  and its corresponding rationale
could be, “This choice is for the student who factored
correctly but found the hole, rather than the vertical
asymptote.” Have students match each distractor answer
choice to its corresponding rationale in the list.

Strategy
Definition
Examples
Error Analysis
Students analyze an existing solution to determine whether (or where) errors have occurred.
When students are working with parametrization of
implicitly-defined functions, give pairs of students the
steps toward and a final equation after eliminating the
parameter. Each “solution” presented contains an error in
the process. Students individually identify the error then
confirm with a partner. After confirming the error, they
complete the correct process individually and compare their results.
Four Corners
Students are given a sheet of paper that’s been divided vertically and horizontally with four equal sections and a topic, concept, or function in the center of the page. Each section is used to provide information about the center item (e.g., different representations of a function).
To help students learn about each conic section, provide
a Four Corners activity sheet for each conic and have
students determine the features of the conic in one corner,
graph in another corner, a table in another corner, and a
verbal description of the features in the last corner.
Graph and Switch
Each student in a pair generates a graph (or sketch of a graph) to model a certain function. Then, the students switch graphing calculators (or papers) to review each other’s solutions.
As students learn about sinusoidal functions, have them
graph a sinusoidal function of their choice. Then, they can
switch graphing calculators with a partner and see if they
can generate the analytic representation of the graph their partner created.
Graphic
Organizer
Students represent ideas and information visually (e.g.,
Venn diagrams, flowcharts, etc.).
In order to determine the set of solutions to rational
inequalities, have students construct a table defining
appropriate test values in intervals defined by boundary
points. Then, students will mark the correct intervals and incorrect intervals.
Identify a
Subtask
Students break a problem into smaller pieces whose combined outcomes lead to a solution.
As students learn to build trigonometric models from
scenarios, have them break the task into finding the
period, amplitude, vertical shift, and phase shift.
Look for a
Pattern
Students observe information or create visual representations to find a trend.
To show that patterns can be detected when graphing a
cycle of sine or cosine, have students calculate the exact values of multiples of

n o

r n
er 4, the fraction pi over 3, the fraction pi over 2 , in order to determine the correct graph within the bounds.

Examples
Odd One Out
In groups of four, students are given four problems, images, or graphs. Three of the items should have something in common. Each student in the group works with one of the four items and must decide individually whether their item fits with the other three items and then write a reason why.
Students then share their responses within their groups.
Begin by modeling an example, such as three images of
four-legged animals and one image of an object, explaining
why the object is the “odd one out.” Divide students into
groups of four and then provide each student in the group
with one of four images displaying graphs. Three of the
graphs should represent exponential functions, while the
fourth graph represents a logarithmic function. Students
examine their graph and write on mini whiteboards or
sheets of paper, “I’m in because ...” or “I’m out because ....”
All members of each group discuss their answers together and signal when they have reached consensus. Then
reveal the answer and explain what the three similar graphs
had in common, and why the other was the odd one out.
Predict and Confirm
Students make conjectures and confirm or modify the conjectures based on outcomes of an activity.
Give each student two sets of cards: one with the
trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, and tangent) and
the other with the graphs of the reciprocal functions
(cosecant, secant, and cotangent). Then, have students
attempt to match the function with their appropriate
reciprocal graph. Students should find the relationship
between roots of the functions and asymptotes of the
reciprocal functions’ graphs. They can also compare the
range of the function to the range of the graph. Finally,
students can use graphing calculators to confirm that
they have matched the correct function to each reciprocal function graph.
Quickwrite
Students write for a short, specific amount of time about a designated topic.
To help synthesize concepts after learning how to work
with rational functions, have students write as much as
they can about the similarities and differences between
rational functions with holes and vertical asymptotes
in 3–5 minutes. As part of a share-out, have students
summarize how to tell if the graph of the function has a vertical asymptote or a hole.
Quiz-Quiz-Trade
Students answer a question independently, and then quiz a partner on the same question.
Give each student a card containing a question on the
front and have them solve the problem, showing their
work and answer, on the back. Each student should get a
different question. At regular time intervals, have students
move around the room to partner with a classmate. Then,
the students in each pair take turns quizzing each other
about their individual problems. When you signal that time
is up, students switch cards with each other—so they
now have a different question than the one they started
with—and find a new partner. Have the process repeat for a number of rounds you determine.

Strategy
Definition
Examples
Round Table
Students are given a worksheet with multiple problems, or a single problem with many parts and work individually to solve one assigned to them. Then, students rotate after each problem, or part of the single problem, to allow other group members to check their work.
In groups of four, have each student use a different color
pen/pencil to work a problem on a worksheet one step at
a time. Student A works part one of the problem and then
passes the paper to Student B. In turn, Student B checks
the work of Student A, making corrections if needed, and
then completes part two of the problem. Have students
rotate again and continue the process until the problem
is solved. Each group in the class could work the same
problem, or for variation, each group could have a different
problem. After a set amount of time, the teacher can
call for one student from each group to rotate to a new
group and share their original problem with the new group
members. This activity could be used for a variety of solving equations topics.
Simplify the
Problem
Students use “friendlier” numbers or functions to help solve a problem.
When discussing equivalent trigonometric functions,
review equivalent trigonometric models using “friendly numbers” before moving on to problems where the
transformations are more complex. For example, use multiples of
the fraction pi over 6  for exploring the sine and cosine sum identities before other angles.
Think Aloud
Students talk through a difficult problem by describing what the text means.
In order to determine which transformations occurred to a
given function, have students ask themselves a series of
questions out loud to identify each type of transformation.
These questions could include but are not limited to: Has
the graph of the function been vertically stretched? Has the
graph been horizontally or vertically shifted? You may want
to provide students with a list of questions to start and then have them add their own question(s).
Think-Pair-
Share (or Wait,
Turn, and Talk)
Students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then conclude by sharing results with the class.
Given the equations of several exponential functions, have
students think of the steps needed to solve for a value
located in the exponent. Then, have students share their
ideas with a partner before sharing out to the whole class.

About the
Free-Response
Questions
FRQ 1: Function Concepts (Graphing Calculator) presents functions expressed
graphically, numerically, and analytically. The question includes three Parts and requires
students to work with a variety of concepts. These may include function composition,
inverse functions, function input-output values, zeros of a function, end behavior of
a function, and identification of an appropriate function type to construct a function
model. The graphing calculator is useful in this question.
FRQ 2: Modeling a Non-Periodic Context (Graphing Calculator) presents a real-life
context. In Part (A), students use the given information to construct a function model by
building a system of equations and finding the parameters using a method of choice.
Function types include polynomial, piecewise-defined, exponential, and logarithmic. In
Part (B), students calculate, apply, and reason with average rates of change and their
units. In Part (C), students justify a conclusion about assumptions or limitations of the
model. The graphing calculator is useful in this question.
FRQ 3: Modeling a Periodic Context (No Calculator) presents a real-life context that
is modeled by a sinusoidal function. In Part (A), students use the given information to
identify coordinates of five labeled points on the graph of the sinusoidal function and
its midline for two full cycles. In Part (B), students find the parameters of an analytical
presentation of the sinusoidal function. Both Parts (A) and (B) require students to
construct the sinusoidal model by using the context to determine the vertical dilation
and vertical translation of the sine or cosine function (amplitude and vertical shift), and
the horizontal dilation and horizontal translation of the sine or cosine function (period
and phase shift). In Part (C), students answer questions about the behavior of the
function and describe the change in the rate of change on a particular interval.
FRQ 4: Symbolic Manipulations (No Calculator) presents several functions:
exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, and/or inverse trigonometric. Two parts of
the question require students to solve equations using given functions. The third part
of the question requires students to rewrite given function expressions in equivalent
forms. In this question, students must (1) determine the exact values of expressions
that can be obtained without a calculator (2) use algebraic methods and rules for
exponents and logarithms to combine terms (3) show the work that leads to their answers in each part of the question.
Sample Free-Response Questions and Scoring Guidelines will be available on
AP Central and AP Classroom in summer 2023. Teachers are encouraged to

AP Precalculus Learning Notes
Learning Notes
UNIT 1
While studying polynomials, students use the zeros
or roots or x-intercepts of the graph of a polynomial
function to connect the graphical, numerical, analytical,
and verbal representations. The lessons learned with
polynomials apply to rational functions and extend
to include a deeper introduction to the relationship between zero and infinity. When investigating the
vertical, horizontal, and slant asymptotes of graphs,
students engage with the zero-infinity duality that occurs often in both mathematical and contextual phenomena. As the values of one variable increase
without bound, infinitely, the values of the other variable
become indistinguishable, zero distance, from a limiting
value. All phenomena that are inversely proportional demonstrate this zero-infinity limit behavior.
Students need to think about functions as representing
how quantities co-vary. Over equal-length input-value
intervals, they should consider how values of the output
variable change with respect to values of the input variable and consider whether the rates of change
are increasing or decreasing. Throughout the course, students should practice communicating with this language.
Teaching polynomial and rational functions should
be more than familiarizing students with a set of rules
and procedures. While the processes associated with
finding zeros, determining equations of asymptotes,
and curve sketching are included in this unit, time should be taken to build the underlying ideas.
Students should also communicate how graphical and
numerical representations are related to analytical
representations. Polynomials provide opportunities to
talk about concavity and estimate points of inflection
of graphs and are also useful in developing language
around relative and absolute extrema, a topic critical
to calculus. While studying rational functions, students
should practice using the language of, and wrestling
with, the concept of limit as they explore vertical,
horizontal, and slant asymptotes. For example, a student
may say, “As x approaches 2 from the left, the function
g decreases without bound, so the graph of g has a
vertical asymptote at x = 2,” and “As x increases without
bound, the function g has a limit of 1, so the graph of g
has a horizontal asymptote at y = 1.” Students should
be encouraged to communicate these important ideas
verbally in class, as well as in writing through a variety
of processing activities. They should also practice
explaining the relevance of their statements in that
context. As students develop polynomial and rational
function models for contextual scenarios, they should
be making conclusions with related numerical values and units situated in the context.
Polynomial functions will be used to model aspects
of a scenario. Polynomials are especially useful in
building models with multiple constraints. Phenomena that increase and decrease repeatedly without a
predictable, periodic pattern benefit from polynomial modeling. Every time the degree of a polynomial increases, an extra turn or twist may be added to
the graph of the polynomial function. Consequently, polynomials can model the height above the ground
versus distance from the starting point of a roller coaster. The full power of polynomials will not be experienced until the study of calculus, when
students learn that polynomials, a type of function that is “algebraic” and of which we have a great understanding, can be used to approximate many
“transcendental” functions, of which we have far less
ability to manipulate and control, to any degree of
accuracy desired. So polynomial functions are a critical building block for advanced work in STEM fields.
In this unit, students begin modeling aspects of contextual scenarios and data sets through transformations applied to parent functions and
technology-based regressions. Students will evaluate
a situation or data set for indications as to which is the
appropriate function type to use as a model, choose
an appropriate function type, model the situation or
data set with an appropriate function model, and make
conclusions about the scenario using the model. In
addition to choosing, developing, and using a model,
students will add assumptions and restrictions to the
models they develop. Students need to ask questions
of each other that help them restrict their model, clarify
assumptions related to the model, and defend their
choice of a certain model. This type of interaction
with other students will prepare them for modeling throughout the course.

UNIT 2
In precalculus courses, students typically learn how to
manipulate exponential and logarithmic functions and
equations. However, in AP Precalculus, students also
develop conceptual understanding of how exponential
and logarithmic functions change, how to model real world phenomena with these functions, and what
multiple representations of these functions reveal
about each other. Students also hone their thinking
about zero and infinity from Unit 1, as exponential and logarithmic functions demonstrate asymptotic behavior. Developing a comprehension beyond procedural knowledge helps students to develop a
deeper understanding of exponential and logarithmic functions.
Although most students entering precalculus have experience working with linear and exponential functions, they frequently struggle to see the
parallels between them. In this unit, students should
discover the similarities between discrete arithmetic
sequences and continuous linear functions, as well as discrete geometric sequences and continuous
exponential functions. Students should also explore the similarities between linear and exponential
functions. Since repeated addition can be understood
as multiplication and repeated multiplication can be understood as exponentiation, students should identify the parallels between the linear form f o f

x

equals, b plus, m times x  and the exponential form

f o f  x equals a times b to the power x .
Both forms include an initial value and a constant
involved with change and students should recognize
that the only structural difference is the operation of
addition versus multiplication. Note that it is useful to
move students from traditional slope-intercept form y e q u a l s m t i m e s x plus b to f of x equals, b plus, m times x m  for these activities.
As students explore these relationships, they should experience a multirepresentational approach to arithmetic and geometric sequences and linear and
exponential functions. Making connections among the
graphical, numerical, analytical, and verbal function
representations allows for a fuller understanding.
As a transition from exponential to logarithmic
functions, students first study logarithmic expressions
alone and begin to think in terms of a logarithmic
scale. Next, students will develop an understanding of
composition of functions and inverses in the setting
of general (non-analytical) functions such as f  and g
before moving to the more analytical experiences with
exponential functions and their inverses, logarithmic functions. Students should experience composition
of functions with different function representations
and develop communication skills related to function composition. For example, students may be given a
table of values for the function f  and a graph for g
and be asked to evaluate  g  of f of 2 . They may then
communicate that “The table for f maps 2 to 7, then
the graph for g maps 7 to approximately 4. So, the
composition maps 2 to 4.” Students should experience a composite function being undefined at certain
values because the output from the first function is
not in the domain of the second function. Students
should also experience graphing a composition of two
functions, with and without technology, which includes
holes, places where the composition is not defined,
and asymptotes. As students reverse the order of the
functions, they will find that function composition is not commutative.
The relationship between composition of functions and
inverses should be highlighted in this unit. Students
should practice composing functions with the identity function  f o f  x  analytically, graphically, and
numerically, and, additionally, find that composition with  f o f  x  does not change the other function.
Students should experience the parallels between f
o f  x  as the identity function for composition just
as 0 is the identity for addition and 1 is the identity
for multiplication. This development with “identity”
will allow for a smoother transition to working with
inverse functions because additive inverses add to
give 0, multiplicative inverses multiply to give 1, and function inverses compose to give x. Because an inverse function acts as the reverse mapping of a
function, students should practice verbally explaining the operations mapping values of x to values of

f

of x , then work together to explain how the
inverse function  f superscript minus 1  maps values of y to  x e qua ls, f superscript minus 1, of y .
These relationships can be leveraged to show that x

e q ual s ,

f
su perscript minus 1, of y, equals, f superscript minus 1, of, f of x . That is, the composition
of two functions that are inverses of each other maps to the identity function  f o f  x . There may be a
temptation to just apply the “swap x and y then solve
for y” approach to inverses. However, this approach
can lead to misconceptions about inverse functions
including confusion of the roles and meanings of the
independent and dependent variables for a function and its inverse, and errors in thinking about and
labeling the axes when graphing a function and its
inverse. This procedure should be treated with great
care as it invokes a complete reversal of the roles and
assignment of the variables, including their respective meanings and units, when applicable. Instruction
should focus on the conceptual development of inverse
functions so that students are able to build models,
explain relationships among function representations, and provide rationales for inverse relationships.
With this strong conceptual development of inverse
functions, the graphical, numerical, and analytical relationships between exponential functions and
logarithmic functions have a firm foundation for relating
the function types and using that knowledge to solve exponential and logarithmic equations.
It is important for students to gain numerical understandings of logarithms before exploring logarithmic functions as the inverse functions of
exponential functions. The use of logarithmic scales

can help students see how logarithms can manage
numerical data that tends towards large values. As the inverse relationship between exponential and
logarithmic functions is investigated, respective rates
of change should also be understood as inverses: the
output values of a general form exponential function
change proportionately over equal-length input-value
intervals while the input values of a general form logarithmic function change proportionately over equal-length output-value intervals.
Students will also experience comparing competing
function models for bivariate data sets and choosing
appropriate models by taking the residuals in regression
analysis into account. As students use technology to
calculate linear, quadratic, cubic, quartic, exponential,
and logarithmic regressions on data sets, they should
not lose sight of the conceptual importance of the residual plots and what those plots communicate.

UNIT 3
In addition to the standard treatment of trigonometric functions, this unit emphasizes modeling with
trigonometric functions, with and without technology.
Unlike transformations on linear, quadratic, exponential, and some polynomial functions, transformations on
the sine and cosine functions are, graphically speaking,
very apparent. With sinusoidal functions, vertical and
horizontal additive transformations – or graphical
translations – and vertical and horizontal multiplicative
transformations – or graphical dilations – are not
only easy to see both analytically and graphically, but
come with a rich vocabulary for communicating such
changes including vertical shift, phase shift, midline, amplitude, and period. Students should recognize
and communicate these characteristics as they build
models. From the scatterplot of an appropriate data
set, students should be able to estimate the amplitude,
vertical shift, and period of a sinusoidal function, build a
model from those values, and estimate the phase shift
needed to bring the model into phase with the data.
There are also other important concepts that students
will explore in this unit. Starting with right triangle trigonometry and the unit circle, students should
investigate why the sine function is a wave and why the
graph of the tangent function has asymptotes. Through classroom explorations and discussions, students
should be using language of covarying quantities. Since
the input values of trigonometric functions represent
angles and the output values relate to arcs of a circle,
students should practice explaining how the values
change with respect to each other and how the rates of
change are changing. For example, a student may say
“From 𝝅 over 2 to 𝝅 radians, as the angle increases the
values of sine decrease, and over equal-angle intervals,
the values of sine decrease at a decreasing rate.”
Practicing communicating changing rate of rates in this context is productive preparation for calculus.
Students will solve trigonometric equations, work with
trigonometric identities, and determine exact values
of trigonometric functions for certain angles. While they solve equations, students should account for
periodicity and domain restrictions. Domain restrictions
related to inverse trigonometric functions require special attention and students should be given an
opportunity to restrict the domain before the standard
restrictions are given to them. These skills are important
for working with trigonometric functions in calculus and other college-level STEM courses.
Students will also explore a new coordinate system.
Polar coordinates describe a location in the plane by a distance from a reference point and an angle
from a reference direction. Trigonometry is key in
relating the familiar rectangular coordinate system to the polar coordinate system. While studying polar functions, students should engage with
covarying quantities in this novel setting. The set
of input values for a polar function are angles and
the output values are radii. Consequently, intervals of increase or decrease, maxima and minima, and rates of change take on different meanings that
are related to characteristics of functions in the rectangular coordinate system. Students should be able to communicate that “As the angle increases
from 𝝅 over 2 to 𝝅 the radius starts at 4, increases to 6, decreases to 0, and then increases again.”
The transition in thinking to a different coordinate
system forces students to revisit their thinking about function behavior—zeros, extrema, and especially
relative rates of change. Just as studying a different language deepens understanding of one’s native
language, so can the study of functions based on a different coordinate system strengthen students’
understanding of functions, their behavior, and their characteristics.

UNIT 4
Since most of the content in this unit is likely to be
unfamiliar to students, it will be important for them to
have contextual anchors and language on which to build
their understandings. When someone throws a ball to
someone else, the ball’s path is a parabola. Through
Algebra 1, Algebra 2, and earlier units in this course,
this path would be described in terms of height and distance from the first person as y

equals f of x , a quadratic
function of x. Parametric functions can also describe the same path, but as two equations based on the
parameter of time. The vertical height of the ball from
the ground at any time t seconds after it is thrown is given by

y
equals v of t , and the horizontal distance from the
first person is given by  x  eq uals h of t . With this parametric
function of vertical height and horizontal distance
both as functions of time, the two components can be
analyzed individually and with respect to each other.
Furthermore, rates of change of individual components
with respect to changes in values in the input variable
can also be understood independently or in relation to one another.
Alternately, using the particle motion in the plane context, students should express statements about
both position and motion in a direction. They should
also be justifying their conclusions while making claims.
For example, a student may say “The particle is moving
up and to the left from time t equals 1 to t equals 2
seconds because y of t is increasing on that interval and
x of t is decreasing,” or “The particle is farthest to the
right at time t equals 3.5 seconds because x of t has a
maximum at that time,” or “The only time the particle
is at the origin is at time t equals 4 seconds because x
of t equals zero only at times 1, 3, and 4 seconds; y of
t equals zero only at times 2, 4, and 6 seconds; and t
equals 4 seconds is the only time when x of t and y of t both equal zero.”
For many students, this will be the first time they graph
parametric functions. Technology should be used as a
tool to explore these graphs. However, students should
not just look at the graph produced by technology,
but they should also be looking at tables of values to
better understand how the parameter t impacts each dependent variable x and y. The concept of domain
is again critical in bounding parametric functions.
Students should experience the same mathematical
object expressed by two different parametric functions
over different domains. In addition, it is important for students to understand that graphs of parametric
functions may not pass the “vertical line test.” This
more advanced understanding of a function will stretch
those students who had memorized a rule or procedure
without internalizing the uniqueness requirement of a function.
Students will learn how to graph implicitly-defined
functions and examine how variables vary with respect to each other. Conic sections can be expressed by
implicitly-defined functions and can be analyzed and
graphed in this form. Conic sections and all other
implicitly-defined functions can also be parameterized
or rewritten as parametric functions. The topics of
parametric functions, implicitly-defined functions, and
the familiar shapes of conic sections help students to
understand the relationships in meaningful ways. In
understanding conic sections parametrically, students strengthen their understanding of trigonometric
functions and trigonometric identities since the tie
between implicit and parametric expressions of conic sections relies on trigonometry.
After a brief introduction to vectors and matrices, students should begin to experience linear
transformations via matrices and vectors in concrete
ways. Students may begin with vectors representing the
vertices of a random quadrilateral in Quadrant I of the
xy-plane and apply a 90-degree rotation matrix to see
how the matrix affects the quadrilateral. Students can
discover the impacts of various matrix transformations
through exploratory activities or guided instruction.
In the end, students should be able to produce three
matrices that, when applied to a large set of vectors,
rotate, dilate, and reflect an object in the xy-plane.
As students begin modeling situations involving
changes in states, care should be taken to compare
the matrix operation and transformation results to calculations done by hand to help students get a
feel for how the matrices are interacting with the situation being modeled. Students should practice communicating the results of applying different matrices to a given vector.
