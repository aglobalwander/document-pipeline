AP Equity and Access Policy
College Board strongly encourages educators to make equitable access a guiding
principle for their AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared
students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination
of barriers that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and
socioeconomic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented. Schools
should make every effort to ensure their AP classes reflect the diversity of their
student population. College Board also believes that all students should have
access to academically challenging course work before they enroll in AP classes,
which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to
equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.

About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills
that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking AP
courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and AP
Exams are developed and scored by college faculty and
experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges and
universities in the United States grant credit, advanced
placement, or both on the basis of successful AP Exam
scores; more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
assessments—Personal Progress Checks—that
teachers can assign throughout the year to measure
student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students: Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically challenging coursework before they enroll in AP
classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is
only through a commitment to equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses:
The AP Course Audit
AP Course Development
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the content
and skills that are the focus of the corresponding
college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also
organizes the content and skills into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many AP teachers have
told us they follow in order to focus their instruction.
The intention of this publication is to respect teachers’
time and expertise by providing a roadmap that they
can modify and adapt to their local priorities and
preferences. Moreover, by organizing the AP course
content and skills into units, the AP Program is able
to provide teachers and students with free formative
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP
courses must participate in the AP Course Audit, a
process through which AP teachers’ course materials
are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.

§ § §

The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the
AP teacher and the school principal (or designated
administrator) to confirm awareness and understanding
of the curricular and resource requirements. A syllabus
or course outline, detailing how course requirements
are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework.  The AP
Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor; all
AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision, piloting,
and analysis to ensure that questions are accurate, fair,
and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development, College
Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher education
institutions. This feedback is carefully considered to
ensure that AP courses and exams are able to provide
students with a college-level learning experience and
the opportunity to demonstrate their qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam development process, relies on the expertise of both AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course
performance assessments, as applicable, are scored by
thousands of college faculty and expert AP teachers.
Most are scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small
portion are scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly
trained, and their work is monitored throughout the
Reading for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves
as Chief Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP
Readers in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy
of the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a
curve. Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which
means that every student who meets the criteria for
an AP score of 2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no
matter how many students that is. The criteria for the
number of points students must earn on the AP Exam
to receive scores of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently validates for credit and placement
purposes—include:
Bullet The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
Bullet The number of points researchers have found to be predictive that an AP student will succeed when placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
Bullet Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP
scores as follows:

While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the United States have
adopted statewide credit policies that ensure college
credit for scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and universities. To confirm a specific college’s AP
credit/placement policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/creditpolicies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for
seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score
the free-response sections of the AP Exams. Ninety eight percent of surveyed educators who took part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an
AP Reader, including opportunities to:
Bullet Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
Bullet Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure
to the quality and depth of the responses from the
entire pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
Bullet Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
Bullet Score from home: AP Readers have online distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects. Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
Bullet Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs):
AP Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enables students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide suggests a
sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds skill instruction across units, organizes content
into topics, and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course topics and skills, create
customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.﻿

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
Bullet Teachers and students sign in to, or create, their College Board accounts.
Bullet Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
Bullet Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
Bullet Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP coordinator.
Bullet Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and AP coordinators
to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following additional benefits:
Bullet
Bullet Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
Bullet Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student pack.
The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
Bullet Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

About the AP Physics C:
Mechanics Course
AP Physics C: Mechanics is a calculus-based, college-level physics course. It covers
kinematics; Newton’s laws of motion; work, energy, and power; systems of particles and linear
momentum; circular motion and rotation; oscillations; and gravitation.
College Course Equivalent
It is strongly recommended that AP Physics C: Mechanics be taught as a second-year
physics course. A first-year physics course aimed at developing a thorough understanding of
important physical principles and that permits students to explore concepts in the laboratory
provides a richer experience in the process of science and better prepares them for the more
analytical approaches taken in AP Physics C: Mechanics.
However, secondary school programs for the achievement of AP course goals can take other
forms as well, and imaginative teachers can design approaches that best fit the needs of
their students. In some schools, AP Physics C: Mechanics has been taught successfully as
a very intensive first year course; but in this case, there may not be enough time to cover the
material in sufficient depth to reinforce the students’ conceptual understanding or to provide
adequate laboratory experiences. This approach can work for highly motivated, able students
but is not generally recommended. Independent study or other first year physics courses
supplemented with extra work for individual, motivated students are also possibilities that have been successfully implemented.
If AP Physics C: Mechanics is taught as a second year course, it is recommended that the
course meet for at least 250 minutes per week (the equivalent of a 50-minute period every
day). However, if it is to be taught as a first year course, approximately 90 minutes per day
(450 minutes per week) is recommended in order to devote sufficient time to study the
material to an appropriate depth and allow time for labs. In a school that uses block scheduling,
one of the AP Physics C courses, but not both, can be taught in a single semester.
Whichever approach is taken, the nature of the AP Physics C: Mechanics course requires
teachers to spend time on the extra preparation needed for both class and laboratory. AP
teachers should have a teaching load that is adjusted accordingly.
Prerequisites
Students should have taken or be concurrently taking calculus.
Laboratory Requirement
AP Physics C: Mechanics should include a hands-on laboratory component comparable
to a semester-long introductory college-level physics laboratory. Students should spend
a minimum of 25% of instructional time engaged in hands-on laboratory work. Students
ask questions, make observations and predictions, design experiments, analyze data, and
construct arguments in a collaborative setting, where they direct and monitor their progress.
Each student should complete a lab notebook or portfolio of lab reports.

Introduction
The AP Physics C: Mechanics course outlined in this framework reflects a
commitment to what physics teachers, professors, and researchers have
agreed is the main goal of a college-level physics course: to help students
develop a deep understanding of the foundational principles that shape
classical mechanics. By confronting complex physical situations or
scenarios, the course is designed to enable students to develop the ability
to reason about physical phenomena using important science practices,
such as creating and analyzing representations of physical scenarios,
designing experiments, analyzing data, and using mathematics to model and to solve problems.
To foster this deeper level of learning, the AP Physics
C: Mechanics course defines concepts, skills, and
understandings required by representative colleges and universities for granting college credit and
placement. Students will practice reasoning skills
used by physicists by discussing and debating, with
peers, the physical phenomena investigated in class,
as well as by designing and conducting inquiry-based
laboratory investigations to solve problems through
first-hand observations, data collection, analysis, and interpretation.
This document is not a complete curriculum. Teachers
create their own local curriculum by selecting, for each
concept, content that enables students to explore the
course learning objectives and meets state or local
requirements. This result is a course that prepares students for college credit and placement.

Content
Based on the Understanding by Design® (Wiggins and McTighe) model, this
course framework provides a clear and detailed description of the course
requirements necessary for student success. The framework specifies what
students must know, be able to do, and understand, with a focus on big ideas
that encompass core principles, theories, and processes of the discipline.
The framework also encourages instruction that prepares students to make
connections across domains through a broader way of thinking about the physical world.
Big Ideas
The big ideas serve as the foundation of the course and develop understanding
as they spiral throughout the course. The big ideas enable students to create
meaningful connections among course concepts. Often, these big ideas are
abstract concepts or themes that become threads that run throughout the
course. Revisiting the big ideas and applying them in a variety of contexts allow
students to develop deeper conceptual understanding. Following are the big
ideas of the course and a brief description of each:
2
BIG IDEA 1: CHANGE (CHA)
Interactions produce changes in motion.
BIG IDEA 2: FORCE INTERACTIONS (INT)
Forces characterize interactions between objects or systems.
BIG IDEA 3: FIELDS (FLD)
Fields predict and describe interactions.
BIG IDEA 4: CONSERVATION (CON)
Conservation laws constrain interactions.

Introduction
Designed with extensive input from the community of AP Physics C:
Mechanics educators, the unit guides offer teachers helpful guidance in
building students’ skills and knowledge. The suggested sequence was
identified through a thorough analysis of the syllabi of highly effective AP
teachers and the organization of typical college textbooks.
This unit structure respects new AP teachers’ time by providing one
possible sequence they can adopt or modify rather than having to build
from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units enable the AP
Program to provide interested teachers with formative assessments—the
Personal Progress Checks—that they can assign their students at the end
of each unit to gauge progress toward success on the AP Exam. However,
experienced AP teachers who are pleased with their current course
organization and exam results should feel no pressure to adopt these
units, which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

Building the

1.C
3.A
4.A
The ability to describe and explain physical processes, principles, and concepts is central to the study of physics. Physicists often create and use models and representations to analyze phenomena, make predictions, and communicate ideas. In this unit, students will practice demonstrating consistency between different types of representations of the same physical situation. For example, students will create a motion map, a velocity versus time graph, and a set of equations that all model the same motion of an object or a system. The content of Unit 1 provides students with multiple opportunities to discuss the relationships between variables and to model these relationships with various representations.
Unit 1 will also teach students to identify appropriate data to plot in order to describe patterns and trends in data, as patterns and trends help scientists understand relationships between fundamental laws and the world around them. Because identifying the appropriate data as well as identifying patterns gets easier with practice, introducing these skills in Unit 1 is important for student success.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Students should be able to identify, describe, and/or explain the relationships among features in graphs, free-body diagrams, and other representations. They should also be able to analyze patterns and trends in data (i.e., different motion plots) and use mathematical routines (selecting appropriate kinematic equations, deriving mathematical relationships, etc.).
Often, students studying kinematics have trouble recognizing one major difference between instantaneous and average velocity.
That is, instantaneous velocity is a property of an object in motion at a single time, while the average velocity (total displacement divided by total time) of an object in motion depends on the total amount of time.
Developing Understanding
Although motion is considered an accepted phenomenon because it can easily be seen,
discerning—and eventually understanding—why objects move requires more observation.
Unit 1 introduces students to kinematics—particularly one-dimensional, two-dimensional,
and projectile motion. Students will not only learn how to define each kinematic quantity
(position, velocity, acceleration, and time), but also how to distinguish between them, and
how to graphically and mathematically represent the relationships among them. Kinematics
serves as a foundation for various physics principles and concepts, and in the units that
follow, students are expected to call upon their knowledge of kinematic quantities to describe
components of motion in a variety of scenarios, such as how acceleration is addressed with Newton’s third law of motion.

Students often struggle with knowing where to begin with laboratory design free-response questions. For help, we recommend they perform scaffolded activities and labs to determine the appropriate data needed to answer a scientific question. Teachers can refer to the learning objectives aligned to this unit to create these activities.
The laboratory focus in Unit 2 encourages students to make observations and/or collect data from representations of laboratory setups or results. Students are required to determine an appropriate experimental procedure, including sketches of the laboratory setup to answer a scientific question.
On the AP Exam, a free-response question may require students to create, use, and analyze graphs and representations (i.e., free body force diagrams) when applying Newton’s second law of motion. Students must select an appropriate law, definition, or model to describe a physical situation and/or develop a logical and coherent argument (or aspects of one). For example, when given a scenario in which two almost identical masses are hung on opposite sides of a pulley, students should be able to predict and justify why the acceleration of the system will be much smaller than the acceleration due to gravity.
Unit 2 also provides opportunities to develop the skill of crafting scientific arguments.
Scientific arguments may specify a cause and-effect relationship between variables or describe a mechanism through which a phenomenon occurs. By the end of the unit, students should be able to identify the

2.D evidence necessary to defend a claim, be able to identify a fundamental principle of physics to begin the reasoning process, and begin to sketch out the support for a claim citing evidence from physical representations.
7.C
The ability to create, describe, and use representations is central to the study of physics. Physicists create and use models and representations to analyze phenomena, make predictions, and communicate ideas.
In Unit 2, students will describe and discuss the relationships between different types of representations (for example, mathematical models and free-body diagrams) of the same physical situation and will re-express one type of representation as another.
Preparing for the AP Exam
To understand how and why objects move, students must first understand the role forces play
in motion. Unit 2 investigates Newton’s laws of motion, which describe the relationship among
moving objects and the forces acting on them. Students will learn how forces can change the
motion of an object (first law); about the relationship between force, mass, and motion (second
classical mechanics, and in subsequent units, students will evolve their understanding by applying
Newton’s laws of motion to a variety of physics principles, including the conservation of energy
(Unit 3), rotation (Unit 5), simple harmonic motion (Unit 6), and the orbital motion of satellites (Unit 7).

Scientific questions can range in scope as well as specificity. Students will identify or describe the appropriate principle needed to answer a specific scientific question, as well as the potential sources of experimental uncertainty. Students will identify and/or describe potential sources of experimental error either in their own experiments or when given an experimental setup.
Preparing for the AP Exam
When answering free-response questions, students should be able to select relevant features of a graph to describe a physical situation (e.g., graphs of force versus position, where the area under the curve is equal to the work done). Students should also be able to derive symbolic expressions from known quantities, as well as apply the appropriate laws, definitions, and/or mathematical relationships to perform a calculation or solve a problem. For example, students could be asked to apply the work-energy theorem to a scenario or calculate the negative integral of force with respect to position to determine the change in potential energy of a system.
Students will develop the practice of argumentation by predicting the causes or effects of a change in, or disruption to, one or more components in a system. It is essential that students are able to clearly demonstrate the ability to determine the relationship between variables within an equation when a new variable is introduced.

students make connections to other content presented in the course. For instance, students

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
CON-1.B.1
A definition that relates conservative forces internal to the system to the potential energy
function of the system is:Delta U equals negative integral from a to b of ((vector (F subscript (c f)) dot d vector (r))

CON-1.D a. Derive the expression for the potential energy function of an ideal spring.
b. Derive an expression for the potential energy function of a nonideal spring that has a nonlinear relationship with position.
CON-1.D.1
An ideal spring acting on an object is an example of a conservative force within a system (spring-object system). The ideal spring relationship is modeled by the following
law and is also called “linear spring:”vector (F subscript s) equals negative k times delta vector (x) a. Using the general relationship between conservative force and potential energy, the potential energy for an ideal spring can be
shown as:U subscript s equals 1 over 2 times k times (delta x) squared b. Nonlinear spring relationships can also be explored. These nonlinear forces are conservative since they are internal to the system (of spring-object) and dependent on position.

UNIT 4
Building the
Science Practices
1.E
2.C
7.D
The analysis, interpretation, and application of quantitative information are vital skills for students in AP Physics.
Opportunities for scientific inquiry should be designed and implemented with increasing student involvement to help enhance the development of inquiry learning, critical thinking, and problem solving skills. The laboratory focus in Unit 4 encourages students to identify appropriate experimental procedures to answer scientific questions. Students are required to clearly and concisely determine an appropriate experimental procedure, including sketches of the laboratory setup.
Unit 4 continues to challenge students to work with representations to help describe what happens when the conditions of a scenario are changed. It is important students have scaffolded practice with modifying assumptions or conditions and making predictions about the results. It is also essential that students can use fundamental principles of physics as evidence to defend and justify their claims.
Preparing for the AP Exam
To earn full credit on a free response question, students must demonstrate competency of the learning objectives. This can be achieved by having ample practice and opportunities to apply the science practices. For instance, students should be able to articulate assumptions and limits of a representation of a physical situation, including assuming symmetry of objects and systems and describing the limitations of conservation of kinetic energy in certain collisions. They should also be able to derive a symbolic expression from known quantities. For example, students should be able to derive a symbolic expression for the final velocity of two boxes after a collision.
Students should also be given multiple opportunities to develop a coherent and logical argument (or aspects of one) and to use physical principles and/or empirical data to justify a claim or prediction. An example of this practice includes verifying the law of conservation of momentum during an explosion.
Developing Understanding
Have you ever wondered how a tennis player times a return shot? Alongside skill, players must
consider a number of factors to estimate how far, fast, or high their swings should be. Unit 4
introduces students to these factors through the concepts of center of mass, impulse and
momentum, and the conservation of linear momentum. Students will learn the relationship
between impulse and momentum via application or calculations. The conservation of linear
momentum and how it’s applied to collisions is also addressed. Unit 4 offers a complete
picture of the motion of a system, which is explored primarily through impulse and changes in
momentum. Students will further their understanding of momentum and angular momentum
in Unit 7 as they begin to articulate orbital and rotational motion.

Explain the difference between the terms “center of gravity” and “center of mass,” and identify physical situations when these terms have identical positions and when they have different positions.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
CHA-3.B.1
If there is no net force acting on an object or a system, the center of mass does not accelerate; therefore, the velocity of the center of mass remains unchanged.
a. A system of multiple objects can be represented as one single mass with a position represented by the center of mass.
b. The linear motion of a system can be described by the displacement, velocity, and acceleration of its center of mass.
CHA-3.C.1
The center of gravity is not precisely the same scientific quantity as the center of mass.
If the object experiencing a gravitational interaction with a large planet is of large dimensions (comparable to the planet), then the gravitational acceleration due to the large planet will be a nonuniform value over the length of the object. This would result in the center of gravity location being a different location than the center of mass.

Science Practices
3.C
5.D
6.D
In this unit, students will create and use graphical representations to demonstrate understanding of the functional relationships between the variables that describe the motion of objects or systems. The content of Unit 5 provides students with multiple opportunities to discuss the relationships between variables and to graph these relationships in various scenarios.
Unit 5 will also help students master clear and concise derivations of a change in quantity using mathematical relationships.
On the AP Exam, students should be comfortable with calculating an unknown quantity with units, and/or a symbolic expression from known quantities, by selecting and following a logical computational pathway. Students should also be able to assess the reasonableness of their results or solutions and will be expected to derive and/or calculate on the free-response section on the AP Physics C:
Mechanics Exam.
Preparing for the AP Exam
To earn full credit on a free-response question, students must be able to describe and modify their assumptions about a representation of a physical situation.
They should also be able to determine the change in a quantity using a mathematical relationship and calculate a symbolic expression from known quantities. For example, students should be able to determine the change in angular momentum after torque has been applied to a pulley.
Calculating an unknown quantity with units, and/or a symbolic expression from known quantities, by selecting and following a logical computational pathway is also required. For example, students must be able to calculate the angular acceleration of a hoop rolling without sliding down an incline. Quite often when prompted to “calculate,” students will fail to properly show all mathematical work.
They should start with a known physics formula and show, step-by-step (including numeric substitutions), how a final answer is achieved.
Developing Understanding
In this unit, students will investigate torque and rotational statics, kinematics, and dynamics, in
addition to angular momentum and its conservation, to gain an in-depth and comprehensive
understanding of rotation. Students are provided with opportunities to make connections
between the content and models explored in the first four units, as well as with opportunities
to demonstrate the analogy between translational and rotational kinematics. Unfortunately,
when dealing with rotational motion, all the conceptual difficulties found in translational
motion also have direct analogs. For example, if the angular velocity is zero, students often
believe that the angular acceleration must also be zero. Astronomical phenomena (such as
satellites in orbit) are explored in Unit 7 to build students’ knowledge of angular momentum and its conservation.

Linearizing data is an important skill that helps students to re-express data, see functional relationships, and write equations between variables. Regular analysis of data collected in the laboratory, as well as laboratory type data, will strengthen students’ linearization and data analysis skills.
Representations exist to make describing, explaining, and analyzing phenomena more manageable. It is vital that students are given multiple opportunities to represent data to be able to discuss how that data or graph illustrates physics principles, processes, concepts, or theories.
of error and how each error affects the results of the experiment.
Unit 6 will continue to develop the practice of writing clear and concise laboratory observations and data collection, as well as identifying and/or describing potential sources of experimental error. Students should have multiple opportunities every unit to perform laboratory investigations, particularly inquiry-based investigations where they are challenged to think about, discuss, and analyze the potential sources
Preparing for the AP Exam
One of the free-response questions may require students to create graphs, free body and free-body force diagrams, or other representations. Students often fail to create effective graphs due to an inability to choose appropriate quantities and labels
(with units), a useful scale, correctly plot given data points, and draw a best-fit line. These elements must be performed correctly to receive full credit. Additionally, students must be adept at working with graphs (creation, analysis, interpreting, etc.) and constructing coherent arguments for them or other phenomena. For example, justifying the claim that an object is experiencing a restoring force based on the analysis of its motion and comparison to SHM.
Some students also struggle with correctly drawing free-body diagrams. It’s recommended that students have ample practice and opportunities to practice this skill. For example, when drawing free-body force diagrams, students should pay careful attention to including appropriate forces and correct relative vector lengths.
Developing Understanding
While earlier units focused on linear motion, Unit 6 pays close attention to the type of motion we
experience when we talk or listen to music. Through the concept of oscillations, students are
introduced to the model of simple harmonic motion (SHM), springs, and pendulums. Students
will discover why some objects repeat their motions with a regular pattern. They will also apply
the model of SHM, define the three kinematic characteristics (displacement, velocity, and
acceleration), and practice representing them graphically and mathematically. During their study
of oscillations, students will gain a more in-depth understanding of motion, making them better
equipped to apply their knowledge of forces and motion to waves. Students will continue to
expand on circular motion in Unit 7 as they explore celestial bodies and objects.

Building the
Science Practices
5.E
1.D
3.D
At this point in the course, students should be skilled at crafting clear and concise derivations that utilize fundamental principles of physics and follow a clear and logical algebraic pathway. Students should also be able to assess the feasibility of their solutions by checking units and functional relationships to determine if their solution is correct. This is an especially important skill when performing derivations, as the solution is often something that looks “messy” and is difficult to assess without practice.

As students progress, they should become more proficient at selecting and creating relevant representations (e.g., free-body diagrams) to answer a question or defend claims, illustrate physical situations, solve problems, and show consistency between multiple sets of representations of the same physical scenario.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Students should be able to assess the reasonableness of solutions. For gravity based problems, they must be able to assess whether 500 kg is a reasonable solution for the mass of the sun or the mass of a person.
They should also be able to construct a logical and coherent argument (or aspects of one) that supports their assessment or any other phenomena. Aspects or elements of an argument include explanations, predictions, and justifications.
Teachers should provide ample time and practice for students to develop and/ or evaluate an argument using scientific reasoning that connects their claim and evidence; assumptions and limitations should also be considered. For example, students should be able to develop an explanation that supports the assertion that there exists in the space between two massive bodies a point where the net gravitational force on a test object is zero.
Student explanations must always include a claim supported by evidence and reasoning.
Developing Understanding
Unit 7 investigates Newton’s laws of gravity and the relationships shared between planets,
satellites, and their orbits. Students will become familiar with the law of universal gravitation
and how it can be applied to any pair of masses and will consider the motion of an object
in orbit under the influence of gravitational forces. Additionally, students will be given
opportunities to relate connected knowledge across units by applying and deriving Kepler’s
laws of planetary motion to circular or general orbits. Drawing such relationships will help
elevate students’ understanding of motion and force in various circumstances.

Lab Experiments
Although laboratory work has often been separated
from classroom work, research shows that experience
and experiment are often more instructionally effective when flexibly integrated into the development of
concepts. When students build their own conceptual understanding of the principles of physics, their
familiarity with the concrete evidence for their ideas
leads to deeper understanding and gives them a sense
of ownership of the knowledge they have constructed.
Scientific inquiry experiences in AP Physics C:
Mechanics should be designed and implemented
with increasing student involvement to help enhance
inquiry learning and the development of critical thinking
and problem-solving skills and abilities. Typically, the
level of investigations in an AP Physics C: Mechanics classroom should focus primarily on the continuum
between guided and open inquiry. However, depending
on students’ familiarity with a topic, a given laboratory
experience might incorporate a sequence involving all
four levels of inquiry (confirmation, structured inquiry, guided inquiry, and open inquiry).
Lab Manuals and Lab Notebooks
College Board publishes AP Physics 1 and 2 Inquiry-
Based Lab Investigations: A Teacher's Manual to
support the guided inquiry lab requirement for the course.
It includes labs that teachers can choose from to satisfy
the guided inquiry lab component for the course. Many
publishers and science classroom material distributors
offer affordable lab manuals with outlined experiments
and activities as well as lab notebooks for recording lab
data and observations. Students can use any type of
notebook to fulfill the lab notebook requirement, even an
online document. Consider the needs of the classroom when deciding what type of lab notebook to use.
Lab Materials
be accomplished with simple, inexpensive materials
and with more sophisticated physics equipment, such
air tracks, force sensors, and oscilloscopes. Remember
that the AP lab should provide experience for students
equivalent to that of a college laboratory, so teachers are
encouraged to make every effort to provide a range of
experiences—from experiments students contrive from
plumbing pipe, string, and duct tape to experiments in
which students gather and analyze data using calculators or computer-interfaced equipment.
A wide range of equipment may be used in the
physics laboratory, from generic lab items, such as
metersticks, rubber balls, springs, string, metal spheres,
calibrated mass sets, beakers, glass and cardboard
tubes, electronic balances, stopwatches, clamps, and
ring stands, to items more specific to physics, such
as tracks, carts, light bulbs, resistors, magnets, and
batteries. Successful guided inquiry student work can
There are avenues that teachers can explore as a
means of getting access to more expensive equipment, such as computers and probes. Probes can often
be rented for short periods of time from instrument
suppliers. Alternatively, local colleges or universities
may allow high school students to complete a lab as a
field trip on their campus, or they may allow teachers to
borrow their equipment. They may even donate their old
equipment. Some schools have partnerships with local
businesses that can help with laboratory equipment and
materials. Teachers can also utilize online donation sites such as Donors Choose and Adopt-A-Classroom.
Lab Time
For AP Physics C: Mechanics to be comparable to a
college physics course, it is critical that teacher’s make
laboratory work an important part of their curriculum.
An analysis of data from AP Physics examinees, regarding the length of time they spent per week
in the laboratory, shows that increased laboratory
time correlates with higher AP scores. Flexible or modular scheduling must be implemented to meet
the time requirements identified in the course outline.
At minimum, one double period a week is needed.
Furthermore, it is important that the AP Physics laboratory program be adapted to local conditions
and funding as it aims to offer the students a well rounded experience with experimental physics.
Adequate laboratory facilities should be provided so
that each student has a work space where equipment and materials can be left overnight if necessary.
Sufficient laboratory equipment for the anticipated enrollment and appropriate instruments should be
provided. Students in AP Physics should have access
to computers with software appropriate for processing laboratory data and writing reports.

How to Set Up a Lab Program
Physics is not just a subject. Rather, it is a way of approaching scientific discovery that requires
personal observation and physical experimentation.
Being successful in this endeavor requires students
to synthesize and use a broad spectrum of knowledge
and skills, including mathematical, computational,
experimental, and practical skills, and to develop
habits of mind that might be characterized as thinking
like a physicist. Student-directed, inquiry-based lab experience supports the AP Physics C: Mechanics
course and AP Course Audit curricular requirements.
It provides opportunities for students to design
experiments, collect data, apply mathematical routines and methods, and refine testable explanations and predictions. The AP Physics C: Mechanics course should include a hands-on laboratory component
comparable to a semester-long introductory college level physics laboratory. Students should spend a minimum of 25% of instructional time engaged in hands-on laboratory work.
The AP Physics C: Mechanics Exam directly assesses
the learning objectives of the course framework, which
means that the inclusion of appropriate experiments
aligned with those learning objectives is important for
student success. Teachers should select experiments
that provide students with the broadest laboratory experience possible.
We encourage teachers to be creative in designing
their lab program while ensuring that students explore
and develop understandings of these core techniques.
After completion, students should be able to describe
how to construct knowledge, model (create an abstract
representation of a real system), design experiments, analyze visual data, and communicate physics.
Students should also develop an understanding of
how changes in the design of the experiments would
affect the outcome of their results. Many questions on
the AP Exam are written in an experimental context,
so these skills will prove invaluable for both concept comprehension and exam performance.
to laboratories should be similar to that in a college course. Therefore, school administrators should realize the implications, in both cost and time, of incorporating serious laboratories into their program. Schools must ensure that students have access to scientific equipment and all materials
necessary to conduct hands-on, college-level physics laboratory investigations.
Because AP Physics C: Mechanics is equivalent to a college course, the equipment and time allotted
Getting Students Started
There are no prescriptive “steps” to the iterative process of inquiry-based investigations. However,
there are some common characteristics of inquiry that
will support students in designing their investigations.
Often, this simply begins with using the learning objectives to craft a question for students to
investigate. Teachers may choose to give students a list
of materials they are allowed to use in their design or
require that students request the equipment they feel they need to investigate the question. Working
with learning objectives to craft questions may include
the following:
§Bullet Selecting learning objectives from the course framework that relate to the subject under study,
and that may set forth specific tasks, in the form of “Design an experiment to . . . . ”
§Bullet Rephrasing or refining the learning objectives that
align to the unit of study to create an inquiry-based investigation for students.
Students should be given latitude to make design modifications or ask for additional equipment
appropriate for their design. It is also helpful for
individual groups to report to the class their basic
design to elicit feedback on feasibility. Guided student
groups can proceed through the experiment, with the
teacher allowing them the freedom to make mistakes—
as long as those mistakes don’t endanger students or
equipment or lead the groups too far off task. Students
should have many opportunities for post-lab reporting so that groups can understand the successes and challenges of individual lab designs.

Communication, Group
Collaboration, and the
Laboratory Record
Laboratory work is an excellent means through which students can develop and practice communication skills. Success in subsequent work in physics
depends heavily on an ability to communicate about
observations, ideas, and conclusions. Students must
learn to recognize that an understanding of physics is
relatively useless unless they can communicate their
knowledge effectively to others. By working together
in a truly collaborative manner to plan and carry out
experiments, students learn oral communication skills and teamwork. Students must be encouraged to take
full individual responsibility for the success, or failure, of the collaboration.
After students are given a question for investigation,
they may present their findings in either a written or
an oral report to the teacher and class for feedback
and critique on their final design and results. Students
should be encouraged to critique and challenge one another’s claims based on the evidence collected during the investigation.
Laboratory Safety
Giving students the responsibility for design of their own laboratory experience involves special responsibilities for teachers. To ensure a safe
working environment, teachers should first provide
the limitations and safety precautions necessary for potential procedures and equipment students may
use during their investigation. Teachers should also
provide specific guidelines prior to students’ discussion on investigation designs for each experiment, so
that those precautions can be incorporated into final student-selected lab designs and included in the
background or design plan in a laboratory record. It may
also be helpful to print the precautions that apply to
that specific lab as safety notes to place on the desk or
wall near student workstations. Additionally, a general
set of safety guidelines should be set forth for students
at the beginning of the course. The following is a list of possible general guidelines teachers may post.
Bullet Before each lab, make sure you know and record the
potential hazards involved in the investigation, as
well as the precautions you will take to stay safe.
Bullet Before using equipment, make sure you know the proper method of use to acquire good data and avoid damage to equipment.
Bullet Know where safety equipment is located in the lab,
such as the fire extinguisher, safety goggles, and the first aid kit.
Bullet Follow the teacher’s special safety guidelines as set forth prior to each experiment. (Students should
record these as part of their design plan for a lab.)
Bullet When in doubt about the safety or advisability of a procedure, check with the teacher before proceeding.
Teachers should interact constantly with students as
they work to observe safety practices and anticipate
and discuss with them any problems that may arise.
Walking among student groups, asking questions, and
showing interest in students’ work allow teachers to
keep the pulse of what students are doing and maintain a watchful eye for potential safety issues.

Selecting and Using Course Materials
Teachers will benefit from a wide array of materials to help students become proficient with the
science practices and skills necessary to develop a
conceptual understanding of the relationships, laws, and phenomena studied in AP Physics C: Mechanics.
In addition to using a college-level textbook that will provide required course content, students should
have regular opportunities to create and use data, representations, and models. Rich, experimental
investigation is the cornerstone of AP Physics, and
diverse source material allows teachers more flexibility
in designing the types of learning activities that will help develop the habits of thinking like a physicist.

While nearly all college-level physics textbooks address
the seven units of AP Physics C: Mechanics, it’s important for teachers to identify other types of secondary
sources to supplement the chosen textbook accordingly,
ensuring that each of the seven topic areas and, as well
as the science practices, receive adequate attention.
AP Central provides an example textbook list to help
determine whether a text is considered appropriate in meeting the AP Physics C: Mechanics Course
Audit resource requirement. Teachers can also select textbooks locally.
Guided Inquiry in AP
Physics C: Mechanics
AP Physics courses require students to engage with
data in a variety of ways. The analysis, interpretation,
and application of quantitative information are vital skills for students in AP Physics C: Mechanics.
Scientific inquiry experiences in this course should be designed and implemented with increasing student
involvement to help enhance inquiry learning and the
development of critical thinking and problem-solving
skills and abilities. Typically, the level of investigations
in an AP Physics C: Mechanics classroom should focus primarily on the continuum between guided and open inquiry. However, depending on students’
familiarity with a topic, a given laboratory experience
might incorporate a sequence involving all four levels of
inquiry (confirmation, structured inquiry, guided inquiry, and open inquiry).

Instructional Strategies
The AP Physics C: Mechanics course framework outlines the concepts and skills students must master in order
to be successful on the AP Exam. In order to address those concepts and skills effectively, teachers should
incorporate a variety of instructional approaches and best practices into their daily lessons and activities. Teachers
can help students develop mastery of the skills by engaging them in learning activities that allow them to apply their
understanding of course concepts. Teachers may consider the following strategies as they plan instruction. Please
note they are listed alphabetically and not by order of importance or instruction.
Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Ask the Expert
Students are assigned as “experts” on problems they have mastered.
Groups rotate through the expert stations to learn about problems they have not yet mastered.
Students to share their knowledge and learn from one another.
In rotational mechanics, assign students as “experts” on rotation questions involving different solution techniques.
Have students move through stations in groups, working with the station expert to justify a set of claims with corresponding physical laws.
Bar Chart
Bar chart tasks have histograms for one or more quantities. Frequently, histograms are given for before and after some physical process with one bar left off. Students are asked to complete the bar chart by supplying the value for the missing quantity. These are a new type of representation, requiring the students to translate between whatever other representation they are using and this one. Bar chart tasks are usually quite productive in helping students to make meaning.
These items can be especially useful since most students seem to adapt to bar chart representations relatively easily.
Bar chart tasks help students make meaning by asking them to translate between before and after some physical process.
This strategy can be used with conservation laws. Ask students to define the system and then create bar charts for before and after some event. For example, students might create an energy bar chart for a ball rolling down an incline. Students would identify the system and then create one set of charts for the top of the incline and a separate set of charts for the bottom of the incline.

Changing
Representations
These tasks require students to translate from one representation (e.g., an electric field diagram) to another (e.g., an equipotential curves or surfaces diagram).
Students often learn how to cope with one representation without really learning the role and value of representations and their relationship to problem solving. Getting them to go back and forth between/among different representations for a concept helps them develop a more robust understanding of each representation. Among the representations that will be employed are mathematical relationships, so this task can serve, at times, as a bridge between conceptual understanding and traditional problem solving.
Students create pictures, tables, graphs, lists, equations, models, and/or verbal expressions to interpret text or data. This helps organize information using multiple ways to present data and answer a question or show a problem’s solution.
As students learn about energy conservation, ask them to move between different representations. For example, for a given situation involving energy conservation, students should be able to create a sketch of the identified system, a set of conservation of energy equations, sets of energy bar charts and graphs of potential energy, kinetic energy, total energy, or combinations of the above representations.
Concept-Oriented
Demonstration
These tasks involve an actual demonstration but with the students doing as much of the description, prediction, and explanation as possible. Although the demonstration should produce results students don’t expect, students should nonetheless feel comfortable making predictions about what will happen.
Involving an actual demonstration, students are asked to predict and explain.
This strategy is useful for helping students to practice writing descriptions, predictions, and explanations. Often when conducting an experiment, data collection takes the most amount of time and gets the most amount of focus, so students mistakenly believe it to be the most important piece.
If teachers supplement their longer laboratory experiments with concept-oriented demonstrations, students can practice important laboratory skills (description, prediction, and explanation) without taking huge amounts of class time collecting data.

Purpose
Example
Conflicting
Contentions
Conflicting contentions tasks present students with two or three statements that disagree in some way, and students decide which contention they agree with and explain why. These tasks are very useful for contrasting statements of students’ alternate conceptions with physically accepted statements.
This process is facilitated in these tasks because they can be phrased as “which statement do you agree with and why” rather than asking which statement is correct or true.
These tasks complement the “What if Anything Is Wrong?” tasks.
These tasks help contrast statements of students’ alternate conceptions with physically accepted statements.
This strategy is useful for helping students begin to understand how to write a full argument. By providing the arguments and having students identify good claims (and not-so-good claims) and good evidence and reasoning (and not-so-good evidence and reasoning), teachers can help scaffold the practice of good argumentation for their students.
Construct an
Argument
Students use mathematical reasoning to present assumptions about mathematical situations, support conjectures with mathematically relevant and accurate data, and provide a logical progression of ideals leading to a conclusion that makes sense.
Helps develop reasoning skills and enhances communication skills in supporting conjectures and conclusions. This strategy also helps develop the process of evaluating mathematical information.
This strategy can be used with word problems that do not lend themselves to immediate application of a formula or mathematical process. The teacher can provide distance and velocity graphs that represent a motorist’s behavior through several towns on a map and ask students to construct a mathematical argument either in defense of or against a police officer’s charge of speeding, given a known speed limit.
Create a Plan
Students analyze the tasks in a problem and create a process for completing the tasks by finding the information needed, interpreting data, choosing how to solve a problem, communicating the results, and verifying accuracy.
Assists in breaking tasks into smaller parts and identifying the steps needed to complete the entire task.
When scaffolding for students how to design an experiment, a good first step is assigning small groups to analyze the tasks necessary to design the experiment. Have students identify the steps needed to answer the question by collecting and analyzing data.
Included in this discussion is a plan for what to do with the collected data.

Purpose
Example
Debriefing
Students discuss the understanding of a concept to lead to a consensus on its meaning.
Helps clarify misconceptions and deepen understanding of context.
To discern the difference between average velocity and instantaneous velocity, have students roll a ball down a simple ramp and measure the distance the ball travels over time, every second for 5 seconds.
Plotting position versus time and sketching a curve of best fit, have students discuss how they might determine the average velocity of the ball over the 5 seconds and then the instantaneous velocity of the ball at several points. A discussion in which students address the distinction between the ball’s velocity between two points and its velocity at a single point would help in clarifying the concept and mathematical process.
Desktop
Experiment
Tasks
These tasks involve students performing a demonstration at their desks (either in class or at home), using a predict-and-explain format. After students complete the experiment, have them “reformulate” or reconsider their previous explanations in light of what happened. Desktop experiment tasks are narrow in scope, usually qualitative in nature, and typically use simple equipment.
Students are presented with a small desktop experiment and asked to use the apparatus provided to answer a given question.
Direct measurement videos make excellent “desktop” experiments that students can work with either in class or for homework. Desktop experiment tasks can include small experiments using toy cars or spring scales, for example.
Discussion
Groups
Students work in groups to discuss content, create problem solutions, and explain and justify a solution.
Aids in understanding through the sharing of ideas, interpretation of concepts, and analysis of problem scenarios.
Once students learn all methods of problem solving and can select which is the most appropriate given a particular situation, have them discuss in small groups (no writing) why a specific method should be used over another.

Purpose
Example
Friends Without
Pens
Students are given a free-response question, quiz, or challenging problem. “Friends without pens” takes place in two rounds: the first round is the timed “friends without pens” round, in which students are grouped together and can discuss— but not write about—the question.
At the end of the time, students return to their desks for the “pens without friends” round, where they tackle the assignment in the traditional, independent sense.
This can be a scaffolding tool, if students are being introduced to a new type of assignment or a particularly difficult or challenging
AP-level question.
Students identify and discuss, with their peers, adequate claims, evidence, and reasoning.
They then return to their desks to create the full argument.
Four-Square
Problem Solving
Students are given a situation, perhaps one that came from a traditional, plug-and-chug problem. They then divide a sheet of paper into four quadrants. In each quadrant, the student(s) put some representation of what is going on in the problem. Possible representations include motion maps or graphs, free-body diagrams, energy bar graphs, momentum bar graphs, mathematical models (equation with symbols), well-labeled diagrams, or written responses (2–3 strong, clear sentences).
Re-expressing or re-representing data is a key skill necessary for student success in this course. Multiple opportunities with this task scaffolds the needed practice for students to get into the habit of creating and using representations to make claims and answer questions.
In Unit 3, students can regularly and repeatedly do four-square problem solving with work and energy questions. They can sketch graphs or free-body diagrams, write paragraphs, and solve numerical and/or symbolic problems.
Graph and Switch
Students generate a graph (or sketch of a graph) to model a certain function, and then switch calculators (or papers) to review each other’s solutions.
Allows students to practice creating different representations of functions as well as both giving and receiving feedback on each other’s work.
As students learn about graphs of potential energy, they can graph potential energy versus position and force versus position. Have students individually graph and explain how their graphs support claims and are consistent with each other. They then share their steps with a partner and receive feedback on their graphs, claims, evidence, and reasoning.
Graphic
Organizer
Students arrange information into charts and diagrams.
Builds comprehension and facilitates discussion by representing information in visual form.
In order to organize the position, velocity, and acceleration versus time graphs for an object under the influence of a resistive force, students can create a table to help them keep track of their logic as they think through the different functional relationships that are seen in these graphs.

Purpose
Example
Identify Subtasks
Students break a problem into smaller pieces with outcomes leading to a solution.
Helps organize the pieces of a complex problem and reach a complete solution.
Another scaffolding technique:
when first exposing students to AP-level questions that involve several steps of reasoning and logic, additional questions can be added to help guide students to the final claim, evidence, and reasoning. For example, ask students to sketch a free-body diagram, discuss the system, and/or draw energy bar charts. After the first few units, students should be able to identify (first in groups and then individually) what the subtasks would be (free-body diagram), to start thinking about the claim, evidence, and reasoning.
Marking the Text
Students highlight, underline, and/ or annotate text to focus on key information to help understand the text or solve the problem.
Helps the student identify important information in the text and make notes in the text about the interpretation of tasks required and concepts to apply to reach a solution.
This strategy can be used with AP-level problems as well as problems from the text or sample laboratory procedures.
Students read through the question, experimental design (or another student's experimental design) and underline the pronouns, equipment, key information, (i.e., the car begins at rest) etc.
to identify important information and to be able to ask clarifying questions.
Meaningful,
Meaningless
Calculations
Students are presented with an unreduced expression for a calculation for a physical quantity describing a physical situation. They must decide whether the calculation is meaningful (i.e., it gives a value that tells us something legitimate about the physical situation) or is meaningless (i.e., the expression is a totally inappropriate use of a relation). These calculations should not be trivially meaningless, such as substituting a wrong numerical value into the expression. These items are best when the quantity calculated fits with students’ alternative conceptions.
Students are presented with an unreduced calculation for a physical calculation that involves a mathematical relationship, and students are asked if the calculation makes any sense.
These calculations can take many forms, but the most useful are those where the “meaningless” calculations illustrate common student misconceptions. Students could be asked to write an expression for the energy of a system. Students then have to decide which of the following expressions are meaningful (MgD, Mg/D, MD/g, and 1/MgD).

Model Questions
Students answer items from released AP Physics Exams.
Provides challenging practice and assesses students’ ability to apply multiple physical practices on content as either a multiple choice or a free-response question.
Model questions can be
AP-released questions or AP-level questions. They can be given as written, or scaffolded for students earlier in the year to provide them with support.
Note Taking
Students create a record of information while reading a text or listening to a speaker.
Helps organize ideas and process information.
Have students can write down verbal descriptions of the steps needed to solve a problem so that a record of the processes can be referred to at a later point in time.
Predict and Explain
Predict and explain tasks describe a physical situation that is set up at a point where some event is about to occur. Students predict and explain what they think will happen. These tasks must involve situations with which the students are familiar, or have sufficient background information in, to enable them to understand the task. This is important, because otherwise students usually do not feel comfortable enough to attempt to answer.
Stimulates thinking by asking students to make, check, and correct predictions based on evidence from the outcome.
When an object on the end of a string is set into SHM, ask students what would happen to the period if the mass were increased, the angle were decreased, or the length of the string changed?
Qualitative
Reasoning
These tasks can take a variety of forms, with their common denominator being qualitative analysis. Frequently, students are presented with an initial and final situation and asked how some quantity, or aspect, will change.
Qualitative comparisons (e.g., the quantity increases, decreases, or stays the same) are often the appropriate answer. Qualitative reasoning tasks can frequently contain elements found in some of the other task formats (e.g., different qualitative representations and a prediction or explanation).
Students are presented with a physical situation and asked to apply a principle to qualitatively reason out what will happen.
These questions are commonly found in other multiple-choice question subtypes.
Ask students what would happen to the angular momentum of an object in orbit around the Earth if the radius of orbit were increased, if the speed of orbit were decreased, or if the mass of the Earth or the mass of the object were changed. Additional questions could include, “What happens to the energy of the system as the physical properties above are changed?” continued on next page

Purpose
Example
Quickwrite
Students write for a short, specific amount of time about a designated topic.
Helps generate ideas in a short amount of time.
To help synthesize concepts after having learned how to calculate the derivative, have students list as many real-world situations as possible in which knowing the instantaneous rate of change of a function is advantageous.
Ranking
Ranking tasks present students with a set of variations—sometimes three or four but usually six to eight—on a basic physical situation. The variations differ in value (numeric or symbolic) for the variables involved but also frequently include variables that are not important to the task.
The students’ objective is to rank the variations on the basis of a specified physical quantity. Students must also explain the reasoning for their ranking scheme and rate their confidence in their ranking.
These tasks require students to engage in a comparison reasoning process that they seldom have opportunities to do in traditional problem solving.
Given six different arrows launched from the ground with different speeds at different angles, ask students to rank the arrows on the basis of the highest acceleration at the top, the longest time in the air, and the largest velocity at the top.
Sharing and Responding
Students communicate with another person or a small group of peers who respond to a proposed problem solution.
Gives students the opportunity to discuss their work with peers, make suggestions for improvement to the work of others, and/or receive appropriate and relevant feedback on their own work.
Group students to review individual work (graphs, derivations, problem solutions, experimental designs, etc.). Have the groups make any necessary corrections and build a single complete solution together.
Simplify the
Problem
Students use friendlier numbers or functions to help solve a problem.
Provides insight into the problem or the strategies needed to solve the problem.
Have students use the analogy of one-dimensional motion when initially analyzing rotational kinematics.
Troubleshooting
Troubleshooting tasks are variations on the “What if Anything Is Wrong?” task. Students are explicitly told that there is an error in the given situation.
Their job is to determine what the error is and explain how to correct it. These tasks can often produce interesting insights into students’ thinking because they will, at times, identify some correct aspect of the situation as erroneous. This helps develop additional items.
Allows students to troubleshoot errors and misconceptions by focusing on problems that may arise when they do the same procedures themselves.
Give students a derivation or problem solution and ask them to find the incorrect step(s).
Students must not only identify, but also explain the mistake or misunderstanding that led to the mistake. This can also be done with bar charts, diagrams, and other representations.

Example “What if
Anything Is
Wrong?”
Requires students to analyze a statement or diagrammed situation to determine if it is correct or not.
If everything is correct, the student is asked to explain the statement/ situation and why it works as described. If something is incorrect, the student has to identify the error and explain how to correct it.
These are open-ended exercises, so they provide insight into students’ ideas, since they will often have interesting reasons for accepting incorrect situations and for rejecting legitimate situations. Often, students’ responses provide ideas for other items.
Allows students to troubleshoot errors and focus on problems that may arise when they do the same procedures themselves.
Give students a force diagram that may or may not have incorrect forces drawn on it. Or, give them graphs of force and potential energy that “match” and ask them to determine if the graphs do indeed correspond.
This technique can also be used in derivations and problem solving where students are given the “complete” solution and are asked to verify whether it was done correctly.
Write and Switch
Like graph and switch but with writing. Students make observations, collect data, or make a claim and then switch papers.
Allows students to practice writing as well as both giving and receiving feedback on each other’s work.
As students learn about creating an argument, they can draft an initial argument themselves;
share their claim, evidence, and reasoning with a partner;
and receive feedback on their argument.
Working
Backward
This task reverses the order of the problem steps. For example, the given information could be an equation with specific values for all, or all but one, of the variables.
The students must then construct a physical situation for which the given equation would apply. Such working backward tasks require students to take numerical values, including units, and translate them into physical variables. Working backward problems also require students to reason about these situations in an unusual way, and they often allow for more than one solution.
Provides another way to check possible answers for accuracy.
Students are given an equation 4

m e qu al s 6  m over s, minus 9 m over s squared such as and students are asked to create another representation from this equation. For example, a written scenario that this equation could represent may include position versus time graphs, velocity versus time graphs, motion maps, etc.

Developing the
Science Practices
Throughout the course, students will develop skills that are fundamental to the discipline of physics. Since these
practices represent the complex skills that adept physicists demonstrate, students will benefit from multiple
opportunities to develop them in a scaffolded manner. Through the use of guided questioning, discussion
techniques, and other instructional strategies, teachers can help their students practice applying these skills in
new contexts, providing an important foundation for their college and career readiness.
Science Practice 1: Visual Representations
Analyze and/or use [non-narrative/non-mathematical] representations of physical situations, excluding graphs.
The real world is extremely complex. When physicists describe and explain phenomena, they try to simplify real
objects, systems, and processes to make the analysis manageable. These simplifications, or models, are used to
predict how new phenomena will occur. A simple model may treat a system as an object, neglecting the system’s
internal structure and behavior. More complex models are models of a system of objects, such as an ideal gas.
A process can be simplified, too, and models can be both conceptual and mathematical. To make a good model,
one needs to identify a set of the most important characteristics of a phenomenon or system that may simplify
analysis. Inherent in the construction of models that physicists invent is the use of representations. Examples of
representations used to model introductory physics are pictures, free-body diagrams, force diagrams, graphs,
energy bar charts, and momentum bar charts. Representations help in analyzing phenomena, making predictions,
and communicating ideas. AP Physics C: Mechanics requires students to use and/or analyze and/or re-express
models and representations of natural or man-made systems.
The following table provides examples of questions and instructional strategies for implementing visual

Science Practice 2: Question and Method
Determine scientific questions and methods.
Scientific questions can range in scope, from broad to narrow, as well as in specificity and from determining
influencing factors and/or causes to determining mechanism. The question posed will determine the type of data
to be collected and will influence the plan for collecting data. Designing and improving experimental designs and/
or data collection strategies is a learned skill. Class discussion can reveal issues of measurement uncertainty and
assumptions in the data collection. Students need to understand that the results of collecting and using data to
determine a numerical answer to a question is best thought of as an interval, not a single number. This interval, the
experimental uncertainty, is due to a combination of uncertainty in the instruments used and the process of taking
the measurement. Although detailed error analysis is not necessary to convey this pivotal idea, it is important that
students make some reasoned estimate of the interval within which they know the value of a measured data point
and express their results in a way that makes this clear.
Laboratory experience is also important in helping students understand the topics being considered. Thus, it is
valuable to ask students to write informally about what they have done, observed, and concluded in well-organized
laboratory notebooks. Some questions or parts of questions on the AP Physics C: Mechanics Exam deal with lab related skills, such as the design of experiments, data analysis, and error analysis, and are intended to distinguish
between students who have had laboratory experience and those who have not. In addition, the understanding
gained in the laboratory may improve a student’s test performance overall.
Examples of scientific experiments include guided, inquiry-based, hands-on lab investigations; individual, hands-on
lab investigations; lab demonstrations; or lab-based, hands-on classroom activities.

Science Practice 3: Representing Data and Phenomena
Create visual representations or models of physical situations.
AP Physics C: Mechanics requires several key skills, including drawing and interpreting graphs and representing
data or physical relationships in graphical form. Students need to be able to think about the material in their physics
courses in terms of conceptual, verbal, graphical, and mathematical ideas. As part of these comprehensive skills
for understanding the physical world around them, students must be able to perform graphical analysis in its
many forms. With the use of graphing calculators, students appear to be losing the ability to draw, interpret, and
understand graphs. There appears to be a disconnect between what students learn in their mathematics courses
and how they apply that knowledge in their physics course. For example, even if students have learned graphing
in previous math courses and understand the concept of slope, they may have difficulty understanding that the
slope of a displacement-versus-time graph is the velocity. The AP Physics C: Mechanics course should provide
opportunities to bridge the gap between physics and mathematics for students.

phenomena representation resources into the course:

Science Practice 4: Data Analysis
Analyze quantitative data represented in graphs.
Students often think that to make a graph they need to connect the data points or that the best-fit function is always
linear. Thus, it is important that they can construct a best-fit curve even for data that do not fit a linear relationship.
Students should be able to represent data points as intervals whose size depends on the experimental uncertainty.
After students find a pattern in the data, they need to ask why this pattern is present and try to explain it using
the knowledge that they have. When dealing with a new phenomenon, they should be able to devise a testable
explanation of the pattern if possible. It is important that students understand that instruments do not produce
exact measurements and learn what steps they can take to decrease the uncertainty.
Students should be able to design a second experiment to determine the same quantity and then check for
consistency across the two measurements, comparing two results by writing them both as intervals and not as
single, absolute numbers. Finally, students should be able to revise their reasoning based on the new data, data for
some that may appear anomalous. The analysis, interpretation, and application of quantitative information are vital
skills for students in AP Physics C: Mechanics. Analysis skills can be taught using any type of data, but students will
be more invested in the data analysis if it is data they have collected through their own investigations. Teachers are
encouraged to provide opportunities for students to analyze data, draw conclusions, and apply their knowledge to
the enduring understandings and learning objectives in the course.

Science Practice 5: Theoretical Relationships
Determine the effects on a quantity when another quantity or the physical situation changes.
Physicists commonly use mathematical representations to describe and explain phenomena as well as to solve
problems. When students work with these representations, they should understand the connections between
the mathematical description, the physical phenomena, and the concepts represented in the mathematical
descriptions. When using equations or mathematical representations, students need to be able to justify why
using a particular equation to analyze a particular situation is useful, and to be aware of the conditions under
which the equations/mathematical representations can be used. Students tend to rely too much on mathematical
representations. When solving a problem, they need to be able to describe the problem situation in multiple ways,
including pictorial representations, force diagrams, and so forth, and then choose an appropriate mathematical
representation instead of first choosing a formula whose variables seem to match the givens in the problem.
Students should be able to work with the algebraic form of the equation before substituting values, and should also
be able to evaluate the equation(s) and the answer in terms of units and limiting case analysis. Students should be
able to translate between functional relationships in equations (proportionalities, inverse proportionalities, etc.)
and cause-and-effect relationships in the physical world. Finally, students are expected to be able to evaluate a
numerical result in terms of whether it makes sense. In many physics situations, simple mathematical routines may
be needed to arrive at a result even though they are not the focus of a learning objective.

Science Practice 6: Mathematical Routines
Solve problems of physical situations using mathematical relationships.
Students need to be proficient in problem solving and in the application of fundamental principles to a wide
variety of situations. Problem-solving abilities can be fostered by scaffolded practice and exposure to a range
of challenging problems. In general, the purpose of allowing calculators and equation sheets to be used on both
sections of the AP Physics C: Mechanics Exam is to place greater emphasis on the understanding and application
of fundamental physical principles and concepts. The availability of equations for all students means than in scoring
the exam, little or no credit will be awarded for simply writing down equations. For solving problems, a sophisticated
scientific or graphing calculator is no substitute for a thorough grasp of the physics involved. It should be noted
that although fewer topics are covered in AP Physics C: Mechanics than in AP Physics 1, they are covered in greater
depth and with greater analytical and mathematical sophistication, including calculus applications.

Science Practice 7: Argumentation
Develop an explanation or scientific argument.
A scientific explanation, accounting for an observed phenomenon, needs to be experimentally testable. One should
be able to use it to make predictions about new phenomenon. A theory uses a unified approach to account for a
large set of phenomena and gives accounts that are consistent with multiple experimental outcomes within the
range of applicability of the theory. Examples of theories in physics include the kinetic molecular theory, quantum
theory, and atomic theory. Students should understand the difference between explanations and theories.
Students should be prepared to offer evidence, construct reasoned arguments for their claim from the evidence,
and use the claim or explanation to make predictions. A prediction states the expected outcome of a particular
experimental design based on an explanation or a claim under scrutiny.
Physicists examine data and evidence to develop claims about physical phenomena. As they articulate their claims,
physicists use reasoning processes that rely on their awareness of different types of relationships, connections,
and patterns within the data and evidence. They then formulate a claim and develop an argument that explains how
the claim is supported by the available evidence. AP Physics C: Mechanics teachers should help students learn how
to create persuasive and meaningful arguments by improving their proficiency with each of these skills.
