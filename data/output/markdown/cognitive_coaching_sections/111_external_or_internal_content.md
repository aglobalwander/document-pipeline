## External or Internal Content

External content is what is going on in the environment around, and thus outside, the person. Internal content is what is going on inside the other person's mind and heart: satisfaction, puzzlement, frustration, thinking processes (metacognition), values, intentions, or decisions. Questions that most effectively mediate thinking link internal content with external content.
