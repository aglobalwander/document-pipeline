Introduction
Purpose of this document 1
Chemistry guide

=== Page 8 ===
The Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the
16 to 19 age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be
knowledgeable and inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on
encouraging students to develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes
necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The Diploma Programme model
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core (see figure 1). It encourages the
concurrent study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study two modern languages (or a modern
language and a classical language), a humanities or social science subject, an experimental science,
mathematics and one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the DP a
demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance. In each of the
academic areas students have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can choose subjects
that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.

Introduction
The Diploma Programme 2
Chemistry guide

=== Page 9 ===
Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they can,
instead of an arts subject, choose two subjects from another area. Normally, three subjects (and not
more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB
recommends 240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than at SL.
At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of the
course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some element of coursework assessed by teachers.
The core of the Diploma Programme model
All DP students participate in the three course elements that make up the core of the model.
Theory of knowledge (TOK) is a course that is fundamentally about critical thinking and inquiry into the
process of knowing rather than about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines the
nature of knowledge and how we know what we claim to know. It does this by encouraging students to
analyse knowledge claims and explore questions about the construction of knowledge. The task of TOK is
to emphasize connections between areas of shared knowledge and link them to personal knowledge in
such a way that an individual becomes more aware of their own perspectives and how they might differ from others.
In TOK, students explore the means of producing knowledge within the core theme of “knowledge and the
knower” as well as within various optional themes (knowledge and technology, knowledge and politics,
knowledge and language, knowledge and religion, and knowledge and indigenous societies) and areas of
knowledge (the arts, natural sciences, human sciences, history and mathematics). The course also
encourages students to make comparisons between different areas of knowledge and reflect on how
knowledge is arrived at in the various disciplines, what the disciplines have in common, and the differences between them.
Creativity, activity, service (CAS) is at the heart of the DP. The emphasis in CAS is on helping students to
develop their own identities, in accordance with the ethical principles embodied in the IB mission
statement and the IB learner profile. It involves students in a range of activities alongside their academic
studies throughout the DP. The three strands of CAS are creativity (arts and other experiences that involve
creative thinking), activity (physical exertion contributing to a healthy lifestyle) and service (an unpaid and
voluntary exchange that has a learning benefit for the student). Possibly, more than any other component
in the DP, CAS contributes to the IB’s mission to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect.
The extended essay (EE), including the world studies extended essay, offers the opportunity for IB students
to investigate a topic of special interest, in the form of a 4,000-word piece of independent research. The
area of research undertaken is chosen from one of the students’ six DP subjects, or in the case of the
interdisciplinary world studies essay, two subjects, and acquaints them with the independent research and
writing skills expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally presented, structured writing, in
which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent manner, appropriate to the subject
or subjects chosen. It is intended to promote high-level research and writing skills, intellectual discovery
and creativity. An authentic learning experience, it provides students with an opportunity to engage in
personal research on a topic of choice, under the guidance of a supervisor.
Approaches to teaching and approaches to learning
Approaches to teaching and approaches to learning (ATL) across the DP refers to deliberate strategies, skills
and attitudes that permeate the teaching and learning environment. These approaches and tools,
intrinsically linked with the learner profile attributes, enhance student learning and assist student
The Diploma Programme 3
Chemistry guide

preparation for the DP assessment and beyond. The aims of approaches to teaching and learning in the DP
are to:
•
empower teachers as teachers of learners as well as teachers of content •
empower teachers to create clearer strategies for facilitating learning experiences in which students
are more meaningfully engaged in structured inquiry and greater critical and creative thinking •
promote both the aims of individual subjects (making them more than course aspirations) and linking
previously isolated knowledge (concurrency of learning) •
encourage students to develop an explicit variety of skills that will equip them to continue to be
actively engaged in learning after they leave school, and to help them not only obtain university
admission through better grades but also prepare for success during tertiary education and beyond •
enhance further the coherence and relevance of the students’ DP experience •
allow schools to identify the distinctive nature of an IB DP education, with its blend of idealism and practicality.
The five ATL (developing thinking skills, social skills, communication skills, self-management skills and
research skills) along with the six approaches to teaching (teaching that is inquiry-based, conceptually
focused, contextualized, collaborative, differentiated and informed by assessment) encompass the key values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy.
The IB mission statement and the IB learner profile
The DP aims to develop in students the knowledge, skills and attitudes they will need to fulfil the aims of
the IB, as expressed in the organization’s mission statement and the learner profile. Teaching and learning
in the DP represent the reality in daily practice of the organization’s educational philosophy.
Academic integrity
Academic integrity in the DP is a set of values and behaviours informed by the attributes of the learner
profile. In teaching, learning and assessment, academic integrity serves to promote personal integrity,
engender respect for the integrity of others and their work, and ensure that all students have an equal
opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquire during their studies.
All coursework—including work submitted for assessment—is to be authentic, based on the student’s
individual and original ideas with the ideas and work of others fully acknowledged. Assessment tasks that
require teachers to provide guidance to students or that require students to work collaboratively must be
completed in full compliance with the detailed guidelines provided by the IB for the relevant subjects.
For further information on academic integrity in the IB and the DP, please consult the IB publications
Academic integrity policy, Effective citing and referencing, Diploma Programme: From principles into practice
and the general regulations in Diploma Programme Assessment procedures (updated annually). Specific
information regarding academic integrity as it pertains to external and internal assessment components of this DP subject can be found in this guide.
Acknowledging the ideas or work of another person
Coordinators and teachers are reminded that candidates must acknowledge all sources used in work
submitted for assessment. The following is intended as a clarification of this requirement.
DP candidates submit work for assessment in a variety of media that may include audiovisual material, text,
graphs, images and/or data published in print or electronic sources. If a candidate uses the work or ideas of
another person, the candidate must acknowledge the source using a standard style of referencing in a
consistent manner. A candidate’s failure to acknowledge a source will be investigated by the IB as a
potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.
The Diploma Programme 4
Chemistry guide

=== Page 11 ===
The IB does not prescribe which style(s) of referencing or in-text citation should be used by candidates; this
is left to the discretion of appropriate faculty/staff in the candidate’s school. The wide range of subjects,
response languages and the diversity of referencing styles make it impractical and restrictive to insist on
particular styles. In practice, certain styles may prove most commonly used, but schools are free to choose a
style that is appropriate for the subject concerned and the language in which candidates’ work is written.
Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a given subject, it is expected that the minimum
information given includes: name of author, date of publication, title of source, and page numbers as applicable.
Candidates are expected to use a standard style and use it consistently so that credit is given to all sources
used, including sources that have been paraphrased or summarized. When writing text candidates must
clearly distinguish between their words and those of others by the use of quotation marks (or other
method, such as indentation) followed by an appropriate citation that denotes an entry in the bibliography.
If an electronic source is cited, the date of access must be indicated. Candidates are not expected to show
faultless expertise in referencing, but are expected to demonstrate that all sources have been
acknowledged. Candidates must be advised that audiovisual material, text, graphs, images and/or data
published in print or in electronic sources that is not their own must also attribute the source. Again, an
appropriate style of referencing/citation must be used.
Learning diversity and learning support requirements
Schools must ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided to
candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Access and inclusion
policy and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes: Removing barriers to learning.
The publications Meeting student learning diversity in the classroom and The IB guide to inclusive education: a
resource for whole school development are available to support schools in the ongoing process of increasing
access and engagement by removing barriers to learning.
Programme standards and practices
The programme standards and practices are a set of principles for schools to ensure quality and fidelity in
the implementation of IB programmes. Teaching and learning are important markers of quality and
effective practice in schools; thus the expectations teachers and learners share across all IB programmes can
be found in the programme standards and practices.
The programme standards and practices provide a framework to help teachers understand their rights and
responsibilities in IB World Schools as they develop learning environments and experiences for their
students. The IB recognizes that in order for effective teaching to take place, teachers must be supported in
their understanding, well-being, environment and resources. Teachers use the core tenets of IB philosophy
and pedagogy (approaches to teaching, ATL, the learner profile and international-mindedness) to design
learning experiences that prepare learners to fulfil the aims and objectives outlined in this guide.
To learn more about teachers’ rights and responsibilities, please see the IB publication Programme
standards and practices on the Programme Resource Centre.

What is nature of science?
Nature of science (NOS) is an overarching theme in the biology, chemistry and physics courses that seeks to
explore conceptual understandings related to the purpose, features and impact of scientific knowledge.
What do we want to know in science?
Nobel laureate and influential popularizer of science, Richard Feynman, once described the process of
science using the analogy of watching an unknown board game being played “... and you don’t know the
rules of the game, but you’re allowed to look at the board from time to time. And from these observations,
you try to figure out what the rules are of the game, [and] the rules of the pieces moving” (Feynman et al., 1963).
What is the scientific endeavour?
Classifying such observations and underlying patterns in the natural world is the essence of what scientists
do, underpinned by the assumption that the universe exists as an external reality accessible to the human
experience. The varied and often non-linear processes used in scientific methodologies have several key
features in common to maximize the validity and reliability of knowledge produced. The development of
falsifiable hypotheses, a requirement for replicable data, and the utilization of peer-review may be among
the most essential of these and help differentiate a scientific process from a pseudoscientific one. The
communal and collaborative nature of this approach further strengthens the objectivity of science by
ensuring the inclusion of diverse perspectives and shared responsibility for its outcomes.
What type of knowledge do we produce?
Formal scientific knowledge may encompass several categories including representative models,
explanatory theories and descriptive laws. As the focus of each discipline of natural science differs, so too
does the balance of their contributions to each category. What remains constant, however, is the
acknowledgement of assumptions, exceptions and limitations of scientific knowledge to provide realistic
parameters to our understanding of the natural world. Claims of certainty are treated with caution given
the presence of paradigmatic shifts throughout the history of science.
What is the impact of scientific knowledge?
As well as the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, it is useful to consider the interplay of science with
other areas of society. Although advances in technology traditionally fuelled great leaps in scientific
understanding, in recent times it may be more common to see science as a driver of technological
development. In addition, the implications of science within environmental, political, social, cultural and
economic domains can also be profound. These connections illustrate the importance of local, national and
international scientific bodies that engage with the public understanding of science and heighten the
responsibility of scientists to adhere to principles of academic integrity in their research.

Nature of science 6
Chemistry guide

=== Page 13 ===
Table 1
Aspects of nature of science
Aspects
How are scientific knowledge claims generated, tested, communicated,
evaluated and used? What issues arise from these actions?
Observations
Scientists act as observers, looking at Earth and all other parts of the universe, to
obtain data about natural phenomena. Observations can be made directly using
human senses, or with the aid of instruments such as electronic sensors.
Unexpected or unplanned observations can open up new research fields.
Patterns and trends
Scientists analyse their observations, looking for patterns or trends, and try to draw
general conclusions by inductive reasoning. They also look for discrepancies.
Scientists classify objects through pattern recognition. A trend may take the form
of a positive or negative correlation between variables. Correlations may be based
on a causal relationship, but correlation does not prove causation.
Hypotheses
Scientists make provisional explanations for the patterns that they have observed
in natural phenomena. These hypotheses can be tested, with further observations
or experiments, to obtain support for a hypothesis or show that it is false.
Experiments
Scientists design and perform experiments to obtain data, which can be used to
test hypotheses. The quality of experimental evidence depends on careful control
of variables and on the quantity of data generated. Progress in science often
follows technological developments that allow new experimental techniques.
Creativity and imagination play a role in experimental design, interpretation and conclusion.
Measurement
Quantitative measurements are more objective than qualitative observations, but
all measurements are limited in precision and accuracy. Measurements are
repeated to strengthen the reliability of data. Random errors in measurement due
to unknown or unpredictable differences lead to imprecision and uncertainty, whereas systematic errors lead to inaccuracy.
Models
Scientists construct models as artificial representations of natural phenomena.
They are useful when direct observation or experimentation is difficult. Models are
simplifications of complex systems and can be physical representations, abstract
diagrams, mathematical equations or algorithms. All models have limitations that need to be considered in their application.
Evidence
Scientists adopt a sceptical attitude to claims and evaluate them using evidence.
Some claims cannot be tested using verifiable evidence, so cannot be falsified.
They are therefore not scientific. Scientific knowledge must be supported by evidence.
Theories
Scientists develop general explanations that are widely applicable, based on
observed patterns or tested hypotheses. Predictions can be generated from these
theories by deductive reasoning. If these predictions are tested, they may
corroborate a theory or show that it is false and should be rejected. Paradigm shifts
take place when a new theory replaces an old one. The term “law” is sometimes
used for statements that allow predictions to be made about natural phenomena without explaining them.
Falsification
Scientists can use evidence to falsify a claim formulated as a hypothesis, theory or
model, but they cannot prove with certainty that such a claim is true. There is
therefore inherent uncertainty in all scientific knowledge. Nonetheless, many
theories in science are corroborated by strong evidence and allow for prediction
and explanation. Scientists must remain open-minded with respect to new evidence.
Nature of science 7
Chemistry guide

=== Page 14 ===
Aspects
How are scientific knowledge claims generated, tested, communicated,
evaluated and used? What issues arise from these actions?
Science as a shared endeavour
Scientists communicate and collaborate throughout the world. Agreed
conventions and common terminology facilitate unambiguous communication.
Peer review is essential to verify the research methods of knowledge claims prior to their publication in journals.
Global impact of science
Scientists have an obligation to assess the risks associated with their work and
must aim to do no harm. Developments in science may have ethical,
environmental, political, social, cultural and economic consequences that must be
considered during decision-making. The pursuit of science may have unintended
consequences. Research proposals are often filtered through ethics boards.
Scientists have a responsibility to communicate their findings to the public with honesty and clarity.
How is NOS different from TOK?
In contrast to the specificity of understanding of science, the TOK course encourages students to think
critically about the concepts that underpin knowledge production. For example, peer review is used as a
tool to support objectivity in scientific research. Through the study of TOK, students question the
limitations of the peer review process and extend their thinking to an assessment of objectivity in other areas of knowledge.
Nature of science 8
Chemistry guide

=== Page 15 ===
What is the purpose of studying chemistry?
As one of the three natural sciences in the IB Diploma Programme, chemistry is primarily concerned with
identifying patterns that allow us to explain matter at the microscopic level. This then allows us to predict
and control matter’s behaviour at a macroscopic level. The subject therefore emphasizes the development
of representative models and explanatory theories, both of which rely heavily on creative but rational
thinking. Given the pattern-seeking nature of chemistry, the development of generalized rules and
principles also plays an important part in knowledge production, as do the concrete statements provided by mathematical laws.
How is knowledge acquired in chemistry?
With its roots in the practice of alchemy, chemistry maintains a strong emphasis on empirical
experimentation. However, with advances in technology, it now extends its reach beyond the limits of the
human senses at a macroscopic level and into fields such as spectroscopy and computer molecular
modelling. Insights from these technologies often require thorough mathematical analysis before being
accepted as valid justifications for scientific claims. In all their investigative work, chemists must qualify
confidence in their discoveries by considering potential errors related to methodology or limitations in measuring equipment.
What is the impact of chemistry?
As outlined in the “Nature of science” section, the pursuit of scientific knowledge does not occur in
isolation. In chemistry, developments in fields such as biofuels or catalysis often have impacts far beyond
the boundaries of academic research. Honest and clear communication to audiences beyond the scientific
domain is therefore essential. The retraction of a 2019 research paper by Dr Frances Arnold, a Nobel
laureate in chemistry, due to unreproducible data is a good example of embracing this ethical responsibility.
How is the nature of chemistry engaged with?
The Diploma Programme chemistry course supports teaching through:
• approaches to learning • nature of science • skills in the study of chemistry.
The Diploma Programme chemistry course supports learning in several ways.
•
It offers a balanced experimental programme—Students are encouraged to become familiar with
traditional experimentation techniques, as well as the application of technology where possible. These
opportunities help them to develop their investigative skills and evaluate the impact of error in scientific inquiry.
•
The scientific investigation—This places a specific emphasis on inquiry-based skills and the formal communication of scientific knowledge.
•
The collaborative sciences project—This extends the development of scientific communication in a
collaborative and interdisciplinary context, allowing students to work together beyond the confines of one specific syllabus.
Introduction
Nature of chemistry 9
Chemistry guide

=== Page 16 ===
Distinction between SL and HL
Students at SL and HL share the following.
•
An understanding of science through a stimulating experimental programme •
The nature of science as an overarching theme •
The study of a concept-based syllabus •
One piece of internally assessed work, the scientific investigation •
The collaborative sciences project
The SL course provides students with a fundamental understanding of chemistry and experience of the
associated skills. The HL course requires students to increase their knowledge and understanding of the
subject, including additional mathematical skills, and so provides a solid foundation for further study at university level.
The SL course has a recommended 150 teaching hours, compared to 240 hours for the HL course. This
difference is reflected in the additional content studied by HL students. Some of the HL content is
conceptually more demanding and explored in greater depth. The distinction between SL and HL is
therefore one of both breadth and depth. The increased breadth and depth at HL result in increased
networked knowledge, requiring the student to make more connections between diverse areas of the syllabus.
Chemistry and the core
Chemistry and theory of knowledge
The TOK course plays a special role in the DP by providing opportunities for students to reflect on the
nature, scope and limitations of knowledge and the process of knowing through an exploration of knowledge questions.
The areas of knowledge (AOK) are specific branches of knowledge, each of which can be seen to have a
distinct nature and sometimes use different methods of gaining knowledge. In TOK, students explore five
compulsory AOK: history, the human sciences, the natural sciences, mathematics and the arts.
There are several different ways in which aspects of the chemistry course can be connected to the
exploration of knowledge. During the teaching and learning of the chemistry course, teachers and students
evaluate knowledge claims by exploring questions concerning their validity, reliability, credibility and
certainty, as well as individual and cultural perspectives on them.
Exploration of the relationship between knowledge and TOK concepts can help students to deepen their
understanding and make connections between disciplines. For example, while discussing the depletion of
energy sources and the constant need for new energy resources to meet energy demands, students can
explore the concepts of responsibility, power and justification.
Many aspects of the chemistry course lend themselves to the exploration of knowledge questions. Some examples are provided in the following table.

For more information, please refer to the Theory of knowledge guide and the Theory of knowledge teacher support material.
Chemistry and the extended essay
Students who choose to write an EE in chemistry undertake independent research as part of an in-depth
study of a focused topic. The topic for study may be generated from the chemistry course or may relate to a
subject area beyond the syllabus content. This detailed study will help develop research, thinking, self management and communication skills, which will support students’ learning in the chemistry course, and in further studies.
Examples of areas for research topics •
Environmental chemistry—removing heavy metals or pesticides from the soil or water sources;
measuring the amount of and effects of acid deposition.
•
Food chemistry—investigating the stability of certain pigments or vitamins and the shelf life of certain molecules in food.
•
Materials chemistry—assessing the durability or other chemical/physical properties of compounds, mixtures or metals.
Students and supervisors must ensure that an EE does not duplicate other work submitted for the diploma.
For more information, please refer to the Extended essay guide and the Extended essay teacher support material.
Chemistry and creativity, activity, service
The CAS component of the DP core provides many opportunities for students to link science concepts and
topics to practical experiences. Teachers can highlight how knowledge and understanding developed
through the course might inform meaningful experiences. Outside the classroom, CAS experiences might
also ignite students’ passion for addressing topics inside the chemistry classroom.
Some examples of relevant CAS experiences are as follows.
•
Organizing a science club for students in lower years •
Implementing environmental initiatives within the school or local community, such as recycling, composting and roof gardens •
Organizing or participating in a social media outreach or advocacy campaign, for example, on an environmental or health concern
CAS experiences can be a single event or may be an extended series of events. It is important that CAS
experiences be distinct from and not submitted as part of a chemistry assessment.
For more information, please refer to the Creativity, activity, service guide and the Creativity, activity, service teacher support material.
Chemistry and international-mindedness
Science has been, and continues to be, a truly international endeavour. From the beginnings of seismology
in China, through material science in Mesopotamia to astronomy in the Islamic Golden Age, the search for
an objective understanding of the natural world transcends the limitations imposed by national
boundaries. The scientific process, requiring curiosity, insight and an open-minded approach, benefits from
the widest possible participation across genders and cultures through inclusivity and diversity.
Nature of chemistry 11
Chemistry guide

=== Page 18 ===
Given the global nature of many scientific issues, international organizations often have a focus on the
engagement of science with the public domain. The World Health Organization and the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change are two well-known examples that model a responsibility to inform nations of
scientific progress on an equitable basis. Underlying this responsibility is the interest of promoting a peaceful and sustainable future.
Advancements in technology, along with the cost of modern research facilities, continues to reinforce the
role of international collaborative work. The project between the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research in
Russia and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the USA to provide evidence for the existence of
element 118, oganesson, is a good example of international collaboration.
The importance of collaboration in contemporary science is reflected by the large number of international
organizations tasked with collating and sharing data with the scientific community. Access to shared
knowledge through websites and databases must be integrated into classroom teaching as it plays an important role in validating experimental work.
In addition to integrating technology and collaborative work, the collaborative sciences project provides an
excellent opportunity for students to engage with global issues.
Teachers are encouraged to consider the questions posed in the “Teaching in context” section in the TSM,
to allow students to reflect on where and how science might interact with society. These conversations may
also introduce ethical questions such as those identified in the TOK syllabus.
Chemistry and the IB learner profile
Each box provides an example of how each learner profile attribute could be modelled by learners and teachers.

The approaches to learning framework
What are approaches to learning skills and why do we teach them?
The approaches to learning (ATL) framework seeks to develop in students affective, cognitive and
metacognitive skills that will support their learning processes during and beyond their IB experience. The
development of ATL skills is closely connected with the IB learner profile attributes and therefore helps to
advance the IB mission. The ATL skills are an integral part of IB learning and teaching that should be
developed across the whole programme—it is not expected that a single course should ever address all of them.
How are they organized?
The ATL framework for IB programmes consists of five general skill categories: thinking skills,
communication skills, social skills, research skills and self-management skills. Each of these categories
covers a broad range, as shown by the examples presented in the table below. The ATL skill categories are
closely linked and interrelated and therefore individual skills may be relevant to more than one category.
How do we teach them?
ATL skills can be learned and taught, improved with practice and developed incrementally. The table below
illustrates, through a number of examples, how the chemistry course can support ATL skill development.
The examples shown in the table are not exhaustive. Teachers are encouraged to adapt them for use in
their school context and collaboratively identify further examples of ATL skill development.
Further information on the ATL framework and strategies for the development of the ATL skills can be
found in the Chemistry teacher support material and the Diploma Programme Approaches to teaching and learning website.

Experimental programme
Integral to the student experience of a chemistry course is the learning that takes place through scientific
inquiry within the classroom or laboratory. Experimentation through a variety of forms can be used to
introduce a topic, address a phenomenon or allow students to consider and examine authentic questions and curiosities.
A school’s experimental programme should allow students to experience the full breadth and depth of the
course, develop scientific skills and demonstrate safe, competent and methodical use of a range of tools,
techniques and equipment. Students should therefore be encouraged to develop investigations to support
their learning through open-ended inquiry with a focus on laboratory experiments, databases, simulations and modelling.
Approaches to the teaching and learning of chemistry 16
Chemistry guide

=== Page 23 ===
Conceptual learning
Concept-based teaching and learning is encouraged across the continuum of IB programmes.
Concepts are mental representations of categories. They are constructed, modified and activated by the
learner through learning experiences. Concepts do not exist in isolation but are interrelated. Conceptual
understanding is always a work in progress—it is continually being developed and refined.
Conceptual understanding is therefore an outcome of a non-linear, ongoing process of evolving
understandings, adapting previous understandings, and identifying and dispelling misconceptions. It
consists of making connections between prior and new knowledge to construct and build an awareness of this network of knowledge.
Concepts vary in their level of abstraction and universality.
•
They can be organizing ideas that are applicable in many contexts and have relevance both within and across subject areas.
•
They can provide a deep understanding of specific knowledge fields (or fields of knowledge) and help
to organize knowledge further, as well as reveal connections between different areas of the subject.
For example, consider the following sequence of three concepts, which shows the more specific focus of each concept.
Change >
Reactivity >
Collision theory
In other words, collision theory is a component in understanding chemical reactivity, which in turn helps to
develop an understanding of change in chemistry. The sequence could be extended further to look at
concepts such as particle, collision and reaction, all of which provide a basis for understanding collision theory.
Outcomes of a concept-based approach
Fostering critical thinking, the outcome of a concept-based approach is that students are able to:
• identify examples of a concept •
organize, reflect on, modify and expand their network of knowledge • apply concepts to existing and future knowledge •
apply their conceptual understanding as a scientific thinking tool for predicting outcomes, justifying conclusions and evaluating knowledge claims.
Structure of the syllabus and conceptual understanding
The structure of this chemistry syllabus is intended to promote concept-based teaching and learning.
There are two organizing concepts in the chemistry roadmap: structure and reactivity. Each of these
concepts is subdivided into topics and subtopics, which are all connected through the idea that structure
determines reactivity, which in turn transforms structure.
Each of the 22 subtopics is headed by a guiding question to give a sense of what is covered. The purpose of
these guiding questions is to promote inquiry—they are therefore not straightforward and best answered
once the associated understandings have been acquired. Teachers and students are encouraged to create
their own guiding questions to capture the content of units of study.
Several linking questions are associated with understandings throughout this guide. Linking questions are
intended to promote the skills in the study of chemistry and highlight links between the course
understandings, encouraging students to look at an understanding from a different perspective, originating
in a different part of the course. They are designed to facilitate these connections and their ideal outcome is
to promote a highly networked understanding of chemistry.
For example, the trend in reactivity down group 1 is connected to several parts of the course—it illustrates
the organization of elements in the periodic table, can be explained in terms of ionization energies, is
related to the electron configuration and exemplifies the tendency of metals to be oxidized. The linking
Approaches to the teaching and learning of chemistry 17
Chemistry guide

=== Page 24 ===
questions found in the guide are not exhaustive. Students and teachers may encounter other connections
between understandings and concepts in the syllabus, leading them to create their own linking questions.
Teaching chemistry in context
The study of chemistry enables constructive engagement with topical scientific issues. By contextualizing
chemical concepts, scientific knowledge claims can be evaluated more effectively, and informed choices on
such issues as human health and the environment can be made. Chemical research has brought innovation
and benefit to many fields and continues to be at the heart of seeking effective solutions to many global
challenges. It is therefore important to explore applications of chemistry in our world while teaching the
course to elicit interest, understanding and curiosity.
Teaching the content of the course in relation to specific contexts supports the pedagogical principle of
teaching in local and global contexts as part of the approaches to teaching framework and offers a number
of advantages. First, it helps students relate their learning to genuine applications of chemistry,
highlighting the relevance to global issues as well as the significance in students’ own contexts. Second, it
develops an appreciation for the interaction between scientific solutions and their implications, be it
ethical, environmental or economic. Third, it helps to illustrate some of the NOS aspects underpinning the course.
The Chemistry teacher support material highlights possible areas that could be visited throughout the course
and that may provide context for some topics to stimulate the application of ideas and problem-solving
skills. Consideration of these and related areas may help provide ideas for the scientific investigation, the
collaborative sciences project, TOK exhibition, CAS, or an EE in chemistry or world studies.
Engaging with sensitive topics
Students and teachers are encouraged to engage with exciting, stimulating and personally relevant topics
and issues that may be, at times, sensitive or personally challenging. Teachers should be aware of this and
provide guidance on how to engage with such topics in a responsible manner. Consideration should be
given to the personal, political and spiritual values of others.
Prior learning
Past experience shows that students will be able to study chemistry at SL successfully with no background
in, or previous knowledge of, science. Their approach to learning, characterized by the IB learner profile attributes, will be significant here.
However, for most students considering the study of chemistry at HL, while there is no intention to restrict
access, some previous exposure to formal science education would be necessary. Specific topic details are
not specified, but students who have undertaken the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) or studied an
equivalent national science qualification or a school-based science course would be well prepared for an HL subject.
Links to the Middle Years Programme
The MYP sciences courses seek to promote skills and attitudes needed to apply scientific knowledge in
theoretical, experimental and authentic contexts. A strong foundation is established for DP sciences in
which learners will capitalize on—and continue advancing—their skills and attitudes to develop
knowledge and understanding commensurate with pre-university level science.
The MYP offers a framework for learning and teaching while maintaining flexibility with curriculum content.
The content in MYP sciences courses can therefore vary greatly from one school to another. Content in DP
sciences courses is more prescribed, and this is one of the main differences teachers will notice when comparing the two programmes.
Approaches to the teaching and learning of chemistry 18
Chemistry guide

=== Page 25 ===
A connected, conceptual curriculum where learning is inquiry-based and contextualized is the pedagogical
principle that underpins both programmes and indeed the entire IB continuum (International
Baccalaureate, 2019).
Conceptual learning focuses on organizing ideas and their interconnections. A conceptual approach is
encouraged in IB programmes because it promotes deep learning and facilitates the construction of further
knowledge. Conceptual understanding aids the application of knowledge in unfamiliar and novel contexts.
This skill is reflected in the aims and assessment objectives of both programmes.
Broad concepts frame MYP learning and teaching with the purpose of unifying ideas across subject areas.
Discipline-specific related concepts are intended to provide disciplinary depth (International Baccalaureate,
2014). Key and related concepts are not required in the DP, although some teachers may find that they wish
to continue developing a curriculum around them. In DP sciences, overarching concepts are manifested in
the course roadmaps and the NOS. DP sciences seek to highlight the interconnectedness of the course
understandings. The intention is to promote conceptual understanding and further the construction of learners’ knowledge networks.
Both MYP and DP teaching involve inquiry-based approaches, which foster a high degree of student
engagement, collaboration and interaction. The inquiry, design, experimental, analysis, evaluation and
communication skills encouraged by criteria B and C will serve students well as they prepare to undertake
the scientific investigation for the internal assessment (IA). In addition, MYP students will gain familiarity
with criterion-related assessment and the use of assessment criteria, which will further support their understanding of the DP sciences IA criteria.
IB programmes encourage the exploration of scientific principles in connection to local and global contexts.
Doing so helps students ground abstract concepts in more concrete local and global real-world situations
as well as cultivating international-mindedness (see the “Approaches to teaching” section in Diploma
Programme Approaches to teaching and learning website). Teachers should therefore weave opportunities for
contextualization into the curriculum. MYP sciences criterion D analyses the real-world application of
science. In the DP, sciences teachers are encouraged to frequently anchor their teaching in real-world
applications that are invoked throughout the course of the programme.
In addition to equipping students with scientific knowledge and skills, the MYP and DP sciences courses
share similar guiding principles that seek to develop in students the learner profile attributes.
Links to the Career-related Programme
In the Career-related Programme (CP), students study at least two DP subjects, a core consisting of four
components and a career-related study, which is determined by the local context and aligned with student
needs. The CP has been designed to add value to the students’ career-related studies. This provides the
context for the choice of DP courses. The chemistry course can assist CP students planning careers in a
variety of professional fields where, for example, a sound understanding of science and mathematical skills
are important. This includes healthcare, technological and manufacturing industries, and engineering.
While chemistry helps students understand the underlying science in the contemporary world, it also
encourages the development of strong problem-solving, critical thinking and ethical approaches that will assist students in the global workplace.
Approaches to the teaching and learning of chemistry 19
Chemistry guide

=== Page 26 ===
The collaborative sciences project is an interdisciplinary sciences project, providing a worthwhile challenge
to DP and CP students, addressing real-world problems that can be explored through the sciences. The
nature of the challenge should allow students to integrate factual, procedural and conceptual knowledge developed through the study of their disciplines.
Through the identification and research of complex issues, students can develop an understanding of how
interrelated systems, mechanisms and processes impact a problem. Students will then apply their collective
understanding to develop solution-focused strategies that address the issue. With a critical lens they will
evaluate and reflect on the inherent complexity of solving real-world problems.
Students will develop an understanding of the extent of global interconnectedness between regional,
national, and local communities, which will empower them to become active and engaged citizens of the
world. While addressing local and global issues, students will appreciate that the issues of today exist across
national boundaries and can only be solved through collective action and international cooperation.
The collaborative sciences project supports the development of students’ ATL skills, including
teambuilding, negotiation and leadership. It facilitates an appreciation of the environment, and the social
and ethical implications of science and technology.
Full details of the requirements are in the Collaborative sciences project guide.

General
Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most important aims of assessment in the
Diploma Programme (DP) are that it should support curricular goals and encourage appropriate student
learning. Both external and internal assessments are used in the DP. IB examiners mark work produced for
external assessment, while work produced for internal assessment is marked by teachers and externally moderated by the IB.
There are two types of assessment identified by the IB.
•
Formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is concerned with providing accurate and
helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of learning taking place and the nature of
students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop students’ understanding and capabilities.
Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide information to
monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives (0404-01).
•
Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring
student achievement at, or towards the end, of the course of study (0404-04).
A comprehensive assessment policy is viewed as being integral with teaching, learning and course
organization. For further information, see the IB Programme standards and practices publication.
The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not norm-referenced. This approach to
assessment judges students’ work by their performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, and
not in relation to the work of other students. For further information on assessment within the DP, please
refer to the publication Assessment principles and practices—Quality assessments in a digital age.
To support teachers in the planning, delivery and assessment of the DP courses, a variety of resources can
be found on the Programme Resource Centre or purchased from the IB store (store.ibo.org). Additional
publications such as specimen papers and markschemes, teacher support material (TSM), subject reports
and grade descriptors can also be found on the Programme Resource Centre. Past examination papers as
well as markschemes can be purchased from the IB store.
Methods of assessment
The IB uses several methods to assess work produced by students.
Assessment criteria
Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended. Each criterion concentrates on a
particular skill that students are expected to demonstrate. An assessment objective describes what
students should be able to do, and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do it. Using
assessment criteria allows discrimination between different answers and encourages a variety of responses.
Each criterion comprises a set of hierarchically ordered level descriptors. Each level descriptor is worth one
or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The maximum marks for each
criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are added
together to give the total mark for the piece of work.
Markbands
Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance against which responses are judged.
They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds to Assessment
Assessment in the Diploma Programme 65
Chemistry guide

=== Page 72 ===
a range of marks to differentiate student performance. A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which
particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.
Analytic markschemes
Analytic markschemes are prepared for those examination questions that expect a particular kind of
response and/or a given final answer from students. They give detailed instructions to examiners on how to
break down the total mark for each question for different parts of the response.
Marking notes
For some assessment components marked using assessment criteria, marking notes are provided. Marking
notes give guidance on how to apply assessment criteria to the particular requirements of a question.
Inclusive access arrangements
Inclusive access arrangements are available for candidates with access requirements. Standard assessment
conditions may put candidates with assessment access requirements at a disadvantage by preventing them
from demonstrating their attainment level. Inclusive access arrangements enable candidates to
demonstrate their ability under assessment conditions that are as fair as possible.
The IB document Access and inclusion policy provides details on all the inclusive access arrangements
available to candidates. The IB document Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes: Removing
barriers to learning outlines the position of the IB with regard to candidates with diverse learning needs in
the IB programmes. For candidates affected by adverse circumstances, the publication Diploma Programme
Assessment procedures (updated annually), which includes the general regulations, provides details on access consideration.
Responsibilities of the school
The school is required to ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided
to candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Access and
inclusion policy and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes: Removing barriers to learning.

Purpose of internal assessment
Internal assessment is an integral part of the course and is compulsory for both SL and HL students. It
enables students to demonstrate the application of their skills and knowledge, and to pursue their personal
interests, without the time limitations and other constraints that are associated with written examinations.
The internal assessment should, as far as possible, be woven into normal classroom teaching and not be a
separate activity conducted after a course has been taught.
The internal assessment requirements at SL and at HL are the same.
Guidance and authenticity
The scientific investigation (SL and HL) submitted for internal assessment must be the student’s own work.
However, it is not the intention that students should decide upon a title or topic and be left to work on the
internal assessment component without any further support from the teacher. The teacher should play an
important role during both the planning stage and the period when the student is working on the
internally assessed work. It is the responsibility of the teacher to ensure that students are familiar with:
•
the requirements of the type of work to be internally assessed •
the Sciences experimentation guidelines publication •
the assessment criteria. Students must understand that the work submitted for assessment must address these criteria effectively.
Teachers and students must discuss the internally assessed work. Students should be encouraged to initiate
discussions with the teacher to obtain advice and information, and students must not be penalized for
seeking guidance. As part of the learning process, teachers should read and give advice to students on one
draft of the work. The teacher should provide oral or written advice on how the work could be improved,
but not edit the draft. The next version handed to the teacher must be the final version for submission.
It is the responsibility of teachers to ensure that all students understand the basic meaning and significance
of concepts that relate to academic integrity, especially authenticity and intellectual property. Teachers
must ensure that all student work for assessment is prepared according to the requirements and must
explain clearly to students that the internally assessed work must be entirely their own. Where
collaboration between students is permitted, it must be clear to all students what the difference is between collaboration and collusion.
All work submitted to the IB for moderation or assessment must be authenticated by a teacher, and must
not include any known instances of suspected or confirmed malpractice. Each student must confirm that
the work is their authentic work and constitutes the final version of that work. Once a student has officially
submitted the final version of the work, it cannot be retracted. The requirement to confirm the authenticity
of work applies to the work of all students, not just the sample work that will be submitted to the IB for the
purpose of moderation. For further details, refer to the IB publications Academic integrity policy, Diploma
Programme: From principles into practice and the relevant general regulations (in Diploma Programme
Assessment procedures).
Authenticity may be checked by discussion with the student on the content of the work, and by scrutiny of one or more of the following.
•
The student’s initial proposal •
The first draft of the written work •
The references cited
Assessment
Internal assessment 71
Chemistry guide

=== Page 78 ===
•
The style of writing compared with work known to be that of the student •
The analysis of the work by a web-based plagiarism detection service such as www.turnitin.com
The same piece of work cannot be submitted to meet the requirements of both the IA and the EE.
Time allocation
Internal assessment is an integral part of the chemistry course, contributing 20% to the final assessment in
the SL and the HL courses. This weighting should be reflected in the time that is allocated to teaching the
knowledge, skills and understanding required to undertake the work, as well as the total time allocated to carry out the work.
It is recommended that a total of approximately 10 hours (SL and HL) of teaching time should be allocated to the work. This should include:
•
time for the teacher to explain to students the requirements of the internal assessment •
class time for students to work on the internal assessment component and ask questions •
time for consultation between the teacher and each student •
time to review and monitor progress, and to check authenticity.
Safety requirements and recommendations
It is the responsibility of everyone involved in science education to make an ongoing commitment to safe and healthy practical work.
The working practices and protocols should be effective in safeguarding students and protecting the
environment. Schools are responsible for following national or local guidelines, which differ from country to
country. The Chemistry teacher support material provides some further guidance.
Using assessment criteria for internal assessment
For internal assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion
has level descriptors describing specific achievement levels, together with an appropriate range of marks.
The level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure to achieve may be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL against the criteria using the level descriptors.
•
The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.
•
The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by
the student, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be made
when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark awarded
should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is not
necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.
•
When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors for each criterion until
they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a
piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the
one that more appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.
•
Where there are two marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper marks if the
student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent; the work may be close to
achieving marks in the level above. Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work
demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in the level below.
•
Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.
Internal assessment 72
Chemistry guide

=== Page 79 ===
•
Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary but should concentrate on identifying the
appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.
•
The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by a
student. Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of the work being assessed.
•
A student who attains a high achievement level in relation to one criterion will not necessarily attain
high achievement levels in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a student who attains a low
achievement level for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the other
criteria. Teachers should not assume that the overall assessment of the students will produce any particular distribution of marks.
•
It is recommended that the assessment criteria be made available to students.
Internal assessment details—SL and HL
The scientific investigation
Duration: 10 hours
Weighting: 20%
The IA requirement is the same for biology, chemistry and physics. The IA, worth 20% of the final
assessment, consists of one task—the scientific investigation.
The scientific investigation is an open-ended task in which the student gathers and analyses data in order to answer their own formulated research question.
The outcome of the scientific investigation will be assessed through the form of a written report. The
maximum overall word count for the report is 3,000 words.
The following are not included in the word count.
•
Charts and diagrams •
Data tables •
Equations, formulas and calculations •
Citations/references (whether parenthetical, numbered, footnotes or endnotes) •
Bibliography •
Headers
The following details should be stated at the start of the report.
•
Title of the investigation •
IB candidate code (alphanumeric, for example, xyz123) •
IB candidate code for all group members (if applicable) •
Number of words
There is no requirement to include a cover page or a contents page.
Facilitating the scientific investigation
The research question should be of interest to the student, but it is not necessary that it encompasses
concepts beyond those described by the understandings within the guide.
The scientific investigation undertaken must have sufficient extent and depth to allow for all the descriptors
of the assessment criteria to be meaningfully addressed.
The investigation of the research question must involve the collection and analysis of quantitative data that
should be supported by qualitative observations where appropriate.
The scientific investigation allows a wide range of techniques for data gathering and analysis to be
employed. The approaches that could be used in isolation or in conjunction with each other are as follows.
•
Hands-on practical laboratory work
Internal assessment 73
Chemistry guide

=== Page 80 ===
•
Fieldwork •
Use of a spreadsheet for analysis and modelling •
Extraction and analysis of data from a database •
Use of a simulation
The Chemistry teacher support material contains further guidance on these possible approaches.
Teachers must:
•
ensure that students are familiar with the assessment criteria •
ensure that students are able to investigate their individual research question •
counsel the students on whether their proposed methodology is feasible in consideration of available time and resources •
ensure that students have given appropriate consideration to safety, ethical and environmental factors before undertaking the action phase •
remind students of the requirements for academic integrity and the consequences of academic
malpractice. The difference between collaboration and collusion must be made clear.
Developing the research question
Each student is expected to formulate, investigate and answer a unique research question, seeking advice from their teacher.
A student must not present the same set of raw data as another student.
Methodology for individual work
Each student develops their own methodology to answer their individual research question. The student
investigates by:
• manipulating an independent variable or • selecting variables during fieldwork or • selecting different data from external databases.
The student might seek support from peers when collecting data.
Methodology for collaborative work
Collaborative work is optional and where it is facilitated the groups formed must be no larger than three
students. Students may organize their own groups. The teacher must provide guidance to ensure that all
students are fully engaged in the collaborative activity. Students must clearly understand the requirement to conduct an individual investigation.
The methodology developed to answer their individual research question may be in part the outcome of
collaborative activity. A student within the group investigates their individual research question by
manipulating:
•
a different independent variable from those selected by other group members or •
the same independent variable with a different dependent variable from those selected by other group members or •
different data from those selected by other group members from within a larger communally acquired data set.
In this context, collaborative work is permitted under the understanding that the final report presented for
assessment is that of the individual student. A report by the group is not permitted. All authoring, including
Internal assessment 74
Chemistry guide

=== Page 81 ===
the description of the methodology, must be done individually. This diagram illustrates a possible route
through the IA process where students collaborate.
Figure 3
A possible route through collaborative work
Class collaboration to set up a database
A school may take part in a large-scale activity collecting data to generate a database using standardized
protocols. If a student decides to utilize this database in order to answer their research question, then the
investigation must be treated as a database investigation. In such a case the methodology should be
focused on the way the data is filtered and sampled from the whole database in the same way as if the data was wholly acquired from an external source.
Assessing the scientific investigation
The performance in IA at both SL and HL is marked against common assessment criteria, with a total mark
out of 24. Student work is internally assessed by the teacher and externally moderated by the IB.
The four assessment criteria are as follows.

Each assessment criterion has level descriptors describing specific achievement levels, together with an
appropriate range of marks. The level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the
lower levels failure to achieve may be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL against the same criteria using the level
descriptors and aided by the clarifications. The criteria must be applied systematically using a best-fit
approach—when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels the mark
awarded should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is not
necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded. The highest
level descriptors do not imply faultless performance.
Where there are two or more marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper mark if the
student’s work largely satisfies the qualities described; the work may be close to achieving marks in the
level above. Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work demonstrates the qualities
described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in the level below.
Only whole numbers must be recorded; partial marks (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.
The criteria should be considered independently. A student who attains a high achievement level in
relation to one criterion will not necessarily attain high achievement levels in relation to the other criteria.
Similarly, a student who attains a low achievement level for one criterion will not necessarily attain low
achievement levels for the other criteria. Teachers should not assume that the overall assessment of the
students will produce any particular distribution of marks.
Where command terms are used in the level descriptors, they are to be interpreted as indicated in the
“Glossary of command terms” section of this guide. These command terms indicate the depth of treatment
required. Command terms used within the descriptors are provided in the following table.
Assessment objective
Command term Descriptor
AO1
State
Give a specific name, value or other brief answer without explanation or calculation.
AO2
Identify
Provide an answer from a number of possibilities.
AO2
Outline
Give a brief account or summary.
AO2
Describe

AO3
Explain
Give a detailed account including reasons or causes.
AO3
Justify
Give valid reasons or evidence to support an answer or conclusion.
Referencing and academic integrity
Appropriate referencing to sourced information used in the report of the scientific investigation is
expected. Omitted or improper referencing will be considered to be academic malpractice.
Students must ensure their assessment work adheres to the IB’s academic integrity policy and that all
sources are appropriately referenced. A student’s failure to appropriately acknowledge a source will be
investigated by the IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB
Final Award Committee. See the “Academic integrity” section of this guide for full details.

Research design
This criterion assesses the extent to which the student effectively communicates the methodology
(purpose and practice) used to address the research question.
Marks
Level descriptor 0
The report does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.
1–2 •
The research question is stated without context.
•
Methodological considerations associated with collecting data relevant to the research question are stated.
•
The description of the methodology for collecting or selecting data lacks the detail to allow for the investigation to be reproduced.
3–4 •
The research question is outlined within a broad context.
•
Methodological considerations associated with collecting relevant and sufficient
data to answer the research question are described.
•
The description of the methodology for collecting or selecting data allows for the
investigation to be reproduced with few ambiguities or omissions.
5–6 •
The research question is described within a specific and appropriate context.
•
Methodological considerations associated with collecting relevant and sufficient
data to answer the research question are explained.
•
The description of the methodology for collecting or selecting data allows for the investigation to be reproduced.
Clarifications for research design
A research question with context should contain reference to the dependent and independent variables
or two correlated variables, include a concise description of the system in which the research question is
embedded, and include background theory of direct relevance.
Methodological considerations include:
•
the selection of the methods for measuring the dependent and independent variables •
the selection of the databases or model and the sampling of data •
the decisions regarding the scope, quantity and quality of measurements (e.g. the range, interval or
frequency of the independent variable, repetition and precision of measurements) •
the identification of control variables and the choice of method of their control
Internal assessment 77

Clarifications for research design •
the recognition of any safety, ethical or environmental issues that needed to be taken into account.
The description of the methodology refers to presenting sufficiently detailed information (such as specific
materials used and precise procedural steps) while avoiding unnecessary or repetitive information, so that
the reader may readily understand how the methodology was implemented and could in principle repeat the investigation.
Data analysis
This criterion assesses the extent to which the student’s report provides evidence that the student has
recorded, processed and presented the data in ways that are relevant to the research question.
Marks
Level descriptor 0
The report does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
1–2 •
The recording and processing of the data is communicated but is neither clear nor precise.
•
The recording and processing of data shows limited evidence of the consideration of uncertainties.
•
Some processing of data relevant to addressing the research question is carried out
but with major omissions, inaccuracies or inconsistencies.
3–4 •
The communication of the recording and processing of the data is either clear or precise.
•
The recording and processing of data shows evidence of a consideration of
uncertainties but with some significant omissions or inaccuracies.
•
The processing of data relevant to addressing the research question is carried out
but with some significant omissions, inaccuracies or inconsistencies.
5–6 •
The communication of the recording and processing of the data is both clear and precise.
•
The recording and processing of data shows evidence of an appropriate consideration of uncertainties.
•
The processing of data relevant to addressing the research question is carried out appropriately and accurately.
Clarifications for data analysis
Data refers to quantitative data or a combination of both quantitative and qualitative data.
Communication •
Clear communication means that the method of processing can be understood easily.
•
Precise communication refers to following conventions correctly, such as those relating to the
annotation of graphs and tables or the use of units, decimal places and significant figures.
Consideration of uncertainties is subject specific and further guidance is given in the Chemistry teacher support material.
Major omissions, inaccuracies or inconsistencies impede the possibility of drawing a valid conclusion that addresses the research question.
Significant omissions, inaccuracies or inconsistencies allow the possibility of drawing a conclusion that
addresses the research question but with some limit to its validity or detail.

Conclusion
This criterion assesses the extent to which the student successfully answers their research question with
regard to their analysis and the accepted scientific context.
Marks
Level descriptor 0
The report does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
1–2 •
A conclusion is stated that is relevant to the research question but is not supported by the analysis presented.
•
The conclusion makes superficial comparison to the accepted scientific context.
3–4 •
A conclusion is described that is relevant to the research question but is not fully consistent with the analysis presented.
•
A conclusion is described that makes some relevant comparison to the accepted scientific context.
5–6 •
A conclusion is justified that is relevant to the research question and fully consistent with the analysis presented.
•
A conclusion is justified through relevant comparison to the accepted scientific context.
Clarifications for conclusion
A conclusion that is fully consistent requires the interpretation of processed data including associated uncertainties.
Scientific context refers to information that could come from published material (paper or online),
published values, course notes, textbooks or other outside sources. The citation of published materials
must be sufficiently detailed to allow these sources to be traceable.
Evaluation
