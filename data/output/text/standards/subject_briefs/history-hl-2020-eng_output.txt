The Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19 age
range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and
inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students
to develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for
them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core. Students study
two modern languages (or a modern language and a classical language), a ­humanities
or social science subject, an experimental science, mathematics and one of the creative
arts. Instead of an arts subject, students can choose two subjects from another area.
It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma Programme a
demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university
entrance. In each of the academic areas students have flexibility in making their
choices, which means they can choose subjects that particularly interest them and
that they may wish to study further at university.
Normally, three subjects (and not more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and
the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends 240 teaching hours for HL
subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than
at SL. In addition, three core elements—the extended essay, theory of knowledge and creativity,
activity, service—are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.
These DP subject briefs illustrate four key course components.

I. Course description and aims
The DP history course is a world history course based on a comparative
and multi-perspective approach to history. It involves the study of a
va-riety of types of history, including political, economic, social and
cultural, and provides a balance of structure and flexibility.
The course emphasizes the importance of encouraging students to
think historically and to develop historical skills as well as gaining
factual knowledge. It puts a premium on developing the skills of critical
think-ing, and on developing an understanding of multiple interpre­
tations of history. In this way, the course involves a challenging and
demanding critical exploration of the past. Teachers explicitly teach
thinking and re-search skills such as comprehension, text analysis, transfer, and use of primary sources.
There are six key concepts that have particular prominence throughout
the DP history course: change, continuity, causation, consequence, sig-nificance and perspectives.
The aims of the DP history course are to enable students to:

z develop an understanding of, and continuing interest in, the past

z encourage students to engage with multiple perspectives and to
appreciate the complex nature of historical concepts, issues, events and developments

z promote international-mindedness through the study of history from more than one region of the world

z develop an understanding of history as a discipline and to develop
historical consciousness including a sense of chronology and
context, and an understanding of different historical perspectives

z develop key historical skills, including engaging effectively with sources

z increase students’ understanding of themselves and of contempo­
rary society by encouraging reflection on the past.
