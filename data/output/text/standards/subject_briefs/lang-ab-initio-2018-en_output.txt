I. Course description and aims
Language acquisition consists of two modern language courses—
language ab initio and language B—designed to provide students
with the necessary skills and intercultural understanding to enable
them to communicate successfully in an environment where the language studied is spoken.
Offered at SL only, language ab initio is a language acquisition course
designed for students with no previous experience in—or very little exposure to—the target language.
Language ab initio students develop their receptive, productive and
interactive skills while learning to communicate in the target language in familiar and unfamiliar contexts.
Students develop the ability to communicate through the study of
language, themes and texts. There are five prescribed themes: identities,
experiences, human ingenuity, social organization and sharing the planet.
While the themes are common to both language ab initio and language
B, the language ab initio syllabus additionally prescribes four topics for
each of the five themes, for a total of 20 topics that must be addressed over the two years of the course.
The following language acquisition aims are common to both language ab initio and language B.
•	 Develop international-mindedness through the study of
languages, cultures, and ideas and issues of global significance.
•	 Enable students to communicate in the language they have
studied in a range of contexts and for a variety of purposes.
•	 Encourage, through the study of texts and through social
interaction, an awareness and appreciation of a variety of perspectives of people from diverse cultures.
•	 Develop students’ understanding of the relationship between
the languages and cultures with which they are familiar.
•	 Develop students’ awareness of the importance of language in relation to other areas of knowledge.
•	 Provide students, through language learning and the process of
inquiry, with opportunities for intellectual engagement and the
development of critical- and creative-thinking skills.
•	 Provide students with a basis for further study, work and leisure through the use of an additional language.
•	 Foster curiosity, creativity and a lifelong enjoyment of language learning.

The Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19
age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and
inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students
to develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them
to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core. Students study
two modern languages (or a modern language and a classical language), a humanities
or social science subject, an experimental science, mathematics and one of the creative
arts. Instead of an arts subject, students can choose two subjects from another area.
It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma Programme a
demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university
entrance. In each of the academic areas students have flexibility in making their
choices, which means they can choose subjects that particularly interest them and
that they may wish to study further at university.
Normally, three subjects (and not more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and
the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends 240 teaching hours for
HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than at SL.
In addition, three core elements—the extended essay, theory of knowledge and creativity, activity,
service—are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.
This IB DP subject brief has four key components:
