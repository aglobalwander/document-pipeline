## Where Do I Start?

During pacing, the coach asks himself which of the five states of mind appears to be unawakened in the colleague's experience. If liberated, which of them might convey the necessary resources? The lead to internal resources may begin with a question designed to illuminate that state of mind and its related resources. Although none of the questions listed here would be the first question asked in the lead, as they are the central focus of the conversation occurring later, they illustrate inquiries that might activate a particular state of mind within the context of an interaction. For example, if efficacy is unawakened, the coach might ask the following questions:

- Self-prescribing: 'How do you go about motivating yourself?'
- Choice making: 'So you can think of several approaches. How will you know which one to choose?'
- Correcting fate control: 'What was it in your behavior that might have caused that?'
- Shifting toward an internal locus of control: 'What do you need to do?'
- Identifying resources: 'What knowledge, skills, or attitudes might you need to accomplish that?'
- Content reframing: 'What might be the positive value of that response?'

If the colleague needs to access flexibility, the coach might ask questions like these:

- Entering other perspectives: 'Considering their history, what might they be feeling?'

- Enlarging frames of reference: 'What additional values might there be?'
- Predicting consequences: 'What might be the result of . . .?'
- Considering intentions: 'What do you think they want to achieve?'
- Testing outcomes: 'What's the worst [or best] possible results of achieving that outcome?'
- Style checking: 'Given your knowledge of learning styles, what might be going on?'
- Changing time horizons: 'If you had twice the time [or half the time], what difference might that make?'
- Context reframing: 'If there were an upside to this misfortune, what might it be?'

A coach who wants to help a colleague access craftsmanship might ask questions like the following:

- Communicating with specificity: 'How do you define . . .?'
- Managing time: 'How will you know it is time to move on?'
- Defining criteria for judgment: 'What criteria will you use to . . .?'
- Striving for refinement: 'How will you know when you are really satisfied?'
- Exploring standards: 'What are the connections with [curriculum, teaching, district] standards?'

To access consciousness, the coach might ask these kinds of questions:

- Metacogitating: 'What was your thinking that led to that decision?'
- Mental rehearsing: 'As you picture this event, what will you be doing?'
- Mental editing: 'Looking back, what might you change?'
- Owning intentions: 'What are your intentions?'
- Considering effects: 'How might your choice influence you and others?'
- Checking assumptions: 'So you are assuming . . . . How did you arrive at that?'
- Values searching: 'What is it that makes this so important to you?'

In the area of interdependence, a coach might ask the following:

- Collaborating: 'Who else is concerned about this?'

- Talent searching: 'What useful skills do other group members have?'
- Resource banking: 'How might others assist you?'
- Group supporting: 'In what ways does this relate to staff concerns?'
- Envisioning potential: 'As this group continues to develop, what other ways might it handle this?'
- Coordinating: 'Where else in the system does this value of yours reside?'
