## Comfort

Because problem resolving is the most complex of the maps and depends on moment-to-moment sensory acuity, the coach may not always know what to say next. Being comfortable with this dimension of ambiguity is a critical resource to both parties. For the coach, living with this ambiguity

helps to prevent premature and inappropriate comments. For the colleague, it is reassuring to have someone fully present and not discomforted as he works through his uncertainties.

If the coach becomes uncomfortable by being lost in her own emotional reactions to the issues being discussed, two strategies can be employed. First, she can remind herself to set aside focus on self. Second, she can use a paraphrase. Paraphrasing helps to focus the coach's emotional attention on the colleague, not on the coach's discomfort. If the coach becomes lost in the process and a way out is not apparent, living with the discomfort at these times is often the best action. In doing so, the coach communicates her trust in the colleague and in the process.
