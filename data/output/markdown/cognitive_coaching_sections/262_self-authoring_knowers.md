## Self-Authoring Knowers

Able to synthesize various points of view, and informed by abstract principles and clear personal values, this way of knowing might appear as multiple ripples in a pond, perhaps with different velocities. These adults, among the three developmental ways of knowing, operate at the most abstract level. They attain greater clarity about personal values, principles, and long-term goals. They are conscious of their own competencies, pursue personal development, and look for the demonstration of the competencies of others. They can be a special asset to collaborative work as they have the ability to synthesize diverse points of view and critique ideas. Developmental challenges for adults operating at this level are that they prefer their own approaches and need encouragement to be open to other approaches. They can also be resistant to the perspectives of others when those views are in opposition to their own.

Engage them in leadership roles that offer opportunities for them to utilize their analytic abilities and engage in dialogue and learn from the perspectives of others. Flexibility and interdependence are two states of mind in which they can develop. Encourage them to chair committees, lead student projects, or engage in curriculum revision.
