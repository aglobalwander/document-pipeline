The IB Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous, academically challenging and
balanced programme of education designed to prepare students aged 16 to 19
for success at university and life beyond. The DP aims to encourage students to be
knowledgeable, inquiring, caring and compassionate, and to develop intercultural
understanding, open-mindedness and the attitudes necessary to respect and evalu ate a range of viewpoints. Approaches to teaching and learning (ATL) within the DP
are deliberate strategies, skills and attitudes that permeate the teaching and learning
environment. In the DP students develop skills from five ATL categories: thinking,
research, social, self-management and communication.
To ensure both breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding, students must
choose at least one subject from five groups: 1) their best language, 2) additional lan guage(s), 3) social sciences, 4) experimental sciences, and 5) mathematics. Students
may choose either an arts subject from group 6, or a second subject from groups
1 to 5. At least three and not more than four subjects are taken at higher level (240
recommended teaching hours), while the remaining are taken at standard level (150
recommended teaching hours). In addition, three core elements—the extended
essay, theory of knowledge and creativity, action, service—
are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.
These IB DP subject briefs illustrate four key course components.

I. Course description and aims
Physics is the most fundamental of the experimental sciences, as it
seeks to explain the universe itself, from the very smallest particles to
the vast distances between galaxies. Despite the exciting and ex traordinary development of ideas throughout the history of physics,
observations remain essential to the very core of the subject. Models
are developed to try to understand observations, and these themselves
can become theories that attempt to explain the observations.
Besides helping us better understand the natural world, physics gives us
the ability to alter our environments.  This raises the issue of the impact
of physics on society, the moral and ethical dilemmas, and the social,
economic and environmental implications of the work of physicists.
By studying physics students should become aware of how scientists
work and communicate with each other. While the scientific method
may take on a wide variety of forms, it is the emphasis on a practical
approach through experimental work that characterizes the subject.
Teachers provide students with opportunities to develop manipulative
skills, design investigations, collect data, analyse results and evaluate and communicate their findings.
Through the overarching theme of the nature of science, the aims of the DP physics course are to enable students to:
1.	 appreciate scientific study and creativity within a global context through stimulating and challenging opportunities
2.	 acquire a body of knowledge, methods and techniques that char acterize science and technology
3.	 apply and use a body of knowledge, methods and techniques that characterize science and technology
4.	 develop an ability to analyse, evaluate and synthesize scientific in formation
5.	 develop a critical awareness of the need for, and the value of, effec tive collaboration and communication during scientific activities
6.	 develop experimental and investigative scientific skills including the use of current technologies
7.	 develop and apply 21st century communication skills in the study of science
8.	 become critically aware, as global citizens, of the ethical implica tions of using science and technology
9.	 develop an appreciation of the possibilities and limitations of sci ence and technology
10.	develop an understanding of the relationships between scientific
disciplines and their influence on other areas of knowledge.

The group 4 project
The group 4 project is a collaborative activity where students from
different group 4 subjects, within or between schools, work togeth er. It allows for concepts and perceptions from across disciplines to
be shared while appreciating the environmental, social and ethical
implications of science and technology. It can be practically or theoret ically based and aims to develop an understanding of the relationships
between scientific disciplines and their influence on other areas of
knowledge. The emphasis is on interdisciplinary cooperation and the scientific processes.
III. Assessment model
It is the intention of this course that students are able to fulfill the following assessment objectives:
1.	 Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of:
• facts, concepts, and terminology • methodologies and techniques • communicating scientific information.
2.	 Apply:
• facts, concepts, and terminology • methodologies and techniques
• methods of communicating scientific information.
3.	 Formulate, analyse and evaluate:
• hypotheses, research questions and predictions • methodologies and techniques • primary and secondary data • scientific explanations.
4.	 Demonstrate the appropriate research, experimental, and person al skills necessary to carry out insightful and ethical investigations.

IV. Sample questions
• Why is wave-particle duality used in describing the properties of light?
A.	 Light is both a wave and a particle
B.	 Both wave and particle models can explain all the properties of light
C.	 Different properties of light can be more clearly explained by using one of the wave or particle models
D.	 Scientists feel more confident when using more than one model to explain a phenomenon (Paper 1)
• The tower is 120m high with an internal diameter of 3.5m.  When
most of the air has been removed, the pressure in the tower is 0.96 Pa.
Determine the number of molecules of air in the tower when the temperature of the air is 300 K. (Paper 2)
• The streamlines above the airfoil are closer to each other than the
streamlines below the airfoil. Suggest why this implies that the
speed of the air above the airfoil is greater than the speed of air below the airfoil.  (Paper 3)
