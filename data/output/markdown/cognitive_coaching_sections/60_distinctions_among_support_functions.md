## DISTINCTIONS AMONG SUPPORT FUNCTIONS

The many terms that are used in education to describe support services intended to improve instruction are often confusing: consulting , mentoring , peer assistance , catalyst , supervision , coaching , evaluation , collaborating , and so forth.

We distinguish four functions intended to support teacher development: evaluating, collaborating, consulting, and mediating (Lipton, Wellman, and Humbard 2001). Table 1.1 elaborates on each of these.

Three of these functions-coaching, collaborating, and consultinginteract to improve instructional practice. For beginning teachers, the consulting, and collaborating features are often beginning stages of a conversation. The skillful, sensitive coach will ultimately default to Cognitive Coaching as it is most likely to support self-directed learning.
