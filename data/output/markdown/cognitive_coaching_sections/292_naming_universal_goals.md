## Naming Universal Goals

Another tip for crafting goal statements is to listen for the expression of three universal goals. After the basic survival needs of food, water, shelter, and sex, humans desire three goals: identity, connectedness, and potency. Coaches may use words in the goal statement that relate to these concepts. If, for example, circumstances threaten a colleague's ability to act congruently with his sense of self, the coach may choose goal words that relate to identity. For example, the coach may use phrases such as 'and you want to be true to yourself' or 'who you are is a person of integrity and you want to be that with others' or 'you want to be who you really are in this situation.'

If a situation is challenging one's sense of efficacy, words related to potency may express that desire. For example: 'and what you want is to be a catalyst' or 'you want to be a person of influence' or 'you want to be resourceful in this situation.'

If a person feels isolated, words that convey connectedness might be appropriate. For example: 'so your desire is be a team player,' 'you want a sense of family,' or 'you want to be a friend.'

Table 12.2 contains a bank of words and phrases that the coach may want to use with this verbal skill.
