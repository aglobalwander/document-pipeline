About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking
AP courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and
AP Exams are developed and scored by college faculty
and experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges
and universities in the United States grant credit,
advanced placement, or both on the basis of successful
AP Exam scores; more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the content
and skills that are the focus of the corresponding
college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also
organizes the content and skills into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many AP teachers have
told us they follow in order to focus their instruction.
The intention of this publication is to respect teachers’
time and expertise by providing a roadmap that they
can modify and adapt to their local priorities and
preferences. Moreover, by organizing the AP course
content and skills into units, the AP Program is able
to provide teachers and students with free formative assessments—Personal Progress Checks—that
teachers can assign throughout the year to measure
student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students:
Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically
challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to equitable preparation and
access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses:
The AP Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP courses
must participate in the AP Course Audit, a process through which AP teachers’ course materials are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.
﻿ V.1 | 1
AP European History Course and Exam Description
Return to Table of Contents © 2020 College Board

=== Page 9 ===
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the
AP teacher and the school principal (or designated
administrator) to confirm awareness and understanding
of the curricular and resource requirements. A syllabus
or course outline, detailing how course requirements
are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The
AP Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor;
all AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision,
piloting, and analysis to ensure that questions are
accurate, fair, and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development,
College Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher
education institutions. This feedback is carefully
considered to ensure that AP courses and exams are
able to provide students with a college-level learning
experience and the opportunity to demonstrate their
qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam
development process, relies on the expertise of both
AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice
questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course performance
assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands
of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are
scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion
is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained,
and their work is monitored throughout the Reading
for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief
Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers
in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of
the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a curve.
Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which means that
every student who meets the criteria for an AP score of
2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no matter how many
students that is. The criteria for the number of points
students must earn on the AP Exam to receive scores
of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently
validates for credit and placement purposes—include:
§§ The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
§§ The number of points researchers have found to be predictive that an AP student will succeed when placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
§§ Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP scores as follows:
AP Score
Credit
Recommendation
College Grade
Equivalent 5
Extremely well qualified
A 4
Well qualified
A-, B+, B 3
Qualified
B-, C+, C 2
Possibly qualified n/a 1
No recommendation n/a

While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and
universities. To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/ placement policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/creditpolicies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score the free-response sections of the AP Exams.
Ninety-eight percent of surveyed educators who took
part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an
AP Reader, including opportunities to:
§§ Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
§§ Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure
to the quality and depth of the responses from the
entire pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
§§ Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
§§ Score from home: AP Readers have online
distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects.
Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
§§ Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs):
AP Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.
How to Apply
Visit collegeboard.org/apreading for eligibility
requirements and to start the application process.

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide suggests a
sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds skill instruction across units, and organizes content into topics.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course topics and skills, create
customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.
*To report misuses, please call, 877-274-6474 (International: +1-212-632-1781).

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
§§ Teachers and students sign in to or create their College Board accounts.
§§ Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
§§ Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
§§ Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP Coordinator.
§§ Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and
AP Coordinators to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following
additional benefits:
§§ Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
§§ Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
§§ Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student pack.
The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
§§ Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

§§ Use the Unit at a Glance table to identify related topics that build toward a common
understanding, and then plan appropriate pacing for students.
§§ Identify useful strategies in the Instructional Approaches section to help teach the concepts and skills.
Teach
When teaching, supporting resources could be used to build students’ conceptual understanding and their mastery of skills.
§§ Use the topic pages in the unit guides to identify the required content.
§§ Integrate the content with a skill, considering any appropriate scaffolding.
§§ Employ any of the instructional strategies previously identified.
§§ Use the available resources on the topic pages to bring a variety of assets into the classroom.
Assess

About the AP European
History Course
In AP European History, students investigate significant events, individuals, developments,
and processes from approximately 1450 to the present. Students develop and use the same
skills, practices, and methods employed by historians: analyzing primary and secondary
sources; developing historical arguments; making historical connections; and utilizing
reasoning about comparison, causation, and continuity and change over time. The course
also provides seven themes that students explore throughout the course in order to make
connections among historical developments in different times and places: interaction of
Europe and the world, economic and commercial development, cultural and intellectual
development, states and other institutions of power, social organization and development,
national and European identity, and technological and scientific innovations.
College Course Equivalent
AP European History is designed to be the equivalent of an introductory college or university survey of modern European history.
Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites for AP European History. Students should be able to read a
college-level textbook and write grammatically correct, complete sentences.

Introduction
The AP European History course outlined in this framework reflects a
commitment to what history teachers, professors, and researchers have
identified as the main goal of a college-level modern European history survey
course: learning to analyze and interpret historical evidence to achieve
understanding of major developments in European history.
The AP European History Course and Exam Description defines what representative colleges and universities have
said students should know and be able to do in order to earn college credit or placement. Students practice the
thinking skills used by historians by studying primary and secondary source evidence, analyzing a wide array of
historical evidence and perspectives, and expressing historical arguments in writing.
Although the course framework is designed to provide a clear and detailed description of the course content and
skills, it is not a complete curriculum. Teachers create their own local curriculum to meet the needs of their students and any state or local requirements.

Course Framework
Components
Overview
This course framework provides a description of what students should know and be
able to do to qualify for college credit or placement.
The course framework includes two essential components:
1   HISTORICAL THINKING SKILLS AND
REASONING PROCESSES
The historical thinking skills and reasoning processes are central to the
study and practice of European history. Students should practice and
develop these skills and processes on a regular basis over the span of the course.
2   COURSE CONTENT
The course content is organized into commonly taught units of study that
provide a suggested sequence for the course. These units comprise the
content and conceptual understandings that colleges and universities
typically expect students to master to qualify for college credit and/or
placement. This content is grounded in themes, which are cross-cutting
concepts that build conceptual understanding and spiral throughout the course.

Historical
Thinking Skills and Reasoning
Processes
This section presents the historical thinking skills and reasoning processes that
students should develop during the AP history courses and that form the basis of the tasks on the AP history exams.
Historical Thinking Skills
The AP historical thinking skills describe what students should be able to do
while exploring course concepts. The table that follows presents these skills, which
students should develop during the AP European History course.
The unit guides later in this publication embed and spiral these skills throughout
the course, providing teachers with one way to integrate the skills in the course
content with sufficient repetition to prepare students to transfer those skills when taking the AP Exam.
More detailed information about teaching the historical thinking skills can be found

AP EUROPEAN HISTORY
Course
Content
Influenced by the Understanding by Design® (Wiggins and McTighe) model, this
course framework provides a description of the course requirements necessary for student success.
The course content is organized into commonly taught units. The units have
been arranged in a logical sequence frequently found in many college courses and textbooks.
The nine units in AP European History, and their approximate weighting on the
AP Exam, are listed on the following page.
Pacing recommendations at the unit level and in the Course at a Glance provide
suggestions for how to teach the required course content and administer the
Personal Progress Checks. The suggested class periods are based on a schedule
in which the class meets five days a week for 45 minutes each day. While these
recommendations have been made to aid planning, teachers should of course
adjust the pacing based on the needs of their students, alternate schedules
(e.g., block scheduling), or their school’s academic calendar.
TEACHING EARLIER PERIODS
AP European History focuses on topics in modern European history from the
mid-15th century through the 21st century, and the AP European History
Exam assesses understanding of only those topics. However, to gain a deeper
appreciation of the themes and patterns in European history, many teachers find
it useful to introduce the course with elements of earlier periods, such as ancient,
classical, or medieval history. Information on Greek and Roman attitudes, for
example, would help students understand the significance of how Renaissance
artists and scholars made use of ancient thought in their work. Similarly, a
discussion of Catholic theology from Augustine through the late middle ages
would help students appreciate the impact of such thought on later European
intellectual, cultural, social, and political beliefs as well as religious conflicts during
the Reformation and the wars of religion. Exposure to primary and secondary
sources in these periods would also give students more practice with the skill
of analyzing historical evidence. Using earlier periods to establish the thematic
foundations of the course can help students deepen their understanding of modern Europe’s history.

*Events, processes, and developments are not constrained by the given dates and may begin before, or continue after, the
approximate dates assigned to each unit and/or topic.
TOPICS
Each unit is broken down into teachable segments
called topics. The topic pages (starting on p. 38)
contain all required content for each topic. Although
most topics can be taught in one or two class periods,
teachers are again encouraged to pace the course to suit the needs of their students and school.
In order for students to develop an understanding of
these topics, teachers select specific historical figures, groups, and events—and the primary and secondary source documents through which they can be
examined—that enable students to investigate them. In
this way, AP teachers create their own local curricula for AP European History.

to political, economic, social, and cultural exchanges that influenced both
European and non-European societies.
THEME 2: ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENTS (ECD)
Economic development, especially the development of capitalism, played
an important role in Europe’s history, often having significant social, political, and cultural effects.
THEME 3: CULTURAL AND INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTS (CID)
The creation and transmission of knowledge, including the relationship
between traditional sources of authority and the development of differing
world views, had significant political, intellectual, economic, cultural, and social effects on European and world societies.
THEME 4: STATES AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS OF POWER (SOP)
European states and nations developed governmental and civil institutions
from 1450 to the present to organize society and consolidate political power,
with a variety of social, cultural, and economic effects.
THEME 5: SOCIAL ORGANIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT (SCD)
Economic, political, and cultural factors have influenced the form and status
of family, class, and social groups in European history, affecting both the individual and society.
THEME 6: NATIONAL AND EUROPEAN IDENTITY (NEI)
Definitions and perceptions of regional, cultural, national, and European
identity have developed and been challenged over time, with varied and
often profound effects on the political, social, and cultural order in Europe.
THEME 7: TECHNOLOGICAL AND SCIENTIFIC INNOVATION (TSI)
Scientific and technological innovations have increased efficiency, improved
daily life, and shaped human development and interactions, having both intended and unintended consequences.
Themes
The themes serve as the connective tissue of the course and enable students
to create meaningful connections across units. They are often broader ideas
that become threads that run throughout the course. Revisiting the themes
and applying them in a variety of contexts helps students to develop deeper
conceptual understanding. Below are the themes of the course and a brief description of each.

AP EUROPEAN HISTORY
Unit
Guides
Introduction
The structure of the unit guides respects new AP teachers’ time by
providing one possible sequence they can adopt or modify rather than
having to build from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units
enable the AP Program to provide interested teachers with formative
assessments—the Personal Progress Checks—that they can assign
their students at the end of each unit to gauge progress toward success
on the AP Exam. However, experienced AP teachers who are satisfied
with their current course organization and exam results should feel no
pressure to adopt these units, which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

AP European History Course and Exam Description
Using the Unit Guides
The Unit at a Glance table shows the topics, related thematic
focus, suggested skills, and reasoning processes for each topic.
The class periods column has been left blank so that teachers can customize the time they spend on each topic.
The suggested skill for each topic shows one way teachers can
link the content in that topic to a specific AP historical thinking
skill. The individual skill has been thoughtfully chosen in a way
that helps spiral the skills throughout the course. The questions
on the Personal Progress Checks are based on this pairing.
However, AP Exam questions may pair the content with any of the skills.
The Sample Instructional Activities page includes optional
activities that can help tie together the content and skills of a
particular topic. Additionally, this page offers space for teachers
to make notes on their approach to the individual topics and the unit as a whole.

the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery on cards. Place the cards into a box and have
students pick a card at random. Give them a few minutes to gather and recall information
about the cause or effect, and then ask them to find the connection between their
concepts in pairs. Finally, ask each student pair to write a brief explanation of how the concepts are related.
SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate instructional approaches into the classroom. They were developed in partnership
with teachers from the AP community to share ways that they approach teaching some of the
topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional Approaches section beginning on p. 213 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Unit Planning Notes

KC-1.5.II.B
Advances in military technology led to new forms of warfare, including greater reliance on infantry, firearms, mobile cannon, and more elaborate fortifications, all financed by heavier taxation and requiring a larger bureaucracy.
New military techniques and institutions (i.e., the military revolution) tipped the balance of power toward states able to marshal sufficient resources for the new military environment.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
Unit 4: Learning Objective B
Explain how understanding of the natural world developed and changed during the
Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment.
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTS
KC-1.1.IV.A
New ideas and methods in astronomy led individuals, including Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton, to question the authority of the ancients and traditional knowledge, and to develop a heliocentric view of the cosmos.
KC-1.1.IV.B
Anatomical and medical discoveries by physicians, including William Harvey, presented the body as an integrated system, challenging the traditional humoral theory of the body and of disease espoused by Galen.
KC-1.1.IV.C
Francis Bacon and René Descartes defined inductive and deductive reasoning and promoted experimentation and the use of mathematics, which would ultimately shape the scientific method.
KC-1.1.IV.D
Alchemy and astrology continued to appeal to elites and some natural philosophers, in part because they shared with the new science the notion of a predictable and knowable universe.
At the same time, many people continued to believe that the cosmos was governed by spiritual forces.

Explain the factors contributing to and the consequences of demographic changes from 1648 to 1815.
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTS
KC-2.4.I
In the 17th century, small landholdings, low-productivity agricultural practices, poor transportation, and adverse weather limited and disrupted the food supply, causing periodic famines. By the 18th century, the balance between population and the food supply
stabilized, resulting in steady population growth.
KC-2.4.I.A
By the middle of the 18th century, higher agricultural productivity and improved transportation increased the food supply, allowing populations to grow and reducing the number of demographic crises (a process known as the Agricultural Revolution).
KC-2.4.I.B
In the 18th century, plague disappeared as a major epidemic disease, and inoculation reduced smallpox mortality.
KC-2.4.III.A
Although the rate of illegitimate births increased in the 18th century, population growth was limited by the European marriage pattern, and in some areas by various birth control methods.

Cities offered economic opportunities, which attracted increasing migration from rural areas, transforming urban life and creating challenges for the new urbanites and their families.
KC-2.4.IV.A
The Agricultural Revolution produced more food using fewer workers; as a result, people migrated from rural areas to the cities in search of work.
KC-2.4.IV.B
The growth of cities eroded traditional communal values, and city governments strained to provide protection and a healthy environment.
KC-2.4.IV.C
The concentration of the poor in cities led to a greater awareness of poverty, crime, and prostitution as social problems, and prompted increased efforts to police marginal groups.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate instructional approaches into the classroom. They were developed in partnership
with teachers from the AP community to share ways that they approach teaching some of the
topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional Approaches section beginning on p. 213 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 7.4
Questioning a Source
Assign students to analyze a 19th-century illustration arguing in support for social
Darwinism. Ask them to write down any clarification and discussion questions that come to
mind with a goal toward explaining the limitations of the source’s argument. Have students
form groups around similar questions and ask them to find evidence in other sources
that refute the source’s argument. Have groups present their findings and then lead a
discussion about the motivations behind this movement and how it connects to ethnic nationalism.
2 7.6
Self/Peer Revision
Have students work through writing components of a full practice long essay question
(claim, evidence, historical reasoning, and addressing alternative perspectives
demonstrating a complex understanding) on the political and economic motivations for
the new imperialism, and then have them perform self- or peer revisions of their practice argument essays. That way, they have the opportunity to review and assess their own argument and the argument of their peers.
3 7.7
Socratic Seminar
Ask the question How did imperialism change Europe’s relationship with the world? to
initiate a Socratic seminar. In the discussion, students can illustrate their knowledge of the
causes and effects of the new imperialism and make connections between and among
related global events (such as the Fashoda crisis or the Sepoy Mutiny).
4 7.8
Think-Pair-Share
Have students analyze the patterns of continuity and change over time in 19th-century
culture and the arts by posing a question, such as Explain the continuities and changes
in European artistic expression from 1815 to 1914. After students have shared their
responses with a partner, engage the class in a group discussion to discover which
changes or continuities they used as examples and to enhance student understanding.
Unit Planning Notes
Use the space below to plan your approach to the unit. Plan for how to provide practice opportunities
that will help students develop a complex understanding of an event, development, or process in their arguments on the exam.

Topic
Sample Activity 1 8.2
Questioning the Source
Assign students to read and analyze propaganda posters from World War I and write
down any clarification and discussion questions that come to mind. Form groups around
similar questions and ask students to find answers in the textbook or another source. Have
groups present their findings and lead a discussion about motivations, nationalism, and the home front during the war.
2 8.3
Guided Discussion
Use brainstorming and quickwrite as strategies during a guided discussion to help
students understand the various causes and effects of the Russian Revolution.
3 8.5
Look for a Pattern
Using a complex graph (with at least two data sets, such as GDP and unemployment
rates during the Depression), have students compare the data to find a trend and draw a conclusion.
4 8.7
Making Connections
Write concepts related to the political, social, and economic changes in Europe during the
interwar period on notecards, place them in a box, and have students pick a concept at
random. Give them a few minutes to gather and recall information about the concept and
then ask them to find the connection between their concepts in pairs. Finally, ask each
student pair to write a brief explanation of how the concepts are related.

Selecting and Using
Course Materials
Using a wide array of historical source material helps
students become proficient with the historical thinking skills and develop a conceptual understanding of
European history. In addition to using a college-level
textbook that will provide required course content, students should regularly examine primary source
material in different and varied forms as well as other
types of historical scholarship. Rich, diverse source
material provides more flexibility in designing learning
activities that develop the habits of historical thinking
that are essential for student success in the course.
Textbooks
The AP European History course requires the use of
a college-level textbook that includes a discussion of historical developments and processes from
c. 1450 into the 21st century in a way that encourages
conceptual understanding. While nearly all college level European history textbooks address the various themes of European history, they may cover these
thematic approaches differently. It will be important to identify other types of secondary sources and supplement the textbook accordingly.
AP Central has a list of textbook examples that meet the resource requirements.
Primary Sources
Students will find it useful to analyze primary source
material regularly to deepen their understanding of the key concepts addressed by the textbook and develop the required skills. While publishers are
increasingly including primary source material in the textbook, students should be introduced to a wide
variety of source material so they can analyze historical
evidence from diverse sources. These sources should
include written documents as well as images, such as
photographs, cartoons, and works of art. The ancillary
materials and online sources that accompany most of
the recently published textbooks may have high-quality
primary source documents, artwork, charts, and other
sources of data that are linked to the topics and themes
addressed in the textbook. If the textbook used does
not provide ample primary sources, or the sources are
too brief, teachers may decide to supplement their
course with document readers that provide lengthier
selections or online compilations of primary sources related to particular topic areas.
Secondary Sources
Student success in the course also depends on exposure to and analysis of multiple secondary
sources. Secondary sources include accounts of the
past written by historians or scholars of other related
disciplines, such as economists, sociologists, political
commentators, or art historians, who were not present
during the events or who are analyzing history today.
Secondary sources include data sets, charts, and maps
as well. Secondary sources of all types can provide a
broader and more substantive perspective on topics addressed by a textbook. Additionally, secondary
sources can be helpful in supplementing textbooks with older publication dates.
It is especially important that students receive
instruction in the practice of analyzing and comparing
historians’ interpretations of events. Students should
have opportunities to compare a primary source with a
secondary source or compare the views represented by
two different secondary sources. This need can often
be met by source collections that provide both primary
and secondary source material or through ancillary
resource material offered by textbook publishers. When
finding resources to use with students, teachers may
consider a variety of sources that vary in complexity,
building toward publications by practicing historians, university presses, or scholarly journals.
School librarians can also help identify databases
that contain a variety of useful primary and secondary
source material. Many schools already subscribe to
databases, such as ABC-CLIO, JSTOR, EBSCO, or Gale,
that may augment the materials found in texts or source collections.

Instructional Strategies
The AP European History course framework outlines the concepts and skills
students must master in order to be successful on the AP Exam. To address those
concepts and skills effectively, it helps to incorporate a variety of instructional
approaches into daily lessons and activities. The following table presents strategies
that can help students apply their understanding of course concepts.
Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Close Reading
Students read, reread, and analyze small chunks of text word for word, sentence by sentence, and line by line.
Develops comprehensive understanding of a text.
When students are reading early documents with unfamiliar vocabulary, have them highlight relevant words and passages that support the author’s claim. Teachers can also read a difficult primary or secondary source aloud to students to help them understand the content and author’s tone.
Create
Representations
Students create tables, graphs, or other infographics to interpret text or data.
Helps students organize information using multiple ways to present data.
Give students a set of data (e.g., numbers of factories or city populations) and have them create a graph that best shows the data and the trends.
Critique
Reasoning
Through collaborative discussion, students critique the arguments of others, questioning the author’s perspective, evidence presented, and reasoning behind the argument.
Helps students learn from others as they make connections between concepts and learn to support their arguments with evidence and reasoning that make sense to peers.
Have students critique Bishop
Bossuet’s arguments in his writings on the divine right of kings. Have students examine
Bossuet’s perspective and the evidence and reasoning he uses to support this position.
Debate
Students present an informal or formal argument that defends a claim with reasons, while others defend different claims about the same topic or issue. The goal is to debate ideas without attacking the people who defend those ideas.
Gives students an opportunity to collect and orally present evidence supporting the affirmative and negative arguments of a proposition or issue.
Have students debate whether Napoleon was a tyrant or a liberator using evidence and reasoning to support their claims.

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Debriefing
Students participate in a facilitated discussion that leads to consensus understanding or helps them identify the key conclusions or takeaways.
Helps students solidify and deepen their understanding.
For complex issues such as philosophies, lead students in a debrief to ensure their understanding.
Discussion
Groups
Students engage in an interactive, small-group discussion, often with an assigned role (e.g., questioner, summarizer, facilitator, evidence keeper) to consider a topic, text, question, etc.
Helps students gain new understanding of or insight into a text or issue by listening to multiple perspectives.
Use the learning objectives, such as “Explain how the revival of classical texts contributed to the development of the
Renaissance in Italy,” (Unit 1:
Learning Objective B) to help students gain information and show their understanding.
Fishbowl
Some students form an inner circle and model appropriate discussion techniques while an outer circle of students listens, responds, and evaluates.
Provides students with an opportunity to engage in a formal discussion and to experience the roles of both participant and active listener;
students also have the responsibility of supporting their opinions and responses using specific evidence.
Use this strategy to discuss the arguments presented in various religious documents during the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation, focusing on how the documents relate to common topics or themes.
Graphic
Organizer
Students use a visual representation for the organization of information (e.g., Venn diagrams, flowcharts, cluster maps).
Builds comprehension and facilitates discussion by representing information in visual form.
Ask students to use a graphic organizer to compare political, economic, religious, social, intellectual, and technological ideas. Make sure students use any organizer thoughtfully and are not simply “filling in the blanks.” Concept webs or timelines are useful types of graphic organizers for having students discuss causation and continuity and/or change over time.
Guided
Discussion
A guided discussion is an umbrella strategy that allows for the use of different techniques as you guide students through the lesson.
Helps students see the big picture and builds their confidence when dealing with difficult content and/or new skills.
Use brainstorming and quickwrite as strategies during a guided discussion to help students understand the various motivations and patterns for participation in European wars of religion.

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Jigsaw
Each student in a group reads a different text or different passage from a single text, taking on the role of “expert” on what was read. Students share the information from that reading with students from other groups and then return to their original groups to share their new knowledge.
Helps students summarize and present information to others in a way that facilitates an understanding of a text (or multiple texts) or issue without having each student read the text in its entirety; by teaching others, they become experts.
Use this strategy to facilitate understanding of the various objectives and accomplishments of one of the 19th-century reform movements. Have students read and analyze primary and secondary sources related to political corruption, social injustice, and economic inequality.
Look for a
Pattern
Students evaluate data or create visual representations to find a trend.
Helps students identify patterns that may be used to draw conclusions.
Using a complex graph (with at least two data sets, such as mobilization numbers for each country during World War I versus their total number of casualties), have students compare the data to find a trend and draw a conclusion.
Making
Connections
Students are given a concept, term, or document and asked to write what they know about it. Then students are paired and asked to determine, describe, and then explain the connection between the two concepts.
Reinforces the fact that concepts are often connected and provides the opportunity for students to make and explain connections between and among these concepts.
Write concepts related to one of the course themes (such as economics or politics) on cards, place them into a box, and have students pick a concept at random. Give students a few minutes to gather and recall information about the term and then pair students and ask them to find the connection between their concepts. Finally, ask the pairs to write a brief explanation of how the concepts are related.
Match Claims and Evidence
Students are given sample claims (most of which can be improved upon) to evaluate and revise. Then students match their revised claims with pieces of evidence that can be used to support the claims. Once matched, students write a statement explaining how and why the evidence supports the claim.
Provides opportunities for students to edit existing claims and match those claims with existing evidence in preparation for writing their own argumentative essays.
In early stages of practicing argumentation, ask small groups of students to write claims and supporting evidence statements based on a prompt. Have groups trade claims and evidence and revise or modify the claims (if necessary), match the claims and evidence, and write statements explaining why the evidence supports the claim.

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Questioning a
Source
Students develop literal, interpretive, and universal questions about the text while reading a text.
Allows students to engage more actively with texts, read with greater purpose and focus, and ultimately answer questions to gain greater insight into the text.
Assign students to read and analyze propaganda posters from either World War I or II and write down any clarification and discussion questions that come to mind while reading the text. Form groups around similar questions and ask students to research answers from a source, such as the textbook. Have groups present their findings and lead a discussion about motivations, nationalism, and “the home front” during the war.
Quickwrite
Students write for a short, specific amount of time about a designated topic.
Helps students generate ideas in a short time.
As preparation for the free response questions, use the learning objectives to have students write claims and explain evidence that supports their claims for various topics.
Self/Peer
Revision
Students work alone or with a partner to examine a piece of writing for accuracy and clarity.
Provides students an opportunity for editing a written text to ensure correctness of identified components.
As students work through writing components of their arguments (claims, evidence, historical reasoning, sourcing, etc.), have them perform self- or peer revisions of their practice-argument essays, so that they have the opportunity to review their practice claims, supporting evidence, sourcing, and analysis and reasoning.
Socratic
Seminar
Students engage in a focused discussion tied to a topic or selected text in which they ask questions of one another.
The questions initiate a conversation that continues with a series of responses and additional questions.
Helps students arrive at a new understanding by asking questions that clarify; challenging assumptions; probing perspective and point of view; questioning facts, reasons, and evidence;
or examining implications and outcomes.
Use the essential questions at the start of each unit to initiate discussion where students can illustrate their understanding of the learning objectives and essential knowledge statements.
Think-
Pair-Share
Students think through a question or issue alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with the class.
Enables the development of initial ideas that are then tested with a partner in preparation for revising ideas and sharing them with a larger group.
Have students use think-pair share to analyze the causes and effects of the formation of the European Union.

Developing Historical
Thinking Skills
Throughout the AP European History course, students
will develop skills that are fundamental to the study of
history. Since these historical thinking skills represent
the complex skills that adept historians demonstrate,
students will benefit from multiple opportunities to develop them in a scaffolded manner.
The historical thinking skills and reasoning processes used in the course framework help students begin
to understand and create historical arguments in a
process similar to that used by historians. This process
begins with a close analysis of historical sources and reaches its conclusion when evidence, drawn from
historical sources, is used effectively to support an argument about the past.
The tables on the pages that follow look at each of the
skills and provide examples of tasks or questions for
each skill, along with instructional notes and strategies for implementing that skill into the course.

Historical Thinking Skill 1: Identify and explain historical developments and processes
Historical knowledge is gained from a variety of formats: knowledge transfer from
the teacher, reading textbooks, analyzing primary and secondary sources, and from
other media. In order to perform historical analysis and argumentation, students
need to establish a depth of knowledge about historical events, processes, and
people and their actions. This skill allows students to gain empirical knowledge that
they can then apply using more sophisticated skills.

Historical Thinking Skill 2: Analyze sourcing and situation of primary and secondary sources
Historians use primary sources and the arguments of other historians (secondary
sources) as the foundation for creating an understanding about historical events—
in short, a historical argument. Sources need to be closely evaluated so that they
can be used properly to support, refute, or even modify an argument. By using these
skills, students will build an understanding of source analysis that they can later
use in developing their own historical arguments. Good analysis requires a critical evaluation of the source's limitations.

§§ How could a historian use this source to develop an argument?
§§ What does the source not tell you?
§§ How does the tone and/or audience of a source affect its value to historians?

Historical Thinking Skill 3: Analyze arguments in primary and secondary sources
Because historians rely on primary and secondary sources to serve as evidence
to support their claims, they need to closely analyze these sources. This analysis
includes investigating what the source does and does not communicate,
determining the argument established by a source, and identifying the evidence the author uses to support that argument.
Skill
Tasks/Questions

Historical Thinking Skill 4: Analyze the context of historical events, developments, or processes
Historical events, developments, and processes do not happen in a vacuum. They
cannot be understood without proper examination within the relevant context.
While students are often taught to focus on comparison, causality, and patterns of
continuity and change over time as ways to look at these events, historical context
also plays a part. Analyzing historical events using context helps students see the big
picture and make the connections they will need to make when developing thoughtful
arguments. These skills guide students through the process of contextual analysis.
Skill
Tasks/Questions
Sample Activity
Instructional
Strategies 4.A Identify and describe a historical context for a specific historical development or process.
§§ What events led up to the one being studied?
§§ What else is happening in Europe or the world at this time?
Have students examine one of William Hogarth’s illustrations on poverty in British cities.
While Hogarth’s message is social, have students view the image through the lens of industrialization and describe how industrialization relates to the scene Hogarth is depicting.
§§ Debriefing §§ Discussion
Group 4.B Explain how a specific historical development or process is situated within a broader historical context.
§§ Ask students to use historical reasoning to explain how an event relates to a broader process.
§§ Consider the evidence through the lens of another historical event or development.
§§ How does the relationship affect the event being studied?
§§ What does the source tell us about the time in which it was created?
§§ Examine the evidence through the lens of another historical event or development.
§§ How can this evidence be used to explain other related historical events?
Have students examine
Lenin’s April Theses in the context of both the Russian
Revolution and World
War I. Extend this discussion to include relating Lenin’s plans to the 19th-century “isms” and the emancipation of the
Russian serfs.

Historical Thinking Skill 5: Using historical reasoning processes (comparison, causation, continuity and change), analyze patterns and connections between and among historical developments and processes
Analyzing patterns and making connections is the bridge between all of the
previous historical thinking skills. This skill pulls everything together and allows
students to connect all concepts. Whether they are using sources or their own
historical knowledge, students will use the historical reasoning processes to identify
and explain patterns and connections between historical events and developments.

Sample Activity
Instructional
Strategies 5.A Identify patterns among or connections between historical developments and processes.
§§ What historical developments or processes are described in this source?
§§ What are the causes of this development or process?
§§ What are the effects of this development or process?
§§ Where does the development or process fit into a pattern of continuity or change over time?
§§ What are the similarities and differences between this development or process and another?
§§ What does the data in a non-text-based source show?
§§ What trends and patterns can you identify from data?
Have students examine a series of visual sources (such as Da Vinci’s The Vitruvian
Man, Albrecht Durer’s
Rhinoceros, Copernicus’s heliocentric model of the universe, and Louis XIV
Visiting the Royal Academy of Sciences) in order to identify and describe a pattern or connection between the
Renaissance and the Scientific

Historical Thinking Skill 6: Develop an argument
Writing claims is often the first argumentation skill that students practice, but claims
are difficult to develop without prompting. Giving students prompts to work with can
help them as they learn this skill. The prompt should establish parameters that require
students to take a position, either by choosing one of two presented alternatives or
by assessing the extent to which a given proposition or scenario is valid.
In order to develop a historically defensible claim, students need to know what
evidence is available to support that claim. You can have students practice
writing claims using just their knowledge as evidence, as they will in the long
essay question. They should also write claims using documents, to practice both
evidence and sourcing (a few at first, then build quantity as students gain skills and
confidence), as they will in the document-based question.
The reasoning processes, discussed in more depth starting on page 231,
will help students develop historical reasoning needed to appropriately connect their evidence to their claims.
There is no simple path to teaching students to develop complex arguments. The
tasks/questions and the sample activities in the table below can serve as a roadmap.
However, students will also need a mastery of the course content, source analysis,
a highly developed understanding of historical context, and the ability to make
connections between and among events to demonstrate this skill. In short, it is the
culminating skill for an AP European History student.
Skill
Tasks/Questions
Sample Activity
Instructional
Strategies 6.A Make a historically defensible claim.
§§ What do you know about the development or processes established in the prompt?
§§ What are your options regarding positions to take?
§§ What historical reasoning process is indicated (or best fits the structure of the essay you plan to write)?
§§ Based on the prompt and the evidence (either provided or from your own knowledge), which position will you take?
§§ State in a few words how you will prove your claim (“because” statement).
Provide students with a practice writing prompt, such as,
Evaluate the extent to which the
Age of Discovery was motivated by political or economic reasons. Have students break down the question into potential positions (Age of Discovery was politically motivated or Age of Discovery was economically motivated, or was motivated by both).
Have them identify a historical reasoning process that best fits the essay that they would go on to develop (such as comparison or causation).
Ask them to think of evidence that would support all of the identified positions. Then ask them to write a defensible claim that establishes a line of reasoning by stating their chosen position and provides a roadmap for how they are going to prove their claim (“because” statement).

Strategies 6.B Support an argument using specific and relevant evidence.
§§ Describe specific examples of historically relevant evidence.
§§ Explain how specific examples of historically relevant evidence support an argument.
§§ Brainstorm relevant evidence that relates to the development or process established in the prompt.
§§ Hone your initial list of evidence by describing specific examples that support the argument.
§§ If practicing a DBQ, evaluate the evidence provided.
§§ Determine whether the evidence supports, refutes, or modifies each of the possible positions.
Provide students with three to four documents* that could be used to support the positions outlined in a sample prompt, such as, Evaluate the extent to which the French Revolution produced a radical change in the lives of nonaristocratic peoples. Ask students to evaluate the evidence using a Venn diagram. They should categorize the evidence in one of three categories:
1) It supports the idea that the
French Revolution brought about a radical change,
2) it supports the idea that it was not as radical, or
3) the evidence could be used to support both positions.
For each piece of evidence, have students write a statement explaining how the evidence supports the position(s).
*You can use this same activity for LEQ practice by asking students to brainstorm relevant evidence instead of providing documents.

§§ If causation is indicated, how does the evidence show a pattern of causes and/or effects?
§§ If continuity or change over time is indicated, identify patterns or developments that indicate it and draw conclusions in support of your claim.
In a practice argumentation essay, have students identify the historical reasoning process indicated in the prompt. Then have them develop and use a graphic organizer (such as a Venn diagram or flow chart) to arrange the evidence in a way that reflects the organizational structure of the historical reasoning process.

Developing the
Reasoning Processes
Reasoning processes describe the cognitive operations
that students will be required to apply when engaging
with historical thinking skills on the AP Exam. The
reasoning processes ultimately represent the way in which historians think.
Student responses on the AP Exam should reflect their
ability to apply a reasoning process that aligns to the
intent of the question. In many cases, guiding students toward a better alignment between the reasoning
process and the task unlocks their understanding and helps them improve their writing.

Section I
PART A: MULTIPLE-CHOICE
The first part of Section I of the AP European History Exam includes 55 multiple-choice
questions typically appearing in sets of three to four questions, each with one or more
stimuli, including primary texts, secondary texts, images (artwork, photos, posters,
cartoons, etc.), charts, or other quantitative data, and maps. Additionally, there will be
at least one set of paired text-based stimuli. Multiple-choice questions require analysis
of the provided stimulus sources and the historical developments and processes described in the sources.
PART B: SHORT-ANSWER
The second part of Section I of the AP Exam also includes three required short-answer
questions. Short-answer question 1 is required and includes a secondary source
stimulus. The topic of the question includes historical developments or processes between the years 1600 and 2001.
Short-answer question 2 is required and includes a primary source stimulus. The topic
of the question includes historical developments or processes between the years 1600 and 2001.
Students may select short-answer question 3 or 4, neither of which includes a
stimulus. Short-answer question 3 focuses on historical developments or processes
between the years 1450 and 1815. Question 4 focuses on historical developments or processes between the years 1815 and 2001.
Section II
DOCUMENT-BASED QUESTION
The document-based question presents students with seven documents offering
various perspectives on a historical development or process. The question requires students to do the following:
§§ Respond to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a line of reasoning.
§§ Describe a broader historical context relevant to the prompt.
§§ Use the provided documents to support an argument in response to the prompt.
§§ Use historical evidence beyond the documents relevant to an argument about the prompt.
§§ For at least three documents, explain how or why the document’s point of view,
purpose, historical situation, and/or audience is relevant to an argument.
§§ Demonstrate a complex understanding of the historical development that is the
focus of the prompt, using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the question.
The topic of the document-based question includes historical developments or processes between the years 1600 and 2001.

How Student Learning Is
Assessed on the AP Exam
The six historical thinking skills are assessed on the AP Exam as detailed below.
Historical
Thinking Skill
Multiple-Choice Questions
Free-Response Questions
Skill 1:
Developments and Processes
Multiple-choice questions assess students’ ability to identify and explain historical developments and processes.
The short-answer questions, document-based question, and long essay question assess students’ ability to identify and explain historical developments and processes.
Skill 2: Sourcing and Situation
Multiple-choice questions assess students’ ability to analyze sourcing and situation of primary and secondary sources.
Students will need to identify and explain the point
of view, purpose, historical situation, and/or audience
of a source, including its significance. Additionally,
students will need to explain how the sourcing and situation might limit the use(s) of a source.
Short-answer questions 1 and/ or 2 assess students’ ability to analyze the sourcing or situation in primary or secondary sources. The document-based question assesses students’ ability to analyze how the point of view, purpose, historical situation, and/or audience is relevant to an argument.
Skill 3: Claims and Evidence in Sources
Multiple-choice questions assess students’ ability to analyze arguments in primary and secondary
sources, including identifying and describing claims
and evidence used. Additionally, students will need to compare arguments and explain how claims or evidence support, modify, or refute a source's argument.
Short-answer questions 1 and/or 2 assess students’ ability to analyze arguments in primary or secondary sources. The document-based question also provides opportunities for students to analyze arguments in primary sources.
Skill 4:
Contextualization
Multiple-choice questions assess students’ ability
to identify and describe a historical context for a
specific historical development or process as well
as explain how a specific development or process is situated within a broader historical context.
The document-based question and long essay question assess students’ ability to describe a broader historical context relevant to the topic of the question. One or two of the short answer questions may also assess this skill.
Skill 5: Making
Connections
Multiple-choice questions assess students’ ability to analyze patterns and connections between and
among historical developments and processes, using historical reasoning processes (e.g., comparison, causation, continuity and change).
The document-based question, long essay question, and one or more of the short-answer questions all assess this skill.
Skill 6:
Argumentation
No multiple-choice questions explicitly assess the argumentation skill.
The document-based question and long essay question assess argumentation.

Sample Exam
Questions
The sample exam questions that follow illustrate the relationship between the course
framework and the AP European History Exam and serve as examples of the types of
questions that appear on the exam. After the sample questions is a table that shows to
which skill and learning objective(s) each question relates. The table also provides the answers to the multiple-choice questions.
Section I
PART A: MULTIPLE-CHOICE
Questions 1–4 refer to the passage below.
“It is not right when some make the simple folk believe that diligent
confession and a worldly gift grants a papal indulgence and that thereby they
can attain the forgiveness of sins. For the clink of the coin that falls into the
money box will not free the sinner of his sins. Forgiveness requires first and
above all else a truly contrite heart. Also, it is beyond doubt that the person
may attain forgiveness of his sins by a true, honest contrition even without all
the indulgences that he can avail himself of. But it is incredible and without
any basis to attain pardon of sins even with papal grace if there is not first
a true, heartfelt contrition over sins. . . . It is also the greatest foolishness to
think sins may be greater than God’s mercy. The mercy of God is without
measure and infinitely great. No one who seeks it will be denied it.”
Johannes von Staupitz, Catholic theologian and dean of the
faculty at the University of Wittenberg, sermon, 1516
1.	 Which of the following best describes the main claim made by von Staupitz in the passage?
(A)	 Church authorities are the best judges of whether someone is truly repentant.

(C)	 Forgiveness of sins depends on repentance, not on a monetary payment.
(D)	Bishops, rather than the pope, should have the power to forgive sins.

Questions 8–11 refer to the passage below.
“Foreign trade can bring great wealth, but it also exposes us to great risks.
The domestic economy of a state is its real treasure. For Spain, foreign trade
has become a great chain binding us to vast overseas territories. Rather than
worry daily about their preservation, we must pay greater attention to those
certain sources of wealth in our domestic economy. We lost Flanders, we
lost Italy, so why could we not lose Mexico and Peru? Little Prussia has given
the world a surprising example of what a medium-sized kingdom can do on its own. . . .
It is necessary to inform the people of the motives for a law, and of the evils
the law seeks to avoid or the benefits it seeks to provide. This is especially
true in monarchies in which the people have no part of legislative authority.
The true measure of good laws is the extent to which they apply equally to
all citizens. Happy is the kingdom whose ruler is governed by the maxims of
justice and who can balance sovereign authority with civil liberty. Happy the
king who realizes that political oppression is bad for the longevity of the state
and that mutual confidence and unity between citizens cannot be established
if the relationship between rulers and the ruled is akin to that between masters and slaves.”
Letter by an anonymous Spanish government official to the
Count of Llerena, Spain's minister of finance, 1789
8.	 The author’s mention of Prussia as an example for Spain most likely refers to which of the following?
(A)	Prussia’s dynastic union with Brandenburg, which was similar to Castile’s dynastic union with Aragon
(B)	 Prussia’s diplomatic maneuvering during the Thirty Years’ War, which had enabled it to expand its territory
(C)	 Prussia’s success in eighteenth-century conflicts such as the Seven Years’
War, which occurred despite its lack of significant overseas colonies
(D)	Prussia’s emergence as an early leader in industrialization among German
states, which resulted in the establishment of the Zollverein
9.	 The author’s statement in the first paragraph concerning Spain’s relationship
with its colonies in the Americas is most likely influenced by which of the following late-eighteenth-century developments?
(A)	The emergence of new economic ideas challenging mercantilist theory and practice
(B)	 The outbreak of armed rebellions in Spanish colonies calling for national independence
(C)	 The formulation of new models of political representation based on the idea of the social contract

Napoleonic Wars of the ideas expressed in the passage?

Questions 12–14 refer to the passage below.
“The single and undisguised object of the League is to put down commercial
monopoly; but that cannot be done by saddling upon our backs a fixed duty
[tax] on imported corn [grain], which means a differential duty on sugar, on
coffee, and monopoly in every other article. The Corn-law is the great tree of
Monopoly, under whose baneful shadow every other restriction exists.
It is no fault of ours if with this agitation should be mixed up with the
question of rents [paid by tenant farmers to large landowners], and should
mingle in a degree that would render it difficult to separate the rights of
property from the claims of those who labour under the grievance of these
intolerable exactions. It is no fault of ours if the nobility of this country
should become as much detested at their own baronial hall doors as were the
noblesse of France previous to the Revolution. We are responsible for none of
these things. The fault lies with those who support monopoly, who are deaf to
reason and justice, and who place themselves upon a pedestal of injustice; a
pedestal which is always liable to fall, and always certain to bring down those who stand upon it.
Free Trade! What is it? Why, breaking down the barriers that separate
nations; those barriers, behind which nestle the feelings of pride, revenge,
hatred, and jealousy, which every now and then burst their bounds, and
deluge whole countries with blood; those feelings which nourish the poison
of war and conquest, which assert that without conquest we can have no
trade, which foster that lust for conquest and dominion which sends forth
your warrior chiefs to scatter devastation through other lands, and then calls
them back only to harass and oppress you at home.”
Richard Cobden, politician and manufacturer, speech to the anti-Corn Law League, 1843
12.	 Based on the passage, Cobden would most likely have been associated with
which of the following nineteenth-century ideologies?
(A)	Liberalism (B)	 Anarchism (C)	 Utopian socialism (D)	Conservatism
13.	 Which of the following conclusions about the economic and political structure
of Great Britain is best supported by the passage?
(A)	Imperial expansion was extremely unpopular among British elites.
(B)	 In spite of parliamentary reforms, radical political revolution was widely supported by the bourgeoisie.
(C)	 Mercantilist economic policies were widely supported by the British working class.
(D)	Despite changes brought about by industrialization, landed elites still retained significant power.

14.	 The eventual adoption of Cobden’s ideas by the British government
contributed most directly to which of the following developments in the late nineteenth century?
(A)	The increase in social tensions between the land-owning aristocracy and other classes in Great Britain (B)	 The growth of a global economic network
(C)	 The increasing incidence of famine due to decreased food production in Great Britain

Questions 15–17 refer to the passage below.
“I have a family of nine, and what did I have before the kolkhoz [collective
farm]? I had all the produce I needed to feed my family, and fuel, and I
clothed and shod them. Had a horse and three head of sheep. Delivered
to the government twenty poods [1 pood = about 36 pounds] of rye, forty
poods of millet, oats, potatoes, and hemp. I have worked on the kolkhoz, I
have honestly earned 355 labor-days, but I no longer eat bread, but husks and
potatoes, we don’t have enough to resole our shoes. My children have turned
black from malnutrition. Respected editors, is there no way to leave the kolkhoz rather than perish here?”

Section II
The following are examples of the kinds of free-response questions found on the exam.
Note that on the actual AP Exam, students will answer one document-based question
and will select one of the three long essay questions to answer.
DOCUMENT-BASED QUESTION
1.	 Evaluate whether the Thirty Years’ War was fought primarily for religious or primarily for political reasons.
In your response you should do the following:
§§ Respond to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a line of reasoning.
§§ Describe a broader historical context relevant to the prompt.
§§ Support an argument in response to the prompt using at least six documents.
§§ Use at least one additional piece of specific historical evidence (beyond that found
in the documents) relevant to an argument about the prompt.
§§ For at least three documents, explain how or why the document’s point of view,
purpose, historical situation, and/or audience is relevant to an argument.
§§ Use evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the prompt.
Document 1
Source: Holy Roman Emperor Matthias, open letter to his Protestant subjects in Bohemia, 1618
It has been alleged that the free exercise of religion will be abolished.
We want to make it clear to you through this open letter that we have no
intention of rescinding the agreement between the religions, still less want
anyone else to do this, despite what others in Bohemia may have said.
Moreover, we have always intended, and still intend, to preserve all the
Bohemian privileges, liberties, and treaties. Anyone who claims otherwise
slanders us before God and the world. Rest assured, dear obedient, loyal, and
true Bohemian subjects, and do not give credence to such falsehoods. We
would like nothing more than to return in person to our royal throne and
residence amongst our loyal and obedient subjects and inhabitants and clear
up these misunderstandings with God’s help. However, we cannot come to
our Bohemian territories at the moment, partly through poor health, but also
pressure of other important affairs. Capable and prominent individuals will
be appointed to clear up this misunderstanding. Since no enemy threatens us
as ruler of Bohemia, there are no constitutional grounds to raise soldiers to
defend the country, and thus no grounds for anyone, whoever, they might be,
to use the territorial privileges, letters of majesty, ordinances, freedoms, or laws to justify arming.

Document 2
Source: Selections from the constitution of the Bohemian Federation, a coalition of nobles and city governments, 1619
Since the Almighty has also given his grace and blessing as this
Confederation is solely in defense of religion, the territories have agreed
that each and every one of their coreligionists should follow a Christian
life according to the Calvinist teaching and faith, avoid and prevent sin,
vice, public trouble, hypocrisy, in whatever form, and follow strictly the
admonishments from the pulpit and the authorities. . . .
All churches in these united territories currently in Calvinist hands are to remain so in perpetuity. . . .
The free exercise of Calvinist religion is extended to every man and
woman in all united territories and towns regardless as to whether they
belong to the king or queen, permitting the construction of churches,
schools, and cemeteries, and the appointment of Calvinist pastors and
schoolteachers. Everyone shall be allowed to follow the old ceremonies
of their Christian conscience in their own church. However, to ensure
better unity and to prevent all kinds of difficulties and bitterness, there are
to be no insults or personal attacks from the pulpit upon pain of removal from office. . . .
Should, contrary to hope, a king attempt anything contravening the religious
concessions, unions, and this constitution, and thereby force the territories to
take defensive measures, then all of these united kingdoms and provinces are
released from their duty and cannot be subsequently held to account for any insults to the royal sovereignty and majesty.
Document 3
Source: Bernhard Baumann, Jesuit official in Heidelberg, report to Elector
Maximilian of Bavaria on efforts to re-Catholicize previously Protestant
areas after the Catholic victory in that region, 1628
Four hundred in the town and 1,200 outside it have been freed from heresy;
on feast days we get around 700 communicants in the Church of the Holy
Spirit. We alone look after parish duties, visit the sick and converts daily,
conduct catechism inside the town and outside, and deliver two sermons
on Sundays. These crowds are gathered with great difficulty; since only six
months ago the richer townspeople were so obstinate, that two or three
hundred declared they would emigrate if they were forced to convert. Then
entire districts (they had arranged this in advance) declared they would
keep the faith of their ancestors, because we could not steal this like other
possessions. Since the orders arrived from Munich [to intensify Catholic
conversions] they have used unbelievable deceptions to try to circumvent
these. Furthermore, they complain to the Holy Roman Emperor, but the
secular government, to its undying credit, knew how to stop this.

Document 4
Source: Letter from Gustavus Adolphus, king of Sweden, to the Protestant elector of Brandenburg, 1630
I have come into this land for no other purpose than to free it from the
thieves and robbers who have so plagued it, and, first and foremost, to help
his Excellency [the elector] out of his difficulties. Does his Excellency then
not know that the [Holy Roman] emperor and his followers do not mean to
rest till the Protestant religion is wholly rooted out of the empire, and that
his Excellency has nothing else to expect than being forced either to deny his
religion or to leave his country? Does he think by prayers and pleas and such
like means to obtain something different? . . . I seek not my own advantage
in this war, nor any gain save the security of my kingdom; I can look for
nothing but expense, hard work, trouble, and danger to life and limb.
I tell you plainly that I will know nor hear nothing of “neutrality”; his
Excellency must be either friend or foe. When I reach his frontier he must
declare himself either hot or cold. The fight is between God and the devil. If
his Excellency is on God’s side, let him stand by me; if he holds rather with
the devil, then he must fight with me; there is no third course, that is certain.
Document 5
Source: Confidential account of a meeting between Axel Oxenstierna,
Swedish high chancellor, and Sweden’s ally Brandenburg after the death of Gustavus Adolphus, 1633
Concerning the late Gustavus Adolphus’ intentions:
They were, in general, to disrupt the plans of the enemy, whose intentions
with regards to the Baltic Sea are sufficiently well-known. His Majesty
therefore intended to ensure the safety of his kingdom and the Baltic region,
and liberate the oppressed lands [of Germany]; and thereafter to proceed
according as events might develop: it was no part of his original intention to
march as far into Germany as he did. He saw and clearly understood where
that would lead, but the enemy and the circumstances compelled this. His
majesty was there in person wherever the greatest danger was.

Document 7
Source: Pope Innocent X, papal declaration in response to the treaty of Westphalia, 1648
Consumed by zeal for the house of the Lord, we endeavor everywhere to
maintain the integrity and the authority of the Catholic Church, so that
the ecclesiastical rights of which we have been appointed guardian by our
Savior shall not in any way be impaired by those who seek their own interest
rather than God’s, and that we may not be accused of negligence when we
shall render account to God. Accordingly it is not without deep pain that we
have learned that by several articles in the peace concluded at [Westphalia],
between our very dear son in Christ, Ferdinand, king of the Romans and
emperor elect, on the one hand, and the Swedes, as well as our very dear son
in Jesus Christ, Louis, the very Christian king of the French, on the other,
great prejudice has been done to the Catholic religion, the divine service, the
Roman apostolic see, the ecclesiastical order, their jurisdictions, authority,
immunities, liberties, exemptions, privileges, possessions, and rights. . .
Accordingly we assert and declare that all the articles in the treaty which in
any way impair . . . the Catholic religion, divine worship, or the salvation
of souls . . . . have been, and are of right, and shall perpetually be, null and void . . . even when they be ratified by oath.

Scoring Criteria
Decision Rules
A.  THESIS/CLAIM (0–1 pt) 1 pt.
Responds to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis/claim that establishes a line of reasoning.
To earn this point, the thesis must make a claim that responds to the prompt rather than restating or rephrasing the prompt. The thesis must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion.
B.  CONTEXTUALIZATION (0–1 pt) 1 pt.
Describes a broader historical context relevant to the prompt.
To earn this point, the response must relate the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that occur before, during, or continue after the time frame of the question. This point is not awarded for merely a phrase or reference.

AP History Rubrics
Introductory notes:
§§ Except where otherwise noted, each point of the rubric is earned independently.
For instance, a student could earn a point for evidence beyond the documents without earning a point for thesis/claim.
§§ Accuracy: The components of this rubric each require that students demonstrate
historically defensible content knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, a
response may contain errors that do not detract from its overall quality, as long as
the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate.
§§ Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain
grammatical errors. Those errors will not be counted against a student unless
they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and reasoning processes described in the rubrics.

Document-Based Question
1.	 Evaluate whether the Thirty Years’ War was fought primarily for religious or primarily for political reasons.
In your response you should do the following:
§§ Respond to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis or claim that establishes a line of reasoning.
§§ Describe a broader historical context relevant to the prompt.
§§ Support an argument in response to the prompt using at least six documents.
§§ Use at least one additional piece of specific historical evidence (beyond that found in the documents) relevant to an argument about the prompt.

Document 1
Source: Holy Roman Emperor Matthias, open letter to his Protestant subjects in Bohemia, 1618
It has been alleged that the free exercise of religion will be abolished. We want to make it clear to you through this
open letter that we have no intention of rescinding the agreement between the religions, still less want anyone else
to do this, despite what others in Bohemia may have said. Moreover, we have always intended, and still intend, to
preserve all the Bohemian privileges, liberties, and treaties. Anyone who claims otherwise slanders us before God
and the world. Rest assured, dear obedient, loyal, and true Bohemian subjects, and do not give credence to such
falsehoods. We would like nothing more than to return in person to our royal throne and residence amongst our
loyal and obedient subjects and inhabitants and clear up these misunderstandings with God’s help. However, we
cannot come to our Bohemian territories at the moment, partly through poor health, but also pressure of other
important affairs. Capable and prominent individuals will be appointed to clear up this misunderstanding. Since
no enemy threatens us as ruler of Bohemia, there are no constitutional grounds to raise soldiers to defend the
country, and thus no grounds for anyone, whoever, they might be, to use the territorial privileges, letters of majesty, ordinances, freedoms, or laws to justify arming.

Document 2
Source: Selections from the constitution of the Bohemian Federation, a coalition of nobles and city governments, 1619
Since the Almighty has also given his grace and blessing as this Confederation is solely in defense of religion, the
territories have agreed that each and every one of their coreligionists should follow a Christian life according to the
Calvinist teaching and faith, avoid and prevent sin, vice, public trouble, hypocrisy, in whatever form, and follow
strictly the admonishments from the pulpit and the authorities. . . .
All churches in these united territories currently in Calvinist hands are to remain so in perpetuity. . . .
The free exercise of Calvinist religion is extended to every man and woman in all united territories and towns
regardless as to whether they belong to the king or queen, permitting the construction of churches, schools,
and cemeteries, and the appointment of Calvinist pastors and schoolteachers. Everyone shall be allowed to
follow the old ceremonies of their Christian conscience in their own church. However, to ensure better unity
and to prevent all kinds of difficulties and bitterness, there are to be no insults or personal attacks from the pulpit upon pain of removal from office. . . .
Should, contrary to hope, a king attempt anything contravening the religious concessions, unions, and this
constitution, and thereby force the territories to take defensive measures, then all of these united kingdoms and
provinces are released from their duty and cannot be subsequently held to account for any insults to the royal sovereignty and majesty.
Document 3
Source: Bernhard Baumann, Jesuit official in Heidelberg, report to Elector Maximilian of Bavaria on efforts to re-
Catholicize previously Protestant areas after the Catholic victory in that region, 1628
Four hundred in the town and 1,200 outside it have been freed from heresy; on feast days we get around 700
communicants in the Church of the Holy Spirit. We alone look after parish duties, visit the sick and converts
daily, conduct catechism inside the town and outside, and deliver two sermons on Sundays. These crowds are
gathered with great difficulty; since only six months ago the richer townspeople were so obstinate, that two or three
hundred declared they would emigrate if they were forced to convert. Then entire districts (they had arranged
this in advance) declared they would keep the faith of their ancestors, because we could not steal this like other
possessions. Since the orders arrived from Munich [to intensify Catholic conversions] they have used unbelievable
deceptions to try to circumvent these. Furthermore, they complain to the Holy Roman Emperor, but the secular
government, to its undying credit, knew how to stop this.

Document 4
Source: Letter from Gustavus Adolphus, king of Sweden, to the Protestant elector of Brandenburg, 1630
I have come into this land for no other purpose than to free it from the thieves and robbers who have so plagued it,
and, first and foremost, to help his Excellency [the elector] out of his difficulties. Does his Excellency then not know
that the [Holy Roman] emperor and his followers do not mean to rest till the Protestant religion is wholly rooted out
of the empire, and that his Excellency has nothing else to expect than being forced either to deny his religion or to
leave his country? Does he think by prayers and pleas and such like means to obtain something different? . . . I seek
not my own advantage in this war, nor any gain save the security of my kingdom; I can look for nothing but expense, hard work, trouble, and danger to life and limb.
I tell you plainly that I will know nor hear nothing of “neutrality”; his Excellency must be either friend or foe. When I
reach his frontier he must declare himself either hot or cold. The fight is between God and the devil. If his Excellency
is on God’s side, let him stand by me; if he holds rather with the devil, then he must fight with me; there is no third course, that is certain.
Document 5
Source: Confidential account of a meeting between Axel Oxenstierna, Swedish high chancellor, and Sweden’s ally
Brandenburg after the death of Gustavus Adolphus, 1633
Concerning the late Gustavus Adolphus’ intentions:
They were, in general, to disrupt the plans of the enemy, whose intentions with regards to the Baltic Sea are
sufficiently well-known. His Majesty therefore intended to ensure the safety of his kingdom and the Baltic region,
and liberate the oppressed lands [of Germany]; and thereafter to proceed according as events might develop: it was
no part of his original intention to march as far into Germany as he did. He saw and clearly understood where that
would lead, but the enemy and the circumstances compelled this. His majesty was there in person wherever the greatest danger was.

Source: Pope Innocent X, papal declaration in response to the treaty of Westphalia, 1648
Consumed by zeal for the house of the Lord, we endeavor everywhere to maintain the integrity and the authority of
the Catholic Church, so that the ecclesiastical rights of which we have been appointed guardian by our Savior shall
not in any way be impaired by those who seek their own interest rather than God’s, and that we may not be accused
of negligence when we shall render account to God. Accordingly it is not without deep pain that we have learned
that by several articles in the peace concluded at [Westphalia], between our very dear son in Christ, Ferdinand, king
of the Romans and emperor elect, on the one hand, and the Swedes, as well as our very dear son in Jesus Christ,
Louis, the very Christian king of the French, on the other, great prejudice has been done to the Catholic religion, the
divine service, the Roman apostolic see, the ecclesiastical order, their jurisdictions, authority, immunities, liberties,
exemptions, privileges, possessions, and rights. . .
Accordingly we assert and declare that all the articles in the treaty which in any way impair . . . the Catholic religion,
divine worship, or the salvation of souls . . . . have been, and are of right, and shall perpetually be, null and void . . .
even when they be ratified by oath.

6.A 0 points 1 point
Responds to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis/claim that establishes a line of reasoning
Decision Rules and Scoring Notes
Responses that do not earn this point:
•	 The intended thesis or claim only restates or rephrases the prompt
•	 The intended thesis or claim does not respond to the prompt
•	 The intended thesis or claim offers no indication of a line of reasoning
•	 The intended thesis or claim is overgeneralized
Responses that earn this point:
•	 The response must provide a historically defensible thesis or claim that

fought for religious or political reasons. The thesis or claim must either
provide some indication of the reason for making that claim OR by establishing categories of the argument
Examples that do not earn this point:
Do not establish a line of reasoning, although the claim is historically defensible
•	 “The Thirty Years’ War was fought for political but primarily religious reasons”
•	 “The Thirty Years’ War was fought for religious and for political reasons.
It is hard to determine the most significant because the two go together hand in hand”
Examples that earn this point:
Establish a line of reasoning that evaluates the topic of the prompt with analytic categories
•	 “While the Thirty Years’ War was religious in that it was fought to protect
the freedom of religion throughout the Holy Roman Empire, it was also
political in that it was used to strategically help certain powers protect themselves and stay prominent”
•	 “The Thirty Years’ War was fought overwhelmingly for religious purposes,
with countries being drawn into war to defend the sanctity of one religion
or another, and always divided Catholics and Protestants”
Establish a line of reasoning
•	 “The Thirty Years’ War was primarily fought over religion and all stemmed
from a little squabble in Bohemia.” (Minimally acceptable thesis/claim)
Additional Notes:
•	 The thesis or claim must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion (which may not be limited to the first or last paragraphs)

Responses that do not earn this point:
•	 Provide an overgeneralized statement about the time period referenced in the prompt
•	 Provide context that is not relevant to the prompt •	 Provide a passing phase or reference
Responses that earn this point:
•	 Must accurately describe a context relevant to whether the Thirty Years’
War was fought for primarily political or religious reasons
Examples of unacceptable contextualization that do not earn
this point:
Do not provide context relevant to the topic of the prompt
•	 “The Thirty Years’ War sparked large amounts of disruption in Europe
and it involved primarily the French Huguenots and the Holy Roman
Empire (Catholics) but other European countries were involved”
Examples of relevant context that earn this point include the following, if appropriate elaboration is provided:
•	 Earlier Protestant-Catholic conflicts •	 Protestant and Catholic Reformations •	 Habsburg vs. French dynastic rivalries •	 Religious conflict in England •	 The Peace of Augsburg •	 The Edict of Nantes •	 Jesuits and the Catholic Reformation •	 Fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire •	 Huguenots and French wars of religion •	 Emergence of Lutheranism and Calvinism •	 Increasing power of monarchies •	 Defenestration of Prague
Examples of acceptable contextualization:
•	 Prior to the Thirty Years’ War period, Luther had been spreading his
ideas of Protestantism and individual interpretation of the Bible. As a
result European states were divided without the Catholic Church holding
them together. The religious tension, primarily between the Holy Roman
Empire and France, marked the period prior to the Thirty Years’ War”
•	 “During the Thirty Years’ War the Peace of Augsburg was taken away. In
the Peace of Augsburg it states that he leader of the country can choose
to have a Protestant or Catholic country. This was taking away people’s
freedom and religious toleration … Cardinal Richelieu from France did not
like the idea of Huguenots gaining power because they were Protestant”
Additional Notes:
•	 The response must relate the topic of the prompt to broader historical events, developments, or processes that occur before, during, or continue after the time frame of the question
•	 To earn this point, the context provided must be more than a phrase or reference

Responses that earn 2 points:
•
Support an argument in response to the prompt by
accurately using the content of at least six documents •
The six documents do not have to be used in support
of a single argument, but they can be used across sub arguments or to address counterarguments
Examples of describing the content of a document:
Describe evidence from the documents relevant to
the topic but do not use that evidence to support an argument •
(Document 6): “In 1640 the Thirty Years War had reached the ‘French Phase’. This phase was known as one of the bloodiest phases to exist. Jean
Gagniere paints Richelieu carefully removing the
French Calvinists (Huguenots) from France. Gagniere paints Catholic Austria and Spain as chained back but vicious” •
(Document 7): “In Doc 7 is the signing of the Treaty
of Westphalia which is known to be the signing that
ended religious conflicts. Pope Innocent X responds
on how the authority of the Catholic church should
not prevent you from seeking other interests other than God”
Examples of supporting an argument using the content of a document:
•
(Document 1): “The Holy Roman Emperor attempted to
convince others that he wasn’t motivated to start war
because of religion, since he doesn’t plan on altering
religious policies. However this is wholly untrue since the
Holy Roman Emperor continues to be a Catholic power.”
(Connects the contents of document 1 to an argument
about real vs. asserted motivations for the Thirty Years’
War) •
(Document 4): “However the war was in fact religiously
motivated. In a letter from Gustavus Adolphus to the
elector of Brandenburg, Adolphus declares that the HR
Emperor only wants to root out the Protestant religion.”
(Describes and connects the content of document 4 to an
argument about the strong religious motivations for the
Thirty Years’ War) •
In a paragraph arguing for political motivations, Holy
Roman Emperor Matthias (Document 1) is referenced as seeking to regain his throne in Bohemia and to
dilute tensions there, while Swedish King Adolphus
(Document 4) is used in reference to his intent to keep
a lasting peace in the Baltic region, and, finally, Swedish
Chancellor Oxenstierna (Document 5) is used as
evidence in reference to Swedish political motivations
for entering the war. (Describes and connects the content
of the documents to an argument about the complicated political motivations for the Thirty Years’ War) continued on next page

window in the infamous Defenestration of Prague.” (Uses a piece of evidence
beyond the documents that describes motivations for different groups’ involvement in the war)
•	 “Richelieu was responsible for convincing King Louis to enter the war, seeing it
as a way to extend French power. Richelieu’s ambitions were successful, as the
war severely weakened the Holy Roman Empire, and cemented France as the
dominant European power.” (Uses a piece of evidence beyond the documents that
addresses Richelieu’s motivations for involving France in the Thirty Years War)

high. As a Jesuit, Baumann was a militant Catholic and held great disdain for
Protestants.” (Identifies the POV of the author and relates this to an argument about religious motivations for the war)
Example of acceptable explanation of the relevance of the historical situation
of a source:
•	 (Document 7): “Document 7 is an excerpt from Pope Innocent 10th denouncing all
articles of religious freedom as noted in the Treaty of Westphalia. The Pope was
not allowed to partake in the Westphalia agreement which signified a continent wide severing of the relationship between church and state. For this reason, Pope
Innocent’s identity and historical situation in the balance of power at that time
adds significance to his outraged and saddened tone in the response.” (Identifies
the historical situation of the engraving and connects this to an argument about the
complex motivations for involvement in the Thirty Years War)
Example of acceptable explanation of the significance of the audience:
•	 (Document 5): “As a confidential account, doc. 5 likely offers an honest telling of
Adolphus’ motives and reveals that there were indeed political motives behind
Adolphus’ actions.” (Connects information about the audience of the declaration to

Complexity 0 points 1 point
Demonstrates a complex understanding of the historical development that is the focus of the prompt, using evidence to
corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the question
Decision Rules and Scoring Notes
Responses that earn this point:
May demonstrate a complex understanding in a variety of ways, such as:
•	 Explaining nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables
•	 Explaining both similarity and difference, or explaining both continuity and change, or explaining multiple causes, or explaining both causes and effects
•	 Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across periods
•	 Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives across themes
•	 Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence
Demonstrating complex understanding might include any of the following, if appropriate elaboration is provided:
•	 Acknowledging that Cardinal Richelieu in Document 6 is achieving political gains and using religion as an excuse. As a politique
he is willing to disregard his religious beliefs in favor of the state. He is killing two birds with one stone by removing Huguenots
and increasing unity in France. Along with Adolphus, these leaders are extending the security of their states and increasing their
power. This demonstrates how a ruler can use religious and political motivations to achieve their goal of increasing the power of
the state, and therefore an understanding of broader historical developments behind the document. (Explains nuance)
•	 Discussing both religious and political reasons but making a clear chronological demarcation between the two. The transition
is based on the intervention of France and Sweden into the conflict. The response uses Document 1 (Emperor is trying
to comfort and pacify the agitation) and Document 2 (Bohemia’s response …defending its right to practice Calvinism).
A discussion of religious reasons is followed by an analysis of Documents 4, 5, and 6 discussing Adolphus and France’s
intervention into the war. This develops the argument that the aims of Sweden and France changed the complexity of the war
from religiously to politically motivated actions. (Explains nuance through multiple variables)
•	 Establishing the argument that the true purpose of the Thirty Years’ War was the gain of power. Document 1 is used to explain
how Matthias tries to avoid alienating Protestants by allowing the free practice of religion, but in reality this is a façade to
protect his own power by deterring the Bohemians from taking up arms. The response then corroborates this line of reasoning
by suggesting that the coalition of Calvinist nobles and cities is deceptive in that its actual motivation is political rather than
being based on religious freedom. This confirms the validity of the argument by showing the use of religion as a pretext for
political motives from the differing perspective of a Catholic and a Protestant ruler. (Corroborates, qualifies or modifies an
argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence)
•	 Supporting an argument that the Thirty Years’ War can be connected to the Spanish Inquisition, the response uses Document
6 to contrast the relatively placid way that Richelieu removed Protestants from France with the violent way in which Philip
forced the exodus of Spanish Jews who would not convert. The response continues by noting that Richelieu’s approach is less
violent than the treatment Huguenots could expect in Spain or Austria. (Explains relevant and insightful connections)
Additional Notes:
•	 This demonstration of complex understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference

General Scoring Notes
•	 Except where otherwise noted, each point of these rubrics is earned independently; for example, a student could earn
a point for evidence without earning a point for thesis/claim.
•	 Accuracy: The components of these rubrics require that students demonstrate historically defensible content
knowledge. Given the timed nature of the exam, essays may contain errors that do not detract from their overall quality,
as long as the historical content used to advance the argument is accurate.
•	 Clarity: Exam essays should be considered first drafts and thus may contain grammatical errors. Those errors will not
be counted against a student unless they obscure the successful demonstration of the content knowledge, skills, and reasoning processes described below.

Thesis/Claim (0-1 points)
6.A 0 points 1 point
Responds to the prompt with a historically defensible thesis/claim that establishes a line of reasoning
Decision Rules and Scoring Notes
Responses that do not earn this point:
•
The intended thesis or claim is not historically defensible •
The intended thesis or claim only restates or rephrases the prompt •
The intended thesis or claim does not respond to the prompt.
•
The intended thesis or claim offers no indication of a line of reasoning •
The intended thesis or claim is overgeneralized
Responses that earn this point:
•
The response must provide a historically defensible thesis or claim about the most significant
long-term effect during the period 1815 to 1900 of the French Revolution. The thesis or claim
must either provide some indication of the reasoning for making that claim OR by establishing analytic categories of the argument
Examples that do not earn this point:
Do not provide a historically defensible thesis/claim •
“The most significant effect of the French Revolution was to
improve the lives of Europeans by giving them political rights”
Do not focus on the topic of the prompt •
“The most significant effect of the French Revolution was to
give Napoleon the opportunity to come to power in France and attempt to conquer Europe”
Do not establish a line of reasoning, although the claim is historically defensible:
•
“The French Revolution had many effects all over Europe”
Restate the prompt or are overgeneralized •
“The French Revolution had significant effects around the world”
Examples that earn this point:
Establish a line of reasoning that evaluates the topic of the prompt •
“Although the French Revolution failed to establish a lasting democratic government in the short term, it had a significant long-term effect on the politics of post-Revolutionary Europe because it
set up republican government as a legitimate and attainable goal for future revolutionaries”
Establish a line of reasoning that evaluates the topic of the prompt with analytic categories •
“The most important long-term effect of the French Revolution was to encourage Europe’s
political elite to attempt to prevent future revolutions. Sometimes this was done through
repression, but increasingly, leaders sought to get ahead of revolutionary demands” •
“The most significant long-term effect of the French Revolution was its failure to destroy the
monarchical model of government. Although many of the goals of the Revolution would later be
realized in different countries of Europe during the 1800s, this would generally happen under the direction of kings and emperors”
Establish a line of reasoning •
“After 1815, the most important effect of the French Revolution was to inspire other revolutions
with similar goals such as the Revolutions of 1848.” (Minimally acceptable thesis/claim)
Additional Notes:
•
The thesis or claim must consist of one or more sentences located in one place, either in the introduction or the conclusion (which may not be limited to the first or last paragraphs) •
The thesis or claim must identify a relevant development(s) in the period, although it is not required to encompass the entire period

Supports an argument in response to the prompt using specific and relevant examples of evidence
Decision Rules and Scoring Notes
Responses that do not earn
points:
•
Identify a single piece of evidence •
Provide evidence that is not relevant to the topic of the prompt •
Provide evidence that is outside the time period specified in the prompt •
Repeat information that is provided in the prompt
Responses that earn 1 point:
•
Must identify at least two specific historical examples
relevant to the topic of the long-term effects of the French
Revolution in the period 1815 to 1900
Responses that earn 2 points:
•
Must use at least two specific historical evidence examples to
support an argument regarding the most important long-term effect of the French Revolution
Example of a statement that does not earn any points for
evidence:
Provides evidence that is outside the time period • “The French Revolution caused major changes, including abandonment of religion, major changes to class structure, and the rise of Napoleon” (Uses historical reasoning by identifying cause and effect, but addresses issues that are outside the time frame clearly indicated by the prompt.)
Examples of evidence that are specific and relevant include the following (2 examples required):
•
Revolutions of 1848 •
Expansion of voting rights in France and Britain •
Romantic portrayals of the Revolution in nineteenth century art and literature •
Metternich and the Concert of Europe •
German student societies •
Romantic imagery of the French Revolution •
Expansion of voting rights in Britain (Chartist movement) •
Garibaldi’s “red-shirts” and attempts to unify Italy •
Revolution of 1830 in France and the July Monarchy •
Greek War of Independence •
Frankfurt Parliament and Constitution (1848) •
Revolution of 1848 in France and the Second Republic •
Napoleon III and the Second Empire •
Bismarck and universal male suffrage in Germany •
Third Republic in France •
Liberal-conservative conflicts in Spain (Carlist wars)
Example of a statement that earns 1 point for evidence:
•
“The French people eventually overthrew the restored
Bourbon monarchy in 1830 and created a constitutional
monarchy, which was followed less than twenty years later
in 1848 by another overthrow of the existing government that established the Second Republic”
Examples that successfully support an argument with evidence:
•
“Revolutionary nationalists in 1848 seeking to unify Italy
and Germany supported the ideals of liberty and universal
citizenship that had first appeared in France during the
Revolution.” (Functions as part of an argument supporting the
thesis that increased nationalism was the most significant effect of the French Revolution) •
“Metternich and other European leaders after the Congress
of Vienna tried to suppress future revolutions by employing
censorship and secret police. This shows the fear that the ideas
of the French Revolution continued to inspire.” (Offers a specific
piece of evidence and explicitly links it to an argument about the continuing effect of the French Revolution) •
“Many nineteenth century revolutionaries were inspired by the
French Revolution. . . In Italy, Garibaldi’s movement used French
Revolutionary slogans and symbols such as the tricolor flag.”
(Presents a topic sentence making a general statement about
the ongoing influence of the French Revolution followed by a statement in the same paragraph about Garibaldi) •
“Conservative rulers in the later 1800s could not completely
ignore the demands for political rights that had begun during
the French Revolution. Both Napoleon III’s Second Empire and
the new German Empire under Bismarck’s leadership gave many
people the right to vote, although neither was truly democratic.”
(Uses two specific pieces of evidence to support a generalization
about a continuing influence of the revolution on European
political systems in the later nineteenth century) continued on next page

Row C (continued)
Additional Notes:
•
Typically, statements credited as evidence will be more specific than statements credited as contextualization.
•
If a response has a multipart argument it can meet the threshold of two pieces of evidence by giving one example for one part of the argument and another example for
a different part of the argument, but the total number of examples must still be at least two.

(For example, the Congress of Vienna represented a return to conservatism as a response to the French Revolution’s radical threat; the ideals of the French Revolution
could not be quelled, eventually serving as part of the inspiration for further 19th century revolutions in Europe and abroad).

evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument that addresses the question
Decision Rules and Scoring Notes
Responses that do
not earn points:
•
May include evidence but offer no reasoning to connect the evidence to an argument •
May assert the use of historical reasoning but does not use it to frame or structure an argument
Responses that earn 1 point:
•
Must demonstrate the use of historical reasoning to frame or structure an
argument that addresses the most significant long-term effect of the French
Revolution, although the reasoning may be uneven, limited or imbalanced
Responses that earn 2 points:
May demonstrate a complex understanding in a variety
of ways, such as:
•
Explaining nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables •
Explaining both similarity and difference, or explaining
both continuity and change, or explaining multiple causes, or explaining both causes and effects •
Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and across periods •
Confirming the validity of an argument by corroborating multiple perspectives across themes •
Qualifying or modifying an argument by considering diverse or alternative views or evidence
Example of unacceptable use of historical
reasoning:
Provides evidence, but offers no reasoning to connect the evidence to an argument •
There were many different effects of the French
Revolution which included increased rights, changes to the government, and changes to society
Using a historical thinking skill to frame or structure an argument could
include:
•
Using causal reasoning to explain nineteenth-century reactions to aspects of the French Revolution •
Structuring an argument thematically to consider different subcategories of effects of the French Revolution •
Structuring an argument logically to consider the merits of alternative possibilities as the most important effect •
Arranging an argument as a chronological narrative of developments over the course of the nineteenth century
Example of acceptable use of historical reasoning •
“The French Revolution led to a conservative reaction and then to subsequent
attempts to restore political stability through military and social efforts.” (Identifies
reactions caused by the French Revolution that considered significant effects.) •
“Nationalist unification movements in a number of European regions in the
middle of the 19th century were inspired by the ideals of the French Revolution,
and through their own successes sparked further nationalist and independence
movements over time.”  (Identifies both causation and references change over
time in the discussion of significant effects of the French Revolution)
Demonstrating complex understanding
might include any of the following, if appropriate elaboration is provided:
•
Explaining different effects of the French Revolution in different regions of Europe. (Explains nuance, multiple variables) •
Explaining changes in the effects of the French
Revolution over the course of the nineteenth century.
(Provides insightful connections with and across periods) •
Considering political and cultural effects of the
Revolution. (Confirms the validity of an argument by
corroborating multiple perspectives across themes) •
Evaluating whether the democratic ideals of the Revolution had more or less impact than its
nationalistic aspects had. (Qualifies or modifies an argument)
Additional Notes:
•
This demonstration of complex understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference
