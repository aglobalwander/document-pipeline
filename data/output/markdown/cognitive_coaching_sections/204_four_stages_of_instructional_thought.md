## FOUR STAGES OF INSTRUCTIONAL THOUGHT

When we compare the research on human information processing with research on teacher cognition, we are struck by the natural similarities. Planning (preactive) consists of all the intellectual functions performed before instruction. Teaching (interactive) includes the multiple decisions made during teaching. Analyzing and evaluating (reflective) consists of all

those mental processes used to reflect, reconstruct, explain, interpret, find patterns, and judge instruction. Finally, applying (projective) abstracts from the experience synthesizes new generalizations, and carries them to future situations (Clark and Peterson 1986).
