APPENDIX J – Science, Technology, Society and the Environment
The goal that all students should learn about the relationships among science, technology, and
society (known by the acronym STS) came to prominence in the United Kingdom and the United
States in the early 1980s.  The individual most closely associated with this movement is Dr.
Robert Yaeger, who has written extensively on the topic (e.g. Yaeger 1996). A study of state
standards (Koehler et al. 2007) has shown that STS became common in state science education
standards during the first decade of the millennium, with an increasing focus on environmental
issues. Consequently, the core ideas that relate science and technology to society and the natural
environment in Chapter 8 of A Framework for K-12 Science Education (NRC, 2012) are
consistent with efforts in science education for the past three decades.

In the Framework
The Framework specifies two core ideas that relate science, technology, society and the
environment: the interdependence of science, engineering and technology, and the influence of
science, engineering and technology on society and the natural world.
The Interdependence of Science, Engineering, and Technology
The first core idea is that scientific inquiry, engineering design, and technological development
are interdependent:
The fields of science and engineering are mutually supportive, and scientists and
engineers often work together in teams, especially in fields at the borders of science and
engineering. Advances in science offer new capabilities, new materials, or new
understanding of processes that can be applied through engineering to produce advances
in technology. Advances in technology, in turn, provide scientists with new capabilities to
probe the natural world at larger or smaller scales; to record, manage, and analyze
data; and to model ever more complex systems with greater precision. In addition,
engineers’ efforts to develop or improve technologies often raise new questions for scientists’ investigations. (NRC, 2012, p. 203)
The interdependence of science—with its resulting discoveries and principles—and
engineering—with its resulting technologies—includes a number of ideas about how the fields of
science and engineering interrelate.  One is the idea that scientific discoveries enable engineers
to do their work. For example, the discoveries of early explorers of electricity have enabled
engineers to create a world linked by vast power grids that illuminate cities, enable
communications, and accomplish thousands of other tasks. Engineering accomplishments also
enable the work of scientists.  For example, the development of the Hubble Space Telescope and
very sensitive light sensors have made it possible for astronomers to discover our place in the
universe, noticing previously unobserved planets and getting even further insight into the origin of stars and galaxies.
The vision projected by the Framework is that science and engineering continuously interact and
move each other forward, as expressed in the following statement:

New insights from science often catalyze the emergence of new technologies and
their applications, which are developed using engineering design. In turn, new
technologies open opportunities for new scientific investigations. (NRC, p. 210)
This reflects the key roles both science and engineering play in driving each other forward in the research and development (R&D) cycle.
The Influence of Engineering, Technology, and Science on Society and the Natural World
The second core idea focuses on the more traditional STS theme, that scientific and
technological advances can have a profound effect on society and the environment.
Together, advances in science, engineering, and technology can have—and indeed have
had—profound effects on human society, in such areas as agriculture, transportation,
health care, and communication, and on the natural environment. Each system can
change significantly when new technologies are introduced, with both desired effects and unexpected outcomes. (NRC, 2012, p. 210).

This idea has two complementary parts.  The first is that scientific discoveries and technological
decisions affect human society and the natural environment.  The second is that people make
decisions for social and environmental reasons that ultimately guide the work of scientists and engineers. As expressed in the Framework:
From the earliest forms of agriculture to the latest technologies, all human activity has
drawn on natural resources and has had both short- and long-term consequences,
positive as well negative, for the health of both people and the natural environment.
These consequences have grown stronger in recent human history. Society has changed
dramatically, and human populations and longevity have increased, as advances in
science and engineering have influenced the ways in which people interact with one
another and with their surrounding natural environment.
Not only do science and engineering affect society; society’s decisions (whether made
through market forces or political processes) influence the work of scientists and
engineers. These decisions sometimes establish goals and priorities for improving or
replacing technologies; at other times they set limits, such as in regulating the extraction
of raw materials or in setting allowable levels of pollution from mining, farming, and industry. (NRC, 2012, p. 212)
The first paragraph above refers to the central role that technological changes have had on
society and the natural environment. For example, the development of new systems for growing,
processing, and distributing food made possible the transition from widely dispersed hunter gatherer groups to villages and eventually cities. While that change took place over thousands of
years, in just the past generation we have seen vast growth in the size of cities along with the
establishment of new global communications and trade networks. In 1960 the world population
was 3 billion.  Today it is more than 6 billion, and thanks to advances in medicine and public
health, people are living longer. Additionally, the growth of industrialization around the world
has increased the rate at which natural resources are being extracted, well beyond what might be
expected from a doubling of world population alone.

The second paragraph emphasizes the limits to growth imposed by human society and by the
environment, which has limited supplies of certain non-renewable resources. Together, these
paragraphs point the way to new science education standards that will help today’s children
prepare for a world in which technological change, and the consequent impact on society and natural resources, will continue to accelerate.
Home and Community Connections to School Science for Student Diversity
While it has long been recognized that building home-school connections is important for the
academic success of non-dominant student groups, in practice, this is rarely done in an effective
manner. There is a perceived disconnect between the science practices taught in schools and the
science supported in the homes and communities of non-dominant student groups. Recent
research has identified resources and strengths in the family and home environments of non dominant student groups (National Research Council, 2009). Students bring to the science
classroom “funds of knowledge” that can serve as resources for academic learning when teachers
find ways to validate and activate this prior knowledge (González, Moll, & Amanti, 2005).
Several approaches build connections between home/community and school science: (1)
increasing parent involvement in their children’s science classroom and encouraging parents’
roles as partners in science learning, (2) engaging students in defining problems and designing
solutions of community projects in their neighborhoods (typically engineering), and (3) focusing on science learning in informal environments.
In the Next Generation Science Standards
There is a broad consensus that these two core ideas belong in the NGSS but a majority of state
teams recommended that these ideas could best be illustrated through their connections to the
natural science disciplines. There are a number of performance expectations that require students
to demonstrate not only their understanding of a core idea in natural science, but also how that
idea is supported by evidence derived from certain technological advances.  The connection
between these core ideas and specific performance expectations is shown in the crosscutting concept foundation box.
The following matrix summarizes how the two core ideas discussed in this chapter progress across the grade levels.

Conclusion
In the decades ahead, the continued growth of the world’s population along with technological
advances and scientific discoveries will continue to impact the lives of our students. Whether or
not they choose to pursue careers in technical fields, they will be asked to make decisions that
influence the development of technologies and the direction of scientific research that we cannot
even imagine today.  Consequently, it is important for teachers to engage their students in
learning about the complex interactions among science, technology, society and the environment.
