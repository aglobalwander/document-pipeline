n the blink of a cosmic eye the technological developments from the atom bomb, cell phone, Internet, and ingestible cameras for medical research have brought profound changes. The individual and cumulative effects of these revolutionary developments liberate, endanger, connect, and separate us. Mass media,  telecommunications,  information  technology,  and  artificial  intelligence are  changing  our  world  and  our  very  selves,  as  they  bring  us  to  new  starting points for human and social development. This is a world in which serious conversations among researchers in the field of artificial intelligence urgently ask the questions: What is intelligence? What is the mind? Will machines wrest control from their human masters?\n\nHow do we cope with such an increasingly unpredictable world? To move with the flow of change we need to be able to let go of past assumptions and learn to think afresh. As change pushes  us  to  make  more  decisions  faster  and faster,  it  becomes  increasingly  important  not to  fall  into  the  trap  of  rushing  our  judgments or  being  seduced  by  the  comfort  of  action. Complex  problems  always  have  simple  solutions-that  are  usually  wrong.  Quality  decisions require that we slow down and create the opportunity for insights and feelings to emerge in our awareness. Slowing to think, to inquire, to  collaborate,  to  talk  together  about  student learning is what biologists call an adaptive trait.\n\nAdaptive  traits  have  a  current  functional role  in  the  life  of  an  organism.  In  organizations, these traits maintain, sustain, and evolve by  becoming  normative  forces  that  shape  the behavior  of  managers  and  employees. This  is not a simple matter, as this new normal requires support,  monitoring,  and  indelible  connection with values. The organization must remain viable at all stages of its development and within all phases of environmental change.\n\nOn a recent break from working with international educators in Mumbai, India, while wandering  the  alleyways  and  passageways of  Dharavi, the locale for the movie Slumdog Millionaire ,  we wondered what adaptive traits might be keeping this multireligious, multiethnic,  diverse  settlement  alive.  With  nearly  one million people sardined into five hundred acres, these human beings are amazingly resourceful. Adaptivity is their essential human quality, enabled by self-conscious intelligence modifying either the conditions or themselves to such an extent that they can live at the extremes. People adapt and use their ingenuity and inventiveness to  survive,  but  also  to  find  meaning  and  purpose,  and  whatever  degree  of  pleasure,  even happiness, that humans may know.\n\nWe also wondered anew about the adaptive traits necessary for twenty-first-century schools to crest the waves of unrelenting change. From the first edition of this book in 1999 until now, the essential adaptive traits we have witnessed in  many  settings  are  the  dispositions  to  inquire, to collaborate, and to talk about student learning and teachers' roles in student enlight-\n\nenment. These traits, and the instruments that serve  them,  have  been  sustainable  and  embraced internationally now for seventeen years. Teaching  is  a  people  business,  and  effective schools are settings in which people meet in the center of their practice. They meet as humans and with the practical and productive tools described in this book.\n\nRegarding this third edition we especially appreciate  the  keen  editing  eyes  of  Jane  Ellison, Carolee Hayes, Carolyn McKanders, and Wendy Ferguson and the invaluable assistance provided by Michael Dolcemascolo in refining this  new  organization  and  material  on  facilitator moves and strategies. And above all, we want  to  express  gratitude  to  Sue  Canavan, acquisitions editor and friend, who has guided this work  through  three  editions  now,  and whose indefatigable spirit, encouragement, and problem-solving abilities have been indispensable in making this work available to readers.\n\nWe  are  eternally  grateful  to  the  many voices  that  have  contributed  to  our  learning, from  schools  around  the  world,  from  colleagues  at  Thinking  Collaborative,  and  from the  emerging  research  and  knowledge  in  our profession. We remain committed to the notion that adaptation is a process requiring relatively small  changes  over  time  and  those  changes begin with us.\n\nRobert Garmston and Bruce Wellman Mumbai, India January 2016\n\n## Introduction\n\nT school systems and groups in the past twenty years as we have worked his edition of The Adaptive School represents much of our learning about with  educators  in  settings  that  span  the  globe. Although  each  school  is unique, there are social patterns that are easily recognizable when people gather in groups to work together. Drawing on these experiences and looking at group work through the  theoretical  filters  of  biology,  ecology,  quantum  physics,  complexity science, systems thinking, and cognitive and social psychology, we offer a practical set of principles and tools for developing and facilitating collaborative groups.\n\nThe  Adaptive  School is about  developing  strong  groups  and  schools  in  which  collaborative  faculties  are capable  of  meeting the  uncertain  challenges  of  tomorrow.  Some schools  are  flourishing.  Others  are  making remarkable gains in improving student achievement,  increasing  attendance,  attaining  higher post-school  accomplishments,  and  developing satisfying relationships with their communities. Some schools produce only fair results; others languish. We believe that all can be better.\n\nit  is  difficult  to  maintain  a  collaborative  core. Regardless of the nature of the issues, it is our premise that the means for improvement exist within  the  school  community.  The  practical ideas in this book show how to activate these resources if they are dormant and focus them if they are scattered.\n\nAs  realists, we  recognize  that  difficult and  different  challenges  beset  schools  and communities  in  their  quest  to  serve  students. Issues differ from school to school. Urbanism and ruralism bring their own special problems. Defeatism, extremism, apathy, or politics infect some  schools.  Schools  can  become  obsessed with  ensuring  predictable  results  or  they  can struggle  to  overcome  the  effects  of  extreme poverty, neglected children, or the burdens of ponderous  bureaucracy.  Money  can  bring  its own  problems.  Some  affluent  communities lobby  for  traditional  definitions  of  success  at the  expense  of  other  needs.  In  some  districts, the teachers and students struggle daily with inadequate and outdated materials and facilities. In some settings, faculty turnover is so frequent\n\nWe  believe  that  leadership  is  important, and that the most effective leadership is widely distributed,  informed,  and  deeply  developed. To be adaptive and meet the demands of omnipresent  change  requires  more  than  linear thought,  old  problem-solving  formulas,  and recycled strategic plans. In the work of school improvement, human energy matters as much as  the  elements  of  good  management  domaybe more.\n\n## How to Use This Book\n\nThis  book  is  informed  by  the  central  notion  of  adaptivity,  five  principles  of  complex systems,  and  focusing  questions  that  bring attention to the fundamental issues of capacity building in schools. (See sidebar.) These ideas are initially introduced in part I and elaborated in the remaining chapters. They form the conceptual backbone of the chapters and provide a\n\nrationale for the tools and approaches that we present.\n\nThe book is designed as a sourcebook to support you in developing and facilitating collaborative groups to improve student learning. You can use it  as  a  basic  text  for  yourself  or with a study group and as a reference book for diagnosis and problem solving. We encourage you  to  choose  the  approaches  that  best  serve your interests and needs.\n\nRead from the beginning to the end. The chapter  content  is  designed  sequentially,  with each chapter building on the preceding ones.\n\nCheck the table of contents for an issue of specific  interest  and  read  that  chapter.  It  will provide references to other chapters.\n\nRead the  introduction  to  each  of  the  five parts to overview main ideas in those chapters.\n\nRefer  to  the  problem-based  user's  guide (table  I.1)  to  search  the  text  for  information about specific problems.\n\nA  major  section  of  this  book  is  the  toolkit  of  facilitator  moves  and  strategies,  which makes  up  appendix  A.  Appendix  I  offers  a self-assessment device from which every meeting can be improved.\n\nAdaptive: Change form, clarify identity Schools are complex systems\n\n## Complex systems principles:\n\nMore data do not lead to better predictions\n\nEverything influences everything else\n\nTiny events produce major disturbances\n\nYou  don't  have  to  touch  everyone  to make a difference\n\nBoth things and energy matter\n\n## Focusing questions:\n\nWho are we?\n\nWhy are we doing this?\n\nWhy are we doing this this way?\n\nTable I.1 .

These generations  of  inquiry  continue  to  influence present practices in both productive and, in many cases,  nonproductive  ways.  Traditional  views and linear designs for organizing learning limit our ability to see schools as complex systems of interacting parts, each influencing the others.\n\nHere we provide a brief history of school improvement efforts. Our thinking is informed by  constructivist  psychology,  quantum  mechanics,  complexity  theory,  fractal  geometry, evolutionary  biology,  and  systems  thinking as  new  ways  of  looking  at  schools.  Here  we address  several  issues:  Why  adaptivity  is  important  to  schools,  what  adaptive  leaders  do to  support  sustainable  change,  and  what  both formal and informal leaders can do to support adaptivity in their schools.\n\nThis  opening  section  of  the  book  reveals a  glimpse  of  the  patterns  and  emerging  evolution of thinking related to significant human achievements, including the education of children and youth. We make the case that clockwork thinking  has  driven  most  organizational innovation,  especially  in  the  ways  reformers think  about  school  change.  These  habits  of technical thought guided the exploration of the ancient  world  and  even  now  the  exploration of  space. We propose that newer sciences are revealing a fresh way of thinking about complex organizations, including schools, and offer promise  for  working  with  the  perennial  challenges in schooling. Here we offer a definition of adaptivity, explore its importance to education, and present a short version of how groups operate with it as a driving principle.\n\nWe  also  explore  the  limits  of  traditional leadership  and  comment  on  emerging  understandings of the role of the adaptive leader.\n\n## Chapter 1 What is an Adaptive School?\n\nA n adaptive school is neither a place, nor a program, neither a leader nor a structure. Rather, it is the application of two lenses, one for 'things' and one for 'energy' to examine learning and the organic systems in which it thrives. Central to these lenses is a dual focus held by leaders-leaders not just in the traditional sense of assigned authority, but including those passionate enough to step forward and lead from any role when conditions favor such emergence. These dual  perspectives  might  be  found  in  a  grade-level  group,  a  department,  a  cross disciplinary team, a school, or an entire district. The lens for 'thing' focuses on the basic stuff of good management. 'Thing' ways of seeing and working get the details handled, the bills paid, and the buses running on time and making the right stops in the right neighborhoods. 'Thing' thinking is the historical foundation of management systems in modern organizations.\n\nThe second leadership perspective focuses on energy. Margaret Wheatley (1992) observed that the quality of human relationships creates the  energy  that  produces  work.  This  interdependence,  noted  by  Wheatley,  studied  by Louis, Marks, and S. Kruse (1996) and examined  in  high  performing  groups  by  Woolley and  colleagues  (2010)  is  an  essential  energy for  school  success.  Other  important  energies are the energies of commitment, will, efficacy, craftsmanship, consciousness, and others. With the  additional  lenses  explored  in  this  book, leaders  in  all  roles  can  identify,  enhance,  and concentrate  these  energies  on  the  moral  mission of schools.\n\nThe  revolution  in  physics  called  quantum mechanics clarifies the essential distinctions  between  matter  and  energy  and  simultaneously  blurs  the  line  between  them.  The very term quantum mechanics means bundles of  energy  (quantum)  in  motion  (mechanics) (Capra,  1991).  This  book  describes  ways  to shape this energy through the liberating structures  of  collaborative  norms,  well-organized meetings, new frames for conflict, and communication  practices  that  make  a  difference for student learning.\n\nAs  Richard  Elmore  (1995)  reminds  us, the  real  work  of  changing  schools  lies  not in  changing  things,  but  in  changing  norms, knowledge, and skills (energy) at the individual  and  organizational  levels.  In  fact,  without new  norms,  knowledge,  and  skills,  structural changes  such  as  block  scheduling,  site-based decision-making, multiage classrooms, and inclusive classrooms will have little or no effect on student learning.\n\nIn  adaptive  organizations,  leaders  pay  attention  to  both  things  and  energy  and  to  the flow  and  interchange  of  energy  and  information. Energy becomes an avenue to attainment. We will expand on this idea in chapter 3 with descriptions of four leadership roles, in chapter 8 with an elaboration on the role of facilitator,\n\nand  in  chapter  10,  in  which  we  will  describe five invisible sources of high performance.\n\n## Adaptive, Not Adapted\n\nEvolutionary  biology  is  the  source  for  a central  notion  in  our  work:  adaptivity.  To  be adaptive means to change form in concert with clarifying identity. This is quite different from being adapted ,  which  means  to  have  evolved through specialization to fit specific conditions within tightly defined boundaries.\n\nMonarch butterflies are a good example of an adapted species. As we write this, the monarch has been added to the endangered species list. Across North America, the summer fields sparkle  with  their  flight.  Monarchs,  as  most schoolchildren  learn,  lay  their  eggs  only  on milkweed plants. When the larvae hatch, they feed on the milkweed leaves, growing and developing until it is time to spin a chrysalis that is attached to the milkweed plant. The larvae metamorphose  into  adult  butterflies,  and  the cycle repeats. Without milkweed there would be  no  monarchs.  The  monarch's  nutritional and  habitat  needs  are  firmly  adapted  to  this one type of plant.\n\nAn example of adaptivity within a species can  be  found  on  another  continent. As  primatologists  study  the  social  lives  of  chimpanzee groups,  they  discover  a  remarkable  range  of behaviors within individuals and within populations that are isolated from one another. They are now using the term culture to describe variations in food-gathering techniques that include prepositioning hammer stones for cracking nuts in anticipation of ripening, using grass stalks as tools to fish termites from holes, and sharpening sticks  to  use  as  thrusting  spears  when  hunting small monkeys. These cultural variations spread through local populations and to the next generation but remain unique to a given region.\n\nOrganizations,  like  species,  also  need  to contend  with  adapting  to  changing  environments. This usually means letting go of existing forms and continually clarifying the core iden- tity of the enterprise. As we write this volume, the United States Post Office is struggling for relevancy. Years of deficit budgets have coincided  with  changes  in  the  ways  people  communicate. E-mails, texts, Twitter, Skype calls, and  other  digital  innovations  have  eroded  the Post Office's dominance in the communication field.  Today,  they  are  reasserting  their  place in the economy with a change in form, and in identity. 'Our former identity,' an official told us,  'was connecting  people .  You  write  your grandmother a letter.  In  a  couple  of  days  she gets it. Today people have all these other ways of connecting. So our emerging identity is connecting goods .  We are cheaper than FedEx or UPS and are the delivery service for Amazon.' The Post Office is changing its form, eliminating a fleet of planes, handling more packages than letters,  with  big-brother  data  everywhere clocking the time people spend in line, and how long it takes a driver to get out of the truck at a stop. 'FedEx drivers,' he told us, 'are disciplined if they spend too much time backing up' because studies show backing is less efficient than moving forward.\n\nOne  of  the  most  significant  changes  in form and identity in schools has been the relatively recent transformation of the role of the school librarian. This was first brought to our attention  several  years  ago  at  a  seminar  we were  conducting,  when  a  participant  stopped by  at  a  break  to  share  her  struggles  with  this issue. As the head librarian for a medium-sized school district, she described all of the professional changes she had experienced since completing her master's degree in library science in the early 1970s. As a supervisor, she supported several  librarians  who  were  also  struggling with similar changes. She noted that as librarians they were taught to be quality filters and to stock the shelves with reliable and authoritative reference materials. When students and teachers asked for resources, the librarians were able to  supply  the  best  sources  available  and  took professional pride in knowing and having these materials on hand.\n\nAs students and teachers became increasingly  computer  savvy,  the  librarians  began feeling  devalued.  The  budget  for  reference materials  switched  to  online  resources,  and the  librarians  became  concerned  about  the quality  of  the  information  that  students  and teachers  access  through  Google  and  Wikipedia, and  other  searchable  sources.  Being  a quality filter was a role that gave the librarians pride in their work. They have found that they now have to be teachers of  quality  filtering. The deep transition is therefore not a change in the knowledge base of librarians, but in the ways that they apply their knowledge within their new identities.\n\nAll around us we see examples like this. As Internet-based courses for students become common, what it means to be a teacher and to have  a  class  will  dramatically  shift.  What  it means to be a student is changing. The very concept of the schoolhouse may increasingly be  seen  as  a  historical  artifact  rather  than  a current reality.\n\nVoice-recognition software, coupled with high  bandwidth,  cheap  digital  storage,  and artificial  intelligence,  will  most  likely  dramatically change the teaching of foreign languages. It is not hard to imagine digital environments  in  which  students  or  their  avatars interact with native speakers of the language they are learning. The scenes will come com- plete  with  full  cultural  settings,  appropriate body language and nonverbal messages, and an  oscilloscope-like  readout  displaying  the voice  inflections  of  the  native  speaker  compared  to  the  voice  inflections  of  the  novice learner.  Conversations  can  be  repeated  with this  patient  tutor  until  they  are  fully  mastered.  In  such  an  environment  the  form  of specialty teacher of one language is replaced by the identity of master of second-language learning. This identity is accompanied by the elements  of  designer,  motivator,  manager, and clinician. The number of languages to be taught is limited not by personnel, but by the availability of software and hardware.\n\nTable 1.1 sums up the relationship between form and identity in several examples.\n\nThe great challenge for schools is to let go of the comforts and routines of adapted behaviors  and  to  develop  the  patterns  and  practices of adaptivity. The demographic, technological, economic, environmental, social, and political pressures  driving  our  rapidly  changing  world make this necessary. This is especially true in climates  in  which  the  metaphorical  milkweed might  not  live  forever. Adaptivity  consists  of informed inquiry leading to flexible responses interacting with changing environmental conditions. This is true for individuals, species, and organizations. It requires a clear identity and a lack of attachment to form.\n\nTable 1.1 . Form and Identity.\n\n| Example          | From old identity/form                                                                     | New form/identity                                                                                  |\n|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Phone company    | Managing reliable voice call service/ wires and telephone calls                            | Information transmission/wireless and high-speed data services                                     |\n| Hospital         | Treating disease and injury/surgery, drugs, authoritative patient- providers relationships | Promoting heath and well-being/ classes, therapists, collaborative providers-partner relationships |\n| School librarian | Resource decider and provider/ gatekeeper to reference books, provide classroom unit sets  | Facilitates learner user capacity/ teach research and search skills                                |\n\n## Why Adaptivity Matters to Schools\n\nTo address this question we must first address the differences between technical change (fixing  an  ordinary  problem  without  altering the system)  and  adaptive  change  (fixing  a problem by disrupting the system), for in truth, adaptivity matters when one's goal is sustainable  change.  Educational  literature  is  replete with dramatic stories of change; a heroic principal turns around an underperforming school, a  superintendent  promotes  reforms  that  raise the test scores in a middle-class district, a special  ed  director  causes  improvements  in  math scores for students whose teachers she directs. Inevitably, these dramatic accounts of progress realized  by  treating  adaptive  challenges  as technical ones reverse course, and gains made during  a  brief  period  of  charismatic  attention return to a status quo.\n\nSustainable change is, of course, an oxymoron  unless  it  is  understood  that  healthy change  efforts  include  a  period  of  refinement and  revision  as  educators  seek  to  bring  the changes  into  alignment  with  best  possible benefits  for  students.  Mutation  monitoring  is a process in which leaders monitor application practices  that  differ  from  the  adopted  innovation,  eliminate  those  that  interfere  with  program fidelity, and expand on those that provide better mechanisms to achieve program goals.\n\nSustainable  change  is  driven  by  moral clarity, only possible with adaptive approaches, and only realized when identity is clear. CVS Pharmacy is changing its name to CVS Health as  it  shifts  its  emphasis  to  promote  health  in line  with  its  emerging  identity.  It  is  banning cigarette sales from its stores and, as reported by  Hakim  at  the New York  Times (2015),  recently  resigning  from  the  U.S.  Chamber  of Commerce because of that institution's position against antismoking laws.\n\n## Using Fresh Lenses and New Skills\n\nTechnical  challenges,  differ  from  adaptive ones  in  that  the  problems  are  easy  to  identify, may lead to quick and easy solutions, can sometimes be solved by edict, and rarely address the root causes of problems. Adaptive change, however, requires a systems view, asks for changes in  values,  is  difficult  to  identify,  easy  to  deny, requires  altering  numerous  arenas  within  the organization, needs people with the problem to resolve  it,  and  requires  experimental  thinking. In the medical field, if high blood pressure is the problem,  taking  blood  pressure  medicine  is  an example of technical change while moving to a healthier lifestyle would be a more adaptive approach. Managing schools calls for both kinds of change.  Examples  of  problems  requiring  technical change are altering bus routings to reduce time students are  in  transit,  improving  the  win record of a high school sports team, or changing the start times of school even with the resulting challenges  this  brings  to  other  aspects  of  the program such as student schedules, after-school work opportunities, and athletic practices. Sending a person to the moon and performing openheart  surgery  are  often  offered  as  examples  of complicated problems needing technical change and linear reasoning.\n\nIn contrast adaptive changes require nonlinear  thought,  attention  to  an  ever-changing environment,  ownership  of  the  problem  by the  people  closest  to  it,  fearless  inquiry,  and addressing  values  conflicts.  In  schools,  improving  the  reading  performance  of  primary students, achieving a student body committed to  inquiry,  or  eliminating  bullying  requires adaptive change.\n\nThe same problem can be viewed from either lens. One school confronting the challenge of  receiving  a  passing  mark  on  a  tenth-grade state  literacy  test  focused  its  remedial  efforts\n\n## The Peripatetic Pivot Point\n\nSuccessful  sea  captains  must  apply  adaptive  competence,  explains  P.  F.  Willteron  in Basic Ship Handling for Master, Mates and Pilots (1980). There is no formula for ship handling, but an array of forces that must be monitored lest the captain be caught off guard. Tide, displacement, wind, and current can all cause a ship to pivot, and the captain must be able to anticipate these forces and tap into learning from past experience in order to skillfully move the vessel forward.\n\nThe tricky thing about the pivot point is that the location of the pivot point changes from moment to moment because the location of the pivot point of a boat that is underway depends on how or even whether the boat is already moving relative to the water that it is in contact with at that moment .\n\nAdded to the complexity of ship handling is the reality that ships do not have brakes. An anchor helps when a ship is moving slowly, but a ship can still move forward even with its anchor dropped. This increases the importance of monitoring forces, as well as how forces interact with one another. For example, given that part of the vessel is underwater, if the current is moving faster than the wind, the water will exert more force than the air. This knowledge of which forces are exerting the most impact informs the captain's decision-making regarding steering and adjustments.\n\nSchools are much like ships, requiring monitoring forces rather than following a formula. Anchorage District principal Deanna Beck (Lt. Commander, U.S. Coast Guard Reserve) told us how she prioritizes forces as a leader. 'It depends on your speed,' she replied. If you're going fast you'll have to pay attention to what will have the biggest impact on your vessel and what else is going on in the environment. When coming into San Francisco Bay, for example, she first makes note of anything nearby such as trees or buildings, then figures out how fast she's going. With that collective information she can determine whether the wind or water is having more force, and how to adapt accordingly (Beck, 2015; Whiteley, 2015).\n\non  boosting  the  achievement  of  students  who were falling just below a failing grade. Another school  facing  the  same  situation  concentrated its efforts on improving literacy for all students for  the  long  run. Teachers worked together to improve their practices and engaged the community with a full month emphasis on literacy skills. In the second school, results for the first year were not dramatic, but by the third year the school had become the district's second-highest scoring school (Hargreaves and Fink, 2004). In the first example, the school treated an adaptive challenge as a technical one and got quick but nonsustainable change.\n\nOne  emerging,  messy  issue  for  schools that  requires  adaptive  change  is  that  a  sustained emphasis on information and communication  technologies  has  significantly  influenced  students  and  their  school  experience. At a restaurant the other night we watched a three-year-old  competently  manage  an  iPod. Ian  Jukes  (2006)  notes  that  kids'  brains  are being  changed  because  of  intense  sustained experience (seven days a week, several hours a  day)  with  the  digital  world.  Some  observe that the average working memory space might be  less  today  than  when  we  were  students. How many phone numbers do you know other\n\nTable 1.2.

External devices manage most of our memory tasks today.\n\n## Schools Are Complex Systems\n\nTable 1.3. Schools Are Complex Systems.\n\n## From Different Disciplines Come These Synonyms\n\nNonlinear\n\nComplex\n\nDynamical\n\nBeyond the issues of sustainability, and a rapidly changing environment, another reason adaptivity is important is that schools are complex  systems,  and,  while  it  is  not  possible  to change such systems,  it  is  possible  to  disturb them. A complex system is one in which tiny events cause major disturbances (the butterfly effect  in meteorology  or  the  paraphrase  in social  systems);  everything  affects  everything else (on days when David is absent, everything goes better in class); you don't have to touch everyone  to  make  a  difference  (six  teachers changed the work culture of an entire school by being publicly polite in public places); and both things and energy matter (while things like new books are important, more important are effort, caring, and commitment).\n\nComplicated  systems,  on  the  other  hand, lack the interactive characteristics of complex ones  and  can  be  changed  through  edict  and linear  logic.  Performing  brain  surgery  is  an example of working in a complicated system.\n\nManaging  a  marriage  represents  a  complex system challenge (Cuban, 2010; Garmston and Wellman, 2013).\n\nSchools  are  nonlinear  systems  in  which cause and effect are not tightly linked. In nonlinear systems, the parts do not add up to the same sum each time they are combined. Fresh combinations result in different outcomes. For teachers,  the  curriculum  combines  with  instructional and assessment practices to support student  learning.  Yet  every  school  year  turns out  differently  as  the  pedagogical  mix  blends with a new crop of students.\n\nA  blend  of  regularity  and  irregularity shapes nonlinear systems, producing patterns of stability and  instability. Critical choice points present new  possibilities and  new forms  of  order.  Instability  permits  creative life  in  school  systems.  The  self-organizing interactions between people develop feedback loops that recur and amplify across the scale of the organization. Changes in such systems may be unexpected.\n\nSelf-organization develops through meaningful  adult  interactions  about  students,  student work, and the purposes and processes of schooling. To be productive, such interactions must  be  infused  with  and  guided  by  shared values  and  norms  of  collaboration.  The  environment  must  encourage  reflection,  inquiry, challenge,  and  deprivatization  of  practice  for both teachers and administrators. This in turn requires  skills  in  dialogue,  discussion,  planning, and problem solving. At times the work\n\nis messy and nonrational. Habitual, linear ways of thinking will work for some issues but not for the increasingly complex and ill-structured problems that beset many schools today.\n\n## Principles of Complex or Dynamical System Change\n\nIn  the  early  1950s  a  trucking  magnate named  Malcolm  McLean  and  his  colleagues began  the  process  that  produced  the  shipping-container  industry  that  we  know  today, revolutionizing  costs  as  cargo  handling  at  either  end  of  the  voyage  produced  as  much as  50  percent  of  the  costs  of  moving  goods (Levinson, 2006). McLean was not limited by the identity of being a trucker. He realized that he was in the moving goods business and that trucks, trains, and ships could work in harmony to  move  material  if  that  material  was  placed in  uniform-sized  containers  and  a  supporting infrastructure  facilitated  the  rapid  deployment of these containers across the globe.\n\nHis  innovations  rapidly  reduced  the  costs of moving goods and negated the need to have sources of production and storage close to ports. The waterfronts of the world swiftly shed manufacturing industries, and warehouses were transformed into high-status housing and recreation areas in many locales. In 1964 the five boroughs of New York City were home to manufacturing concerns that employed nearly 900,000 workers. By the mid-1970s more than one-third of those jobs were gone. Cheap transportation motivated the search for cheaper labor and lower manufacturing costs. Distance was no longer an obstacle to commerce. This example illuminates five underlying principles, described below, that guide adaptive systems such as the shipping industry, weather systems, and schools.\n\n- 1. More  data  do  not  lead  to  better  predictions . Malcom  McLean  did  not  need  to know all  the  economic  data  points  about the industries that were his customers. He merely  needed  sufficient  data  about  his own business and the appropriate metrics\n- to guide his business plans. Meteorologists have  more  data  than  at  any  time  in  history, yet their radars and computer models lose meaning beyond a four-day window. Many schools we work with are data-rich and  meaning-poor.  They  collect  endless surveys  and  pore  over  spreadsheets  but don't take the time to dialogue and make meaning  from  their  experiences  and  the knowledge they have within them.\n- 2. Everything influences everything else . The rise  of  the  shipping  container  made  the economic boom possible both in Asia and for  Wal-Mart  and  other  big-box  discount stores.  These  forces  have  fueled  growing prosperity as well as environmental damage across the globe. In weather systems, temperature changes affect wind patterns, which affect precipitation patterns, which in turn influence climate changes, including  droughts  and  floods.  In  schools,  the affective climate of the building and classrooms  influence  how  adults  feel  about their work, the energy they invest, and the academic results for students.\n- 3. Tiny  events  create  major  disturbances. Putting  a  stack  of  boxes  in  and  on  ships is  in  many  ways  a  tiny  event.  Yet  this simple revolution has changed economies throughout the world, changed labor relations by making loading ships highly technical  skilled  work,  and  changed  the  balance of power as emerging countries flex their  new  financial  and  political  muscles. As tropical storms develop off the coast of the African continent and swing across the Atlantic Ocean and into the Caribbean Sea, encountering water that is as little as onefourth degree warmer tips the storm into a raging hurricane. In collaborative groups, a  participant  who  is  skilled  in  paraphrasing  and  inquiry  opens  up  the  thinking  of others and deepens the meaning that these conversations produce.\n- 4. You don't have to touch everyone in the system to make a difference . Malcom Mclean\n\ndidn't have to run around the globe and get all  the  policymakers and decision makers in  place  and  on  board  before  starting  his venture.  He  designed  some  sturdy  boxes, converted some old tanker ships, and built some  special  cranes  at  the  sending  and receiving  ports.  The  rest  of  the  system responded over time to these innovations. Weather systems affect behaviors by their mere  presence.  Whether  these  systems are hot or cold, wet or dry, environments and organisms respond to these influences without the right to vote. In the same way, a  school  culture  shapes  the  behavior  of its  members. That is why school cultures are  so  tenacious  in  the  face  of  personnel changes. The real work of school improvement, then, is the work of 'reculturing' by shaping the norms, beliefs, and values of those cultures. We've consulted with several international schools on this for whom this is a special challenge.\n\n- 5. Both  things  and  energy  matter . Ships, boxes,  cranes,  trucks,  and  trains  are  all things.  They  have  to  work  together  in  a timely  fashion  to  move  the  goods  that move  the  economy.  They  also  represent the energy of commerce-the innovating, buying, selling, and improving of products that  engage  human  minds  and  imaginations. Wind, sun, and rain are all tangible phenomena, but it is the energy they contain  and  transmit  that  moves  windmills, sprouts  plants,  and  produces  waterfalls. Schools require books and bells, halls and balls,  but  again  it  is  the  energy  of  caring and  commitment  that  moves  minds  and produces learning.\n\n## How Schools Become Adaptive\n\nSo far we have discussed the importance of adaptivity and the need to clarify identity, both as  individuals  and  as  organizations,  without clinging to outmoded forms. We've suggested a rationale for why this is important by framing schools as nonlinear, complex, dynamical systems in which cause-and-effect linkages are not so easily drawn. We will now briefly describe how schools can achieve this. The chapters that follow  will  expand,  elaborate  on,  and  share many of the concrete tools we have learned to use from our work with successful schools.\n\nFor readers that prefer to see the big picture, figure 1.1 gives an overview of concepts that follow in this book.\n\n## A Short Course in Adaptivity: Focusing Questions\n\nWe  encourage  departments,  committees, councils, and faculties to reflect frequently on three focusing questions: (a) Who are we? (b) Why are we doing this? and (c) Why are we doing this this way? The byproduct of this reflection is action for improving student learning.\n\n## Who Are We?\n\nPrincipal Kathy Dunton of Vine Hills Elementary School in California told us that these three  questions  transformed  her  school.  She encourages  teachers  and  parents  to  ask  them frequently  and  to  explore  them  in  depth.  The question  'Who  are  we?'  leads  directly  to  the issue  of  identity.  This  issue  forces  the  related questions  of  'About  what  do  we  care?'  and 'How much do we dare?' The form taken by a school, team, department, or teacher's assignment  is  less  important  than  identity.  Identity represents  the  story  that  a  group  tells  itself to  organize  its  values  and  beliefs.  A  group's beliefs determine its behavior. Collectively, its behavior affects student learning (Dilts, 1994). (See chapter 10.)\n\nIdentity  cannot  be  found  in  a  mission statement. It displays itself in hallways, faculty lounges,  meeting  minutes,  and  student  academic results. Identity reveals itself in periods of  stress:  What  a  group  strives  to  preserve  or fights to protect describes its identity. The very definitions of success, the awards and rewards\n\nFigure 1.1 . Concept Map\n\nfor both students and staff members, symbolize driving values and beliefs.\n\n## Why Are We Doing This?\n\nFolk  wisdom,  tradition,  and  unexamined habit  rule much  of  what  schools  do.  The agricultural  calendar,  factory  schedules,  and athletic practices  continue  to  frame  yearly and daily time use. Bus schedules and teacher contracts exert powerful and often unexamined influences  on  student  learning.  Yet  these  and other  features  of  school  life  go  unquestioned. 'It's  just  the  way  we  do  things  around  here,' one is told when bold enough to inquire.\n\nA classic story captures the essence of this issue. A little girl, watching her mother prepare a ham for the oven, wanted to know why her mommy was cutting the end off before placing it in the roasting pan. 'I don't really know,' her mother  replied,  'That's  the  way  my  mommy did it.'\n\nSo  the  little  girl  went  to  see  her  grandmother and asked her why she cut the end of the ham off before putting it in the roasting pan. 'I don't really know,' her grandmother replied, 'That's the way my mommy did it.'\n\nSo the little girl went to see her great-grandmother and asked her why she cut the end of the ham off before putting it in the roasting pan. 'Well,'  the  old  woman  explained,  stretching her arms wide, 'I grew up on the prairie in a little  sod  house, and our hams were this big.' Bringing  her  hands  closer  together,  she  concluded,  'And  our  oven  was  this  big.  We  had to cut the end off the ham to fit it in the oven.'\n\nIn  many  settings,  educators  continue  to 'cut the end off the ham' long after the original rationale has passed. The deep structure of schooling is  set  on  foundations  of  'hams  and end  scraps'  from  earlier  eras.  Unquestioned assumptions  form  the  'ovens'  in  which  they 'cook.'  Many  current  practices  are  rooted  in beliefs  about  the  need  for  power  and  control over others and over resources (Sarason, 1990). Such beliefs were at the heart of the management  literature  during  most  of  the  1800s  and\n\n1900s.  They  are  the  source  of  conflicts  over curriculum and at the center of most tensions around  any  form  of  shared  decision  making. The question 'Why are we doing this?' brings attention and choice to practices that have become unquestioned habits.\n\n## Why Are We Doing This This Way?\n\nThe  'this'  that  we  are  doing  could  be grouping  students  for  instruction,  developing learning  experiences,  or  deciding  time  allotments for activities. This last question, valued so  highly  by  California  principal  Kathy  Dunton,  brings  focus  not  to  the what and why of the activity but to the how .  Walk through any school  with  a  notebook  in  hand,  because  this question will have you scribbling rapidly.\n\nThe  daily  schedule  is  a  good  starting point. Anyone who has observed the sleeping and  waking  patterns  of  adolescents  knows that  8:00  a.m.  is  not  peak  time  for  anything not conducted in a prone position, yet district schedules organized by transportation patterns typically have high schools starting around that hour.  On  the  other  hand,  many  five-  and  sixyear-olds are up and bustling, ready to get on with the new day. Schools might, in fact, have the daily time schedule for the various levels of schooling in reverse order from what would be a better fit with physical development patterns.\n\nThe question 'Why are we doing this this way?' could be restated, as 'Who benefits from the current system?' Exploring this form of the question  provides  insight  into  the  forces  that keep current practices in place. As Kathy Dunton found, these three focusing questions open up new ways of seeing school practices. Once revealed,  they  can  be  acted  on  and  modified. Left  unexamined,  they  keep  the  institutional drivers  on  autopilot  and  the  'map'  stuffed  in the 'glove compartment.'\n\n## This Book Teaches New Songs\n\nAll  cultures  have  creation  stories  to  explain  the  coming  of  the  world  and  their  own\n\nplace in it. The Aboriginal people of Australia believe that their land is covered with a web of invisible pathways. These 'dreaming-tracks' or 'songlines' first appeared during the Tjukurpa (djook-oor-pah)  or  'Dreamtime,'  when  ancestral  beings  wandered  over  the  featureless landscape,  singing  the  world  into  existence. These totemic ancestors sang out the name of everything  that  crossed  their  path.  They  sang out the names of plants, animals, rocks, rivers, salt pans, and waterholes, coding and wrapping the world in a web of song (Chatwin, 1987).\n\nWhen  an  Aboriginal  mother  is  pregnant and feels the baby kick for the first time, she calls the shaman to identify that child's totemic spirit  guide.  Physical  features  at  the  site  of the kick are then interpreted, and the spirit of the child-the  child's  'dreaming'-is  thus identified.  This  dreaming  can  be  one  of  any number of mammals, insects, birds, or reptiles. As the child grows, he or she learns the song of  this  spirit  guide.  Coded  into  the  song  are the  features  of  the  local  landscape-where  to find food, water, shelter, and safe travel routes. Song is the oldest mnemonic device, far easier for a nomad to carry than any road atlas.\n\nAn Aborigine  who  goes  'walkabout'  on a  journey  of  discovery  or  on  a  hunting  foray calls  on  this  song  to  guide  him  or  her. Along one's 'songline,' one has safe passage, meeting others who share the dreaming along the way. Memory carries the traveler to the limits of the song. At the boundaries Aborigines meet and, through ritual,  swap  songs. This  sharing  relationship extends the territory of each and binds one to another through song.\n\nTo find new territory and new routes, we all need to learn new songs. This earth and its workings are not as we were once taught. At the limits of our songs, we need one another so that we can be adaptive in a world made of bundles of energy in motion.\n\n## Chapter 2 The Context\n\nW hen pioneering navigators first sailed from the coasts of Asia, Africa, and Europe, they were guided by their dreams, the stars, and primitive compasses-sailing into territories marked on their fanciful charts as unknown lands and seas of mystery. Undoubtedly many in the ships' crews cast apprehensive glances at familiar receding shores, trusting in the soundness of their vessel and the courage and skills of their leaders. Their affects were legion: some were destructive, decimating indigenous cultures and native ecologies; others were constructive, made possible by the forces of technical change, the same forces that propelled a satellite in a flyby of the dwarf planet Pluto in July 2015.\n\nTheir  tools,  by  today's  standards  were primitive: the compass, the sextant, the quadrant  to  measure  the  altitude  and  angle  of celestial  bodies,  and  primitive  maps  of  the world and its seas. Incredibly, the same class of  scientific  thinking,  admittedly  more  sophisticated,  directed  the  twenty-first-century spacecraft passing Pluto, sending images back over  three  billon  miles  from  its  nine-and-ahalf-year  journey.  This  form  of  thinking  has also  governed  approaches  to  school  change for  hundreds  of  years.  It  was  present  in  the early life of kindergartens in 1900, the introduction of 'scientific management' during the period 1900 to 1925, an approach introduced in industry by Francis Taylor. Scientific management  promoted  the  virtues  of  efficiency and time management.\n\ntional Commission on School District Reorganization  proposed  to  eliminate  the  one-room schoolhouses,  thereby  reducing  the  country's 115,000 districts to five thousand.\n\nTaylor's educational followers saw teachers  as  workers  requiring  direct  supervision  to meet predetermined goals. Edward Thorndike, another  researcher  committed  to  efficiency, introduced  standardized  testing,  including  intelligence  testing  adopted  by  the  U.S.  Army beginning in 1900. In 1948 one of these authors graduated eighth grade, the same year the Na-\n\nEfforts  to  study  and  improve  curriculum were launched by twenty men in 1930, eventually leading to the formation of the Association of  Supervision  and  Curriculum  Development, still  a  dominant  force  in  staff  development. Major attempts to reform secondary education occurred during the period 1933 to 1941. According to Tyack and Cuban (1995) this 'Eight Year Study' allowed students to attend courses that crossed departmental boundaries. The first 'In  Service  Workshops'  emerged  during  this era.  The  effects  of  the  Eight  Year  Study  declined as reformers responding to the perceived threats  of  World  War  II  and  the  Cold  War advocated for more authoritarianism in school organizations. Technical thinking drove efforts in innovation throughout the period from 1930 into  the  1950s.  Later,  during  the  1980s  and 1990s the effective schools research led to lists, inventories,  and  an  emphasis  on  behaviorist psychology with rewards and sanctions as the means to school improvement.\n\nThe  No  Child  Left  Behind  Act  of  2001 (NCLB)  perpetuated  this  same  line  of  thinking in school reform. Insensitive to schools as systems,  NCLB  spawned  unintended  results; the  vast  majority  of  schools  'increased  time for  reading  and  math  while  decreasing  time for social studies, science, art, music and even recess'  (Goldstein,  2014).  In  many  regions teacher  pay  was  linked  to  student  test  scores, as parent and teacher revolts erupted over excessive  testing. The  debates  on  testing  in  this country were not unusual as Goldstein (2014) accounts in her history of education, concluding that no other profession operates under the same  level  of  political  scrutiny.  Educational change  has  been  a  battlefield  since  the  early 1800s  and,  at  the  present  time,  public  school teaching  has  become  one  of  the  most  controversial  professions  in  America.  Opposing  a business  orientation  to  schools,  Sergiovanni (1994)  famously  said,  'Schools  are  not  fast food chains or armies.' Rather, they are more like families  and  religious  organizations  in respect to culture, mission, and personnel than like corporations. Educators are interdependent groups  regarding  knowledge  as  fluid,  provisional,  and  subject  to  improvement.  Schools are ultimately moral organizations and become increasingly so when they replace talking at or to one another with true conversations.\n\nBy  1925  a  human  relations  orientation had  emerged  in  opposition  to  the  scientific movement of the  times. Teachers  and  administrators  were  advised  to  be  more  democratic in their treatment of others. This form of educational  philosophy,  never  completely  absent since then, became measurable in the latter part of  the  twentieth  century.  Researchers  began exploring other ways of understanding school change, leading to efforts that, while having a humanistic bent, were still 'technical' in their implementation  efforts.  The  RAND  changeagent  study  in  the  late  1970s  revealed  three principles of school change that are still sound: (a) the importance of staff efficacy; (b) the related value of participation in decision-making; and  (c)  the  necessity  for  the  simultaneity  of both  bottom-up  and  top-down  change  efforts (McLaughlin, 1990).\n\nThis was followed by the meta-analysis of school improvement designs by such authors as Mathew Miles (1984), Richard Elmore (1990), Seymour  Sarason  (1990),  Larry  Cuban,  and Michael  Fullan  that  informed  further  change efforts  as  they  drew  on  knowledge  emerging from  the  field  of  organizational  development. Researchers recruited from Xerox and the universities of Stanford and Berkeley, representing the disciplines of anthropology, computer science,  education,  psychology,  and  linguistics, formed an educational think tank, the Institute for  Research on Learning (IRL) that operated from 1986 to 2000. The IRL contributed to a social  approach  to  learning  expressed  in  the 'Seven Principles' of learning and the idea of communities practice. Their work represented a break from what we are calling technical thinking,  to  understanding  change  through  a  more adaptive lens.\n\nIn the late twentienth century and the early twenty-first century, research began to develop around what we will call school energies. These included a focus on trust (Bryk and Schneider, 2002), professional communities learning (Hall and  Hord,  2001),  collaboration  (Little,  1990), teacher efficacy (Bandura, 1977; Goddard\n\nSeven Principles of Learning\n\n- 1. Learning is fundamentally social.\n- 2. Knowledge is integrated  in  the  life of communities.\n- 3. Learning is an act of membership.\n- 4. Knowing  depends  on  engagement in practice.\n- 5. Engagement is inseparable from empowerment.\n- 6. 'Failure to Learn' is the normal result of exclusion from participation.\n- 7. We  already  have  a  society  of  lifelong learners.\n\nand  Hoy,  2000),  systems  oriented  leadership (Hargreaves and Fullan, 2012; Heifetz, Linsky, and Grashow, 2009), neurosciences (Damasio, 1999;  Rizzolatti  and  Sinigaglia,  2008;  Rock, 2008),  systems  seeing  (Quade,  2015),  and coaching teachers (Costa and Garmston, 1994, 2002, 2016).\n\nthe world not as a reflection of ourselves, but as images of the many possibilities within the human landscape, and to grasp a more complex understanding of how change occurs.\n\nToday, we enter a new world, personally, in  education  and  in  the  broader  environment. Innovation, new opportunities, and challenges confront us: from fMRI studies of the brain to proposals by Amazon to use drones to get products to customers more speedily. Our personal and  organizational  maps  for  this  new  world are  in  many  ways  incomplete. What we most need to develop are the mental, emotional, and social tools for finding our way in these shifting landscapes. We also need new lenses to see\n\nNew  lenses  lead  to  unfamiliar  tools  that help us to see fresh sights, think new thoughts, and do new things. For productive school improvement efforts, many of these new tools are both cognitive and cultural. How we think influences the ways that we work together. How we work together influences the ways that we think about that work. This book explores the previously  unfamiliar  lens  of  adaptivity  as  it relates to improving our schools\n\nEvolutionary forces shaped human brains and  response  systems  to  meet  the  demands of much earlier times. If a saber-toothed tiger were to bound through the door, these systems\n\n## Adaptivity in a Complex System\n\nIn the summer of 2015, we witnessed a grey wolf and two grizzly bears maneuvering over an elk carcass, brought down that morning by the wolf. What we learned is that the elk is an adaptive animal, changing its habits according to environmental conditions. Elk move into heavy timber when wolves are around and return to grassy meadow when wolves are absent. The return of the grey wolf to Yellowstone National Park triggered a trophic cascade among animals and plants (Yellowstone Wolf Project, Annual Report 2013).\n\nIn 1995 grey wolves were reintroduced to the park after nearly a seventy-year absence. Technical thinking in the 1930s led to the extermination of park wolves, because they were believed to be bad for the survival of elk. Elk are also prey for bears and at that time cougars, but the culprit focused on by park managers was the grey wolf. With wolves gone and less predatory pressure on the elk, herds grew so large as to become unsustainable because of insufficient food; many elk grew sick and died as they over-grazed pastures. The park, like schools, is an ecosystem in which everything affects everything else. Elk populations grew, and without the predatory pressure from wolves, didn't move around much in the winter, instead feeding heavily on aspen, cottonwood plants, and willow. Beavers need willow to survive in the winter. Because the elk felt safe from the wolves, giving them no need to move, willow were over-browsed leading the beaver population's decrease to one colony.\n\nToday,  with  the  grey  wolf  back,  elks  keep  on  the  move,  and  healthier  willow  stands enable nine beaver colonies to thrive in the restored habitat. More beavers mean more dams and ponds, with multiple effects on stream hydrology. The dams even out the seasonal pulses of runoff, store water for recharging the water table, and provide cold, shaded water for fish, while newly robust willow stands provide habitat for songbirds. Scavengers that once relied on winter-killed elk for food now depend on wolf-killed elk. That benefits ravens, eagles, magpies, coyotes, and bears (grizzly and black), especially as the bears emerge hungry from hibernation. Wolf kills also affect beetles, wolverine, lynx, and other species.\n\nwould immediately trigger a host of chemical, physical, and emotional reactions. Modern humans still possess automatic routines for Pleistocene-era problems and like frogs in warming water, can't sense the change until it is too late.\n\nThe fast reflexes that supported our hunting and gathering ancestors will not help educators develop the forms of schools and schooling that we need in this new era. These demands require new minds and models that are better suited for the challenges of today. Most of all, educators need new sensitivities that can discern what is not readily apparent to the senses and help to craft  new  ways  of  improving  schools  for  the journey ahead.\n\n## Adaptive Leaders\n\nWhen the task is done, the people will say we did it ourselves.\n\n-Lau Tzu, describing the best leader (Tzu's Tao Te Ching , c. 500 BC)\n\nTraditional, views of leadership are less and less useful given the complexities of our modern world. Never-ending reform efforts, ongoing political challenges to schools, and rapid social and technological  change  strain  systems  organized as hierarchies. At no time has the need for adaptivity  been  so  urgent,  requiring  both  protection and questioning of the status quo, orchestrating conflict to press for richer levels of understanding  and  action,  and  developing  capacities  for provocative  leadership  in  all  members  of  an organization. As  both  stability  and  change  are needed,  the  adaptive  leader  is  both  a  member of a group and an observer of the group and its environment.  Teachers,  school  and  department heads, and students can all lead adaptively.\n\nOne of the demands of adaptive leadership is  the  need  to  mobilize people to take on difficult  challenges. Such leadership is grounded in  the  idea  that  prevailing  issues  in  schools are often  addressed  unsuccessfully  because of  insufficient  knowledge,  skills,  and  values\n\n(Zoller,  Lahera,  and  Noremore,  2015). Adaptive leadership activates new perspectives and builds  on  the  past,  helping  people  determine what is worth preserving and what is productive  to  question  (Heifetz  and  Linsky,  2002). 'Who are we?' 'Why are we doing this?' and 'Why are we doing this, this way?' (chapter 1) are potent questions, stimulating adaptivity. As such, successful adaptive changes build on the past rather than ignoring it making successful adaptations both conservative and progressive.\n\nMobilization  includes  developing  faculties  for  cultures  of  inquiry  and  collaboration. Adaptive leaders patiently cultivate the social skills  of  professional  capital,  by  nurturing  the skills sets for dialogue, discussion, productive conflict,  and  pushing  teachers  to  continually explore  the  relationship  between  curriculum, pedagogy, and student learning. Mobilization, too,  involves  developing  in  faculties  a  sense of system awareness and discernment between technical  and  adaptive  challenges.  Technical problems are head and shoulders issues, adaptive  changes  are  processed  lower  in  the  gut (Linsky and Zoller, 2015).\n\nAdaptive challenges are issues that, in the beginning,  others  do  not  recognize  as  problems. It is the adaptive leader that brings heat to the system, and structures responses in such a way that the people who have the problem do the  work.  These  leaders  sell  the  problem  and not the solution.\n\nBecause  adaptive  change  is  disruptive, leaders  also  support  people  in  navigating  the change. Rather than resisting change, according to Heifetz and Linsky, people resist loss. This is congruent with Bridges's (1980) seminal work on transitions in which people inevitably move through  three  psychological  zones  related  to change-endings, where loss is profoundly experienced, a neutral zone of disorientation, and finally new beginnings in which leaders focus people on the process of achieving outcomes, not  the  outcomes  themselves.  Because  these first  two  are  normal  reactions  to  change,  and because, uninformed, many feel there is something  wrong with them when they experience\n\nthe  emotions  of  loss  and  disorientation,  the adaptive leader helps normalize the processes and offers tools for making the psychological changes necessary.\n\nWe have found these questions useful with groups  experiencing  adaptive  change  (Garmston, 2004).\n\n- \u00b7 What is over and what is not?\n- \u00b7 What do you value and want to continue? As individuals and as a group, what can we do to support ourselves through changes?\n- \u00b7 What are  some  areas  in  which  we  might need to tap into our creativity?\n- \u00b7 What are  some  areas  in  which  we  might need to manage the chaos of transition?\n- \u00b7 If this phase of life for this school looks like clouds, what might be some silver linings?\n\nViewing  the  system  and  system  change from the balcony is an essential trait of leadership.  We  have  watched  countless  examples  of skilled quarterbacks, in the middle of the action, appear  seemingly  calm  as  they  scan  the  field looking  for  possible  receivers.  In  the  immediacy, the quarterback is sensitive to burly bodies hurling  his  way  allowing  him  to  step  aside  to avoid them, while the balcony view affords an understanding of the whole play. Every leader, according to Heifetz and Linsky (2002), should routinely climb to the balcony over their organization to survey, study, and to gain perspective on  what  is  going  on  and  determine  needed adjustments.  School  leaders,  too,  operate  from these  multiple  perspectives-participating  in the group, modeling new behaviors, embracing learning  and  risk  taking,  keeping  ears  to  the ground  in  private  conversations,  and  moving to the balcony in meetings and in reflections as they consider progress of their unit as a whole.\n\nConsistent with the values, goals, and tools of Adaptive  Schools,  we  increasingly  witness the  following  adaptive  leadership  practices  in schools, departments, and grade-level teams.\n\n- \u00b7 Reframing  the  leader's  job  from  that  of problem-solver  to  problem  framers  and developer of problem solvers.\n- \u00b7 Asking  the  important,  tough  questions without having the answers.\n- \u00b7 Knowing how to help people learn, not by telling,  but  by  understanding  the  perceptions,  beliefs,  and  values  that  drive  their action, and helping them to plug into alternative, more agile ways of thinking.\n- \u00b7 Fostering reflection and big-picture thinking,  slowing  down  to  move  the  action forward.\n- \u00b7 Demonstrating  and  modeling  consciousness, efficacy, flexibility, and courage.\n- \u00b7 And,  finally,  seeking  or  being  open  to coaching, a practice consistent with world-renowned  classical  musicians  and professional  dancers  as  well  as  professional  athletes in team  and  individual sports.\n\nIt seems the critical question is no longer, 'How to manage change?' rather, the current question  asked  by  Heifetz and  Linsky  (2002) is, 'How to lead adaptive change.'\n\nAs  educators,  authors,  and  consultants, we  are  actively  exploring  new  possibilities and  developing  ways  of  thinking  about  adult interactions in schools. Our own thinking is influenced by the emerging sciences of quantum mechanics,  complexity  theory,  fractal  geometry, evolutionary biology, and systems thinking as  they  apply  to  social  organizations.  We  are also  influenced  by  constructivist  psychology, as  it  relates  to  learning  and  leadership:  and our  personal  histories  in  a  variety  of  roles in  education-teacher,  curriculum  consultant, staff  developer,  principal,  superintendent,  and professor; and our current work as consultants with  schools  throughout  North  America,  and schools in Australia, Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and India.\n\n## PART II\n\n## COLLABORATION MATTERS\n\nDeveloping shared expertise and working with common purpose are vividly present in the schools that are beating the odds and making a difference  for  student  learning  internationally and in North America.\n\nHow  teachers  talk  affects  how  students learn. Loaded with practical tools, this section of the book underscores how the will to make a  difference  in  the  lives  of  students  is  more important  than  school  structures,  buildings, textbooks,  or  lab  materials.  When  this  will  is collective,  school  teams  can  overcome  many obstacles to student learning.\n\nDrawing  from  essential  research  findings from  the  1980s  to  the  present  and  the  work on  professional  capital  by  Hargreaves  and Fullan  (2012)  we  emphasize  the  increasing importance  of  developing  strong  professional communities in schools.\n\nwe  provide  descriptions  of  the  metacognitive skills  for  being  an  effective  group  member, which cannot be found in other literature as far as we can discern. This role, in our experience, is more crucial to group success than having a skilled facilitator. Here we distinguish the role of the group leader from that of the facilitator. The group leader is the person with knowledge and/or  role  authority  and  in  many  situations should not be facilitating the meeting or work session.  Finally,  we  offer  a  simple  model  for helping participants be clear about their intentions  during  group  conversations.  These Two Ways  of  Talking give  focus  and  structure  to conversations  that  flow  from  dialogue  to  discussion to decisions that stay made.\n\nPart  II  makes  the  case  that  the  Adaptive Schools' models and tools serve two major underpinnings of professional capital: developing human  capital  and  enhancing  social  capital. In  this  section,  we  introduce  ways  to  develop seven norms for collaborative work as expected patterns  of  behavior  in  all  school  communications:  in  groups,  in  hallway  conversations, with  students,  and  with  parents.  Importantly,\n\n## Chapter 3\n\n## The Importance of Professional Community\n\nT working cultures of schools. The word he  term professional  community is  striking  when  it  is  applied  to  the professional has its roots in profess , meaning to declare, to own, and to claim some body of knowledge; it therefore implies a level of expertise with a strong technical core that can be clearly  articulated  by  practitioners.  The  word community has  its  roots  in  the word common , and its relationship to the word communicate implies that this is a shared body of expertise. The practitioners in a professional community talk regularly about their collective practice and work together to extend and effectively apply this knowledge base.\n\nDeveloping shared expertise and working with  common  purpose  are  vividly  present in  the  schools  that  are  beating  the  odds  and making a difference for student learning both internationally  and  in  North  America  (Bryk and  Schneider,  2002;  Dufour,  Eaker,  and Baker, 1998; Louis, Marks, and Kruse, 1996; McLaughlin  and  Talbert,  2006;  Hargreaves and Fullan, 2012).\n\nUnfortunately,  the  notion  of  shared  practice within a school or a district is still not as universal  as  we  would  like.  Richard  Elmore (2000)  pointed  out  that  schools  and  schooling  are  governed  by  the  principle  of  'loose coupling'  (p.  6),  with  many  decisions  about what  and  how  to  teach  residing  in  individual classrooms and not in the surrounding organization. Loose coupling tied to a weak technical core is a recipe for disaster. The effects of both effective  and  ineffective  teachers  are  felt  for years. The issue, then, is how to enhance and spread  good  practice  throughout  the  school to  produce  cumulative  and  lasting  effects  for all  learners,  not  just  those  who  are  fortunate enough  to  learn  the  material  the  way  it  is presently  taught.  Fresh  studies  are  emerging that  document  student  gains  as  a  result  of high-functioning  teacher  learning  communities. As one example, research investigating the extent to which teachers' collaborative school improvement  practices  are  related  to  student achievement was conducted from a sample of 2,536 fourth-grade students in forty-seven elementary schools in a large urban school district in the mid-western United States. Schools with greater levels of teacher collaboration produced higher  achievement  in  mathematics  and  reading  than  those  with  lesser  amounts  (Goddard, Goddard,  and  Tschannen-Moran,  2007).  In John Hattie's meta-analysis of more than eight hundred studies, teacher collaboration is an important characteristic for three of nine teaching standards (Hattie, 2009).\n\nOne of the most stable factors in schools over  the  years  has  been  the  relative  isolation of teachers from one another throughout their workday  and  work  year.  Working  lives  in which  autonomous  teachers  are  organized  by a culture of individualism are still common. In some of these schools teachers live episodically\n\nfrom  one  year  to  the  next  and  seek  routines that are efficient and energy conserving. Caution  about  intruding  in  others'  territory  and guardedness  or  resistance  about  changes  in curriculum and instruction are normal. Teachers in these schools work hard, but with little sense  of  their  potential  collective  power.  We have  worked  in  many  of  these  schools,  from the  west  to  the  east  coasts  in  North America and  in  a  some  international  settings.  Despite leadership efforts, and various forms of professional development, many classroom practices remain fundamentally unchanged even though teacher collaboration is undoubtedly linked to improving student learning outcomes.\n\nThe  Professional  Learning  Community (PLC)  movement  (Teacher  Learning  Community  in  the  United  Kingdom)  organizes practices  around  the  premise  of  improving learning by improving teaching practice. Richard Dufour, a champion of PLCs, cautions that the  term  has  been  used  so  loosely  that  it  is forfeiting meaning (Dufour, 2004). And while PLCs  are  not  what  we  are  describing  in  this book,  research  in  this  area  sheds  some  light on two questions related to teacher collaboaraton.  First,  does  collaboration  change  teaching practices, and second, do changes in practices improve  student  learning?  (Vescio,  Ross,  and Adams, 2008). Only recently have researchers gathered empirical data on these two questions, and the short answer to these queries is yes.\n\nIn  their  award-winning  book  Hargreaves and Fullan (2012) declare that one can't grow much  human  talent  by  focusing  on  individuals.  They  envision  a  pathway  to  schools  with high-quality  teachers  and  teaching.  They  remind readers of Leana's (2011) finding that  patterns  of  interaction  among  teachers and between teachers and administrators that are focused on student learning make a large and measurable difference in student achievement and sustained improvement. (p. 34)\n\nThese  patterns  of  interaction  are  the  basis  of social  capital  in  schools.  In  a  sense,  helping schools bring into being the structures and social  capital  necessary for profoundly effective teaching is the purpose of this book.\n\nHargreaves  and  Fullan  (2012)  are  envisioning  communities  of  practice.  'Communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern, a set of problems, or a passion about a topic, and who deepen their knowledge and expertise in this area by interacting on an ongoing basis' (p. 4). Communities of practice is a concept first proposed by cognitive anthropologists Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger in 1991. Members  in  these  communities  collectively learn in order to do better that which they are passionate  about.  Wenger  (1998)  described such groups as having shared norms and collaborative  relations;  a  shared  understanding of what binds them together and shared repertoire,  literally  creating  a  communal  resource. Hargreaves and Fullan (2012) note that first it is about developing trust and relationships and second,  collaborative  work  will  benefit  'from deliberate  arrangements  of  meetings,  teams, structures and protocols' (p. 127). But if these are built in the absence of commitment, all this will be ineffective. 'First,' by the way, is not a statement of sequence, rather it is statement of primary focus while doing shared work around teaching and learning.\n\n## The Elements of Professional Community\n\nIn our work, we are becoming increasingly optimistic that schools as professional communities  hold  rich  promise  for  meaningful  staff engagement  leading  to  increases  in  student learning.  Our  intent  is  to  share  what  we  are learning  in  this  area.  We  offer  ways  to  build professional  communities  in  schools  so  that teachers and administrators can talk about difficult things, ask hard questions about teaching and learning practices, and adults can actively learn from one another.\n\nThe  fundamental  definition  of  adaptivity, the  principles  of  complex  systems  and\n\nfocusing  questions  introduced  in  chapter  1, directly apply to the work of developing robust professional  communities  in  schools.  These factors interact to produce adaptivity and work together  to  energize  the  emergence  of  a  professional  community.  The  combined  effects of  these  relationships  (figure  3.1)  produce  increased student learning.\n\n## Adaptive Schools and Professional Community\n\n## ProfessionaL Community\n\n- 1.

Adaptive Schools and Professional Community\n\nSix  factors  work  in  concert  to  produce a  sense  of  shared  responsibility  for  student success that successfully delivers results. They are  a  prime  example  of  the  complex  systems principle that everything influences everything else. Each principle on its own is important, but not sufficient for the task of energizing instructional  improvements.  The  emerging  research base supports the importance of these essential elements  of  professional  community.  The  six factors are as follows:\n\n- 1. Compelling purpose, shared standards, and academic focus;\n- 2. Collective efficacy and shared responsibility for student learning;\n- 3. Social  capital  emerging  from  teacher  talk about learning and improving said learning;\n- 4. Collaborative cultures communally applying effective teaching practices;\n- 5. Relational trust in one another, in students, and in parents;\n- 6. Individual  and  group  learning  based  on ongoing assessment and feedback.\n\nThese shared efforts produce school-wide gains in student achievement. When teachers take  collective  responsibility  for  students, they  conceive  their  work  to  be  a  joint  enterprise (Little, 1990). They have a greater sense of personal and collective efficacy and assume that learning is a result of school rather than nonschool factors (Lee and Smith, 1996). In high  schools  where  this  sense  of  collective responsibility was strong, students have been found  to  have  larger  gains  in  mathematics, reading,  history,  and  science  than  in  schools where the collective sense was weaker. These outcomes  were  especially  true  for  minority students  and  students  from  low  socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\n## Compelling Purpose, Shared Standards, and Academic Focus\n\nCommunities  come  into  existence  and thrive because  of  a  common  purpose  for working  together. A  group's  compelling  purpose  establishes  reciprocal  expectations  for its  members.  International  evidence  suggests that educational  reform's  progress  depends on  teachers'  individual  and  collective  capacity  and its link with school-wide capacity for promoting pupils' learning (Stall et al., 2006). Compelling  purposes,  however,  do  not  mean a race to the top. Andy Hargreaves notes that while Singapore schools are consistently rated among the best in the world, they have not set goals to be the best. Rather, they have set goals to be effective, and like other successful organizations, aim for 2 percent annual gains. They teach less so students can learn more. Teacher innovation flourishes in their collaborative cultures. Teachers give away their best ideas and then invent new ones\n\nTeachers'  professional  communities  operate  with  a  sense  of  moral  authority  and moral responsibility for making a difference in  the  lives  of  students.  Such  purpose  is grounded in clearly articulated standards for both student and teacher performance. Defining  and  refining  the  meaning  of  doing  good work  is  the  task  of  a  professional  learning community.\n\n## Collective Efficacy and Shared Responsibility for Student Learning\n\nCollective  efficacy  refers  to  the  shared sense  that  teacher  knowledge  and  effort  will overcome  obstacles  to  student  learning.  Such efficacy  is  achieved  through  four  routes:  (1) direct experience in which a group overcomes difficulties  through  persistent  effort;  (2)  vicarious  experience,  the  observation  of  others' successful  experiences;  (3)  social  persuasion in  which  members  are  persuaded  they  have what it takes to make a difference and the students they are working with have the capacity to  learn;  and  (4)  personal  emotional  states,  in which the sense of feeling good about what one is  accomplishing  is  a  further  reinforcement. This raises confidence, which in turn reinforces the practice of working hard. Stress can weaken\n\nthis affect, and weaken the sense of collective efficacy (Holanda, et al. 2014).\n\nThe personal efficacy of individual teachers  is  a  well-studied  phenomenon.  Teachers with stronger personal efficacy beliefs consistently outperform teachers in the same settings with weaker beliefs. They also work harder and experience less stress. Participating in decision making contributes strongly to teachers' beliefs in  the  capabilities  of  their  peers,  fosters  commitment to school goals, and promotes gains in student achievement. A group of high-efficacy teachers, however, is not the same as a group with collective efficacy.\n\nCollective efficacy, however, is not a panacea.  Parker  (1994)-and  other,  earlier  researchers-found  that  collective  efficacy  can partially counteract the negative effects of low socioeconomic conditions.\n\n## Social Capital Emerging from Teacher Talk about Learning and Improving Said Learning\n\nOne  invests  capital  to  reap  returns.  In schools,  social  capital  develops  from  the  frequency with which teachers and others engage in conversations about student work and teaching practices related to that work (Hargreaves and Fullan, 2012). Social capital improves the teaching  performance  of  all  teachers.  Schools with  rich  social  capital  invest  in  teacher  development; not only in pedagogy, but collegial practices which themselves further inform collective  teaching  practices.  Trust,  reciprocity, information,  and  cooperation  are  associated with these social networks.\n\nTalent is the human capital teachers bring to their work. Regardless of starting levels, human capital grows in relationship to social capital, in magnitudes not possible through attention to individual teacher development. Social capital raises the aspirational and performance bar for everyone. Two parallel dimensions are related to social capital: decisional capital and cognitive capital. Decisional capital rises from the  professional  decision  making  of  teachers when they are  treated  as  professionals,  rather than being treated as workers who need to be told what and how to teach. Costa, Garmston, and Zimmerman (2014) assert that training in reflection, not teacher assessment, is a driving force  for  self-directed  learning.  Not  only  is teaching complex requiring agile thinking, but also sustainable decisions made by groups require similar competencies.\n\n## Collaborative Cultures Communally Applying Effective Teaching Practices\n\nThe  norm  of  privacy  has  deep  roots  in 'real'  schools.  Once  the  classroom  door  is closed,  the  teacher  is God.  In  this  sphere of  autonomy  lies  both  greatness  and  sorrow. Within  the  zone  of  isolation,  some  teachers still find  ways  to  develop  craft  knowledge, content  knowledge,  and  compassion  for  their students. These extraordinary individuals manage to stimulate their teaching and continually renew their passion for daily interactions with young minds. All too often, however, this same isolation buffers mediocrity and hides high performers from those who might learn from their modeling, consultation, and coaching.\n\nWhen  practice  is  deprivatized,  teachers visit one another's classrooms to observe master teaching, to coach each other, to mentor, and to solve problems in the living laboratory of instructional space. Students are the beneficiaries of shared teaching repertoires. Although many schools  and  districts  have  spent  much  time and  energy  developing  coherent  curriculum maps,  shared  instructional  maps  are  equally\n\nimportant. When a student proceeds to the next grade  or  next  subject  in  a  secondary  school, having  possession  of  a  predictable  learning repertoire (such as an understanding of a palette  of  graphic  organizers),  energizes  learning and increases success-especially for the least successful learners.\n\nBy  developing  communities  of  practice, teachers  establish  a  working  zone  between the macro  world  of  district  initiatives  and resources  and  the  micro  world  of  their  classrooms (McLaughlin and Talbert, 2006). In this way they develop more coherent instructional approaches  that  represent  shared  understandings of their unique setting.\n\n## Relational Trust in One Another, in Students, and in Parents\n\nIn their work on the effects of academic optimism on student achievement Hoy, Tarter, and Woolfolk-Hoy  (2006)  point  out  that  collective efficacy  is  the  cognitive  side  of  the  equation; academic emphasis is the  behavioral  side;  and faculty trust in one another, in students, and in parents is the affective side. Given the powerful biochemical connections between thinking and feeling in our bodies and our brains, it is difficult to separate these functions in practice.\n\nTrust  is  the  glue  that  binds  community members to one another. This is equally true for teacher communities, classroom communities, and parent communities. When all three parties hold  high  expectations  for  their  relationships, and these expectations are grounded in shared goals and values, trust is  a  powerful  resource for learning.\n\nBryk and Schneider (2002), in their seminal work in Chicago schools, name four criteria for the discernment of relational trust: respect, competence,  personal  regard  for  others,  and integrity. Respect comes in  the  form  of  basic civility  and  a  willingness  to  listen  deeply  to what each person has to say. Parents, students, and teachers need opportunities to talk with and influence  each  other  and  to  believe  that  they can  positively  affect  educational  outcomes.\n\nCompetence is  the  sense  that  each  party  has the  ability  to  carry  out  its  appropriate  roles and produce desired outcomes. This applies to both academic results and teacher-student relationships. When gross incompetence goes unchecked, it erodes trust and undermines shared efforts  toward  improving  learning. Personal regard for others deepens  relational  trust. We are a social species, wired for relationships and reciprocity. Mutual support and mutual caring fuel  these  associations.  Extending  ourselves to  and  for  others  is  like  making  a  deposit  in the  trust  account;  the  interest  in  this  account compounds with each deposit. Integrity is  the congruence between saying and doing. In trusting relationships, this means we believe that a sense of morality and ethics is operating in others and in the ways we are relating. Following through with agreements and commitments is a key aspect of integrity.\n\n## Individual and Group Learning Based on Ongoing Assessment and Feedback\n\n'Learning  is  a  basic,  adaptive  function  of humans. More than any other species, people are designed to be flexible learners and active agents in  acquiring knowledge and skills' (Bransford, Brown, and Cocking, 1999, p. xi). Cognitive science tells us that learning is socially constructed and  individually  integrated;  learning  therefore requires engaging with other learners and is an active  process  for  all  involved.  Individual  and collective learning is one of the key characteristics of effective professional learning communities (Bolam et al., 2005).\n\nFor adult groups, learning how to learn together requires conscious attention, purposeful structures, and meaningful feedback. One form of  feedback  arises  when  teachers  look  at  student work together to explore what is working and  what  might  require  modification  in  their curricular and instructional approaches. Groups apply another form of feedback when they take time to reflect on their own processes and outcomes to consider which practices to continue, which to abandon, and which to modify.\n\nFrom  time  to  time  a  group  or  team  will share with us that it has some great number of years of combined teaching experience. Their assumption  is  that  learning  is  additive,  when in  fact  the  group  members  have  merely  been involved  in  side-by-side  processes.  Engaging in parallel play without feedback and reflection is usually a poor teacher.\n\n## Developing Teachers' Professional Communities\n\nour  experiences  with  schools  the  past  several years, we offer the following four frameworks as organizers for this journey:\n\n- \u00b7 Twin goals: developing organizational capacities  and  developing  professional  capacities;\n- \u00b7 Four 'hats': facilitating, presenting, coaching, and consulting;\n- \u00b7 Five  energy  sources:  efficacy,  flexibility, craftsmanship,  consciousness,  and  interdependence;\n\nDespite the existence of these descriptors of schools that make a difference for students, the  question  of  how  we  get  there  remains. Schools  require  frameworks,  role  clarity,  and self-renewing  tool  kits  for  collaborative  practice.  Based  on  our  understanding  of  the  literature  on  school  change,  organizational  development, and teaching and learning, as well as\n\n- \u00b7 Seven  norms  of  collaboration:  pausing, paraphrasing, posing questions, providing data,  placing  ideas  on  the  table,  paying attention to self and others, and presuming positive intentions.\n\nFigure 3.3 shows the interaction of the first three frameworks.\n\nFigure 3.2. Adaptive Schools\n\nTo address problems in languishing schools, districts and schools must continually apply energy and resources to both production and production capacities. Leaders of adaptive schools  simultaneously  develop  two  goals  related  to  the  organization's  ongoing  need  for self-improvement.  The  first  goal  expands  six organizational  capacities  for  adaptivity.  The second goal strengthens six professional capacities for adaptivity. These twelve capacities for organizational  and  professional  adaptivity  are the source of and focus for reflective dialogue in  professional  communities.  Exploration  of these twelve areas helps communities to focus their work and strengthen their ties to one another. We offer them here as lenses for examining schools and teaching practice in the hope that they will become focal points for important dialogues  and  discussions  in  schools,  departments, teams, and governing councils. We will provide brief descriptions here and elaborate on them in chapter 13.\n\n## The Languishing High School\n\nAt  the  languishing  high  school,  many students  proactively  disengage  from  learning. They slump in their seats on the days that they even bother to come to class. Students ignore homework assignments, and remediation needs outweigh the coverage of new material. External  rewards  such  as  grades,  honor  rolls,  and college  admissions requirements hold little or no  motivational  power.  Teachers  are  attempting  to  deal  with  this  situation  by  embracing tradition,  enforcing  standards,  and  struggling to  maintain  the  integrity  of  teaching  methods and materials. The net result of all these interactions  includes  departments with abnormally high  failure  rates,  decreased  enrollments  in advanced  courses,  falling  attendance,  and  increased dropout rates. Staff morale and teacher efficacy plummet.\n\nThis is a classic situation in which the five principles of complex systems (see chapter 1) are at work:\n\n- 1. More data do not lead to better predictions. Additional  surveys  and  reports  about  attendance,  dropout  rates,  test  scores,  and staff attitudes will not improve this school.\n- 2. Everything influences everything else. Tough standards only raise the bar higher for students who lack basic jumping skills. Poor  student  performance  lowers  expectations and  teachers'  professional  pride and  sense  of  purpose.  Parental  concerns and  complaints  cause  defensiveness  and withdrawal.\n- 3. Tiny  events  create  major  disturbances. Student expulsions, a dropped section of an  honors  course,  and  half-full  classes create ripple effects throughout life in the school.\n- 4. You  don't  have  to  touch  everyone  in  the system to make a difference. A belief that everyone in the school must be ready for change  before  any  action  can  be  taken blocks movement and innovation.\n- 5. Both things and energy matter. Rules, routines,  and  procedures  will  count  for  little unless  you  also  attend  to  the  qualities  of human relationships in the school.\n\n## Organizational Capacities for Adaptivity\n\nThe six organizational capacities for adaptivity are (1) vision, values, and goal focus; (2) systems  thinking;  (3)  initiating  and  managing adaptation; (4) interpreting and using data; (5) developing and maintaining collaborative cultures; and (6) gathering and focusing resources.\n\n## Vision, Values, and Goal Focus\n\nClarity of vison, values, and goals is a hallmark of successful schools. The most important goals are the academic goals for the students. These  in  turn  are  an  expression  of  the  value system that governs the organization. Healthy\n\nschools  and  organizations  hold  a  vision  for themselves of how they wish to operate in the world. This is a vision of values and goals in action. Such a vision is informed by real-world measures  of  student  achievement  and  other goal accomplishments.\n\nAt  the  languishing  high  school,  vision, values, and goals require rethinking and refocusing. English literature might not be the most appropriate course to teach students who have fundamental literacy needs.\n\n## Systems Thinking\n\nSystems  thinking  and  vision,  values,  and goal focus are the major organizers of adaptivity. Helping others to see systems places the work of schools in a larger context. This framework reveals influential interactions and helps to answer the  question  'What  part  of  the  system  can  we influence to create positive change?'\n\nAdaptve schools engage in systems thinking. Whether explicitly labeled as such or not, this is what professional communities do.\n\n## Initiating and Managing Adaptation\n\nAdaptation is the work of leaders at all levels  of  the  school  and  professional  community. Inquiry  is  an  essential  tool  of  adaptation.  The three focusing questions offered in chapter 1 are resources: 'Who are we?' 'Why are we doing this?' and 'Why are we doing this, this way?'\n\n## Interpreting and Using Data\n\nData  have  no  meaning  on  their  own. Meaning is a result of human interaction with data.  Many  schools  are  data-rich  and  meaning-poor. Adaptive groups develop the capacity to discern what data are worth paying attention to and what collaborative practices help people to engage with data in ways that increase ownership  and  willingness  to  act  on  conclusions. (See chapter 11.)\n\nThe  languishing  high  school  usually  has enough data about the system, but little knowl- edge.  Knowledge,  meaning,  and  commitment result from dialogue and discussion about what story is told by the data. Without organized story making, people in organizations make up their own explanations for events. Part of the reason for this is protection from unwanted truths.\n\n## Developing and Maintaining Collaborative Cultures\n\nCollaboration  is  the  essence  of  teachers' professional  community  in  schools.  Collaboration,  social  captital,  and  group  development work hand in hand. In chapter 10 we will discuss ways to help groups become more interdependent and cohesive.\n\nCollaboration operates within and between groups. When students work with units of measure as they quantify lab materials, interdependence connects the math teachers to the science teachers.  Success  in  the  lab  builds  on  math skills learned in other settings. Laboratory applications further reinforce the practical nature of algorithms learned in math class.\n\nA sense of collaboration is lacking at the low-performing high school. The teachers and the departments feel besieged, hunkering down and fighting their own fights for some sense of accomplishment and dignity. The students and the  teachers  do  not  see  themselves  aligned  in a shared task. Each sees the other as an adversary,  with  small  victories  and  losses  accumulating on a daily basis. Each carries an identity as a teacher of a discipline or grade level, not as part of a team dedicated to student success.\n\n## Gathering and Focusing Resources\n\nTime, money, and human energy are some of the resources that support goal accomplishment  in  schools.  Overload  and  fragmentation are  the  enemies  of  success.  Resources  must be focused where they will make the greatest difference. Ultimately this leads to some hard decisions  in  schools.  Resource  allocation  and goal accomplishment are directly linked. What receives attention gets done.\n\nThis last organizational capacity for adaptivity cannot work without clarity in the others. Values and goals point out resource needs. Systems thinking frames where to target resources. To initiate and manage adaptation means to apply and manage resources. All this is missing at the languishing high school. Energy, time, and money are thrown at problems to fix the most visible ones.  Doing  anything  is  considered good enough. The goal is to protect individuals and the organization from the accusation of not working  hard  enough.  Without  a  clear  focus and without honest feedback systems, however, this only saps resources and increases the magnitude of the problems.\n\n## Professional Capacities for Adaptivity\n\nThe  six  professional  capacities  for  adaptivity are (1) collegial interaction; (2) cognitive processes of instruction; (3) knowledge of the structure of the discipline; (4) self-knowledge, values, standards, and beliefs; (5) a repertoire of teaching skills; and (6) knowing about students and how they learn.\n\n## Collegial Interaction\n\nIn many respects, collaboration needs to be  taught.  Past  practices  and  workplace  culture  influence  the  capacity  for  collaboration. So  does  gender  and  school  organization  (elementary, middle, or high). Attitudes, knowledge, skills, and practices can be taught; these are the focus of chapters 4, 5, 6, and 10. The capacity  to  be  a  colleague  is  different  from other  capacities  of  good  teaching.  It  draws upon  craft  knowledge,  self-knowledge,  and interpersonal skills to form a web of reciprocal relationships and services.\n\nNorms of privatism are strong at the languishing high school. Each teacher operates as an independent artisan. There is no craft guild with  which  to  share  professional  knowledge and  concerns.  Small  breakthroughs  with  stu- dents are personal victories to be savored and fleetingly enjoyed in quiet moments.\n\n## Cognitive Processes of Instruction\n\nInstructional thinking occurs in four phases: planning, teaching, analyzing and evaluating, and applying what has been learned to future work.\n\nThe  more  cognitively  adept  a  teacher  is, the better the results are in classrooms and with colleagues. This capacity includes the abilities to  manage  multiple  goals  simultaneously,  to align one's work with that of one's colleagues, and to learn from experience in the classroom (Costa and Garmston 2015).\n\nTeachers  in  the  languishing  high  school feel as if they have no time to reflect. The pace of  survival  puts  action  ahead  of  reflection  on most  personal  and  collective  agendas.  Peer coaching programs sputter out in the press for time. Formal supervision is pro forma and ritualized. Administrators are mostly satisfied with teachers who 'keep the lid on' in a classroom and keep kids out of the office.\n\n## Knowledge of the Structure of the Discipline\n\nKnowledge  of  the  structure  of  the  discipline moves  beyond  content  knowledge, which is necessary but not sufficient for good teaching.  The  former  involves  knowing  the organizing  schema  of  the  field,  including  the significant ideas in the discipline and how they relate  to  one  another. Anticipating major misconceptions and barriers to learning and understanding the significant ideas are also important here. These inform curricular choices and the selection and use of resource materials.\n\nLittle attention has been given to matters of curriculum  at  the  low-performing  high school  beyond  periodic  textbook  adoptions. Teachers' knowledge of their fields is not always up to date. In fact, more than a quarter of the staff might be teaching outside their areas\n\nof certification or in areas in which they did not major in college.\n\n## Self-Knowledge, Values, Standards, and Beliefs\n\nThe knowledge of what one stands for is the  most  important  assest  a  professional  educator has to maintain a steady course through the  ups  and  downs  of  life  in  schools.  Having clarity about personal standards for good work and good behavior and effectively\n\nA  lack  of  deep  professional  interaction does not serve teachers in the languishing high school. Many are unsure of themselves and insecure in the changing world in which they find themselves.  Old  touchstones,  such  as  grades, course syllabi, and school traditions no longer provide comfort and a sense of purpose in the world.  Some  cling  tightly  to  known  elements even in the face of evidence of their negative effects. The comforts of the past hold memories of the way things are supposed to be.\n\n## A Repertoire of Teaching Skills\n\nIn  chess,  the  queen  is  the  most  powerful piece  on  the  board  because  she  has  the  most flexibility of movement: She can move forward or  backward, left or right, and diagonally, for any  number  of  spaces.  Like  a  chess  queen, teachers with an expanded repertoire of teaching skills have the most flexibility of movement and thus the most options.\n\nNo one knows it all in the classroom. Craft knowledge is a lifetime in the making. There is always something new to invent and learn as research, technology, and professional practice continually  expand  both  the  knowledge  base of  teaching  and  the  answers  to  the  questions about  what  works  and  why.  Teachers  at  the low-performing high school cling to old ways of  doing  business  in  the  classroom.  Lectures, videos,  reading  from  textbooks,  note  taking, and quizzes prevail. Students play out their part of  the  ritual,  minimally  complying  with  this production.  Alternative  teaching  techniques such as simulations and project-based learning are usually rejected as 'not my style.'\n\n## Knowing about Students and How They Learn\n\nJust as educators can never know enough about  the  structure  of  their  disciplines,  themselves,  and  their  teaching  repertoire,  they  can never  know  all  there  is  to  know  about  their students  and  how  they  learn. This  capacity  is divided into two parts. The first, knowing about students, means knowing them as people-who they are and where they come from. This is the stuff of genuine relationships that nurture and motivate  learning.  The  second  part,  knowing how students learn, is informed by knowledge of learning  styles,  developmental  stages  of intellectual  growth,  cultural  differences,  and gender differences.\n\nStudents in the low-performing high school  are  often  viewed  as  problems  to  overcome. They are the objects of instruction, not the  constructors  of  meaning.  All  too  often, relationships  between  teachers  and  students are strained in the battle for power and control. Each side needs the other but does not always know how to cross the gap that divides them.\n\n## The Four 'Hats' of Shared Leadership\n\nIn  adaptive  schools,  all  players  learn  to 'wear  four  hats,'  or  play  four  roles.  By all players we mean administrators, teachers, support staff, students, and, when appropriate, parents. In such schools all the players must have the knowledge and skills to manage themselves and influence and lead others.\n\nLeadership is a function, not a role and is a shared function in meetings, staff development activities, action  research,  and  classrooms. Recognizing  the  'hats'  and  knowing  when and how to change them is shared knowledge within  the  organization.  When  values,  roles, and  work  relationships  are  clear,  decisions about appropriate behavior are easy. We offer\n\ndefinitions to illustrate the major  functions of  four  leadership  roles  and  the  distinctions among the roles. See Costa and Garmston, and Zimmerman (2014) for extended discussion on how each of these functions can contribute to the development of cognitive capital.\n\n## Facilitating\n\nTo  facilitate  means  'to  make  easier.'  A facilitator  conducts  a  meeting  in  which  the purpose  is  dialogue,  shared  decision  making, planning,  or  problem  solving.  The  facilitator directs the processes  used  in  the  meeting, choreographs  the  energy  within  the  group, and maintains a focus on one content and one process at a time. Ideally the facilitator is not the  person  with  role  or  knowledge  authority (described in chapter 8). The role of facilitator is central to the ideas in this book. Many of the templates,  tools,  and  strategies  provided  here apply  to  it.  We  have  therefore  elaborated  on this role in chapter 8.\n\n## Presenting\n\nFigure 3.4. Illustrations from Learning Guide\n\nTo  present  is  to  teach.  A  presenter's goals  are  to  extend  and  enrich  knowledge, skills,  or  attitudes  and  to  enable  these  to  be applied  in  people's  work.  A  presenter  may adopt many stances-expert, colleague, novice,  or  friend-and  use  many  strategies  of presentation-lectures,  cooperative  learning, study groups, or simulations. Touchstones of effective  presentations  include  clarity  of  instructional outcomes, of standards for success, and ways to assess learning (Garmston, 2005; Garmston and Wellman, 1992).\n\n## Coaching\n\nTo  coach  is  to  help  a  group  take  action toward its goals while simultaneously helping it  to  develop  expertise  in  planning,  reflecting, problem  solving,  and  decision-making.  The coach  takes  a  nonjudgmental  stance  and  uses open-ended  questions,  pausing,  paraphrasing, and probing for specificity. The skillful coach focuses on group members' perceptions, thinking,  and  decision-making  processes  to  mediate  resources  for  self-directedness  (Costa  and Garmston, 2015).\n\n## Consulting\n\nTo  consult  is  to  have  your  expertise  be used  by  others. A  consultant  can  be  an  information  specialist  or  an  advocate  for  content or  process.  As  an  information  specialist,  the consultant delivers technical knowledge to the group.  As  a  content  advocate,  the  consultant encourages  group  members  to  use  a  certain instructional  strategy,  adopt  a  particular  curriculum, or purchase a specific brand of computer.  As  a  process  advocate,  the  consultant influences  the  group's  methodology,  such  as by recommending an open rather than a closed meeting  to  increase  trust  in  the  system.  To effectively consult, one must have trust, commonly  defined  goals,  and  the  group's  desired outcomes clearly in mind (Block, 1981).\n\n## Marshaling the Energy for Changing Schools\n\nCarl  Glickman  (1998)  writes  that  without  the  will  to  change  for  the  better,  all  re-\n\nsources  and  management  schemes  will  have little effect. 'This issue of will-wanting to be better-is critical  to  understanding  how  longterm policies, allocation of resources, and work conditions can or cannot work' (p. 3).\n\nTwo  major  problems  related  to  change confront  all  groups.  One  is  adapting  to  and surviving  in  the  external  environment.  The other is developing internally to support daily functioning and increase the capacity to adapt (Shein,  1992).  Groups  either  develop  toward greater inclusion and effectiveness or dissolve through fragmentation and disarray. Changing the  structure  of  the  group  or  teaching  group members  skills  does  not  guarantee  growth toward  increased  group  performance.  Helping  members to pay attention to basic energy sources within the group encourages the development of these resources and permits learned skills  to  be  applied  and  structures  to  be  reinvented for greater impact.\n\nGroup development is  accelerated  by  the following five intervention approaches, which we will elaborate on in chapter 10.\n\n- 1. Structure  the  environment  to  release  and enhance energy sources.\n- 2. Teach  about  the  five  energy  sources  of high-performing groups.\n- 3. Mediate selected intervention points.\n- 4. Model the five energy sources.\n- 5. Monitor evidence and artifacts of selected energy sources.\n\nThe  five  energy  sources,  drawn  from  the work of Costa and Garmston (2015) and members of the Institute for Intelligent Behavior, are discussed below.\n\n## Efficacy\n\nThe group believes in its capacity to produce  results  and  stays  the  course  through internal  and  external  difficulties  to  achieve goals.  The  group  aligns  energies  within  itself in pursuit of its outcomes.\n\n## Flexibility\n\nThe group regards situations from multiple perspectives, works creatively with uncertainty and  ambiguity,  and  values  and  utilizes  differences within itself and the larger community of which it is part. The group attends to rational and intuitive ways of working.\n\n## Craftsmanship\n\nThe  group  strives  for  clarity  in  its  values,  goals,  and  standards.  It  applies  these  as criteria  for  its  planning,  actions,  reflections, and refinements. It attends to both short- and long-term  time  perspectives.  It  continually refines  communication  processes  within  and beyond the group.\n\n## Consciousness\n\nThe group monitors its decisions, actions, and reflections based on its values, norms, and common goals. Members are aware of the impact  of  their  actions  on  each  other,  the  entire group, and outside individuals and groups.\n\n## Interdependence\n\nThe group values its internal and external relationships. It seeks reciprocal influence and learning.  Members  treat  conflict  as  an  opportunity  to  learn  about  themselves,  their  own group,  and  other  groups.  The  group  trusts  its interactions and the processes of dialogue and discussion.\n\n## Simple Rules Govern Complex Behavior\n\nIn  this  book  we  are  attempting  to  frame the complex work of developing and facilitating collaborative groups. Although the frameworks, lenses, and tools we offer might seem a bit overwhelming at first, underneath them are some simple principles that guide our work.\n\nThis  simplicity  is  illustrated  in  a  story related  by  M.  Mitchell  Waldrop  in  his  book Complexity: The Emerging Science at the Edge of  Order  and  Chaos (1992).  Complexity  is the study of intricate dynamical systems. It is an  integrative  science  in  which  economists, biologists, ecologists, meteorologists, and specialists  from  other  fields  connect  to  explore the  underlying  principles  that  govern  natural and human systems. Much of the work is done using high-powered computers to simulate natural and designed systems.\n\nCraig Reynolds of the Symbolics Corporation in Los Angeles is one such researcher. He designed a computer program that captures the essence  of  the  flocking  behavior  of  birds,  the herding  behavior  of  sheep,  and  the  schooling behavior  of  fish.  The  elegance  of  his  design was in not trying to build rules into the group. Instead,  the  rules  resided  within  the  individuals.  He  created  a  collection  of  autonomous, birdlike  agents  he  called boids .  Each  'boid' was programmed with three simple rules:\n\n- 1. Maintain a minimum distance from other objects in the environment, including other 'boids.'\n- 2. Match the velocity of other 'boids' in your vicinity.\n- 3. Move toward the perceived center  of  the mass of other 'boids' in your vicinity.\n\nThere  was  no  superintendent  of  'boids.' None of  these  rules  said  to  form  a  flock,  yet flocks  formed  every  time  the  program  ran. 'Boids'  would  at  first  be  scattered  around the  computer  screen  but  would  soon  flock up.  Flocks  were  able  to  fly  around  obstacles or  break  into  subflocks  to  fly  around  objects, coming  together  again  on  the  other  side.  On one occasion a 'boid' banged into a pole, lost its  bearings  momentarily,  then  darted  forward to rejoin the flock.\n\nIf  simple  rules  govern  complex  behavior in  groups,  what  might  be  some  simple  rules for group members to follow? We propose the following:\n\n- 1. Take care of me . It is each group member's groundedness,  resourcefulness,  and  energy that develops the synergy that makes high-performing groups possible.\n- 2. Take care of us . It is our interdependence, interactions, and caring for each other and the group that motivates us to want to continue to work together.\n- 3. Take  care  of  our  values .  It  is  our  values that  drive  our  goal  clarity  about  who  we are, how we want to be together, and what we will accomplish for students.\n\nIn chapters 4 and 5 we explore these simple rules in action as we discuss group-member capabilities, the seven norms of collaboration, and two ways of talking in groups.\n\nWho  teachers  are  to  one  another  is  as important  as  who  they  are  to  their  students. In high-performing  and  improving  schools, studies  show  that  collaboration  is  the  norm. We  are  not  talking  here  about  project-based collaboration  or  the  'contrived  collegiality' described  by  Hargreaves  and  Dawe  (1990)  in which administrators create tasks and agendas to occupy teachers' collective energies. Rather, we are referring to sharing expertise and perspectives  on  teaching  and  learning  processes, examining data on students, and developing a sense  of  mutual  support  and  shared  responsibility for effective instruction.\n\n## Chapter 4 Developing Collaborative Norms\n\nW e once observed a faculty during a September meeting. Eight teachers, new to the school were studiously attentive to the veterans, emulating their patterns of interaction. This was a vivid example of one essential benefit of establishing norms of collaboration: they are normative-that is, they become a model for newcomers, and are especially valuable in schools with high teacher turnover.\n\nIn this chapter we reveal the metacognitive skills  of  effective  group  members,  show  why collaborative inquiry is at the heart of improving  student  achievement  and  describe  seven norms  of  collaboration.  Groups  who  employ these  norms  in  conversations  about  student learning consistently develop the social capital that improves  collective  teaching  expertise (Hargreaves and Fullan, 2012).\n\nis  only  one  element  of  group  success.  (See chapter 8 for more on the role and skills of the facilitator  and  chapter  3  for  a  description  of four leadership roles.) Individual group members need consciousness and lenses for shaping personal decisions and behaviors in meetings.\n\nWorking  in  groups  is  a  natural  condition of human life. Since the dawn of humanity on the  plains  of Africa,  bands,  clans,  tribes,  and families  have  collaborated  for  defense,  food gathering,  and  ceremonial  purposes.  Work  in groups  is  often  difficult,  filled  with  conflicts and tensions, but it is also absolutely necessary for achieving results in modern organizations.\n\nEach group member must balance personal goals  with  collective  goals,  acquire  resources for  his  or  her  own  work,  and  share  those resources to support the work of others. Navigating the tensions between part and wholebetween  personal  autonomy  and  collaboration-is an ongoing feature of both the surface and the deep structure for any working group.\n\nMany  organizations  try  to  control  these tensions by using facilitators to shape and mold group energy and task focus. Although a person in such a role can often make a difference in  a  group's  performance,  a  skilled  facilitator\n\nAll surface behaviors are driven by inner awareness  and  ongoing  calibration  of  deeper values.  Skillful  group  members  monitor  and adjust  their behaviors  to  support  the  other group members and the group as a whole. To operate with sufficient flexibility, group members  need  self-awareness  and  self-monitoring skills  to  guide  their  choice  making.  Skillful facilitators  increase  this  awareness  by  shining the  light  of  reflection  on  group  processes  and by supporting group members in reflecting on the behavioral decisions they are making.\n\nFour capabilities shape the self-monitoring system  of  high  performing  group  members. These in turn organize and drive seven norms of collaboration. The seven norms are the dayto-day  working  tools  for  both  skilled  group members and skilled facilitators.\n\n## The Four GroupMember Capabilities\n\nWe  first realized  the  special  power  of focusing  on  capabilities  as  part  of  a  group\n\nthat was  developing  'Cognitive  Coaching' with Art Costa and other colleagues from the Institute  for  Intelligent  Behavior. A  capability names what a person is able to do. It is different from capacity, which refers to how much one can  hold.  Capabilities  are  the  metacognitive awarenesses with which people determine how to use, when to use, or when not to use certain skills.  Capabilities  therefore  organize  and  direct the use of skills; they influence the application and effectiveness of knowledge and skills.\n\nThe  four  group-member  capabilities  are as follows:\n\n- 1. To know one's intentions and choose congruent behaviors;\n- 2. To set  aside  unproductive  patterns  of  listening, responding, and inquiring;\n- 3. To know when to self-assert and when to integrate;\n- 4. To know and support the group's purposes, topics, processes, and development.\n\n## To Know One's Intentions and Choose Congruent Behaviors\n\nClarity of intention drives attention, which in  turn  drives  the  what  and  how  of  a  group member's meeting participation. This is true in the moment and over time. This clarity precedes and influences the three other capabilities. It is the source of impulse control, patience, strategic listening, and strategic speaking.\n\nThis capability is the foundation for flexible  and  effective  behavior.  If,  for  example, a  person's  intention  is  to  positively  influence the  thinking  of  others,  various  behaviors  can be used congruently with that intention: under some circumstances, a paraphrase will convey an attempt to understand and open the door for reciprocal  understanding;  in  some  situations, direct  advocacy  will  be  persuasive;  in  other cases,  an  inquiry  into  the  thinking  of  another speaker might more effectively influence point of view.\n\n## To Set Aside Unproductive Patterns of Listening, Responding, and Inquiring\n\nFor each meeting participant, there are two audiences. One is external, made up of the other group members. The other is internal, made up of the feelings, pictures, and talk going on inside each individual. Group members need to continually decide which audience to serve.\n\nThree  major  set-aside  areas  focus  this choice and allow fuller and more nonjudgmental participation. They are as follows:\n\n- 1. To  set  aside  autobiographical  listening, responding, and inquiring: 'Me too!'\n- 2. To set aside inquisitive listening, responding, and inquiring: 'Tell me more!'\n- 3. To  set  aside  solution  listening,  responding,  and  inquiring:  'I  know  what  you need to do!'\n\nThe  autobiographical  frame  leads  to  several  problems  in  group  work.  The  first  is  the filtering process that goes on when individuals try to hear another's story through the lens of their own experiences. Although this can be a source of empathy, it can also lead to distortion and miscommunication.\n\nThis type of listening, responding, and inquiring, while typically the way people listen, is  a  major source of wasted time in meetings. It  often  triggers  endless  storytelling  in  which everyone  around  the  table  shares  a  related anecdote.  This  is  dinner  party  conversation, not  productive meeting talk. Each member of the eighth-grade team does not have to relate a discipline horror story. Instead, the team could more  productively  spend  its  time  developing a collective understanding of the students and their  needs  and  generate  appropriate  response patterns to elicit desired behaviors.\n\nThe  inquisitive  frame  is  sometimes  triggered  by  the  autobiographical.  People  inquire to see how others' stories compare to their own. Pure curiosity also motivates inquisitive listening, responding, and inquiring. A critical question at this juncture is 'How much detail do we\n\nneed to move this item?' This is an example of what we call a naive question. (See appendix A for other examples of naive questions.) Such questions can be asked by any group member. The  purpose  is  to  focus  attention  on  critical matters and avoid unnecessary specificity.\n\nThe  solution  frame  is  deeply  embedded in  the  psyche  of  educators.  Status,  rewards, and identity are all tied up with being a good problem solver. The pressure of time in schools pushes  people  toward  action  and  away  from reflection. The downside of this pattern is that groups and group members get trapped in situations and action plans before they have time to fully understand the perspectives of others.\n\nThe solution frame also stifles the generation of new possibilities. It gets in the way of developing alternative ways of framing issues and  problems,  pushing  groups  toward  action before creating and clarifying clear outcomes.\n\n## To Know When to Self-Assert and When to Integrate\n\nIn  productive  groups,  each  member  must decide  when  to  self-assert  and  when  to  integrate with the group. In one group, a member confided  to  us  that  she  was  concerned  about the autocratic disposition of the new chairman. Although  she  valued  the  directness  that  he brought to the group's work, she was concerned that  they  would  lose  collective  ownership  if she or other group members did not advocate for their own ideas and perspectives. Her issue, and  the  tension  for  each  group  member,  was when  to  challenge  and  when  to  go  with  the flow.  Self-assertion  and  integration  are  conscious choices only when group members have personal  clarity  about  their  own  intentions  as well  as  a  knowledge  of  and  a  willingness  to support the group's outcomes and methods.\n\nSelf-assertion  does  not  necessarily  mean self-focus.  It  can  mean  asserting  oneself  into the  flow  of  group  interactions  to  refocus  the group on a topic or on a process. It can mean reminding others of the purpose of the meeting when the conversation strays off course. It can also  mean  speaking  up  and  advocating  topics and processes.\n\nWhen individual group members integrate, they  align  their  energy  with  the  content  and processes of the meeting. During dialogue they suspend  judgments  and  counterarguments  in an  attempt  to  understand  viewpoints  different  from  their  own.  During  discussions,  they follow  the  flow  of  logic  and  reasoning  as  it emerges. In this way, solutions satisfying to the group as a whole are more likely to emerge.\n\nConsensus  decision  making  is  the  ultimate test of this capability. This procedure assumes that participants know when and how to self-assert and when and how to integrate, both during and after the decision-making process. The next two chapters describe ways of talking in  groups  as  well  as  principles  and  practices for successful meetings. In these chapters you will find many ideas and examples of places for self-assertion and for integration.\n\n## To Know and Support the Group's Purposes, Topics, Processes, and Development\n\nAll ongoing groups need to balance three simultaneous  agendas. The  first  is  task  focus, which is the ultimate expression of the group's purpose.  The  second  agenda  is  process  skills development.  Without  continued  attention  to expanding  repertoire  and  skills,  the  group stagnates and does not increase its capacity for handling more complex work in the future. The third agenda is group development. All groups exist on a continuum from novice to expert performance.  Experience  alone  is  an  insufficient teacher.  Many  longstanding  groups  operate  at novice levels of performance. In chapter 9 we elaborate on concepts of group development.\n\nHigh-performing groups are adaptive groups.  They  learn  from  experience  and  improve  the  way  they  work.  In  supporting  the group's  purposes,  topics,  processes,  and  development,  individual  group  members  make\n\na  commitment  to  this  shared  learning  and  to personal learning.\n\nThe paradoxes of work in groups establish the  essential  tensions  that  groups  and  their individuals must continually resolve. The four group-member  capabilities  supply  metacognitive and emotional filters for decisions, choices, and  behaviors.  All  this  requires  a  toolkit  for productive group work.\n\n## Promoting a Spirit of Inquiry\n\nHigh-functioning groups and group members infuse their work with a spirit of inquiry. Inquiry is central to professional communities that  produce  stable  gains  in  student  learning. Learning  at  its  root  is  a  questioning  process, and successful collaboration embraces the patterns and practices of inquiry. Inquiry presumes an openness to and an investment in the ideas of others. Physicist David Bohm has noted that thought is 'largely a collective phenomenon.' These  thoughts,  like  electrons,  are  shaped  by their interactions with others (Senge, 1990).\n\nTo inquire is to ask, be curious, invite the transmission  of  thoughts  or  feelings,  confer, consult,  wonder,  request,  examine,  and  investigate  ideas.  David  Hackett  Fischer,  a  Pulitzer prize-winning historian, observed that questions 'are the engines of intellect-cerebral machines that  convert  curiosity  into  controlled  inquiry' (Berger,  2014,  p.  15).  Richard  Elmore  (2000) points out that 'the knowledge we need to solve problems [in schools] often doesn't reside close at hand; it has to be found through active inquiry and analysis' (p. 13). Such interactions are not always the norm in schools. Collaborative work is  fraught  with  the  tensions  and  the  fears  of being judged or of being perceived as one who might be judging others.\n\nTeaching as a private practice has a deep cultural  history.  Breaking  and  reshaping  the patterns within a culture requires both skill and commitment to the ongoing process of building community. Teaching in many ways has traditionally  been  a  'telling'  profession.  Teachers tell students what they need to know and how to do the things they need to learn how to do. This 'telling' behavior often carries over into patterns of adult communication as we tell others our stories, thoughts, and opinions or wait for our turn to do so. This culture of advocacy defines much of the interaction in adult groups. We  are  often  caught  up  in  the  tyranny  of or (Collins  and  Porras,  1997).  The  'or'  in  the statements that things must be right or wrong, true or false, yes or no causes these declarations to be dichotomous.\n\nDichotomous  thinking  leads  to  dichotomous questions, which in turn polarize group members. The art of asking invitational questions that avoid these dichotomies is the heart of collaborative inquiry. Invitational questions form connections between people and ideas as well as between ideas and other ideas.\n\nAll  group  work  is  about  relationships. Relationships shape and define patterns of discourse. These relationships are shaped by who initiates  a  query  and  the  form  of  that  query. Who responds and how he or she responds is a  direct  result  of  the  ways  in  which  a  group member initiates a topic.  Form,  function,  and outcome  are  linked  within  an  emotional  and social  system  that,  when  handled  with  care, opens  and  expands  thought  and  creates  new possibilities.  For  example,  a  person  initiating a  topic  with,  'One  idea  we  might  consider  is .  .  .'  will  result  in  a  totally  different  response from a person initiating a topic with, 'I think we should . . .' The former will elicit responses from more group members, who will treat the idea  as  a  possibility,  not  a  decision.  Those respondents  will  also  be  inclined  to  generate more  ideas,  increasing  the  group's  flexibility. The second response will increase the possibility of defensiveness among group members and discourage the generation of new ideas.\n\nThe patterns of inquiry built with the tools of  the  seven  norms  of  collaboration  lead  to deeper  understanding  and  to  better-informed action. This understanding and these actions can be internal for participants and external in their behaviors.  As  we  grapple  with  ideas  and  perspectives we come to know others and ourselves\n\nmore deeply. To do so requires us to reflect on our  inner  and  outer  reactions  to  data,  information,  and  events.  Purposeful  inquiry  helps  us to  interpret  personal  and  collective  values  and the implications of these as we live them out in our organizations. Skillful inquiry also helps us to clarify our priorities for a topic on the table. Where does this issue fit within the bigger picture?  In  what  ways  is  this  topic  important  and in what ways might this topic be a distraction?\n\nIn the end, what we talk about and how we talk to one another is a way of acting out our beliefs about the world and the way it works, our  beliefs  about  the  group  and  its  purposes, and our beliefs about our personal place in both arenas.  What  we  talk  about  and  how  we  talk also  defines  who  we  are  and  ultimately  who we become. By promoting a spirit  of  inquiry within our groups, we make an investment in our personal and collective futures.\n\n## What the Norms of Collaboration Are Not\n\nOccasionally  groups  establish  working agreements  to  set  standards  within  a  specific meeting  or  series  of  meetings  for  a  group. These  are  different  from  the  seven  norms  in two ways. First, they are group and setting specific. Second, they are developed by a group to guide behaviors when that group is convened. Some common examples are: start and end on time,  come  prepared,  and  listen  respectfully. To arrive at these a facilitator might invite the group to brainstorm agreements they might like to  make  in  order  to  maximize  group  success when they meet. After brainstorming, the group clarifies the posted ideas. Finally the group selects five to seven agreements most important to them. These are posted on the wall or appear on each subsequent meeting agenda.\n\nAnother approach to working agreements occurs  when  a  group  is  meeting  only  once and time is limited. In these cases, a facilitator might display, then ask for agreement on a set of agreements.\n\n## Working Agreement Examples\n\n- \u00b7 Demonstrate  mutual  respect.  Respect  people  and  ideas.  Respecting others  does  not  equate  to  agreeing with them.\n- \u00b7 Employ skillful listening. Seek first to understand, then to be understood.\n- \u00b7 Develop sufficient consensus. Work to  understand all views, distinguish between  dialogue  and  discussion, give each person an equal voice, and reach 75 percent agreement of those present to constitute consensus.\n\nWe  offer  two  cautions  about  working agreements.  For  groups  that  already  have  a successful group history they are unnecessary and  establishing  them  runs  the  risk  of  presuming members would not select productive behaviors without this step. This can have an infantilizing  effect  on  members.  Next,  should groups establish them, monitoring is necessary. 'Once  groups  establish  rules,  the  facilitator must make sure that group members follow the working agreements. From time to time, individuals might need to violate a rule by leaving early  or  taking  an  emergency  phone  call;  as long as deviations are outside of the agreement, no one will care. When bad habits become the de facto working agreement, everyone notices' (Garmston  and  Zimmerman,  2013,  p.  54). Since  an  overarching  aim  of  group  work  is self-directedness, self-monitoring is best.\n\nIn  contrast  to  working  agreements,  the seven norms are not only a tool kit for inquiry but for developing and sustaining collaborative cultures  capable  of  making  the  best  decisions for students. Such cultures, as we shall describe later,  engage  in  cognitive  conflict,  a  type  of conflict  that  in  its  absence  leads  to  poor  decisions,  limited  follow-through,  and  too  often Balkanizing or apathy.\n\n## The Seven Norms of Collaboration\n\nSeveral years ago our friend and colleague Bill Baker commented that organizations have been  training  the  wrong  people.  Instead  of spending  time  and  energy  developing  more skilled  facilitators,  he  said,  they  should  develop  group  members'  skills  as  the  way  to improve practice and success. Our experience bears out the wisdom of this approach. When group members are knowledgeable and skilled, anyone  with  simple  knowledge  of  facilitation principles and moves can facilitate constructive group work.\n\nDrawing  from  the  'Cognitive  Coaching' model (Costa and Garmston, 2015); the work of  Peter  Senge  (1990);  the  work  of  Baker, Costa,  and  Shalit  (1997);  and  refinements  by Dolcemascolo and McKanders (2014) we have adapted  and  updated  this  set  of  norms  of collaboration as the tools for productive communication  between  members  of  a  working community. These are as follows:\n\n- 1. Pausing;\n- 2. Paraphrasing;\n- 3. Posing questions;\n- 4. Placing ideas on the table;\n- 5. Providing data;\n- 6. Paying attention to self and others;\n- 7. Presuming positive intentions.\n\nReflect on your typical behavior in some group  with  which  you  regularly  work.  Before reading  the  following  descriptions  of the  norms  of  collaboration,  do  the  following  self-assessment.  In  the  list  above  put  a checkmark after the norms to which you pay conscious attention in most meetings with the group you have in mind.\n\nThere  is  a  marked  difference  between skills  and  norms.  A  skill  is  something  that someone knows how to do. A skill becomes a norm when it is normal behavior in the group.\n\nWhen this occurs, the  behavior  becomes  normative  for  new  group  members,  who  model their own behavior on the standards tacitly set by group veterans.\n\nWhen  the  seven  norms  of  collaborative work become an established part of group life and group work, cohesion, energy, and commitment to shared work and to the group increase dramatically. The seven norms serve as guides and benchmarks in groups, in hallway conversations, with parents and students, and in the staff room. As they become established within the working substrate, they teach and remind all members, both veterans and newcomers,  that  this  is  the  way  we  talk  to  each other around here.\n\nIn  our  follow-up  work  with  clients,  this phenomenon is reported time and again. An assistant superintendent shared with us that when one  or  two  people  in  a  meeting  practice  the norms,  the  behavior  of  other  group  members becomes more effective.\n\nA  major  tension  is  that  all  groups  have more tasks to accomplish than time in which to  accomplish  them.  Yet  any  group  that  is too  busy  to  reflect  on  process  is  too  busy  to improve. The seven norms become goals for collective  growth.  In  adaptive  schools,  individuals  and  groups  select  goals  from  among the seven norms. They practice, monitor, and reflect  on  the  impact  of  the  norms  for  themselves and for the group.\n\nEach norm is deceptively simple. Most are skills that people regularly apply in one-to-one communications. The irony is that these seemingly simple behaviors are rare in many meetings. Inquiring into the ideas of others increases the  capacity  for  group  members  to  influence each  other.  Pausing  and  paraphrasing  are  often missing, especially when things get tense. Posing  questions  for  specificity  is  forgotten when members presume to understand others' meanings. This can lead to later confusion and complication.  Presuming  positive  intentions prevents  members from judging others.  Interpersonal  judgments  spawn  blocked  thinking\n\nand negative presuppositions. See appendix B through E for self and group assessment inventories. We offer the following explanations of the norms as a rationale for their importance.\n\n## Pausing\n\nThere is a vast research base on the positive effects of teacher pausing and silence on student  thinking.  The  'wait  time'  research of  Mary  Budd  Rowe  (1986)  has  been  replicated around the world. Thinking takes time. High-level  thinking  takes  even  longer.  This research  indicates  that  it  takes  from  three  to five seconds for most human brains to process high-level thoughts.\n\nNot  all  brains  work  the  same  way.  This is  especially  evident  in  meetings  and  group work. Some people prefer to think out loud and construct their ideas externally; others prefer to process ideas internally and reflect and analyze before speaking. The external processors often get in the way of the internal processors. This can be an alienating experience for deliberate, internal  thinkers.  The  meeting  topics  move by  before  the  internal  processers  have  had  a chance to contribute.\n\nThe  members  of  one  middle  school  team with whom we worked began to laugh at themselves  after  completing  the  Norms  of  Collaboration  Group  Inventory  (appendix  C).  When we  inquired,  they  said  they'd  been  working together for more than two years and had yet to make a decision. In their group, if you stopped to breathe while speaking, you lost the floor. Consequently, they all had tremendous lung power and claimed they could each talk for hours on a single inhalation. What they recognized was that without a norm of pausing, meetings became a competition for air space. They soon learned to monitor pauses at several junctures to increase their productivity and satisfaction.\n\nGroups become skilled at pausing at four places  in  the  flow  of  their  conversations. The first pause occurs after asking a question or offering a paraphrase. This allows initial process- ing time for those responding to the question or reflecting on the paraphrase. The second pause occurs  after  someone  speaks.  Human  beings think  and  speak  in  bursts.  With  additional processing  time,  more  responders  organize thoughts into more coherent speech. The third place  to  pause  is  before  paraphasing  or  questioning. A  group  in  Istanbul  told  us  that  they initiated  a  five-second  pause  rule  after  each speaker. Meetings became less stressful, more respectful, thoughtful, and more productive.\n\nIn  the  original  wait-time  research  with students,  when  teachers  paused  after  asking questions  and  after  the  students'  initial  responses, the length of the responses increased from 300 percent to 700 percent, depending on the  socioeconomic  status  (SES)  of  the  child. The lower-SES children had the greatest gains.\n\nThe first two pauses require the questioner and  other  group  members  to  monitor  and control  their  own  behavior.  These  are  pauses to  give  other  people  time  to  think.  This  is personal  reflection  time  in  which  that  person waits  before  answering.  Sometimes  one  says, 'Give me a moment to think about that before answering.' At other times one acknowledges the question nonverbally, goes inside oneself to think, and then responds to the question. This is also a nice way to model thoughtfulness for others and can be an important normative behavior in groups.\n\nA fourth place for pausing in meetings is a collective pause. This can be formally structured or can occur spontaneously. These shared pauses allow ideas and questions to settle in and allow time  for  note  taking  and  reflection.  The  intent of these breaks in the action is to create shared cognitive space for the group and its members.\n\nPausing  gets  blood  and  nutrients  to  the neocortex  and  begins  a  pattern  followed  by paraphrasing  and  questioning.  Groups  give themselves a powerful gift when they establish this pattern as a norm; pause, paraphrase, and pose  questions  for  a  wider  range  of  thoughts or for details; and pause, paraphrase, and pose questions about feelings.\n\n## Principles of Paraphrasing\n\n- \u00b7 Attend fully.\n- \u00b7 Listen with the intention to understand.\n- \u00b7 Capture the essence of the message.\n- \u00b7 Reflect the essence of voice tone and gestures.\n- \u00b7 Make  the  paraphrase  shorter  than the original statement.\n- \u00b7 Paraphrase  before  asking  a  question. Use the pronoun 'you,' instead of 'I.'\n\n(Costa  and  Garmston  revised  by  Hayes and Ellison, 2014)\n\n## Paraphrasing\n\nParaphrasing  is  one  of  the  most  valuable and  least  used  communication  tools  in  meetings. It  is  the  key  practice  in  authentic  listening.  Even  people  who  naturally  and  skillfully paraphrase in one-to-one settings often neglect this  vital  behavior  in  group  settings.  Groups that develop consciousness about paraphrasing and give themselves permission to use this reflection tool become clearer and more cohesive about their work.\n\nTry this experiment. Paraphrase, then ask a question. Do this several times. Now ask questions without preceding them with paraphrases. Since a well-crafted paraphrase communicates 'I  am trying to understand you, and therefore I value what you have to say' and establishes a relationship between people and ideas, questions  preceded  by  paraphrases  will  be  perceived similarly. Questions by themselves, no matter how artfully constructed, put a degree of psychological  distance  between  the  asker  and the asked. Paraphrasing aligns the parties and creates a safe environment for thinking (Lipton and Wellman, 1998).\n\nWe refer to paraphrases that invite thinking and reflect the speaker's content and the speaker's emotions about the content as mediational paraphrases. These can acknowldge, organize, or frame a level of abstraction for holding the content.  The  paraphrase  reflects  content  back to  the  speaker  for  further  consideration  and connects that response to the flow of discourse emerging within the group. Such paraphrasing creates permission to pose questions for details and elaboration. Without the paraphrase, some group members may perceive posing questions as interrogation.\n\nKnowing when to paraphrase in groups is a gained skill. Acknowledging paraphrases often occur when emotion is detected and in response to initial statements to estalish expectations for listening. Organizing paraphrases are employed to capture contributions of several speakers on a topic or when individuals might have offered a  series  of  ideas. As  can  be  seen  in  table  4.1 abstracting  paraphrases  support  conceptual  or 'things' thinking.\n\n## The Structure and Flow of Effective Paraphrasing\n\nListen  and  observe  carefully  to  calibrate the  content  and  emotions  of  the  speaker.  Signal your intention to paraphrase. This is done by  modulating  intonation  with  the  use  of  an approachable  voice  and  by  opening  with  a reflective  stem.  Such  stems  put  the  focus  and emphasis  on  the  speaker's  ideas,  not  on  the paraphraser's interpretation of those ideas.\n\nFor example, reflective paraphrases should not  use  the  pronoun  'I.'  The  phrase  'What  I think I hear you saying' signals to many speakers that their thoughts no longer matter and that the paraphraser is now going to insert his or her own ideas into the conversation.\n\nThe following paraphrase stems signal that a paraphrase is coming:\n\nYou're suggesting . . .\n\nYou're proposing . . .\n\nSo what you're wondering is . . .\n\nSo you are thinking that . . .\n\nHmm, you're pondering the effects of . . .\n\nSo your hunch is that . . .\n\nTable 4.1 . Balancing Inquiry and Advocacy\n\n## The Structure of Inquiry\n\nAsk others to make their thinking visible.\n\nUse nonaggressive language and an approachable voice. 'Can you help me understand your thinking here?'\n\nUse a pattern of pause, paraphrase, pause, and probe or inquire.\n\nUse exploratory language. 'What are some of . . . ? How might you . . . ? What are your hunches about . . . ?'\n\nInquire about values, beliefs, goals, assumptions, examples, or significance. 'How does this relate to your values, beliefs, goals, or assumptions? What are some examples of what you think might happen if we act on your proposal? In what ways does this relate to your other concerns?'\n\nExplain your reasons for inquiring. 'I'm asking about your assumptions here because . . . ' Invite introspection. 'What questions do you have about your own thinking?' Compare your assumptions to theirs.\n\nInvestigate other assumptions. 'Would you be willing to have each of us list our assumptions, compare them, and explore if there might be other assumptions about this issue?'\n\nCheck your understanding of what is being said by pausing, paraphrasing, and inquiring. 'So your main concern is the way our team is interacting and you'd like to see more cohesion and focused energy. What are some of your thoughts about how this might look and sound in action?' Test what others say by asking for broader contexts and examples. 'How might your proposal affect . . . ? In what ways is this similar to . . . ? Please share a typical example of . . . '\n\nReveal your listening processes. 'I have been listening for themes. So far I've heard two. Are there others?'\n\n## The Structure of Advocacy\n\nMake your thinking and reasoning visible.\n\nState your assumptions. 'Here is what I assume are the causes of . . . '\n\nDescribe your reasoning. 'I came to this conclusion because . . . '\n\nDescribe your feelings. 'I feel _______ about this because . . . '\n\nDistinguish data from interpretation. 'These are the data I have. I'll share them as objectively as possible. Now here is what I think the data mean . . . '\n\nReveal your perspective. 'I'm seeing this from the viewpoint of . . . '\n\nFrame the wider context that surrounds this issue. 'Several groups would be affected by what I propose.'\n\nGive concrete examples. 'To get a clear picture, imagine that you are in a new school and . . . '\n\n## Test your assumptions and conclusions.\n\nEncourage others to explore your model, assumptions, and data. 'What do you think about what I have just said? Do you see any flaws in my reasoning? What might you add?'\n\nReveal where you are least clear. 'Here's one area that you might help me think through . . . '\n\nStay open. Encourage others to provide different points of view. 'In what ways do you see it differently?'\n\nSearch for generalizations, deletions, and distortions. 'In what I've presented, do any of you believe that I might have overgeneralized, left out data, or reported data incorrectly?'\n\nChoose  a  type  of  paraphrase  with  which to respond. There are three broad categories of paraphase types, each with a specific function. We have refined our thinking about these since the  last  edition.  One  discovery  is  that  sometimes people infer that the three types should be used in sequence. This is not the case, though it is not unusual to begin conversations with the intention of acknowledging the speaker.\n\n- 1. Acknowledging . If  the  paraphrase  is  not completely accurate, the speaker will offer corrections.  'So  you're  concerned  about the  budgeting  process  and  ways  to  get input early.'\n- 2. Organizing . Offer themes and 'containers' to organize several statements or separate jumbled  issues.  This  is  an  especially  important  type  of  paraphrase  to  use  when multiple  speakers  contribute  to  a  topic. 'There appear to be two issues here. One is resource  allocation  and  the  other  is the  impact  of  those  decisions  on  student learning.' In video 4.1, the faciliator poses a  question,  listens  to  the  group,  then  responds with an organizing paraphrase.\n- 3. Abstracting . Listen  deeply  for  meaning then  shift  to  a  higher  or  lower  level  of abstraction.  This  paraphrase  invites  the speaker to think at levels either more abstract or concrete in an manner congruent with  the Ladder  of  Abstraction (Hayakawa,  1939).  In  video  4.3,  the  facilitator offers an abstracting paraphrase and 'How to work with a person who is threatened.' paraphrase by naming the common ground in  the  four  responses  she  has  heard  from the group.\n\nVideo 4.1.\n\nVideo 4.3.\n\n'So a goal for you is . . .' or, 'An assumption  you  have  is.  .  .  .'  Paraphrasing  within a  flow  of  discourse  often  moves  through  a starting  point  of  acknowledging,  then  using each  of  three  forms  of  paraphrase  depending on intention in the moment. Paraphrases move to a higher level of abstraction when they name concepts, goals, values, and assumptions: 'So a major goal here is to define fairness in the budgeting processes and compare those criteria to the operating values of the school.' 'So you are valuing depth over breadth.' Paraphrases move to  a  lower  level  of  abstraction  when  concepts require  grounding  in  details:  'So  fair  might mean  that  we  construct  a  needs  assessment form for each department to fill out and submit to the site council for public consideration.'\n\n## Learning Styles and Paraphrasing\n\nParaphrases that summarize or shift the abstraction level of discourse support and stretch the thinking styles of different group members. Global  thinkers  appreciate  paraphrases  that separate  and  organize  'thinking  in  progress.' At  other  times  the  shift  down  in  level  of  abstraction grounds global thinkers in specific examples and concrete details.  Concrete,  highly sequential  thinkers  learn  from  the  shift  up  to higher  levels  of  abstraction.  This  helps  them to explore a bigger picture and creates a wider context for thinking.\n\n## Posing Questions\n\nThes first two norms are the platform for inquiry.  In  practice,  inquiry  follows  a  pattern of pausing, paraphrasing, and questioning. The tonal and syntactical stucture of questions can\n\namplify  or  reduce  any  perceived  danger  that the  listener  might  hear  in  the  inquiry.  Deep in our  biological  wiring  we  have  a  finely tuned  threat-detecting  system.  The  molecules of emotion link to the molecules of cognition so  strongly  that  the  emotional  processing  circuits  of  the  brain  are  the  first  centers  to  filter incoming  messages.  Perceived  threats  trigger emotional  responses  that  can  inhibit  or  in some  way  interfere  with  high-level  thought. To reduce threat and to open thinking, persons skilled in posing questions apply the following template (Lipton and Wellman 2013).\n\nFull Attention . The invitation to think begins with  full  attention  to  others  in  the  group.  This makes our complete presence available for this conversation, which also indicates that we intend no  harm.  This  physical  message  meshes  with several verbal elements to form an invitation to think together about the ideas being explored.\n\nApproachable  Voice . Using  an  approachable  voice  is  the  next  element  of  the  invitation to think. This voice tone is well modulated and tends to rise at the end of a statement, summary, or question (Grinder, 1997). This tonal package envelops questions and comments, indicating the intention to invite and explore thinking and not to interrogate or challenge. In video 4.2, listen to the faciliator pose a question in an approachable voice and respond to the group using the concept of hopefulness in an abstraction paraphrase.\n\nVideo 4.2.\n\nPlural  Forms .  Two  important  syntactical choices invite colleagues to think with us. One is  to  use  plural  forms  to  increase  options  and possibilities  for  thinking.  The  use  of  plural forms sets aside the need for evaluation and the sorting of ideas. For instance, to inquire about someone's goals instead of their goal opens the realm  of  multiple  intentions  and  not  just  one course of action. Group members often need to hear their ideas aloud before they know which are most central to the issues before the group.\n\nTentative  Language . The  other  syntactical  element  is  the  use  of  tentative  phrasing  in statements  and  questions.  Words  like some , might , seems , possible ,  and hunches widen the potential range of responses and reduce the need for the listener to respond with confidence and surety. Words like could and why can decrease the confidence of listeners by seeming to ask for premature commitment or a need to defend ideas and actions that might not be fully developed.\n\nOpen-Ended  Forms . In  addition  to  employing the elements noted above, mediational facilitators and  group  members  frame  their questions  by  using  open-ended  forms.  These are  questions  that  cannot  be  answered  yes  or no.  For  example,  instead  of  asking  a  group, 'Does  anyone  have  any  ideas  to  add?'  they ask, 'What are some additional ideas we might add to the mix?' By eliminating dichotomous stems  such  as,  'Can  you,'  'Did  you,'  'Will you,' or 'Have you,' skilled questioners invite more productive thinking that puts inquiry first within the group.\n\n## Posing Questions to Explore Thinking\n\nUsing  the  elements  of  invitation,  we  pose questions  to  explore  thinking  by  asking  about perceptions, assumptions and interpretations, and invite others to inquire into their own thinking.\n\nExamples:\n\nWhat  might  be  some  of  the  assumptions  we have about . . . ?\n\nGiven our concern and knowledge of this issue, what  might  be  some  of  the  observations . . . ?\n\nAs we are considering the bigger picture, what might be some of the factors and . . . ?\n\nHow might  you  describe  your  feelings  about . . . ?\n\nWhat might be some reasons our four-year-olds ask more questions than our six-year-olds?\n\n## Posing Questions to Specify Thinking\n\nHuman brains are not  designed  for  specificity.  In  a  world swimming in details, brains form  quick  generalizations  from  fragments of  information.  Brains  delete  particulars  from streams of data and distort incoming and outgoing messages to fit deeply embedded models of reality (Bandler and Grinder, 1971). These are all natural processes; they do not willfully occur. Generalizations, deletions, and distortions are survival patterns hardwired into the human brain.  They  are  adaptations  to  the  challenges faced by our hunting and gathering ancestors. In  modern  times  these  same  traits  cause  difficulties in human  communication.  Conversations  go  haywire  when  the  various  parties make different assumptions about the meaning of words and concepts and neglect to verify or correct those assumptions. Problem definition, problem  solving,  and  solution  generation  all rely on specificity for success.\n\nFive  categories  of  vagueness  inhabit  human speech; these are described below.\n\n## Vague Nouns and Pronouns\n\nSomeone named 'they' makes most of the decisions  in  organizations.  'They'  are  joined by  'the  central  office,'  'the  administrators,' 'the union,' 'the parents,' 'the students,' and a  host  of  others  as  the  source  of  mysterious messages,  concerns,  and  directives.  Unless group members know who 'they' are, communication takes longer, and people do not always know how to treat the information.\n\nWhen  a  speaker  in  a  meeting  says  our students  can't  write,  someone  in  the  group should paraphrase then pose a question asking for details. It might sound like this: 'So you're concerned about student writing. What's your hunch  about  how  many  of  our  students  have writing difficulties?'\n\nAfter  the  speaker  answers,  the  logical  follow-up question would be about which areas of writing are of most concern. If the group discovers that a small number of students lacks specific skill,  they  can  develop  a  remediation  plan  for this  targeted  audience.  If  the  group  discovers that a large number of students has fundamental issues as writers, this calls for a more in-depth look at the patterns of curriculum and instruction in the school. Without the details, the group does not know which problem to solve.\n\n## Vague Verbs\n\nPlanning  and  problem-solving  sessions require specificity for targeted action. The verb plan itself means very different things to different people. Some think that it means scratching ideas  on  a  napkin;  others  imagine  timelines and flowcharts with names and dates attached. Groups have to define their verbs. Words like improve , enhance , design , modify ,  and understand are  all  examples  of  vague  verbs  used by working groups. Someone should begin by posing questions for specificity in order for the team to agree on concepts, plan for change, and act in concert.\n\nVague nouns and pronouns and vague verbs often  go  hand  in  hand.  A  statement  like  'We want  our  students  to  be  on  time  and  prepared for class' easily produces surface agreement in most  groups  of  educators.  It  is  only  when  we pose question about which students are not yet meeting these requirements and what the meanings of 'be on time' and 'be prepared' are that the issue can even be discussed rationally.\n\n## Comparators\n\n'This  meeting  was  much  better  than  last month's  session.'  Unless  the  group  discovers the  speaker's  criteria  for  better,  the  members will not know how to repeat the improvement or, for that matter, whether the speaker's 'better' is even desirable. Words like best , larger , slower , more ,  and least leave out the point of comparison and the standard for the comparison.\n\nWhen  undefined  comparators  are  used, pose  questions  about  criteria.  'So  you've  enjoyed  this  meeting.  What  were  some  of  the ways this was better for you?' The respondent here has been careful to ask the speaker for his or her criteria ('better for you'), which might not be important criteria to other group mem-\n\nbers. The intention is to draw the speaker out and expand the meaning of the statement.\n\n## Rule Words\n\nPeople  operate  with  conscious  and  unconscious  rules  about  how  the  world  works and  how  they  are  supposed  to  operate  in  it. These  rules  appear  in  language  when  people say things like 'We have to,' 'We must,' 'You shouldn't,' and 'I can't.'\n\nTo  clarify  these  rules  and  the  ways  that they  govern  behavior,  other  group  members should pose questions for the rules behind the statements: 'What would happen if we didn't?' 'Who  or  what  says  we  must?'  'Shouldn't? Who made up that rule?' 'What stops you?' Intonation  is  important  here.  The  voice  carrying  the  response  has  to  be  well  modulated, friendly, and nonthreatening.\n\n## Universal Quantifiers\n\n'Everyone  knows  that  this  program  is great.'  Words  and  phrases  like everyone , all , no one , never , and always are examples of universal quantifiers. Linguists use the term 'deity voice' to describe this type of language. It is spoken as if the statement contains a universal truth of which 'everyone' must be aware.\n\nAs most parents and middle school teachers  know,  universal  quantifiers  are  the  lingua franca of teenagers. 'I need to go to the mall; all  my  friends  will  be  there.'  The  typical  response  pattern  is  'All  your  friends?  I  can't imagine  that  all  your  friends'  parents  would permit them to go.'\n\nBy  qualifying  and  clarifying  a  universal  quantifier,  group  members  ground  their conversations  in  data  and  measurable  details. When someone makes the statement that 'These students never understand the assignments  the  first  time,'  another  participant  can pose questions to learn the meaning of never: 'Has  there  ever  been  a  time  when  students understood the first time around?' This can be followed up with an inquiry into the qualities and conditions of the assignments that are an exception to the initial statement.\n\n## Placing Ideas on the Table\n\nIdeas  are  the  heart  of  group  work.  In  order  to  be  effective,  they  must  be  released  to the  group.  'Here  is  an  idea  for  consideration. One possible  approach  to  this  issue  might  be .  .  .'  When  ideas  are  owned  by  individuals, the other group members tend to interact with the  speaker  out  of  their  feelings  for  and  relationship  to  the  speaker  rather  than  with  the ideas  presented.  This  is  especially  true  when the speakers have role or knowledge authority related to the topic at hand. To have an idea be received in the spirit in which you tell it, label your intentions: 'This is one idea' or 'Here is a thought' or 'This is not an advocacy, I am just thinking out loud.'\n\nKnowing when to pull ideas off the table is equally important. 'I think this idea is blocking us; let's set it aside and move on to other possibilities.' In this case, continued advocacy of the idea is not influencing other group members' thinking. This is a signal to pull back and reconsider approaches.\n\n## Providing Data\n\nProductive group work is driven by data, both  qualitative  and  quantitative.  Data  about student learning, school climate, teacher satisfaction, parent satisfaction, and the like are important to ground ideas being put on the table. Collaborative work in schools requires data as well as impressions. In fact, important learning is  possible  whether or not the data align with the impressions of group members.\n\nKnowing what data are  worth  paying  attention to is important. It is also important to know  what  collaborative  practices  will  help people  to  engage  with  data  in  ways  that  increase  their  ownership  and  willingness  to  act on  conclusions.  Data  can  be  quantitative  or qualitative. Schools are difficult places to motivate and govern with numbers. A 6 percent rise in student reading scores is often not as compelling  as  a  teacher's  tale  of  the  slow  reader who  makes  a  breakthrough.  Reasoning  by anecdote  is  often  more  common  than  reason-\n\ning  with  data.  Interpreting  and  using  data  are learned skills that take time and practice to develop. Knowledge, meaning, and commitment result from dialogue and discussion about what story  is  told  by  the  data.  Without  organized story  making,  people  in  organizations  make up  their  own  explanations  for  events.  Part  of the reason for this is protection from unwanted truths.\n\n## Paying Attention to Self and Others\n\nFor  meaningful  dialogue  and  discussion to occur, each group member needs to be conscious of themself and of others. Skilled group members are aware of what they are saying, how  they  are  saying  it,  and  how  others  are receiving and responding to their ideas. This includes paying attention to both physical and verbal  cues  in  oneself  and  others.  Since  the greatest  part  of  communication  occurs  nonverbally, group members need consciousness about their total communication package (Goleman, 2006). This includes posture, gesture, proximity,  muscle  tension,  facial  expression, and the pitch, pace, volume, and inflection in their voices.\n\nPaying attention  to  self  and  others  draws on emotional and cognitive maturity. It requires mindfulness, sensory acuity, and reflective action. Mindfulness focuses attention on sensory experiences,  thoughts,  and  feelings  without judgment.  With  sensory  acuity,  members  increase the levels of detail of what is happening internally  and  externally  to  themselves.  Reflective action, utilizing the first two resources, capacitates  one  to  act,  observe  reactions,  and sustain action when results align with outcomes or  modify  actions  when  they  do  not  (Prickett and Ravlin, 2015).\n\nOne  important  skill  to  develop  is  paying attention  to  and  responding  to  the  learning styles  of  others.  The  earlier  section  on  paraphrasing  offers  some  tips  for  communicating with global and concrete thinkers. In addition to  using  those  ideas,  skilled  group  members match the language forms of others. This oc- curs when the respondent joins in a metaphor offered by another. It also occurs when the respondent matches the representation system of the speaker by using visual, kinesthetic, or auditory words in response to hearing the speaker operate within one or more of those categories (Lankton, 1980). Here's an example:\n\nSpeaker: I'd like to see us develop a workable action plan.\n\nRespondent: So you have an image of practical  process that we can apply to our work. What are some of the features you'd like to have on view before us?\n\n## Presuming Positive Intentions\n\nAssuming that others'  intentions  are  positive  shows respect for others and encourages honest  conversations  about  important  matters. Respect, from its Latin origin, respecere , means to look again. 'Where once we saw one aspect  of  a  person,'  explains  William  Isaacs, 'we look again and realize how much of them we had missed' (1999, p. 111). This is an operating  stance  that  group  members  must  take if dialogue and discussion are to flourish; it is also a linguistic act for speakers to frame their paraphrases and inquiries within positive presuppositions.\n\nPositive  presuppositions  reduce  the  possibility  of  the  listener  perceiving  threats  or challenges in a paraphrase or question. Instead of  asking,  'Does  anybody  here  know  why these  kids  aren't  learning?'  the  skilled  group member might say, 'Given our shared concern about student achievement, I'd like to examine our assumptions about what might be causing gaps in learning.'\n\nThe first question is likely to trigger defensiveness.  The  second  approach  will  most likely  lead  to  speculation,  exploration,  and collective  understanding.  This  is  especially true when a speaker has strong emotions about a topic and even more important when the respondent initially disagrees with the speaker. Here's an example:\n\nSpeaker: I'm really ticked off about the lack of  communication  in  this  school.  We  never find  out  about  the  important  things  until  everyone else knows about them. In fact, I get more district news from the local paper than I do from internal sources.\n\nRespondent: So as a committed professional, you'd like useful information about our organization in a timely fashion and in a means convenient for you. As you think about such a  system,  what  might  be  some  important components?\n\nIn the example  above,  the  respondent presumes that the speaker is a committed professional  who  wants  to  solve  a  real  problem. People  tend  to  act  as  if  such  presuppositions are true. The emotional processors in the brain hear the positive intention and open up access to high-level thinking (Ledoux, 1996).\n\n## Working with Grace in a Culture of Advocacy\n\nIn working  groups  that  have  not  yet embraced a spirit of inquiry, round-robin, or back-and-forth advocacy are often the prevailing patterns of discourse. People who are not talking  are  not  necessarily  listening;  in  fact, they might just be waiting to talk or internally debating  and  are  composing  their  thoughts and responses as they sit poised to pounce at the  first  opening.  By  applying  the  norms  of collaboration,  skilled  group  members,  individually or collectively, interrupt this nonproductive pattern and establish more thoughtful forms of discourse within their groups. To do so they must first break the pattern of balancing advocacy with their own advocacy. Flexible  group  members  and  skillful  facilitators learn to respond to advocacy with a pattern of pausing, paraphrasing, and inquiring.\n\nWe are influenced in this arena by the work of Peter Senge and his colleagues (1994) at the Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology's  Center for  Organizational Learning. We have extended the  concept  and  refined  specific  language  patterns for operating within this framework.\n\nMatching advocacy with inquiry requires both  emotional  and  cognitive  resources. The balance is most necessary at the exact moment when many group members are least likely to want to inquire into the ideas of others. It is at  the  moment  of  greatest  disagreement  and discomfort that this pattern makes the biggest difference. To balance means to spend equal amounts  of  time  and  energy  inquiring  into the  ideas  of  others  before  advocating  one's own  ideas.  The  highest  performing  teams balance both (Losada and Heaphy, 2004). To do  both  equally  well  requires  the  resources of  the  seven  norms  of  collaboration.  Inquiry and  advocacy  are  built  on  the  linguistic  and perceptual foundation described earlier in this chapter. Table 4.2 shows how to balance advocacy and inquiry.\n\nThe  power  of  this  pattern  became  apparent to us in an experience related to us by our friend  and  colleague  Diane  Zimmerman,  who was enrolled in a doctoral program in organizational development. At the time, she was also a principal in Davis, California. Diane and her staff had taken on the norms of collaboration as a shared learning goal. As a skilled and congruent leader, Diane knew that she needed to apply the seven norms in her interactions with adults and students. To support her own learning, she continually sought opportunities to master and integrate these communication skills.\n\nAt an early stage in her graduate program, the professors organized a small-group learning  experience.  The  students  were  placed  in small groups and given a controversial topic to  discuss.  Most  of  the  groups  were  soon  at one  another's  throats  with  rising  emotions, much heated talk, and little listening. Diane's group  took  a  much  different  course. After  a time,  the  professors  gathered  around  in  surprise,  because  the  activity  normally  evoked the  responses  present  in  the  other  groups.

Her  behavior  established  this  pattern, solely by example, within her group.\n\n## Skilled Advocacy\n\nThe intention of advocacy is to influence the thinking of others. Group members sometimes attempt to influence with volume, repetition,  and  passion.  Advocacy  works  through revealing logic and the chain of reasoning that supports assumptions and conclusions.\n\nThe power of advocacy increases when it is  structured  to  influence  multiple  audiences. Global  reasoners  increase  their  impact  when they  learn  to  frame  issues  for  concrete  and sequential  thinkers.  Those  who  are  driven  by logic  and  facts  increase  their  influence  when they learn to frame their ideas within feelings and emotions. This ability to stretch one's own thinking  preferences  often  makes  the  difference in group members being able to hear one another and be persuaded by the positions and stances of others.\n\n## Developing Personal and Group Skills with the Seven Norms of Collaboration\n\nBallet dancers practice in mirrored studios to  monitor  posture  and  the  subtleties  of  their movements.  Groups  also  improve  by  reflection.  The  inventories  in  appendixes  B,  C,  D, and E serve this purpose. Printable versions of these inventories can be found on the Thinking Collaborative  Website  (www.thinkingcollabo rative.com).\n\nFor  personal  skill  development  as  both  a facilitator and as a group member, appendix B serves  as  a  starting  point  for  self-assessment and  goal  setting.  One  useful  approach  is  to select  one  skill  at  a  time  on  which  to  work. Our basic mantra here is isolate, overlearn, and automatize.  By  seeking  opportunities  in  daily communication experiences to  practice  a  particular norm, you will be able to overlearn that\n\ntool so that is available to you when you need it the most in a meeting. The rating scale in the appendix is a useful instrument for self-reflection after running or participating in a meeting.\n\nWith groups in the early stages of development, we suggest that individuals assess by filling out the inventory located in appendix B. Once  completed,  the  form  becomes  the  basis for dialogue about skill development and baseline  data  for  goal  setting  for  individuals  and groups. We encourage groups to master one or two of the norms at a time rather than attempt to take them all on at once.\n\nFor  intact  groups  with  some  history  of working  together,  the  form  is  best  completed by  subsets  of  the  group.  In  twos  and  threes they  can  work  through  the  form,  rating  the full  group's  use  of  each  norm.  Each  subset then  compares  its  assessments  with  the  other subsets. Most groups discover that all members do not perceive meeting behaviors in the same way. This conversation leads to goal setting for individuals and groups.\n\nThe rating scale provides a useful vehicle for ongoing group assessment. Regular mon- itoring  with  reflective  processing  keeps  the norms  alive  and  motivates  steady  improvement.  In  addition,  the  round-robin  reflection pattern  described  in  chapter  8  is  a  powerful tool  for  increasing  personal  and  group  consciousness and skills.\n\nThe four group-member capabilities and the  seven  norms  of  collaboration  are  essential  capacities  and  skills  for  high-performing groups. They operate within several practical frameworks that help groups to develop shared meaning and gracefully reach decisions. In the next chapter we describe two ways of talking among adults that make a difference for student  learning.  Both  ways,  dialogue  and  discussion,  draw  on  group-member  capabilities and norms.\n\nReaders may wish to access the Norms of Collaboration Toolkit at www.thinkingcollaborative.com.

Creating communities of  thought  is  the  ultimate  outcome  of  developing a high functioning team or department. Thinking together is both the expectation and the reward in such communities. As we pointed out  in  chapter  3  the  word  community  itself is  rooted  in  the  word  communicate.  We  hold things  in  common  by  attending  to  the  form and  function  of  collective  talk.  The  physical organization of meeting rooms enhances these processes. For more details on managing space and the surround to enhance collaborative engagement see chapter 6.\n\n(2) Cognition is social in nature. Thought is  a  collective  process.  Our  outer  talk  reflects internal thought patterns and in the process of language construction, we modify those same thought  patterns.  In  this  way,  our  external talking  alters  our  inner  speech.  By  listening to  the  perspectives  of  others,  reflecting  those thoughts back in the form of paraphrases, and inquiring into the ideas of others we shape both their thinking and our own. These same alterations  in  the  patterns  of  thought  occur  when others paraphrase us and inquire into our ideas.\n\n(3)  Cognition  is  distributed  between  individuals and tools. No one person has all the answers or all of the ideas. Collectively we are typically  smarter  than  when  working  alone. Yet,  working  together  is  not  always  easy.  It requires skills, dispositions, and a shared toolkit of maps and tools for talking to manage the cognitive  and  emotional  load  of  productive collaboration.\n\nGroup talk is the organizing ingredient of shared  learning,  yet  it  is  dangerous  and  often counterproductive  to  put  people  in  a  room without  frameworks  and  tools  for  skilled  interaction.  The  group-member  capabilities  and norms of collaboration described in the previous chapter supply part of the equation. What is missing is a map for two kinds of talking that make a difference for student learning (Garmston and Wellman, 1998).\n\nAn elementary school staff was struggling with the reduced budget for instructional aides. Although  consensus  and  fairness  were  their goals, they reported that they felt like turkeys being asked to vote on the merits of Thanksgiving. No one really wanted his or her aide time cut. One first-grade teacher was adamant: She would agree to lose aide time 'over my dead body.' Six months later, as part of a schoolwide effort  to  support  development  of  literacy  and reading  skills,  this  same  teacher  volunteered to share her classroom aide with a third-grade\n\ntutoring program 'if it will really make a difference in helping those students learn to read.'\n\nWhat  happened?  In  six  months  these teachers  learned  to  distinguish  and  practice two  different  ways  of  talking:  dialogue  and discussion.  They  adopted  the  seven  norms  of collaboration,  and  individually  reflected  on their capabilities for professional discourse and openly reflected  on  these  in  order  to  improve personal and collective practice.\n\nDeveloping  a  staff's  skills  for  talking together  professionally  is  no  panacea,  but  it can  represent  one  of  the  single  most  significant  investments  that  faculties  can  make  for student learning.\n\nThese capabilities form the core of a professional  community.  Such  communities  talk about  hard  issues;  they  honor  cognitive  conflict and minimize affective conflict (Amason, Thompson,  Hochwarter,  and  Harrison,  1995); and  they  make  decisions  based  on  objective data,  shared  values,  and  deep  examination  of mental  models.  They  measure  success  by  increased student learning and adults' satisfaction with their work.\n\nTo  develop  shared  understanding  and  be ready to take collective action, working groups need knowledge and skill in two ways of talking. One way of talking, dialogue, leads to collective meaning making and the development of shared understanding. The other way of talking, discussion, leads to decisions that stay made.\n\nBoth  forms  of  professional  discourse  use common tools. The four capabilities described in chapter 4 guide group members in selecting tools  and  help  them  to  monitor  the  effectiveness of their participation.\n\nFigure 5.1 shows the pathways of dialogue and discussion. First we will define the terms in the diagram. Then, we will describe how groups\n\n## Two Ways of Talking\n\nFigure 5.1 . Diagram-Two Ways of Talking\n\nuse these concepts to guide their interactions. Finally, we will report the ways that we introduce groups to these maps, tools, and skills.\n\nDialogue honors the social-emotional brain, building a sense of connection, belonging, and safety. As a shape for conversations, it connects us  to  our  underlying  motivations  and  mental models. This way of talking forms a foundation for  coherent,  sustained  effort  and  community building. In dialogue we hear phrases like 'An assumption I have is . . .' and 'I'd be curious to hear what other people are thinking about this issue.' In the following video (5.1), some internal complexities of being in dialogue are revealed in this interview between Carolyn McKanders and Robert Garmston.\n\nVideo 5.1.\n\nDiscussion,  in  its  more  skillful  form,  requires  conversations  that  are  infused  with sustained  critical  thinking,  careful  consideration  of  options,  and  respect  for  conflicting points  of  view.  This  way  of  talking  leads  to decision making that serves the group's and the school's vision, values, and goals. In a discussion we hear phrases like 'We need to define the  problem  we  are  solving  before  jumping to solutions' and 'I'd like to see the data that these  assumptions  are  based  on  before  we  go much further.' A school in Virginia reports that learning the distinctions between these ways of talking made a profound difference in their collaborative work. What they had to say did not change, how they said it did (Cunneen, 2015).\n\n## Conversation and Deliberation\n\nWhen  groups  come  together,  they  'converge'  and  'converse.'  These  words'  respective Latin roots mean that group members 'turn together'  and  'associate  with  one  another.' Conversation  is  informal  talking  in  which participants  share  information,  anecdotes,  and opinions  to  learn  from  one  another  or  simply to  enjoy  one  another's  company.  When  the conversation  takes  on  an  organized  purpose, to  either  deepen  understanding or make a decision, a group that understands that there are two ways of talking acknowledges this point of deliberation and consciously chooses to engage in either dialogue or discussion. Deliberation in its Latin root, deliberare , means to weigh, as in to evaluate, assess, or ponder.\n\nGroup  members  have  this  choice  point available  to  them  only  when  they  have  road maps  for  ways  of  talking  and  consciousness about  group  processes  and  group  purposes. A significant part of this awareness is recognizing that  culturally  embedded  patterns  shape  behaviors-patterns from the larger surrounding culture  and  patterns  from  organizational  and group  culture.  Many  groups  default  into  the Western cultural habit of polarized discussion and  debate.  Our  media-saturated  world  bombards  us  with  arguments  framed  by  commentators  as  point-counterpoint,  pro  and  con,  left versus  right,  and  other  polarities,  the  regrettable byproduct of the contentious Gore Vidal and  William  F.  Buckley  debates  televised  at the  presidential  conventions  of  1968.  These models  transfer  to  conversations  in  working groups; they then frame how participants listen to others and how and when participants speak. If group members are not careful, they end up listening not to understand, but to hear gaps in the logic of other speakers, or they interrupt to make a point even before the current speaker is finished.  Conversations  then  break  down  into verbal combat, with winners and losers.\n\nAll  too  often,  valued  colleagues  become conscientious objectors, choosing not to participate in the fray. The group then loses perspective and potential alternative viewpoints. The loudest and  most  persistent  voices  become  the  policymakers, and in the worst cases, the process sows the seeds of passive noncompliance or sabotage in those who feel excluded or devalued.\n\nWhen  groups  understand  that  they  have more than one way of talking available to them, they can consciously choose to pursue the path of dialogue or to follow the path of discussion. Most  important  issues  require  explorations along  both  pathways.  Many  sensitive  issues, especially those with high stakes for the participants,  call  for  separate  sessions  in  which  the dialogue and discussion are separated in time and  sometimes  space.  One  useful  facilitation technique  is  to  explicitly  label  agenda  items as either dialogue or discussion and offer language models to further mark the distinctions between the two forms of discourse.\n\nAs group members become more sophisticated with the ways of talking, the pathways become more malleable. For example, during a dialogue, a group member senses an emerging consensus on an issue. He or she then inquires if this is so and frames a proposal to move the item  to  a  decision.  In  another  case,  during  a discussion,  emotions  rise  and  the  details  become  muddled.  Someone  then  proposes  that the group switch to a dialogue format for a set time  to  explore  the  feelings  and  underlying issues that are present.\n\n## The Path of Dialogue\n\nDialogue  is  a  reflective  learning  process in  which  group  members  seek  to  understand one  another's  viewpoints  and  deeply  held  assumptions.  The  word dialogue comes  from the Greek dialogos . Dia means 'through' and logos means  'word.'  In  this  meaning-making through  words,  group  members  inquire  into their own  and  others'  beliefs,  values,  and mental models to better understand how things work  in  their  world.  In  dialogue,  listening  is as  important  as  speaking.  For  skilled  group members, much of the work is done internally.\n\nPhysicist  and  philosopher  David  Bohm (1990) described dialogue as a process of eliciting  and  altering  the  'tacit  infrastructure  of thought.' As a quantum physicist, Bohm draws an analogy between dialogue and superconductivity. Electrons that are cooled to extremely low temperatures  dramatically  change  their  behavior, operating more as a coherent whole and less as  separate  parts.  In  supercool  environments, electrons flow around barriers and one another without  resistance,  creating  very  high  energy. The same electrons radically change behavior in a new environment. At higher temperatures they operate as separate entities, with random movement and loss of momentum (Isaacs, 1993).\n\nDialogue  creates  an  emotional  and  cognitive safety zone in which ideas flow for examination  without  judgment.  Although  many of  the  capabilities  and  tools  of  dialogue  and skilled  discussion  are  the  same,  their  core  intentions are quite different and require different personal and collective monitoring processes.\n\n## Monitoring Dialogue\n\nMindful  group  members  pay  attention  to three essential elements during productive dialogue. They monitor themselves, the process of the dialogue, and the new whole that is emerging within the group.\n\n## Self\n\nDialogue is  first  and  foremost  a  listening practice. When we 'listen to our listening,' we notice whether we are internally debating with the speaker, reviewing our mental catalogue of related information and personal anecdotes, or composing a response. Noticing these common internal processes allows us to switch them off so that we can hear others without judging.\n\nDialogue requires choice making. Typical choices include how and when to talk. Do we paraphrase prior comments to check for understanding and/or synthesis? Do we inquire into the ideas and assumptions of others? Do we put a new idea or perspective on the table to widen the frame?\n\nListening set-asides (chapter 4) and suspension are essential internal skills in dialogue. To suspend judgment, group members temporarily set  aside  their  own  perceptions,  feelings,  and impulses  and  carefully  monitor  their  internal experience. Points of personal conflict can eas-\n\nily emerge when we believe that others are not hearing us or that they are distorting our point of  view.  Points  of  conflict  also  surface  when our own values conflict with those of a speaker. These areas of discomfort influence our listening and our responses,  which  in  turn  influence  the thoughts and behaviors of other group members.\n\nSenge, Roberts, Ross, Smith, and Kleiner (1994)  note  that  suspension  also  involves  developing  an  awareness  of  our  own  assumptions  and  purposely  'hanging  them  from  the ceiling'-that is, suspending them in front of the group so that all can examine them. These assumptions are beliefs-often unexaminedabout  why  we  think  things  work  as  they  do. Our assumptions drive our perceptions, simultaneously opening and blinding us to possibilities in the world around us.\n\n## Process\n\nDialogue as a process requires focusing on the goal of developing shared understanding. In our action-oriented work environments, this is often countercultural. Yet in every group with which we've worked, all the participants could recite  examples  of  decisions  that  were  poorly conceived,  poorly  communicated,  simply  ignored, or, in the worst cases, violated by many organizational members without consequence. At the root of all these stories were group processes that were not thought out, but rather often hurried and inappropriately facilitated. The rush to action pushed unclear decision-making processes  and  timelines  onto  the  group  without sufficient attention to developing a shared understanding of both problems and solutions.\n\nBy  going  slow  and  honoring  the  flow  of dialogue,  groups  can  often  go  fast  when  they get  to  the  choice  points  in  decision-making. When the assumptions and the implications of those  assumptions  have  been  explored  during dialogue,  group  members  don't  second-guess the motives of others during discussions.\n\nMeetings should be safe but not necessarily comfortable. When a group confuses safety with  comfort,  it  sacrifices  productive  tension for the ease of conviviality. Humor and banter can  be  avoidance  strategies  as  much  as  they can be social lubricants. A lack of comfort with discomfort  weakens  dialogue  and  undermines the learning possibilities in that moment.\n\n## Whole\n\nThought is both a personal and a collective process.  We  influence  and  are  influenced  in turn  by  others.  During  dialogue,  the  line  between self and others blurs when we open ourselves to the possibilities within the communal thought space. This created whole is in itself a goal of dialogue. Communities move forward together.  Collective  understanding  leads  to shared goals and shared practices that tap the power of cumulative effect for student learning and for the adult learning community.\n\nThe whole is always greater than the sum of  the  individual  parts.  In  many  ways  it  is both  process  and  product  simultaneously.  By learning  to  observe  the  processes,  patterns, and  results  that  emerge  from  our  dialogues, we can more consciously participate and more consciously  contribute  to  the  whole  of  which we are the parts.\n\n## Understanding as the Outcome\n\nWell-crafted  dialogue  leads  to  understanding.  This  is  the  foundation  for  conflict  resolution,  consensus,  and  professional  community. Decisions that don't stay made are often the result of group members feeling left out or having their  ideas  discounted  by  the  group.  Dialogue gives voice to all parties and all viewpoints.\n\nMisunderstanding  lies  beneath  most  intragroup  and  intergroup  conflict.  Dialogue illuminates  and  clarifies  misunderstandings when  the  underlying  values  and  beliefs  are brought to the surface for examination. There is  often  alignment  at  this  level;  it  is  at  the solution  level  that  opinions  differ.  Working from  a  foundation  of  shared  understanding, group members can more easily and rationally resolve  differences,  generate  options,  and make  wise  choices  when  they  move  to  the discussion side of the journey.\n\n## The Path of Discussion\n\nDiscussion , in its Latin  root discutere , means  'to  shake  apart.'  It  focuses  on  the parts  and  their  relationships  to  one  another: the  causes,  the  effects,  and  the  ripple  effects of proposed actions and solutions. In its most ineffective forms, discussion consists of serial sharing  and  serial  advocacy  without  much group-member  inquiry  into  the  thinking  and proposals  of  others.  Participants  attempt  to reach  decisions  through  a  variety  of  voting and  consensus  techniques.  When  discussion is  unskilled  and  dialogue  is  absent,  decisions are often low-quality, represent the opinions of the most vocal members or leader, lack group commitment, and do not stay made.\n\nThree  elements  (chapter  6)  shape  skilled discussions: (1) clarity about decision-making processes and authority; (2) knowledge of the boundaries  of  the  topics  open  to  the  group's decision-making  authority;  and  (3)  standards for  orderly  decision-making  meetings.  Most meetings are, in fact, structured discussions.\n\n## Monitoring Discussion\n\nMindful  group  members  pay  attention  to three  essential  elements  during  productive  discussion. They monitor themselves, the processes of  skilled  discussion,  and  the  details  of  the problem solving, planning, and decision-making processes in which they are engaged.\n\n## Self\n\nProductive discussions require group members  to  have  emotional  and  mental  flexibility. When our goal is to influence the thinking of others and we give up the model of winning or losing, we are more able to notice our thoughts and  actions  and  the  effects  of  those  thoughts and actions on others.\n\nMentally,  this  requires  taking  a  balcony view. This perceptual position is neither egocentric (I am intensely aware of my thoughts, feelings,  and  intentions  and  know  my  own boundaries)  nor allocentric (I  am  aware  of how something looks, feels, and sounds from the  point  of  view  of  another).  The  balcony view is a third perceptual position, a macrocentric perspective,  in  which,  with  compassion and detachment, we try to understand the nature  of  the  situation  the  group  is  in  at  the moment.  It  is  with  this  view,  looking  down upon the group, that we gain the most knowledge about our group, the group's interactions, and ourselves.\n\nFrom the balcony we can make the most strategic choices about how and when to participate. Should I advocate or should I inquire? At what points should I press? When should I probe for detail or let go? How might I phrase an  idea  for  greatest  influence?  These  are  the same internal skills that teachers employ when they monitor and adjust in their classrooms.\n\n## Process\n\nSkilled  discussion  as  a  process  requires mindfulness  about  focusing  on  one  topic  and applying  one  process  tool  at  a  time  (chapter 6). When  topics  and  processes  blur,  group members lose focus. To maintain focus requires clear structure, purposeful facilitation, impulse control  on  the  part  of  individual  group  members, and recovery strategies if the group strays off course.\n\nEffective  group  members  share  responsibility  with  the  facilitator  for  maintaining  the flow  of  the  discussion,  for  encouraging  other group members to share knowledge and ideas, and for hearing and exposing points of confusion or murkiness.\n\nWhen working  groups  stray  from  skilled discussion,  they  often  move  to  an  unskilled form of debate. This occurs when group mem-\n\nbers overlook the useful advocacy of ideas and proposals and start listening for and challenging  the  fallacies  in  the  arguments  of  others. Battuere ,  the  Latin origin of the word debate , means 'to fight or beat down.' When meetings descend to the level of street debate rather than academic  debate,  we  focus  on  beating  down the ideas of others. Scoring points becomes the goal, and winning comes from intimidation and intonation  as  much  as  from-or  more  thanlogic or reason.\n\n## Details\n\nWhereas successful dialogue requires attention to the whole, successful discussion focuses on  the  details,  both  in  isolation  and  in  their interactions. The  path  of  discussion  is  also  the path of decision. As such, groups need to identify any constraints under which they might be working, such as timelines, deadlines, budgets, product  standards,  nonnegotiable  items,  task assignments, and, most important, who they are in  the  decision-making process. Groups skilled in discussion employ many intentional cognitive skills. There is no set sequence for these efforts. The task before the group determines the necessary intellectual tool kit.\n\nGroups need tools for the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Generating ideas, including a repertoire of brainstorming and creative thinking strategies and protocols;\n- \u00b7 Organizing  ideas,  including  both  conceptual and graphic tools;\n- \u00b7 Analyzing  ideas,  including  a  variety  of tools for illuminating  assumptions  and clarifying particulars;\n- \u00b7 Deciding among alternatives, including the clarification of decision-making roles and processes.\n\n## Decision as the Outcome\n\nDecision, in its Latin root decidere , means 'to  cut  off  or  determine.'  In  practice this means to cut off some options. The pur- pose of discussion is to eliminate ideas from a field of possibilities and allow the stronger ideas to prevail. Groups must learn to separate people from ideas in order for this to work effectively. If ideas are 'owned' by individuals, then to cut the idea away is the same as cutting the  person  away.  Ideas,  once  stated,  should belong to the group, not to individuals. In this way  they  can  be  shaped,  modified,  and  discarded to serve the group's greater purposes. The next  chapter  will  address  decision-making issues in greater detail.\n\n## Professional Community\n\nProfessional  community  is  both  a  cause and  an  effect  of  the  two  ways  of  talking. As a  cause,  being  in  a  community  provides  the motivation  and  vision  of  ways  of  interacting and  working  together.  As  an  effect,  a  strong professional community results from both what is talked about and how people talk. Such talk requires courage, confidence in self and others, and skillfulness in applying the maps and tools for developing shared understanding and strategic decision-making practices.\n\n## Consensus as the Holy Grail\n\nConsensus is one form of decision making, but not the only form. Some groups get stuck trying  to  use  consensus  processes  without  a consciousness  of  the  difference  between  dialogue and discussion.\n\nThere  are  two  types  of  consensus:  (1) opening  consensus,  which  develops  through dialogue,  and  (2)  focusing  consensus,  which develops through discussion. Opening consensus involves the consideration of perspectives and possibilities. Focusing consensus involves winnowing  choices  by  clarifying  criteria  and applying these criteria to the choices. Focusing consensus  for  complex  decisions  depends  on effective opening consensus.\n\nUltimately, consensus is a value and a belief system and not simply a decision-making process.  Unless  groups  are  willing  to  hang\n\nout  with  the  process  for  as  long  as  it  takes, they are not usually ready for full consensus decision making.\n\nMost  groups  with  whom  we  work  are better  served  by  'sufficient  consensus.'  This generally  means  that  at  least  80  percent  of the group is willing to commit and act. It also means  that  the  others  agree  not  to  sabotage. Sufficient  consensus  relies  on  both  dialogue and discussion for its effectiveness. The practice of balancing  advocacy  and  inquiry  is essential. Any  dissenting  voices  must  be  able to  influence  and  persuade  80  percent  of  the group  to  carry  the  day.  This  also  means  that other group members can paraphrase and draw matters to a close when only a few voices line up on one side of an issue. Groups more easily come to common ground when they distinguish positions (divisive) from concerns.\n\n## Norms and Values\n\nProfessional  community  is  built  on  the bedrock of norms and values, which are both honed  by  dialogue  and  discussion.  Strong schools  have  core  values  about  how  children learn, what they should learn, and how faculties should work together. Some norms about faculty work are philosophical (e.g., everyone can be involved in decision making, or no one has to be involved, but once decisions are reached they are binding on everyone). Carl Glickman (1993) calls this a charter, or guiding rules of governance. This type of norm signals what is important to the organization.\n\nAnother  type  of  norm  specifies  how  the values  of  the  organization  can  be  achieved. Our work with schools emphasizes the use of the seven norms of collaboration described in the  previous  chapter.  When  school  faculties make  these  seven  tools  into  norms-that  is, normal  operating  behaviors  in  formal  and  informal  interactions  within  the  school-adult relationships  improve,  groups  work  skillfully to  explore  members'  mental  models  and  assumptions,  and  both  dialogue  and  discussion are  served.  These  norms  also  have  a  tremen- dous payoff in the classroom for both teacherstudent  interactions  and  student-student  interactions. In many cases faculties take them on with the dual agenda of enhancing both faculty and student performance.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe collaborative norms of the group (chapter 4) have more influence on the possibility of success than do the knowledge and talents of the group  facilitator.  Thus,  our  staff  development energies  must  go  to  groups,  not  to  designated leaders  of  groups.  We  have  found  this  to  be helpful  in  groups  that  achieve  high  levels  of skills in the challenging talk that is required in professional communities.\n\nAny group that is too busy to reflect on its work is too busy to improve. Every working group has many more tasks to do than time in which to do them and so is naturally reluctant to  spend  time  monitoring  and  reflecting  on its  working  processes.  Many  groups  commit themselves to a task-process ratio to overcome this  tendency;  they  budget  a  protected  percentage  of  each  meeting  for  examining  how well the group is working and what it might do to improve.\n\nReflection can take many forms. Typically the least effective form involves a process observer-a special role for gathering data about the frequency or distribution of behaviors that the group believes are important. Because this places the gathering of data outside the group members, they ultimately become less accurate\n\nin  gathering  their  own  data  and  self-assessments. A process observer can be useful when after  gathering  requested  data,  the  data  are shown  without  comment  and  members  are invited  to  interpret  them.  The  most  effective form  is  through  reflection  on  the  four  capabilities described in chapter 4. This can occur through journal writing, round-robin reflection, and  dialogue  that  is  focused  on  personal  and collective learning about the power of attention to process. For reflecting on discussions use the meeting inventory (appendix I) in which members assess criteria for successful meetings.\n\nHuman beings are a social species. Living and working in groups is an important part of our  genetic  heritage.  It  is  ironic,  then,  that  in many schools,  professionals  who  are  charged with  preparing  students  to  be  successful,  collaborative citizens are themselves cut off from the  rich  resources  offered  by  true  collegiality. That we talk together in our schools is vitally important  in  these  changing  times.  How  we talk is just as important, for it is how we talk that influences the personal and collective satisfaction  that  motivates  us  to  effectively  talk together in our schools.\n\n## PART III\n\n## MEETINGS ARE TEACHERS' WORK\n\nMeetings can  be  and  are successful  in  many settings.  In  working  with  countless  schools on  several  continents  over  the  years,  we've seen  good  meetings  get  better  and  poor  ones become satisfying and effective. In part III, we will reveal the surprisingly simple patterns for making this  happen. These  ideas  are  straightforward  conceptually,  but  not  always  easy  to implement.  Many  groups  have  unproductive patterns of behavior that require unsticking to make room for new habits.\n\nSuccessful  meetings  are  those  in  which a  great  deal  of  work  is  done  in  a  minimum amount  of  time  with  a  great  deal  of  member satisfaction. Three factors contribute to producing  such  meetings.  (1) Adopting  five  meeting standards,  informed  by  research  and  proven effective in the field. (2) Working from sound agendas.  Good  agendas  require  planning,  just as is true for good lessons. This section of the book  offers  principles  for  agenda  design  and samples of model agendas. (3) Applying skillful meeting  facilitation  concepts,  strategies, and moves. While many of the skills involved are similar to making presentations to groups, the  facilitation  role  is more  complex.  This leadership  role  requires  neutrality  toward  the meeting content, a process tool kit for helping the group get its work done, and the courage to intervene  when  needed  to  support  task  focus and group development.\n\n## Chapter 6\n\n## Well-Run Meetings Enhance Social Capital\n\nI n  chapter  1,  we  described  schools  as  complex  or  dynamic  systems.  So  too are  groups  of  educators  working  together,  such  as  faculties,  departments, grade-level teams, and administrative cabinets. What happens in these groups influences other gatherings of educators throughout the system and can instill effectiveness, efficacy, and meaningful effort within an organization's DNA.\n\nHuman, social, and decisional capital  are essential  for  strong  schools  (Hargreaves  and Fullan, 2012). Together, they form professional capital.  Human  capital  refers  to  highly  qualified  teachers  with  knowledge  of  content,  student learning characteristics, sound preservice work,  emotional  intelligence,  and  capability in  relationships.  Social  capital  refers  to  trust, collaboration,  collective  responsibility,  peer pressure  and  support,  mutual  assistance,  and networks.  Decisional  capital  refers  to  teacher judgment, experience, practice, and the ability to reflect alone and together on their practices and  to  adjust  practice  to  improve  students' learning accordingly.\n\nand manage differences, and it is in meetings that  their  working  culture  evolves-or  stays the same.\n\nWell-run meetings produce specific benefits in social capital including norms of reciprocity, clear communication, and operationally sound information flow. At the heart of these meeting is  professional  discourse.  It  occurs  informally within disciplines as well as across disciplines, grade levels, departments, and faculties. It occurs in pairs, trios, and large groups. It occurs spontaneously and when planned. It happens in meetings. It is in meetings that teachers work together  to  improve  instructional  practice  and performance.  It  is  in  meetings  that  teachers clarify policies, identify and address problems, assess standards, and modify schedules. It is in meetings that faculties respond to the changing needs  of  students,  standards,  and  curriculum demands. It is in meetings that groups mature\n\nMeetings have a greater effect on organizational  success  than  initially  meets  the  eye. First, effective and time-efficient meetings produce work that is important to the school. Second,  well-conducted  meetings  promote  member  satisfaction,  the  capacity  to  collaborate, and a willingness to conscientiously contribute. Third, the more successful groups are at getting important  work  done  in  meetings,  the  greater their collective efficacy, a resource that is undeniably  linked  to  student  success.  (We  will say  more  in  the  next  chapter  about  designing for  efficacy.)  Finally,  members  of  successful groups ultimately become members and leaders elsewhere and enrich the quality of work done by units within the school and the district. For these  reasons,  knowing  how  to  produce  work through meetings has become an essential part of  a  professional  portfolio,  regardless  of  an individual's role.\n\nThis chapter describes what members need to know and be able to do to have meetings that are  productive,  time-efficient,  and  satisfying. As noted earlier, teachers acquire social capital in these meetings. They also develop decisional capital  as  they  gain  wisdom  and  discernment relating  student  assessment  data  to  instructional decisions. As we described in chapter 4, two  ways  of  talking  support  such  learning  in\n\nworking groups: dialogue and discussion. Dialogue, which leads to understanding, is a necessary precursor to discussion, which leads to significant decisions.\n\n## Talking to Decide\n\nInquiry  into  the  craft  of  meetings  is  fundamental  for  effective  meetings.  This  inquiry should include questions on (1) how to distinguish the urgent from the important; (2) how to stay on track, on topic, and focused; (3) how to use conflict constructively; (4) how to orchestrate space and materials; and (5) how to make decisions  that  stay  made.  This  is  important for leaders and members, for, as we shall see, skilled members have more influence on meeting success than good facilitators do.\n\nThree organizing principles guide meeting productivity  and  satisfaction:  a  collaborative mindset,  positive  relationships,  and  collective energy sources. These are described below.\n\n## Collaborative Mindset\n\nMeeting success is influenced more by the collaborative mindset of the group than by the knowledge and skill of the group's facilitator. Schwartz  (2013)  reports  that  over  90  percent of  teams  have  a  unilateral  control  mindset, ascribing  to  the  leader  the  right  and  responsibility  to  make  decisions  for  the  team.  An alternative  mindset  is  collaborative,  recognizing that 'at any given moment, the insight and ability to move the team forward might come from anyone at the table' (p. 10). We refer to group members having this mindset as engaged participants.  The  overriding  commitment  of groups with a collaborative mindset is to work with  others  to  achieve  shared  goals.  For  a committee,  task  force,  department,  or  faculty to achieve this commitment, the members need to have the skills and knowledge for producing work  in  meetings.  Counterintuitively,  this  is more important than the skills of a good facilitator. Imagine an athletic team playing without goals, knowledge of the rules of the game, an awareness of other positions,  and  some  sense of  common  strategy.  As  much  as  a  football team needs a coach, it also needs players who have a common understanding of the game and who are committed to achieving the goals and improving their individual and collective performance. Whether or not a group knows that it is directing its own dynamics, this is the most determining factor in accomplishing work.\n\n## Positive Relationships\n\nThe power of a group to produce results is rooted in the quality of the relationships among the participants. The highest performing groups have far more positive than negative communications, with a positivity ratio of roughly six to one  (Losada  and  Heaphy,  2004).  Becoming  a learning community that focuses on improving practice  and  developing  shared  accountability  is  a  goal  for  many  groups.  As  evidence mounts  that  student  learning  is  the  result  of such  cumulative  effort,  teachers  increasingly need the skills to conduct productive meetings in which they generate the know-how and the will  to  inquire  into  student  learning,  dialogue about data, assess and refine instruction, raise student achievement, and enhance professional community.  To  achieve  this  requires  skillful collaboration. Collaboration is not easy, nor has it been previously required in most schools. It implies  shared  objectives,  a  sense  of  urgency and commitment, mutual trust and respect, intellectual agility, and the application of diverse skills and knowledge. Achinstein (2002) notes the following:\n\nWhen teachers collaborate, they run headlong into enormous  conflicts  over  professional beliefs and practices. In their optimism about caring  and  supportive  communities,  advocates  often  underplay  the  role  of  diversity, dissent, and disagreement in community life, leaving practitioners ill-prepared and conceptions of collaboration under explored. (p. 5)\n\nCollaboration  requires  the  development and  exercise  of  social,  emotional,  and  cogni-\n\ntive  skills.  Inquiring  into  the  views  of  others requires fluency in each of these skills sets and is  essential  to  problem  solving  and  working with conflict. High-performing groups are not only more positive than negative, but balance inquiry  with  advocacy  on  about  a  one-to-one ratio  (Losada  and  Heaphy,  2004). To  demand collaboration without providing training is like the government mandating a program without providing the money to implement it.\n\n## Collective Energy Sources\n\nThe third organizing principle comes from cognitive  social  theory.  The  culture  of  the workplace  influences  what  teachers  do  and how they think more than their training, experience, or knowledge influences what they do. Cognitive social theory holds that robust social norms  and  behaviors  exert  an  influence  on the individual members of a group. The work culture inhibits or amplifies the learning of its members.  Well-structured  meetings  are  one way to influence working culture.\n\nIn  our  work  we  have  noticed  that five sources of collaborative energy become self-organizing  values  for  high-performing  groups: efficacy,  flexibility,  craftsmanship,  consciousness, and  interdependence.  We  introduced these in chapter 4, and readers who are familiar  with  'Cognitive  Coaching'  will  recognize them as the five states of mind held by individuals  (Costa  and  Garmston, 1994, 2002, 2016; Costa,  Garmston,  and  Zimmerman,  2014). How groups take on collaborative energy is an important question because collective efficacy is consistently  and  positively  related  to  increases in student achievement. Experts in any field  look  below  surface  behaviors  to  analyze the sources of successes and challenges. Paying attention to the flow and interchange of energy as  much  as  to  things  is  the  key  to  successful school  leadership.  Chapter  10  describes  how to detect the five energy sources and influence them. Here we describe their basic features.\n\nEfficacy . Collective efficacy is consistently related to improved student achievement. Col- lective efficacy beliefs seem to influence group performance  by  shaping  the  behavioral  and normative  environment  of  schools  (Goddard, 2001). Groups with efficacy judge themselves to have the knowledge, skills, and will to meet goals and overcome obstacles to learning and behave  accordingly.  Efficacious  groups  use more  creative  approaches  to  problem  solving,  persevere  longer,  work  more  diligently, and achieve outcomes more successfully than groups without efficacy. The greater the collective efficacy of a school, the more that teachers persist  in  their  pursuit  of  excellence.  If  most teachers  in  a  school  believe  that  the  faculty can successfully teach students, it becomes the norm for teachers to help the students achieve high levels (Goddard, 2001).\n\nFlexibility . To  inquire  into  data,  to  develop  theories  of  causation  and  solutions  for academic challenges, requires an ability to set aside the first (too) easy answers and continue to  delve  from  various  perspectives.  Groups who  develop  this  energy  source  honor  and value  diversity  inside  and  outside  the  group, attend  to  both  rational  and  intuitive  ways  of thinking, collectively shift perspective, and utilize a wide array of thinking and process skills. Such  groups  can  also  navigate  the  internal tensions that are related to confusion and ambiguity and open capacity for generating multiple ideas for moving ahead.\n\nCraftsmanship .  Like  the  mindsets  of  expert  performers-musicians,  artists,  teachers, craftspeople, and athletes-groups with craftsmanship  take  pride  in  their  work  and  consistently  strive  to  improve  current  performance. Craftsmanship-the drive for elaboration, clarity,  refinement,  and  precision-is  the  energy source from which groups set demanding goals for themselves and ceaselessly work to deepen their knowledge, skills, and effectiveness.\n\nConsciousness .  To  have  consciousness  is to be  mindful-moving  beyond  habituated thinking to thoughtful choice. Consciousness is a prerequisite to self-control and self-direction. Groups  that  tap  this  energy  source  maintain an awareness of their values, norms, and iden-\n\ntity; monitor the congruence of their espoused beliefs and their manifested beliefs; and stand outside themselves to reflect on their processes and products.\n\nInterdependence . Interdependent  groups value and trust the process of dialogue, have an  awareness  of  their  multiple  relationships and  identities  with  other  groups,  and  regard disagreement  as  a  source  of  learning  and transformation.\n\n## Three Success Structures\n\nWe now turn our attention to three success structures. We use the term structure to describe a  system  of  order  and  organization.  Effective social structures honor the dynamic relationship of parts and bring them together into a workable whole. Since any group brings a variety of mental  models,  cognitive  styles,  personal  histories, and individual agendas to its work, the potential for chaotic interaction always exists. Providing structures permits a full and focused expression of these differences in a manner that is useful to the work and life of the group.\n\nThe  following  three  structures,  taken  together, guide groups to continual success. Each addresses significant questions in the work life of groups.\n\n- 1. Who decides? What topics are ours? What decsion-making processes will be used?\n- 2. What  meeting  room  features  (the  surround) will support the work?\n- 3. What are the meeting standards that support us in staying focused and effective?\n\n## Who Decides?\n\nIs a decision to be made by certain individuals within the group, by the group as a whole, by the person who convened the group, or by some person or group not present at this meeting? Groups are most effective and productive when they are clear about whether their role is to inform, recommend, or decide.\n\nAsk  any  group  to  describe  instances  in which a lack of decision-making clarity led to confusion  and  poor  implementation,  and  you will  hear  many  examples.  We  worked  with  a group  once  whose  members  discovered  that they didn't know who would make the decision on the topic they were discussing. Yet they vigorously continued to work on the issue within this conceptual vacuum.\n\nTrust diminishes when a group is not clear about  who  is  making  the  final  decision  and what decision-making processes will be used. When group members lose trust, second-guessing,  resistance,  or  lengthy  and  unproductive process arguments can occur. This steals time and,  more  important,  saps  group  energy,  efficacy, and motivation to persevere on important agenda items.\n\nWhen  curriculum  committees  understand that a final decision will be made by the school board,  they  can  strategically  plan  their  time. Thus 80 percent of committee time might be devoted to becoming as clear as possible about the recommendations they will make to the board. The other 20 percent of the time might be used to study and implement ethical systems of influence.  Many  a  curriculum  committee  has  been dismayed  to  have  its  recommendations  denied because it had not brought the board along in the deliberations. The following are possible levels of authority for decision making:\n\n- \u00b7 An individual or group above you;\n- \u00b7 An administrator unilaterally;\n- \u00b7 An administrator with input;\n- \u00b7 An administrator and staff by consensus;\n- \u00b7 A staff with input from administrators;\n- \u00b7 A staff by consensus;\n- \u00b7 A staff by a vote;\n- \u00b7 A  subgroup  of  a  staff  with  input  from others;\n- \u00b7 A subgroup of a staff unilaterally;\n- \u00b7 Individual staff members, selecting from a menu of options.\n\nConstituents will blame the process when unhappy with the outcome. One of us worked in  a  district  in  which  a  neighborhood  school was to be closed. A representative community commitee  met  several  times,  examined  data, formulated criteria and recommendations, and forwarded this work to the superintendent. He then examined the committee's work with the administrative cabinet and made a recommendation  to  the  school  board.  When  the  board announced the school would be closed, all hell broke out. Why? The process was sound, but had  not  been  overcommunicated,  thus  consituents, both community and staff, assumed the decision had been in the superintendent's desk since  the  start  of  the  study.  Mistrust  clouded each new step in managing the transition.\n\nClarity about decision making is so crucial that we suggest that facilitators name the ultimate  decision  maker(s)  and  decision  process as many as four times. Why overcommunicate like  this?  When  people  are  investing  energy in topics important to them, they often forget that  there  might  be  other  parties  in  the  decision-making chain. Thus, while introducing an item, the facilitator could say, 'On this topic, you will be making a recommendation to the curriculum  committee,  which  has  the  final say.' During the conversation about the topic, the  facilitator  could  say,  'As  you  consider how to structure your recommendation to the curriculum committee. . . .' At the conclusion of the meeting, the facilitator could summarize the action taken on each item, again stating on which topics the group made a recommendation  or  decision.  Finally,  if  there  are  minutes for  the  meeting,  the  language  should  convey the  level  of  decision-making  authority  possessed  by  the  group.  One  of  us  worked  with a  superintendent  in  an  eastern  state  who  was particularly  adept  at  maintaining  clarity  with groups  about  decisions.  On  one  occasion,  he visited each school's faculty to seek its input on  a  decision  he  had  to  make.  He  said  to each group, 'Your job is to give me the best information  possible.  Your  job  is  to  inform me.  My  job  is  to  make  a  decision.  When  I\n\ndo decide, you will hear it first from me.' He then  asked  questions  and  listened.  When  his decision had been made, he again visited the schools. He reported to each staff, 'This is the decision I made. This is my rationale. Here is how your information influenced me.' He then responded to questions.\n\nSeveral months later another issue emerged in which the superintendent wanted input from the  schools.  He  sent  a  memo  describing  the situation and saying that if the faculty wished to inform him, please send a representative to the central office for a meeting at a designated time.  The  teachers  said  to  one  another,  'He really means it.' They had learned to trust the process. Teachers went to the meeting and informed the superintendent.\n\nRemember the principle that meeting success  is  influenced  more  by  the  collaborative mindset of  the  group  than  by  a  skilled  facilitator?  Members,  too,  share  responsibility  for group  consciousness  about  decision  making. They  can  ask  na\u00efve  questions  (appendix  A) such as 'Excuse me. Who makes the final decision on this?' or 'Where does this recommendation go after it leaves us?'\n\nAsking  a  na\u00efve  question  is  one  way  that group members can effectively offer a correction  to  group  work.  To  communicate  na\u00efvely is  to  speak  with  innocence. It is to be artless, unaffected,  and  natural.  Na\u00efve  questions  have an  intonational  quality  of  childlike  inquiry  in which the question being asked is truly openended. 'Who will communicate this decision?' and  'Who  will  be  informed  about  this?'  are examples  of  na\u00efve  questions.  They  serve  the group in developing awareness about process, and they sometimes serve leaders because the question has been overlooked in planning.\n\nA  principal  from  a  large  urban  district complained about thirty years of attending dysfunctional meetings. After being introduced to na\u00efve questioning, he realized that as a group member he could make a difference. He began to ask na\u00efve questions and was amazed at the influence  he  held  as  a  group  member  to  get meetings on track.\n\nFigure 6.1 . Decision Making Questions\n\nOne of the best guides for clarity about decision making is a seminal twelve-step model (figure  6.2)  offered  by  Saphier,  Bigda-Peyton,  and Pierson (1989). They emphasize that the model's effectiveness comes from making it public.\n\nWe  advocate  sharing  and  teaching  this information to all members of an organization through modeling and explicit discussion; this goal is critical to school improvement. We do not do the process 'to' or 'on' people, nor is it a Machiavellian model for working one's will on others.  It  is,  rather,  a  set  of  guidelines  for making good decisions that will stay made.\n\n## What Topics Are Ours?\n\nGroups  conserve  precious  energy  by  focusing  their  resources  where  they  have  direct influence. When the 'sandbox' in which a group is  to  'play'  is  clear  to  all  the  members,  group energy can be powerfully directed at the items it can affect. This structure works in tandem with the first structure, deciding who decides.\n\n## Planning\n\n- 2 Find out and explain how much discretion you have to take action or not. Must this issue be dealt with? State how strongly your personally feel about it.\n- 1 Identify and explicitly state the issue who owns it; and what the underlying goal is\n- 3 Every issue lands in someone's lap in the beginning.

Twelve Steps for Making Successful Decisions\n\nAs  simple  as  these  two  decision-making concepts  are,  they  become  complex  in  organizations  in  which  different  groups  have  intersecting interests. After much deliberation, a high school's faculty members went on a school holiday believing that because they had voted for  a  change  in  the  school  schedule,  it  would be changed when they returned to school. They were stunned to learn that schedule adjustments could not be made until administrators consultated with classified staff.\n\nIn  another  case,  a  teachers'  union  spearheaded a joint project with the administration for a site-based decision-making program. One provision was a district-level council to oversee the site work. The union published the responsibilities  and  functions  of  each  participating group,  describing  'sandbox'  topics  and  decision-making authority on some topics. Despite good effort, insufficient specificity led to confusion,  which  in  each  case  required  time  and emotional energy to untangle.\n\nSchool site councils are common in many states  and  have  different  but  related  responsibilies  with  adminstration  and  the  governing board. Councils are often composed of persons elected by teaching faculty, support staff, parents  and  communty members, and the principal. Their work is complex, often encumbered with  well-intentioned  but  burdendome  state or  district  regulations.  To  foster  success  with these  groups,  districts  often  provide  training in managing meetings. We encourage avoiding Robert's Rules of Order for these groups. Robert's was designed to protect potentially messy gatherings from chaos and disorder-a unilateral  control  mindset.  A  collaborative  mindset using  information  about  meetings  provided here has been found to be less threatening and more productive.\n\nAll  groups  have  interests  that  intersect with  other  groups'  decision-making  authority. Considerations of collegiality, politics, and effectiveness must honor these overlapping areas of concern. Individual and collective vigilance is an essential ingredient of group success. At some time in every group's history, this struc- ture becomes important to departments, curriculum task forces, advisory groups, grade-level teams, site councils, and faculties.\n\nAn  issue  common  to  many  schools  is who should be responsible for decisions about schoolwide  policy  and  practices  on  student discipline. This seems like a simple 'sandbox' question. However, even the briefest conversation  will  reveal  that  several  related  questions must be explored. (We have labeled these na\u00efve questions and listed examples in appendix A.) Student  discipline  is  necessary  in  what  areas (gum or guns)? Within what parameters (state law or district  policies)? At  what  level  of  authority (unilaterally or in consultation with the principal or parents)?\n\nSuzanne Riley, a friend and colleague, was asked to consult with an elementary principal who was 'under siege.' The school technology committee, composed of parents and teachers, had  written  and  received  a  technology  grant from  a  community  business  partner.  The  initial  elation  at  receiving  the  funding  had  been replaced  by  frustration.  The  committee  had submitted  a  list  of  desired  equipment  to  the principal. The principal submitted the requisition for the equipment, but was then contacted by the district technology coordinator, who informed the principal that the desired equipment was  not  compatible  with  the  district  master technology  plan.  The  principal  informed  the committee. The committee was very upset. One of the parents, who was knowledgeable about computers, said that the district plan was totally outdated.  The  committee  argued  that  since  it had  secured  the  funding,  it  should  be  able  to purchase the best available equipment for the students. The committee accused the principal of wasting its time and ignoring its recommendations. The disagreement escalated into a very unpleasant  situation.  Had  the  committee  and principal  clarified  the  'sandbox'  issues  at  the beginning  of  the  process,  much  unhappiness could have been avoided.\n\nWhat  decision-making  processes  will  be used? Over time, intact groups learn a number of  decision-making  processes.  Knowing  what\n\nprocess is being used is as important as knowing  who  decides.  Collective  decision  making is  used  to  develop  criteria  for  deisions,  rank related values, or select within alternative approaches  to  achieve  goals.  V oting  is  the  least useful  approach,  typically  producing  a  set  of 'losers' without adequate opportuity to express opinions  or  influence  others.  Consensus  is  a concept,  not  a  strategy.  The  most  useful  consensus strategy we know is sufficient consensus,  a  process  in  which  80  percent  agreement is required  to  move  a  proposition  forward. When  a  decsion  requires  implementation  by group  members,  ranges  of  commitment  must be  expressed.  Sufficient  consensus  provides this  and  differeing  perpectives  can  be  heard, and accomodated when possible. The faciliator is responsible for assuring that minority voices are heard. It is understood that while some may not be fully in agreement with the group's decision, each has a professional obligation to carry it out. Chapter 8 on faciliation details a number of specific decision-making strategies.\n\n## What Meeting Room Features Will Support the Work?\n\nConsider  the  ideal  meeting  room.  It  is probably quiet, comfortable (but not too comfortable),  and  free  from  distractions.  David Perkins  (1992)  defines  these  and  other  factors  as  part  of  the  surroundings  that  mediate thinking and behavior. Although psychological, emotional,  cognitive,  and  physical  elements contribute  to  the  surroundings,  the  facilitator has  the  greatest  control  over  the  physical  arrangements in the meeting room.\n\nSchwartz (2002) describes three principles for  seating  arrangements  in  meetings,  and  we have added a fourth. They are as follows:\n\n- 1. All  participants  and  the  faciliator  should be  able  to  see  and  hear  each  other  and any visual information presented (e.g., flip charts, projected images).\n- 2. Arrange the seating to distinguish the participants from the nonparticipants.\n- 3. The  seating  arrangement  should  be  spacious  enough  to  meet  the  needs  of  the group, but no larger.\n- 4. The  work-group  space  should  accommodate physical movement, subgrouping with different partners, and personal ownership of the entire room rather than of a single chair or a table.\n\nArranging a room to accommodate the first principle  is  rarely  a  problem  when  the  group size is about twenty or fewer. The semicircle, U-shape, or oval arrangements shown in figure 6.3 will easily serve twenty to twenty-five participants. As the group size expands up to forty or so in a council or decision-making group, arrange a series of tables in a herringbone pattern to  allow  all  participants  to  see  the  facilitator and the flip charts. When the group size reaches eighty to three hundred people, as it sometimes does  for  community  forums,  facilitate  from  a set  of  risers.  Position  flip  charts  on  the  risers and  use  large  markers  like  Washable  Marker available  online  and  in  many  office  supply stores.  Regardless  of  the  size  of  the  group,  if the participants cannot hear one another at any time,  they  should  call  out,  'Louder,  please!' The facilitator should remind the group of this at the beginning of the meeting.\n\nSpecific  tasks  require  conscious  room  arrangement  and  provision  of  materials.  The room  arrangement  communicates  and  structures the desired interaction.\n\nKeep in mind that if eleven million bits of information  are  bombarding  the  participants each  second,  ten  million  come  through  the eyes, and only 40 percent of all that information is being processed consciously. Visual displays are  more  important  for  working  groups  than we have previously thought. Lightweight nylon banners  displaying  seven  norms  of  collaboration,  two  ways  of  talking,  meeting  standards, and group member capabilities are available at www.thinkingcollaborative.com  for  display  in meeting rooms.\n\nHigh-performing  groups  post  charts  that state  outcomes  for  their  tasks  and  charts  that\n\nFigure 6.3. Room Arrangement\n\nremind the participants of the agenda, working agreements, and other central foci like collaborative  norms.  These  groups  chart  for  group memory during discussions. They choose strategies that include a visual component.\n\nGroup memory and graphic processes support learning and retention. Charting materials such as markers, tape, pads, and easels should be readily available. Wall space should also be considered. Blank walls without other artwork are  best  for  meeting  rooms.  This  lets  each group craft the space to its own needs. When groups  become  fatigued,  auditory  functions are  the  first  to  go.  The  very  best  markers  we have found for facilitaton and presentations are Charters \u00ae Markers available at Grove Consulting  (store.grove.com).  Another  useful  brand, not as expensive, is Mr. Sketch Markers available online and in office supply stores. In video\n\n6.1 the narrator describes room arrngment concepts and materials.\n\nMany public bodies and decision-making groups  work  in  settings  in  which  others  are present  to  observe,  inform,  or  advocate.  It  is easier for the facilitator to monitor the moods, interactions, and energy of the members when the seating arrangements distinguish them from nonmembers. We've seen several arrangements for  this.  For  instance,  a  council  of  eight  to twelve  people  is  seated,  facing  one  another,\n\nVideo 6.1.\n\nFigure 6.4. Room Design For Focusing Four (see Appendix A)\n\naround a large conference table. Behind them are seated staff members and resource persons who may periodically be asked to 'come to the table' to give a report, offer an opinion, or give information on a topic.\n\nstrategically  uses  space,  tempo,  posture,  and gesture to keep the group moving together.\n\nIn  another  arrangement,  involving  a  group of  about  forty  people,  of  whom  fifteen  are  resource  people  and  guests,  the  entire  group  is seated  together  at  tables  during  the  dialogue portions of the meeting. The reason for this is to get a rich interplay of ideas and information from different perspectives. 'King Arthur knew what he was doing,' says Burleson (1990, p. 131). At a round table the distance across to another participant is less and the feeling of group involvement is  heightened When  the  group  shifts  to  a  decision-making  mode,  however,  the  guests  either leave or sit in a different part of the room. Policy boards sometimes formalize this in bylaws: 'Decision  making  will  be  by  80  percent  consensus of those present and voting. Only members shall advocate and vote in council meetings.'\n\nFacilitators and recorders usually stand or sit  in  a  location  that  physically  distinguishes them from the other group members (see figure 6.4). Like an orchestra conductor, the facilitator\n\nIn  figure  6.4  the  facilitator's  role  is  indicated by the figure in the center. The figure in the upper right indicates the position of the recorder. The arrow indicates an aisle giving the facilitator freedom to move within the group.\n\n- A) Flip  chart  on  which  the  group's  task  has been pre-recorded.\n- B) Shows the placement of chart paper posted on the wall before the meeting begins. The first  page  displays  the  process  the  group will use, the remaining charts are blank to collect ideas during brainstorming.\n- C) Shows the placement for a chair, allowing the  recorder  to  move  out  of  the  way  of participant sight lines when appropriate. A second chair could be placed to the left of the room so the facilitator, too, could retire from view.\n- D) Shows  participant  seating  close  together with an aisle for facilitator movement.\n\nFigure 6.4 depicts a room arrangement in which several key principles are apparent. First, par-\n\nticipants can easily access visual data; second, they  can  see  the  facilitator,  recorder,  and  one another; and third, because this arrangement is for a decision-making meeting, participants are seated close together with no empty chairs to prevent 'energy leaks.'\n\nTwo  of  the  most  important  facilitator  responsibilities are to focus the group on one topic at  a  time  and  one  process  at  a  time  (see  'Developing Standards,' below). Space, flip charts, other visual displays, gestures, and the position of  the  facilitator's  body  become  valuable  tools for focusing the group. In addition, all facilitator communications are enhanced when nonverbal signals  are  congruent  with  the  purpose  and the  facilitation  language.  For  example,  people consciously  direct  their  attention  to  an  area  at which someone points and unconsciously attend to  where  the  person's  eyes  are  looking.  Thus, recorders  who  point  to  a  flip  chart  and  direct their eyes to the same spot not only focus group energies there, but also ensure facilitator control of focus by not looking at the group.\n\nStand in one spot to give directions. Move to a new space to ask for clarification. This 'visual  paragraph'  separates  the  intention  of  the two  messages  both  verbally  and  nonverbally. Chapter 8 describes the facilitator role in detail and  offers  many  nonverbal  facilitation  strategies to direct. In video 6.2, a narrator describes a facilitors's use of the visual paragraph as we observe the facilitator give instructions.\n\nSkilled groups develop a variety of seating patterns  and  room  arrangements  to  support different  types  of  social  and  cognitive  interactions.  Planning  these  setups  is  part  of  the\n\nVideo 6.2.\n\nmeeting  design  process.  Groups  and  meeting designers  who  lack  this  awareness  can  get trapped by the default furniture configurations of the rooms in which they work. Moving the furniture  to  support  productive  group  work  is an important part of a meeting's success.\n\nOne vital  consideration  is  to  remove  any empty chairs  from  the  work  area.  In  both  dialogue  and  discussion  settings,  empty  chairs draw energy from the group and increase both the  physical  and  psychological  divide  among the  participants.  The  actual  physical  removal of unused chairs sends a powerful message to the group about the need for connection. This is reinforced when latecomers have to move a chair to join the group.\n\nWhen  people  in  meetings  sit  where  they always sit, they tend to see what they always see  and  say  what  they  always  say.  Group members will initially sit where they are most comfortable; let them. However, people unconsciously  become  territorial  in  meetings  quite easily. You might have noticed that in groups that  meet  periodically,  the  members  will  take the  same  space  that  they  occupied  in  the  last meeting.  There  are  two  generic  advantages for  periodically  changing  the  seating  arrangements.  First,  it  produces  energy  to  move  and sit with someone else. Group deliberations can be deadening, and thinking deadened, without physical movement.\n\nSecond,  subgroup  conversations  that  are always  held  with  the  same  person  or  small group  impose  limitations  on  thinking.  Conceptual  boundaries  are  formed  by  these  consistent  relationships,  backgrounds,  cognitive styles,  and  positions.  Moving  members  into different conversational subgroups brings\n\nfresh  thinking.  Occasionally,  changing  seating can serve other purposes as well, such as breaking up a clique or signaling a transition from one agenda item to another.\n\nCertain  tasks  are  done  more  effectively with special room arrangement and provision. For  example,  planning,  problem  solving,  and decision  making  require  access  to  multiple kinds of data. In addition to working with laptops,  tablets,  and  projector;  writing  on  charts; and  information  posted  on  the  walls  become group  memory  devices.  Many  times  we  have witnessed  a  group  fall  silent  while  members scan  what  is  on  display,  linking  and  relating information to the next task in their project.\n\nPerhaps more important than serving memory,  what  is  written  becomes  a  visual voice-always  in  the  room,  never  silent,  interacting  with  group-member  thinking.  Many high-performing  groups  post  charts  to  clarify tasks  and  remind  members of working agreements. Some groups keep lists of collaborative norms, meeting standards, and group-member capabilities  on  permanent  display.  Furthermore, the act of composing language for public  recording  interacts  with  thinking,  forcing greater specificity, economy, and consensus. In video 6.4 the importance of markers, tape, flip charts, and wall space is noted.\n\nVideo 6.4.\n\n## Technology Use in Meetings\n\nIn  meetings  with  or  without  technology, the  facilitator's  functions  remain  the  same:  to focus energy and attention and to support the group  in  collaboratively  attaining  its  goals. Central  to  this  is  maintaining  the  first  two standards  of  effective  meetings  which  are  to manage one process at a time and one topic at a time which are described later in this chapter.\n\nTechnology can be both a boon and a bane. Digital devices offer access to information and tools that help groups focus on their work by increasing  productivity  and  efficiency.  Unfortunately,  in  too  many  cases,  such  devices  are the  great  distracter,  removing  group  members from the task at hand and from their working relationships with the colleagues who are in the room. To mitigate this latter effect some groups develop working agreements to name appropriate ways to respond to text and voice messages and  clarify  when  and  under  what  conditions this might be appropriate. Mindful teams also name the elephant in the room of people bringing  personal  work  to  the  meeting.  Peeking  at laptops  and  scrolling  through  screens  on  tablets and smart phones has become the modern version  of  members  distracted  by  correcting student  assignments  and  grading  homework during team meetings. Ultimately, if the group and  its  work  are  valued  and  intended  to  produce value, then full presence with colleagues is the price of admission.\n\nIncreasingly,  working  groups  need  access  to  information  held  on  school,  district, and  state  or  provincial  Web  sites.  It  is  more productive to have participants share laptops or tablets to encourage  collaboration  with text and graphic information rather than work on  their  own  devices.  When  simultaneous attention  matters  it  is  even  better  to  set  up a  second  projector  with  attached  laptop  to create a group focus for exploring such data. The screen for such a set-up should be located off to the side, establishing the 'Third Point' pattern  described  in  appendix A. This  set-up leaves the main projector and screen available for the facilitator to project process directions that guide the group's work.\n\nA  growing  number  of  digital  tools  are emerging. Most groups are better off mastering and applying a few rather than trying to work with  too  great  a  variety.  One  basic  toolkit  is the  Google  Suite  of  online  resources.  Skillful groups  develop,  modify,  analyze,  and  share documents,  spreadsheets,  and  graphs  using Google  Drive  tools  before,  during,  and  after\n\nwork sessions. These shared objects encourage both  synchronous  and  asynchronous  collaboration  by  keeping  the  group's  work  products visible to all.\n\nFor  larger  groups,  a  second  screen  is sometimes useful for creating a shared space by connecting  to Web  sites  such  as TodaysMeet. com. Group leaders can post prompts for small groups to consider and then have table groups huddle  to  craft  their  responses  before  posting them to the site. This pattern gives participants voice and provides a sense of the room to all involved. This then becomes a structured form of  the  collective  pause,  protecting  time  for thinking  and  reflection.  The  day's  work  can then  be  archived  and  accessed  later  by  interested participants.\n\nNew  tools  are  undoubtedly  being  developed  as  we  write  these  words. An  interesting example  of  a  recent  find  is  the  Post-it  Plus App which allows users to snap a picture with a tablet or smart phone of a set of sticky notes and  then  rearrange  the  notes  on  the  screen. Users  can  export  the  screen  images  to  other screens and archive them at sites like Dropbox, Evernote, and OneDrive. The point here is not to  become  enamored with a specific  tool,  but to focus on the meeting, the tasks, the collaborative  energy  of  the  group  and  the  group's development as a group by tapping resources that serve these purposes.\n\n## Developing Meeting Standards\n\nStandards  are  agreements  for  ways  of working  together.  Although  each  group  is responsible  for  deciding  what  standards  will guide its work, we advocate starting with the following  simple  set  of  standards,  because whenever  we  have  seen  these  standards  in place, we have witnessed successful meetings: (a) maximum product, (b) minimum time, and (c)  maximum  member  satisfaction.  In  addition,  when  effective  groups  implement  these standards,  their  levels  of  efficiency,  efficacy, craftsmanship,  and  satisfaction  soar.  When ineffective  groups  adopt  them,  their  productivity improves.\n\nDoyle  and  Straus  (1993)  initially  discovered these standards for themselves in the form of  success  principles  from  attending  and  analyzing hundreds of meetings.\n\nThey noted that certain elements are common in all successful groups. A board of directors, a governmental task force, a student council, a  citizens'  committee,  an  administrative staff, [and] a radical political group may have different values and objectives, but they all face similar problems when they hold a meeting.\n\nWe have updated the principles to reflect current research. Our list of standards for this meeting structure is as follows:\n\n- 1. Groups  should  address  only  one  topic  at a time.\n- 2. Groups should use only one process  at  a time.\n- 3. Meetings should be interactive and engage balanced participation.\n- 4. Decision-making meetings should encourage cognitive conflict.\n- 5. All parties should understand and agree on meeting roles.\n\n## Addressing One Topic at a Time\n\nThere is a limit to what any individual can attend to in the moment. Groups are limited as well. If more than one topic is being discussed at  a  time,  a  group  will  lack  focus, and confusion will reign. We often hear group members ask, 'Which topic are we on right now?' Doyle and  Straus  (1993)  named  this  a  fundamental meeting  process,  a  multiheaded  animal,  'the tendency to go off in all directions simultaneously' (p. 20).\n\nMultiple-topic  discussions  start  because many issues are linked with others or because one  idea  stimulates  an  associated  idea  in  another  person.  For  example,  a  subcommittee is  meeting  to  recommend  new  textbooks  for adoption.  One  member says, 'You know, I'm\n\nreally pleased that we are working on this task because  the  old  textbooks  aren't  that  useful. In fact, I was in the supply room the other day and I saw several books just sitting on the shelf with dust gathering. I think some teachers are not using them at all.' To this, another group member  responds,  'Supply  room!  I  thought we asked that it be cleaned up. I was in there the other day; it's still a mess!' Another group member  says,  'Has  anyone  seen  my  microscope? I've  been  looking  for  it.  It  was  in  the supply room the last time I was there.'\n\nFor the linear-minded among us, this type of  conversation  drives  us  crazy.  Here  are  a couple of facilitator moves that can redirect the group to one topic.\n\nRelevancy Check . Offer a relevancy check by  asking,  'Please  help  us  understand,  Sam, how your comment relates to the topic that we are discussing.'\n\n'Cape' comments . Use the flip chart like a  bullfighter's  cape.  Sam  makes  a  comment (e.g.,  about  cleaning  the  supply  room),  and the  facilitator  moves  to  the  flip  chart  and writes  'supply  room'  while  saying  to  Sam, 'Sam, I know there are several people interested in this. Let's put it here so we don't lose it. We'll come back to it later.' See appendix A for this procedure.\n\n## Using Only One Process at a Time\n\nGroup  processes  are  vehicles  to  collectively  apply  cognitive  processes  to  common tasks.  To  generate  ideas,  to  clarify,  to  analyze, and to evaluate require different mental operations.  In  order  to  use  one  process  at  a time, all group members must know what the process is, how it works, and why it is being used.  Appendix  A  describes  many  meeting strategies,  including  some  alternatives  and tips for each one. These can be of great help to  meeting  planners  and  facilitators.  Doyle and  Straus  (1993)  observe  that  facilitators who 'go slow in  order  to  go  fast'  can  save meeting time by frontloading detailed instructions before they proceed.\n\nFigure 6.5. PAG/PAU\n\nHere are some facilitator moves that help groups be clear about and honor a process. See appendix A for details.\n\nPAG/PAU ensures  that  members  understand the process correctly. It stands for Process as Given, Process as Understood. The facilitator communicates each stage in three different mediums:  space,  voice,  and  language  (figure 6.5). See video 6.3.\n\nVideo 6.3.\n\nStop and Redirect is  a  facilitator  move to correct deviations from a process.\n\nAdvertising  executive  Alex  Osborn  invented  brainstorming  nearly  a  century  ago. Today  it  remains  one  of  the  most  common ways groups generate ideas, yet alternatives to brainstorming  are  emerging.  They  challenge the assumption that an absence of criticism is necessary for groups to generate a quantity of ideas, yet maintain the principle that meetings must be safe for members to partipate productvely. In a University of California at Berkeley experiment, 265 undergraduate female students were  organized  into  teams  of  five  and  asked\n\nto  generate  ideas  to  reduce  traffic  congestion. One-third  were  instructed  to  brainstorm,  another  third  received  no  process  instruction, and a final third were encourged to debate. On average  the  debating  teams  generated  nearly 20  percent  more  ideas  than  the  brainstorming  group.  The  group  receiving  no  process directions  performed  least  well.  Debate,  in this  situation,  appeared  to  create  more  ideas because  it  encouraged  greater  engagement  in the ideas of others and causes reassessment of one's own ideas (Lehrer, 2012). It is important to  note,  though,  that  certain  conditions  are necessary  for  success  in  this  approach.  First, a  collaborative mindset group with communication skills directed at constructive criticism, not discouraging criticism. Next, clarity about the  goal  and  rationale  for  the  process.  Lehrer (2012) cites research finding that brainstorming groups come up with fewer ideas than groups in  which  members  work  independently  and then share ideas.\n\nHere  are  some  classic  and  alternative strateies for generating ideas.\n\n## Brainstorm To Foster Quantity of Ideas\n\n- \u00b7 Call  out  ideas.  No  judgment,  criticism or questions  allowed.\n- \u00b7 One (or two) members record ideas on public charts as they are heard.\n- \u00b7 Quantity is more important than quality during this phase of group work.\n- \u00b7 Encourage out-of-the-box ideas.\n- \u00b7 Build on ideas on the list when you can.\n- \u00b7 Sequence of Events\n- \u00b7 Describe  the  guidelines.  Check  for understanding. (PAG/PAU)\n- \u00b7 State the topic 'What's the best focus for our time this year?'\n- \u00b7 Prime  the  pump.  (Pairs  generate initial ideas)\n- \u00b7 Invite members to call out ideas.\n- \u00b7 Assign numbrs to the first few raised hands  ( Airplane  stackingSee Appendix A).\n- \u00b7 Repeat airplane  stacking after  the first group have stated their ideas.\n- \u00b7 Facilitator  repeats  key  words  until recorder(s) have charted the idea.\n\nVideo  6.4  shows  how  a  facilitator  sequences  responses  from  a  group  allowing members to listen to others and not worry about their turn to speak.\n\nVideo 6.4.\n\n## Holding Interactive Meetings With Balanced Participation\n\nGroups can plan, share information, problem solve, evaluate, make decisions, and define their boundaries.  When  you  think  of  these purposes for working groups, it is clear that a pattern in which one person talks and the rest of  the  people  listen  is  not  productive.  If  you have twelve individuals in a meeting, you want twelve minds engaged. If you have thirty individuals, you want thirty minds engaged. Participants  construct  meaning  and  develop  ownership interacting with ideas and each other.\n\nHere  are  some  examples  of  facilitator moves to balance participation:\n\n- \u00b7 'Take a moment and jot down your ideas on this before we begin sharing.'\n- \u00b7 'Turn to your neighbor and generate a few more ideas. You've got thirty seconds.'\n\nFacilitators can employ other strategies  and  moves  (all  of  which  are  described\n\nThe  purpose  of  Brainstorm  and  Critique is to enrich idea generation with psychologically  safe  critiques.    In  this  protocol described  in  appendix  A,  a  normal  process  of  brainstorming  is  the  first  step. Next provide some silence in which trios critique items  on  the  list thinking  of alternatives  or  downsides.  Finally  these ideas are made public and the group, after dialoging about this data, uses the rule of one-third to identify the top few ideas.\n\n.\n\nin  detail  in  appendix  A).  In  'Assumptions Wall,'  groups  bring  up  and  and  examine their  assumptions.  This  requires  recordable wall space for subgroups. 'In and Out of the Frame' provides groups with opportunities to get outside their own perspectives to approach a topic. In 'Corners,' members vote with their feet, moving to a place in the room that represents their position.\n\nToo  often  we  have  heard  the  statement that  the  purpose  of  participation  in  meetings is  for  'buy-in.' We discourage the use of this phrase because it carries with it suppositions of manipulation and inferences that the leader has something to sell and the group has an opportunity to buy it. We find, instead, that the purpose of participation is to develop ownership. When ideas  are  owned,  when  values  are  articulated and  owned,  when  beliefs  are  admitted,  when plans and programs and strategies are posed by the group, commitment is high and the likelihood of successful implementation is great. As we  shall  see  in  the  next  principle,  ownership does not occur without disagreements.\n\nBalanced  participation  does  not  mean that  every  member  must  speak  for  an  equal amount of time; it means that the door is open\n\nGroups needlessly waste brain cells anytime  a  group  sits  beyond  20  minutes without a chance to process information with a neighbor.\n\nfor member participation. There are two forms in which group members speak: to the entire group and to a partner or a small group nearby. Facilitate  participation  by  asking  individuals to share with a partner before speaking or to get together with a group of four and identify major criteria to be brought before the group. Partner talk is the safest form of member participation. Moves like these richly engage everyone in thinking processes. They also offer a cloak of anonymity when voices do not wish to be identified.\n\n## Engage Cognitive Conflict\n\nMeetings  must  be  safe,  but  not  necessarily  comfortable.  When  a  group's  meetings are  always  comfortable,  the  group  is  probably not  talking  about  the  right  things.  Cognitive conflict-disagreements among group members about substantive issues like goals, values, and assumptions-tends to improve team effectiveness, lead  to better decisions,  and  increase commitment, cohesiveness, empathy, and understanding. Cognitive conflict occurs as teams examine, compare, and reconcile these differences.\n\nThe  problem  with  encouraging  cognitive conflict  is  that  once  it  is  aroused,  it  can  be difficult  to  control.  If  cognitive  conflict  slides into affective conflict, then hostility, avoidance, cynicism, or apathy can result. Affective conflict  focuses  anger  on  individuals  rather  than ideas, and disagreement becomes personalized. It  can  occur  when  group  members  lack  the skills to disagree gracefully. The greatest insurance against affective conflict is group-member skills and practice of the seven norms of collaboration (see chapter 4).\n\nConflict  about  ideas  improves  decision quality  but  can  also  weaken  the  group's  ability to work together. Resolving this tension is especially important when consensus is valued and  follow-through  is  required.  Teams  that encourage cognitive conflict without affective conflict  are  characterized  by  focused  activity, creativity,  open  communication,  and  integration. They work close to the core of issues and are  not  distracted  by  trivial  points.  They  en-\n\n## Cognitive Conflict\n\nDisagreements about substantive differences of opinion improve team effectiveness and produce\n\n- Better decisions\n- Increased commitment\n- Increased cohesiveness\n- Increased empathy\n- Increased understanding\n\nFigure 6.6. Outcomes of Conflict\n\ncourage thinking beyond normal options, listen to  the  'minority  voice,'  encourage  dissenting opinions, synergize the thoughts and perspectives of different members, and approach problems from new perspectives. The outcomes of conflict are shown in figure 6.6.\n\nConflict  can  be  an  asset  to  maintaining open communication. Members in groups with productive  conflict  challenge  each  other's  assumptions. They make the fullest possible use of all their members, whereas in less effective groups there is often a disproportionate contribution from certain members. Good teams seek out  the  opinions  of  those  who  are  less  active and moderate the input of those who monopolize the conversation. See chapter 12 for how certainty, risk, and adaptivity can be unresolveable sources of conflict unless understood.\n\nThe conditions in which cognitive conflict exist without affective conflict call for cognitive, emotional, and social maturity. These attributes can  be  scaffolded  with  the  understanding  of meeting  standards,  the  use  of  psychologically safe protocols (strategies), and the application of the seven norms of collaboration.\n\n## Understand and Agree on Meeting Roles\n\nAny  team  works  most  effectively  when its members  know  one  another's  responsibilities. The shortstop can anticipate the first baseman's  position  in  relation  to  first  base; therefore  his  throw  is  effective.  The  second baseman  knows  that  the  center  fielder  will back him up on a long ball. Because he can\n\n## Affective Conflict\n\nDisagreements over personalized, individually oriented matters reduce team effectiveness and produce\n\n- Destructive conflict\n- Poorer decisions\n- Decreased commitment\n- Decreased cohesiveness\n- Decreased empathy\n\ncount on his teammate, he stays close to second base to guard it. The same principle works for  group  meetings.  In  meetings  the  group members are the utility infielders.\n\nAlthough there are many possible meeting roles,  we  identify  four  that  are  most  typically found  in  working  groups.  These  are  (a)  engaged  participant,  (b)  facilitator,  (c)  recorder, and (d) role or knowledge authority.\n\n## Engaged Participant\n\nBecause  meeting  success  is  influenced more by the collaborative mindset of the group than by facilitator leadership, we call the people who occupy this role 'engaged participants' to illuminate the active and essential contribution they  make  to  the  group's  work.  Anyone,  at some  time,  might  be  an  engaged  participant. Standing-committee  members,  participating guests at a special session, the recorder or facilitator  before or after serving in those roles, and the building administrator can all at some time serve as engaged participants. What these group members know and do is critically important to group effectiveness.\n\nIn  groups  with  a  collaborative  mindset, engaged  participants  monitor  their  personal adherence to meeting standards. They notice and  set  aside  comments  they  are  about  to make if the comment would violate the 'one topic at  a  time'  standard. They also monitor the group's adherence to standards with na\u00efve questions. Engaged participants use the seven norms of collaboration, seek and provide data,\n\nclarify  decision-making  processes  and  levels of  authority,  and  perform  gatekeeping  functions for others. When members are clear they have  a  role  in  communicating  the  meeting's content to others, they are more likely to insist on their own clarity (Heifetz, Linsky, and Grashow, 2009).\n\nGatekeeping . Malita  might  say  to  Sid, 'Sid,  I'm  aware  that  you  haven't  talked  for  a little  while.  Is  there  anything  that  you  would like  to  add?'  Notice  in  this  interchange  that Sid  is  not  on  the  spot  to  respond.  The  gate, however, has been opened. Similarly, Leonardo might say to Aron, 'Aron, I know you served on a committee like this last year. Do you have anything  that  you'd  like  to  say?'  Alejandra says  to  Ken,  'Ken,  from  where  I'm  sitting, your eyebrows look furrowed. What are some comments might you like to add?'\n\nSetting  and  testing  working  agreements . Engaged  participants  set  and  test  working agreements. For example, Jose sets a working agreement  by  saying  to  the  group,  'I'm  requesting that we make an agreement to start our meetings on time. I notice that some of us are here on time and others are not. Frequently, I have to wait fifteen minutes before the meeting starts.'  Discussion  ensues. The  group  decides to begin meetings on time. Several weeks later, Anhadh tests the agreement by saying, 'I'd like to talk about the decision that we made several meetings ago to start meetings on time. I notice that this is not happening. What do we need to do to keep our agreement?'\n\nTesting  consensus . Engaged  participants informally  test  consensus  by  summary  paraphrasing.  Sometimes  they  say,  'It  seems  that we may have agreement on this. Is that true?' or 'Could we see a show of thumbs? Thumbs up if you are in agreement, thumbs down if not, thumbs sideways if you're not sure or it's not important to you.'\n\nMonitoring internal  processes . Engaged participants  monitor  their  own  internal  processes  and  listen  to  their  own  listening.  They become  aware  of  when  they  have  stopped listening to others and are following a train of thought  in  their  own  minds.  They  recognize their  emotional  responses  to  other  speakers. When they are irritated, they notice it, but instead of giving in to the irritation, they locate the probable reason. Then they set the feeling aside  so  they  can  stay  fully  engaged  in  the conversation.  When  they  are  listening  to  understand, yet find themselves offering counterarguments in their own minds, they notice this and suspend the unproductive mental activity.\n\nFinally, engaged participants are conscious of the assumptions they bring to a conversation and notice how these influence their listening, thinking, and speaking.\n\n## Facilitator\n\nAs you will see in chapter 8, the facilitator role requires a sophisticated set of skills. A facilitator is a third party to a conversation and is responsible for process. As a director of process, the facilitator knows what kind of structures and strategies will be useful in helping the group do its  work.  When  the  facilitator  asks  the  group to  use  certain  procedures  or  intervenes  with counterproductive behavior, it is on the basis of this process knowledge. A facilitator must be a person who is acceptable to all members of the group, who is substantively neutral, and who has no decision-making authority about the topic.\n\nAlthough  a  facilitator  displays  no  preference for any of the solutions the group considers,  no facilitator is truly neutral. To be 'substantively neutral' (Schwartz, 2002) means that facilitators  give  no  verbal  or  nonverbal  cues of  their  personal  reactions  to  the  ideas  being discussed.  Because  the  facilitator  is  serving the group, not certain members, this display of neutrality is important.\n\nFacilitators  often  start  by  clarifying  their own role with the group:\n\nMy  job  is  to  help  you  have  a  conversation about  these  topics  in  such  a  way  that  you understand one anothers' views and the reasoning  that  leads  people  to  those  views.  In this way you have the information with which to make informed decisions. I will not share\n\nmy own views on topics you discuss. However [this would sometimes be appropriate to add], as you know, I have some expertise in one of the topics on your agenda. Should you like information from me on that topic, let me know and I will step out of the facilitation role to provide that.\n\nSchwartz (2002) suggests that facilitators add another statement to their self-introduction in order to reinforce the group's understanding and  proactive  influence  on  roles:  'Please  let me know if at any time you think I am acting inconsistently with my role. Does anyone have any concerns?' With groups that have no history of working together, the facilitator may go on to describe other meeting roles.\n\nChapter 8 details facilitator functions and tools in a meeting and describes how the facilitator focuses group energy, keeps the group on task, and directs processes.\n\n## Recorder\n\nAs groups tire, auditory acuity is the first modality  to  fade.  Because  many  meetings are  long,  members  begin  to  tire,  or  because meetings are at the end of the school day and members are already tired, public recording is critically important for the group's short-term memory. The later in the day the meeting or the  more  fatigued  the  participants,  the  more public  recording  is  necessary.  On  average humans  can  manage  three  to  four  items  of information in their working memories (Moskowitz,  2008).  Public  recording  keeps  key data in front of a group.\n\nRecorders, like facilitators, occupy a position of purposeful neutrality. Their function is to support the group by maintaining a clear visual representation of important ideas and data and to support the facilitator in managing processes as effectively and efficiently as possible. The  recorder  and  facilitator  also  serve  as  behind-the-scenes custodians, arranging displays, clearing  out  unnecessary  data,  and  arranging the room for special activities.\n\nBecause  you  want  the  faciliator  to  direct the focus of the group, it is advisable that re- corders  look  at  the  charts  on  which  they  are working, or  at  the  faciliator,  instead  of  at  the group. Because members' eyes go in the direction  of  the  leader's  eyes,  recorders  looking  at the group split the visual-and cognitive-focus of the group.\n\nA  great  deal  of  knowledge  is  emerging about  the  techniques  and  tools  of  public  recording  (Buckley,  2005).  Following  are  several basics:\n\n- \u00b7 Print rather than write.\n- \u00b7 Use uppercase and lowercase case letters, not all caps.\n- \u00b7 Use  color-alternate  green, blue, and brown for text. Never use red for text; it is hard to read. Reserve red for headlines and other organizers. Reserve black for boxes, arrows, or other organizers.\n- \u00b7 Use only water-based pens.\n- \u00b7 Write large enough for all members to read.\n- \u00b7 Keep all charts visible at all times.\n- \u00b7 Border charts for formal appearance.\n- \u00b7 Use  pictographs  (see  Buckley,  2002,  for traceable chart art).\n- \u00b7 Keep your eyes on the chart when you are recording.  See  eye-hand  coordination  in appendix A for rationale and ways to use this principle in other settings.\n- \u00b7 Have the facilitator tell the group to direct corrections.\n- \u00b7 Have the facilitator ask the group what not to record.\n- \u00b7 Point to or stand by the items as they are being discussed.\n- \u00b7 Remain still and nondistracting.\n- \u00b7 Move your body to support the facilitator's use of space.\n\n## Role or Knowledge Authority\n\nLeaders lead. Principals lead through modeling,  and  develop  leadership  in  others.  In the  past,  the  principal  has  been  expected  to lead  meetings,  but  this  is  changing.  'Because\n\nof  their  positional  authority  and  control  over school  resources,  principals  are  in  a  strategic position  to  promote  or  inhibit  the  development of a teacher learning community in their school' (McLaughlin and Talbert, 2006).\n\nMany  people  lead  meetings.  Leadership roles  in  meetings  are  called  by  many  names: chairperson,  convener,  facilitator,  leader,  consultant,  specialist,  manager,  and  others.  Because we see a critical leadership role in meetings that does not include running the meeting, we have been searching for a term that might be neutral, or at least unlike the other names we have for meeting leadership.\n\nThe most descriptive term we've found so far is role authority or knowledge authority . The role  authority  might  be  the  principal  in  a  staff meeting,  the  vice  principal  if  the  principal  is not there, the superintendent in a district office meeting, or the assistant superintendent if the superintendent is not there. The knowledge authority  might  be  the  literacy  coach,  at  a  task  force dealing  with  the  reading  program;  the  science consultant, in a committee addressing a science curriculum;  or  an  external  consultant  charged with making recommendations to the group on improving organizational effectiveness.\n\nWhen the role  or  knowledge  authority  is in  a  meeting  without  a  facilitator,  this  person typically  manages the group processes. He or she sets the agenda, decides when to move to the  next  topic,  recognizes  those  who  want  to speak,  writes  meeting  notes  to  assist  remembering, and summarizes actions to be taken. In managing all these procedural tasks, the role or knowledge authority limits, or at least diffuses, the attention given to meeting content and also limits  group access to the special information resources that are part of this person's particular role or knowledge expertise.\n\nWithout a facilitator, the value of the role or  knowledge  authority's  information  is  limited.  First,  because  this  leader  has  to  balance attention  between  process  and  content,  there is  less  time  for  interaction  with  the  content. Second,  it  is  extremely  rare  that  a  leader  can maintain  the  neutrality  required  of  the  facili- tation  process  give  content  information to the group,  and  be  perceived  as  neutral.  For  this reason,  leaders  become  more  influential  and the group matures and makes better decisions when a person other than the role or knowledge authority facilitates the meeting.\n\nWhen leaders such as department heads or principals use the services of a meeting facilitator, they will often set meeting schedules, coordinate topics with faculty and others, arrange to have department members rotate through the facilitator  and  recorder  roles,  and  codevelop the agenda design with the meeting facilitator. The  role  authority  will  also  follow  through to  see  that  subcommittee  tasks  are  clear,  that resources are available, and that evaluation of processes and products is provided.\n\nIn many ways, the role or knowledge authority  functions  like  any  engaged  participant in the meeting, but he or she is also available to inform the group about constraints, resources, and values related to the topic. Like other group members, the role or knowledge authority can advocate  one's  own  ideas  as  well  as  inquire about the ideas of others. Remember that until groups  have  attained  a  high  state  of  interdependence, actions in this role will speak louder than words.\n\nCan the facilitator or recorder ever speak? Under certain conditions. Periodically the person  faciliating  or  recording  may  have  important  information  for  the  group  or  may  be asked for an opinion. In such cases, signal role change by asking if it is okay to change hats, ask a participant to take over the faciliation or recording role and sit as a member of the group until  you  have  completed  your  input.  Since people  are  influenced  more  by  what  they  see than what is said, the physcial shift is essential. This is especially useful for team leaders and department heads who often need to wear two hats-faciliator  and  leader.  In  some  settings, content specialists will often facilitate meetings in  content  areas  other  than  their  own  and  a special education consultant might periodically facilitate the superintendent's  cabinent.  For principals,  turning  the  meeting  over  requires\n\ndeveloping  a  collaborative  mindset  with  the faculty and gradually grooming individuals to take over the facilitation role.\n\nIn one Arizona district that was influenced by  the  concepts  and  tools  presented  here,  the superintendent  working  with  her  leadership team  redesigned  their  monthly  meeting  to break  the  pattern  of  each  major  department head  presenting  to  the  whole  group  in  serial fashion. As you can imagine, this common way of organizing a 'meeting' did not energize high levels of participation among the group members in attendance that were reluctant to raise points  of  confusion  or  offer  alternative  viewpoints in front of their peers and supervisors.\n\nIn the  revised  scheme,  major  players, including  the  superintendent  and  the  various associates  and  department  leaders  arranged themselves  around  the  periphery  of  the  room with chairs for participants to join them. Then, for  a  set  amount  of  time  each  district  leader presented  essential  information  to  their  small group and engaged each group in dialogue and discussion about that month's priorities. After a set amount of time, the small groups rotated to the next presentation. This format motivated district  leaders  to  develop  clear  outcomes  for the overall meeting and for their specific segments. They also reported much higher levels of engagement and a greater willingness on the part of participants to raise issues and concerns.\n\n## Using the Three Success Structures\n\nEvery working group needs a declarative knowledge of the three success structures. This means  that  members  can  describe  the  structures,  their  parts,  and  the  principles  on  which they  are  based.  As  groups  learn  from  their experiences,  procedural  knowledge  will  develop, and members will become skillful at exercising,  monitoring,  and  self-correcting  both themselves as individuals and the group. One way to increase both consciousness about and skill in applying the three success structures is to use the meeting assessment inventory found in appendix I. Regular use of this inventory and reflective dialogue with group members about the results focuses attention on skill gains and sticking points for that group.\n\nMature groups eventually acquire a degree of  conditional  knowledge,  allowing  them  to recognize when to break the rules and achieve their purpose even more effectively. Such powerful  and  cumulative  knowledge  can  be,  and is,  developed  with  faculties,  committees,  task forces,  cabinets,  advisory  boards,  and  other groups. It does not have to be lost because of changing membership or environmental crises. We have facilitated a statewide group responsible for deciding how millions of dollars will be used each year to support technology. This group  met  for  a  full-day  meeting  three  times a  year.  Because  members  were  appointed  as representatives from regions, membership constantly changed. Yet after a year-and-a-half of facilitated meetings, the consensus of the group was that 'we have become our values and operating principles.' Effective groups develop a commitment to practice and monitor their use of the three structures.\n\nIn any session in which planning, reflecting,  or  problem  solving  occurs,  the  engaged participants-that is, the group members-are the  ones  who  do  the  work  of  the  meeting.  In fact,  the  meeting's  success is more dependent on  their  informed  participation  than  on  the skills  and  knowledge of a boss, a content expert,  or  a  facilitator.  This  is  especially  so  in small work teams. In large groups a facilitator is  required  to  orchestrate  and  direct  the  contributions of group members. Group members should be able to distinguish between data and inference;  distinguish  relevant  from  irrelevant information,  claims,  or  reasons;  identify  unstated assumptions; and interpret data.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn  this  chapter  we've  explored  foundation knowledge for the art and science of meetings. Our  definition  of  success  for  meetings  is  that they  take  minimum  time,  produce  maximum work,  and  generate  a  maximum  amount  of\n\nmember  satisfaction.  The  ultimate  goal  is  that meetings serve as vehicles to protect and support the primary mission of the school, which is student learning. At schools and in special district committees-McLaughlin  and  Talbert  (2006) say  this  as  well-the  goal  is  to  study  data  on teaching and learning, and then agree to the next steps for changing instruction and for examining the effects of change on student learning.\n\nMeetings are becoming as important a part of  teachers'  work  as  lesson  design.  For  this reason, knowing how to produce work through meetings  has  become  an  essential  part  of  a professional portfolio, regardless of one's role.\n\nIn the next chapter, we explore in detail the principles  of  facilitation,  facilitator  functions, and facilitation tools.\n\n## Postscript\n\nWhile this book was still in development, Google  released  the  results  of  a  multi-year study of 180 Google teams. The results confirm and extend ideas in this book and chapter. Google's approach to the development of teams and team  leadership  applies  findings  from  MIT's Human Dynamics Laboratory.\n\nPsychology  safety,  more  than  anything else, produces effective group work. Psychological safety, they found, was based on group norms  in  which  individuals  set  aside  their personal  proclivities  during  group  work  and honor  team  norms.  Two  essential  attributes: equity  of  turn-taking  and  social  sensitivity, create a climate of interpersonal trust and mutual respect that foster task success. There was nothing  in  the  research  supporting  the  idea that  a  certain  mix  of  personalities,  skills  or backgrounds contributes to higher performing teams. (Duhigg 2016).\n\nWe propose that the seven norms of collaboration (chapter 4), two ways of talking (Chapter 5) and three success structures (chapter 6) forge a resilient foundation for psychological safety.\n\n## Chapter 7\n\n## Time-Efficient Meetings\n\nM eetings that are well-planned and executed-and the planning is prerequisite to the execution-promote one of the most valuable energy sources  for  groups,  and  the  one  most  consistently  related  to  school success: efficacy.\n\nAgenda construction is, first of all, a way of  thinking.  There  is  simply  no  other  activity that can economize time and maximize success and  satisfaction  as  much  as  a  well-formed agenda. The  problem,  of  course,  is  that  it  requires time to develop one.\n\n'Prepare  more  and  meet  less'  is  a  motto for  successful  groups  and  effective  leaders. By  making  a  personal  investment  in  agenda design, leaders reduce wasted time by tenfold and overall meeting time by as much as 30 percent. This in turn produces dramatic increases in productivity and group-member satisfaction.\n\nWhen  leaders  value  agenda  design,  department  meetings  become  better  run,  ad  hoc committees function more smoothly, and task forces  and  advisory  groups  feel  better  about their  work  and  get  more  done.  Being  smart and  proactive  about  meeting  design  pays  off throughout the school and the district.\n\nSmart leaders and facilitators value meeting  planning  in  the  same  way  that  high-performing  teachers  value  planning  for  instruction, because it influences the success of what follows.\n\nGroups meet for many reasons in schools. Each  meeting  provides  opportunities  to  both manage the work of the group and the school and to increase the group's capacity to do richer and deeper work. Once again, both things and energy matter. Smart agendas help groups that meet  for  planning  and  problem  solving  get better  at  planning  and  problem  solving.  This happens  when  the  meeting  design  provides both task focus and opportunities to reflect on the process and personal and collective learning in these arenas. Smart agendas help groups that meet to explore and refine teaching strategies also learn how to learn as colleagues and professionals. Smart agendas help groups that meet to support the learning needs of individual students also learn ways to collaboratively learn  from  and  with  data  and  from  and  with one another.\n\n## How to Use This Chapter\n\nWe will  describe  the  remarkable  benefits of  meeting  design  in  complex  nonlinear  systems, such as schools. Although protecting time to  design  meetings  produces  some  tensions, and  time-pressed  leaders  occasionally  have to work  extemporaneously,  the  majority  of meetings,  planned  well,  will  produce  benefits by the hundredfold. This chapter elaborates on ways  to  achieve  these  benefits.  You  will  find principles  of  agenda  construction,  samples  of agendas, and a template for delegating tasks to groups. Finally, we offer some general design and planning tips.\n\nThe sequence in which you will want this information depends on your prior information, personal  history,  present  needs,  and  urgency. If  you  have  an  immediate  need  for  agenda samples,  move  ahead  to  the  section  'Agenda Templates' or to the list of tips within it. If you want  a  rationale  with  which  to  persuade  others to invest in design work, go to the section\n\n'Design Matters.' If you are interested in design principles that capacitate you to teach others and to develop effective agendas in any setting,  read 'The Principles of Design.' Should you want to delegate a problem to a group for its recommendations, go to the section 'Posing Problems for Groups to Work On.'\n\n## Design Matters\n\nConsider the time you spend in meetings. At  a  modest  two  hours  per  week,  you  are spending  more  than  three  thousand  hours  in meetings  throughout  the  life  of  your  career. If  you translate that to a team of twelve, then 4,500 eight-hour days are being spent in meetings. That's more than twelve years! All professions and industries tend to malign meetings as time wasters. This doesn't have to be so.\n\nPoorly  organized  meetings  incur  abysmal costs.  Morale  suffers,  venting  and  other  counterproductive exchanges move to the building's parking  lot,  and  members  grow  less  and  less willing to invest their time in projects, committees, and teams. Frustration reigns in department meetings and ad hoc groups and insinuates its presence into school activities, including teaching.  Many of us have experienced this and yet know  that  it  does  not  have  to  be  so.  In  many settings, meetings  are  well-organized;  what emerges there are well-run meetings, optimisim, efficacy,  successful  results,  and  an  increasing willingness to particpate in collaborative work.\n\nWhat's talked  about  matters.  One  district collected  and  analyzed  agendas  from  faculty meetings, school leadership teams, department meetings,  and  grade-level  groups.  From  60 percent  to  80  percent  of  the  meetings  were devoted  to  'administrivia'-scheduling,  announcements,  event  organization,  discipline, compliance  issues,  or  disputes-leaving  only a  small  percentage  of  time  for  the  discussion of  teaching  and  learning.  In  other  districts announcements  and  other  'administrivia'  are handled  through  other  forms  of  communication. The only reason an announcment or event details should appear on an agenda is if mem- bers need conversation in order to understand and uniformly apply it.\n\nAgendas, too reveal the dynamical systems principle  that  both  things  and  energy  matter. When meeting topics are matters of substance and  the  conversations  are  well-organized,  the intangible  products  of  meetings  translate  to mindsets  and  behaviors.  These  must  not  be underestimated,  for  when  the  intangibles  are positive, they provide the energy for productive work.  Well-planned  and  executed  meetings promote collective efficacy, found to be a foundation for success even in low socioeconomic schools (Hoy et al., 2006).\n\n## Principles of Design\n\nBecause principles are generalizations, not rules, they offer elasticity, which rules do not. We will explore five agenda-design principles: (a)  allocentrism,  planning  with  the  group  in mind;  (b)  relevance,  connecting  to  the  members  and  unit  goals;  (c)  information,  ensuring that groups have the information they need to do  their  task;  (d)  interaction,  keeping  minds and  voices  active;  and  (e)  congruence  with organizational values and beliefs.\n\n## Allocentrism\n\nDesign with the users in mind. Put yourself  in  their  place.  Imagine  how you will feel entering  the  meeting. Are  there  special  needs that  require  attention? Will the group be tired or  distracted?  Are  the  participants  informed about the purpose of the session? What knowledge  do  they  bring  to  the  table  that  does  not have to be repeated? What would they need to know to  encourage  participation?  What  skills might have to be introduced or reinforced for them to do good work on the issues that will be  addressed?  Are  there  issues  of  mood  that might run counter to receptivity? What seating is going  to  be  comfortable,  psychologically and  physically?  When  attitude  or  low  energy is  an  issue,  design  an  opening that alters this. Consider using banned words, acknowledge re-\n\nsistance or check-in or other inclusion activities found in appendix A to shift mood.\n\nWe once conducted a meeting in a kindergarten  room  that  was  not  going  well.  Finally, we  realized  the  discomfort  that  people  were feeling sitting in those itty-bitty chairs, so we corrected  the  seating  and  the  quality  of  the meeting improved. A simple matter of furniture placement can make an enormous difference in meeting success. We described practical models for room design and materials in chapter 6.\n\n## Relevance\n\nThe principle of relevance concerns membership,  the  internal  fit  of  the  agenda  items, and the degree to which the agenda has some bearing on the larger contexts and goals within which the group works.\n\nWhen an item is relevant to only part of the group, schedule it last and dismiss those who are  not  involved.  Nothing  is  more  frustrating and disrespectful of time than to make someone sit through agenda items that are irrelevant to  them. Selective dismissals honor the group members and become part of a norm of appreciating their energies and time.\n\nTo what degree do the agenda items relate to one another? Cluster those that relate. Organize others using transitions activities that are described  in  chapter  8.  Finally,  and  perhaps most important, what bearing does this meeting have on the larger contexts of the group's existence and work? Cognizance of this allows an opening  in  which  the  meeting  is  perceptually framed to help the participants make sense of the  work.  Groups  often  need  a  sense  of  their history to understand and embrace the work of a particular meeting.\n\n## Information\n\nThree questions guide agenda construction related to information. The first of these is deciding what information is needed for the group to do its work. As mentioned above, sometimes this information is history and context so that the  group  members  can  start  from  the  same place together. Groups might occasionally need policy information or research summaries on a topic in order to do informed work; the agenda planner can then provide for a paired reading activity  from  an  appropriate  journal.  Second, it  is  often  important  to  know  which  players outside the group, or which other groups, have say on the topic so that consciousness can be brought to the question of defining the 'sandbox,' one of the four structures for successful meetings described in chapter 6.\n\nThird,  and  most  important,  groups  need to  know who they are in the decision-making process.  Are  they  to  inform,  recommend,  or decide? Third, if they are to inform or recommend, to whom are they relaying information and  what  are  the  next  steps  in  the  process? Display this information directly on the agenda next to the items.\n\n## Interaction\n\nAssuming  that  the  purpose  of  a  meeting is  for  members  to  think,  deliberate,  or  take action, interaction is essential. Any group that spends  the  majority  of  its  time  in  full-group mode is  keeping  its  brain  activity  surpressed, encouraging  lethargy,  and  reducing  meeting achievement  and  the  value  for  participants. Two essential questions must be addressed to plan  for  the  degrees  and  types  of  interaction. What tasks will be asked of the group: comprehending, exploring, informing, recommending, or deciding? What cognitive actitvities will be required:  generating,  categorizing,  analyzing, synthesizing, or extrapolating?\n\nThe thoughtful use of 'conversation containers' fosters success. These essentially provide  scaffolds  for  the  talk.  Skillful  designers consider  ways  to  start,  structure,  and  sustain thinking in their meetings.\n\nJust  because  people  are  sitting  together does not mean that they are a group capable of working together. Recognize that groups do not arrive primed for work; they need to transition physically,  socially,  cognitively,  and  emotion-\n\nally  into  the  work  space  and  topic.  Wellman and Lipton (2004) refer to strategies that perfom this function as conversation starters .\n\nWell-chosen activators are psychologically safe  conversation  starters  that  are  pertinent to  the  task.  Safety  is  important;  it  allows  the risk  of  stating  ideas  when  you  are  not  sure, disclosing  that  you  do  not  know,  disagreeing, or being able to talk and not be overridden by highly  verbal  participants.  Overcoming  this risk is at the heart of effective meeting participation. What happens early in a meeting sets the  tone  for  the  session.  By  encouraging  full participation  at  the  outset,  participants  then expect  to  contribute  throughout  the  session. When  group  leaders  talk  at  the  group  in  the opening minutes, participants become passive consumers of information with varying degrees of engagement. See inclusion activities in appendix A for ideas.\n\nProtocols (both starters and structures) can be  designed  to  minimize  risk  and  maximize critical  thinking.  Avoid,  at  all  costs,  opening with  'feel  good'  activities  in  which  participants see no connection to their work.\n\nAlthough  safety  is  necessary  to  access the neocortex and the members' best thinking, comfort  is  not  a  requirement  in  meetings.  In fact,  if  a  group  is  always  comfortable,  it  is probably talking about the wrong things.\n\n## Structures\n\nStructures  are  strategies,  or  protocols,  that shape and organize conversations, again providing  psychological  safety  and  maximizing  time efficiency. Almost any strategy can be designed as a protocol that sets rules or instructions for a conversation.  Many  are  listed  in  chapter  8,  related to facilitator tasks during different meeting stages; others can be found in appendix A.\n\nWe are using the terms strategy and protocol somewhat interchangeably. In diplomacy a  protocol  governs  who  greets  whom  first;  in technology it governs the rules for two pieces of  equipment to talk together. A meeting protocol provides a 'container' for conversations that defines what is to happen and how it will occur. In meetings, protocols have the following three functions:\n\n- 1. Establish topics, time for the activity, who speaks, and the sequence of the speakers, if any.\n- 2. Provide challenge and limit discomfort.\n- 3. Designate the thinking skills to be used.\n\nWithout  a  structure,  conversations  can meander,  go  off  course,  and  take  valuable time  away  from  the  meeting  objectives.  The thoughtful  selection  of  strategies  supports  the efficient use  of  time  by  defining  the  total amount of time for a conversation and the time for each component. Protocols can also determine the type of thinking that is required, such as  separating  data  from  inference,  analyzing, evaluating, or developing theories.\n\nSome  examples  of  structures are the paired-reading  activities  of  'Say  Something,' or  the  strategies  'Key  Concepts/Key  Ideas,' 'Assumptions  Wall,'  and  'Card  Stack  and Shuffle'  (appendix  A).  Brainstorming  is  a structure  because  it  specifies  the  thought  processes  to  use  and  the  order  in  which  to  use them, and because the facilitator is calling on people,  determining  who  speaks  when.  It  is our  view  that  the  steps  in  the  brainstorming protocols always have to be reviewed and that facilitators should intervene immediately when violations or mutations occur.\n\n## Sustainers\n\nSustainers are strategies and tools that are used to maintain longer, focused conversations. How  people  talk  to  one  another  will  either sustain  or  dampen  communication. Sustainers are  verbal  and  nonverbal  tools  used  by  group members  to  enhance  their  ability  to  deliver psychologically  safe  thoughts  to  one  another even when they disagree. The seven norms of collaboration  described  in  chapter  4  serve  as the  starting  point  for  this  set  of  skills.  Learning  the  tools  for  inquiry  described  in  chapter 4  represents  an  ongoing  curriculum  for  many groups.  Group  size  is  an  important  sustainer.\n\nPaired  activities  require  the  least  amount  of time,  compared  to  trios,  quartets,  or  sextets. Pairs are psychologically safer units than larger groups  are.  Trios  bring  the  valuable  tension of  three  sets  of  experiences.  It  is  also  harder in  a  trio  than  in  a  pair  to  leave  the  task  and enter social talk. Quartets are diverse yet small enough to be in the early stages of learning as they apply new communication skills. Quartets are an ideal size to dialogue about data posted before  them  on  the  wall.  Groups  of  six  are  a good  size  for  protocols  like  'First  Turn/Last Turn' or 'Grounding' (see appendix A) and for activities that synthesize findings.\n\nIndividual reflection is the safest size unit of  all.  Many  strategies  begin  with  private  reflection,  either  mentally  or  in  writing,  giving members  a  chance  to  gather  their  thoughts before participating in a group.\n\n## Offer the What, Why, and How of Strategies and Structures\n\nA  wise  facilitation  practice  is to offer the  what,  why,  and  how  of  any  strategy  and structure  you  are  about  to  use  with  a  group. Offering  the  'Why'  is  especially  important when  applying  new  meeting  tools  that  break pattern for the group. For example, using pairs and trios instead of operating as a committee of the whole may be disconcerting for some group members. In this case the facilitator might say: 'We're going to use a paired reading strategy so that you can engage with the text and with a partner to clarify your understanding and gain the  perspective  of  another  set  of  eyes.'  The 'Why' is a statement of purpose and intention. The why speaks to both the intention of a particular  strategy  or  structure  and  to  the  deeper group development outcomes for that group.\n\nKeep in mind that these are principles, not rules,  and  that  the  strategies  named  here  are not  limited  to  the  group  size  suggested.  Sue Presler, a colleague and friend, while working with a full faculty in Hawaii, once took a step from  the  'Focusing  Four'  (see  appendix  A) and  used  it  with  the  full  group  to  have  them advocate  lunchroom  solutions  that  had  been generated  the  week  before.  We  never  would have considered doing that, yet after just a few people  talked,  it  became  clear  to  the  group which solution would serve best.\n\nDegree  of  structure  is  another  sustainer. The planners decide when to select a tight or a loose protocol as a matter of scaffolding for success. A tight protocol is one in which members  have  little  choice  about  when  and  how to  participate  and  have  maximum  scaffolding for success.  Examples  are  'First  Turn/Last Turn,' 'In and Out of the Frame,' and 'Futures Wheel.' Designers will plan for tight protocols when  the  topic  is  complex  or  emotionally loaded or when the group does not have much experience working together effectively.\n\nLoose  protocols  provide  less  scaffolding and leave more decisions in the hands of members.  Examples  are  'Paired  Verbal  Fluency,' 'Around  the  Room  and  Back  Again,'  and 'Most Important Point.'\n\nGroup  maturity,  another  sustainer,  refers to  the  collective  effectiveness  of  a  group  as it  works  together.  A  long-standing  group  can be  immature;  a  recently  formed  group  might be mature. The more immature a group is, the more need there is for tight structures and for carefully  describing  the  reasons  for  and  the structures of the strategies. Mature groups can work with either tight or loose protocols and, in fact, will sometimes ask for a tight protocol because they recognize that the topic is hard to talk about.\n\n## Congruence\n\nCongruence  with  organizational  values and  beliefs  is  the  fifth  principle  of  agenda design.  What  happens  in  meetings  is  a  manifestation of the degree to which the group is a learning community and will be a force for or a  force  against  developing  collective  efficacy. Thoughtful design can help unify faculty perspectives and experience. Many schools experience too much fragmentation. Good meeting design can express and reinforce deeper organizational values and beliefs about learning and\n\nare  opportunities  to  model  effective  learning designs. Well-planned meetings link the project to the initiative, the immediate to the important, the short range to the long, and the greater community to its subsets.\n\nWe now move from design principles to the hands-on  activities  of  drafting  an  agenda  you will use. We will explore whether a meeting is even necessary. If the answer is yes, what type of meeting will it be? To help answer this question, we present a planning template and samples of agendas that serve different purposes.\n\n## Is a Meeting Necessary?\n\nYour first consideration is whether a meeting  is  even  necessary. Ask  yourself  what  you want  to  accomplish  and  if  meeting  together is  the  best  possible  use  of  your  group's  time on  this  topic.  Are  there  alternatives,  such  as surveys,  memos,  focus-group  interviews,  or phone or video conferencing that might serve just as well?\n\nIf  you  decide  that  a  meeting  is  appropriate, examine the potential agenda topics. Does each item on the agenda concern at least three members of the group? If not, deal with it oneto-one. Is it clear what type of action the group is to take on the item? If not, clarify it. Can it be dealt with either initially or fully at a lower level? If so, reroute it to the appropriate group or  subcommittee.  Has  the  item  for  discussion been  thoroughly  prepared-researched,  documented, and defined? If not, hold it over until the preparation is complete.\n\nOnce you've decided that a meeting is the best alternative and have screened the agenda items  to  determine  which  ones  must  be  addressed, consider who should be there. Do the agenda items pertain to the entire staff or just some of them? As mentioned earlier, if  some are for all but others pertain to just a couple of departments, schedule two adjournment times, releasing  those  who  are  not  involved  before starting on the final items. Are the items under consideration important or urgent enough to be on the next agenda? If not, reschedule them for a later meeting.\n\nAlways reserve the last five to ten minutes of  discussion  or  dialogue  meetings  for  the members to reflect on the meeting process. Developing other processes is one of the highest callings of leadership. Using a meeting assessment  inventory  reinforces  paying  attention  to the  success  structures  and  meeting  standards described in chapter 6 and helps groups to grow more skillful with each meeting.\n\nUse the rule of one half: List the agenda topics,  then  cut  the  list  by  half.  One  reason meetings  can  be  a  source  of  dissatisfaction is  that  they  attempt  to  cover  too  much.  Slow down. Allow the  time  that  the  topics  and  the members deserve.\n\n## What Type of Meeting Will It Be?\n\nThe type of meeting will influence the type of outcomes that can be reached. Four meeting types common to working groups are musters, assemblies,  discussions,  and  dialogues.  Chapter  5  presented  the  purposes  of  dialogue  (to understand) and discussion (to decide) as well as  the  structures  for  these  meeting  functions. Grade-level  teams,  department  meetings,  curriculum-council  leadership  groups,  and  full-\n\nfacility  meetings  carry  most  of  the  important conversations  about  teaching  and  learning  in dialogue or discussion formats.\n\nAssemblies  are  routine  meetings  of  very large groups  like  high  school  faculties,  in which the large number of members limits the outcomes  to  receiving  and  clarifying  'pass down' information and sanctioning or rejecting proposals presented by a leader or a subgroup. Another example of an assembly is union rallies, in which the purpose is to give information and  get  people  excited.  One  exception  to  the limitation  of  assemblies  is  the  1-2-6  strategy (appendix A), in which even a group as large as two hundred can generate, clarify, advocate, and  select  a  few  items  as  most  important  to pursue. It should take no longer than an hour to accomplish this.\n\nMusters are the regularly scheduled meetings of a department, an elementary faculty, or a special unit of workers such as bus drivers or  principals.  The  function  of  musters  is  to communicate up, down, and sideways and to feel  positive  about  the  experience.  They  are a  time  for  making  announcements,  coordinating calendars, and clarifying 'pass down' information. Never use a muster meeting for 'pass  down'  information  in  a  group  when a  memo  would  do,  unless  members  need  to ask  questions,  raise  issues,  or  agree  to  common  approaches  for  effective  implementation. Musters, like regularly scheduled faculty meetings,  often  reserve  time  for  discussion or  dialogue. We've  occasionally  held  muster meetings with chairs removed, to have standup meetings signaling this is brief, to the point with a quick dismissal.\n\n## Clear Outcomes\n\nWe  like  to  say  that  the  three  most  important  considerations  in  drafting  an  agenda are  clear  outcomes, clear outcomes, and clear outcomes.  Creating  clear  outcomes  is  simple but  not  easy.  Like  a  finely  crafted  lesson,  a successful meeting will have outcomes that are behaviorally observable for each agenda item.\n\nWell-formed outcomes describe a product, not a process; a destination, not a journey.\n\n## Agenda Templates\n\nWe've had much success in designing meeting  agendas  within  our  own  organizations  and for  groups  with  whom  we  consult  by  asking ourselves, or the group, the following questions:\n\n## A Pocket Guide to Agenda Design\n\n- \u00b7 What must happen at the opening of the meeting to provide an inclusion experience,  define  goals  and  roles, and adopt an agenda?\n- \u00b7 What terms should be defined?\n- \u00b7 What  questions must the group address,  and  in  what  sequence,  to achieve its desired outcome?\n- \u00b7 How much time will be assigned to meeting topics?\n- \u00b7 What processes and language will be used to maintain group-member efficacy, flexibility, craftsmanship, consciousness, and interdependence?\n- \u00b7 What  closing  activities  will  ensure clarity on group decisions, and who is to do what by when as the next steps?\n- \u00b7 What follow-up will be required?\n- \u00b7 What will be communicated to others about this meeting, and how will it be communicated?\n\nTo further complicate the issue of having clear  outcomes,  we  offer  two  final  considerations. One  is  that  high-functioning,  intact groups  should  pay  attention  to  their  development as  a  group. Therefore,  outcomes  should be thought about not only in terms of cognitive, affective,  and  product  goals  for  the  meeting, but  also  in  terms  of  how  the  meeting  can  be\n\nconducted  in  such  a  way  that  the  group  gets better at being a group.\n\nFinally,  regardless  of  your  role  within  a meeting,  or  even  the  nature  of  the  meeting, what,  specifically,  are  your  desired  outcomes? As a group member, do you desire greater clarity about an issue, or is it your intent to influence the  group  on  an  item?  If  the  latter,  how  will you  know  you've  succeeded,  and  what  might some strategies be? Mentor teachers often report to  us  with  surprise  that  being  clear  about  their outcomes has transformed one-to-one meetings with the teachers they are supporting.\n\nIn  our  own  practice  we  often  begin  a consultation  conversation  with  the  following questions:  'What  do  you  want  as  a  result  of this  meeting? How will you know if we have achieved that? What topics should be discussed for  that  goal?  How  much  time  should  we  allot,  and  in  what  sequence  should  we  discuss them?'  Helping  the  other  party  to  think  in outcome terms, whether the meeting is a parent conference or the start of a thirty-minute session with two other colleagues helps to focus time and strategies to get results.\n\nThe more one practices, the easier agenda construction  becomes.  Here  are  some  final planning tips:\n\n- \u00b7 Engage  design  help.  In  fact,  part  of  developing  your  group  is  to  increase  group consciousness and skill in this area.\n- \u00b7 Post outcomes in the meeting rooms. This forces you to construct clear language and observable goals and aids all members in knowing  the  reason  for  this  meeting  and how to best focus their energy. In addition, should  group  members  get  off  topic,  it allows the facilitator to gesture toward the posted outcomes and ask, 'Please help us to  understand  how  your  comments  relate to this outcome.' Sometimes they will tell us; sometimes they will monitor their own contribution, saying, 'I'll save it for later.'\n- \u00b7 Determine  how  much  content  and  how much process will be required to achieve\n- outcomes  related  to  the  agenda  items. How much discussion, exploration, or dialogue  might  be  necessary?  How  much information  will  be  required?  Remember that when goals are related to attitude and behavior change, more process time is required, not less.\n- \u00b7 Estimate  the  time  that  each  agenda  item will take. Remember that if processes are involved, it takes time to explain them and to check for understanding.\n- \u00b7 Place  divisive  items  early  on  an  agenda to  minimize  the  possibility  of  members leaving at the end of the meeting in a funk.\n- \u00b7 If the  meeting  purpose  is  singular  and brief,  remove  the  furniture.  This  signals a  stand-up  meeting-quick,  focused,  and everyone out in fifteen minutes.\n- \u00b7 When you are a meeting leader, keep the first  hour  after  the  meeting  to  write  minutes and memos and do the necessary follow-up. Sending out a written follow-up to a meeting within twenty-four or forty-eight hours signals that you value people's time.\n- \u00b7 Consider what commitment will be made in the meeting  to  group  development. What time, processes, and areas of group development will be addressed? At times, one  of  the  seven  norms  of  collaboration (see  chapter  4)  will  emerge  as  important to  strengthen; at other times, raising consciousness  on  the  five  standards  for  successful meetings (see chapter 6 will be useful.  This  attention  to  group  development, often  overlooked,  is  the  secret  to  getting better and is the focus of the next chapter.\n\n## Agenda Formats\n\nFigures  7.2  through  7.5  are  sample  formats for meetings of various lengths. They are offered as idea stimulators for your situations. Obviously, these are not the only formats possible; you might have one that is working well for you.\n\nThis format was developed by the International School Bangkok after one of the authors worked with them developing collaborative tools for instructional leaders. Members of these classes included the Superintendent , Associate Superintendent for Curriculum, all Principals, some department heads and teachers in informal leadership roles The learning and the modeling by the Superintendent was instrumental in spreading sound practices throughout the school. The cabinet also held its meetings in the round so anyone could come and observe them at work, practicing meeting standards and employing norms of collaboration (Garmston and Welsh, 2007)\n\n## MEETING AGENDA\n\nMeeting outcome: Revise and finalize the rubric for the common assessment Name of teamlgroup:\n\nFacilitator:\n\nRecorder:\n\nOther participants:\n\nStartinglending times:\n\nPurposes: Understanding , Informing, Recommending , Deciding\n\nFigure 7 .2.

A Team Meeting Agenda (Hedger and Simpson, 2013)\n\nFigure 7 .5. ( continued )\n\n## Posing Problems for Groups to Work On\n\nMuch time can be saved when councils or other groups delegate tasks to subcommittees. Our experience is that three hours spent carefully  posing  the  problem  has  saved  literally hundreds  of  hours  of  committee  work,  eliminated  false  starts,  and  helped  to  keep  morale and communications at healthy levels.\n\nTo delegate without clear directions, constraints,  and  other  details  often  produces  unsatisfactory results. Both parties feel bad, and sometimes  the  committee  that  developed  the report is directed to repeat the work. It is in this type of work that clarity about decision authority needs to be at its most precise.\n\nDecide which ones are most appropriate for  a  problem  you  are  posing  for  a  group  to work on.\n\nWell-constructed agendas are an essential part of successful meetings. An excellent facilitator,  informed  and  capable  group  members, and  sufficient  time  and  space  alone  are  not enough to create meetings that get a lot of quality work done in a short amount of time with a great deal of member satisfaction.\n\n## Step 1. Leaders define the problem:\n\n- (a) What is the problem or challenge?\n- (b) Who is affected directly?\n- (c) Who and what are affected indirectly?\n- (d) What feelings may exist about the problem?\n- (e) What time, personnel, and fiscal limitations apply to resolutions or resolving processes\n\n## Step 2. Leaders develop resolution criteria:\n\n- (a)   What is the desired outcome?\n- (b)   What criteria must the outcome meet in order to reach a satisfactory resolution?\n- (c)   In what ways will the resolution contribute to organizational values or goals?\n\n## For example:\n\n- \u00b7 The management team achieving and maintaining a common focus \u00b7 Employees knowing that they are cared about and can contribute to the organization's directions\n- \u00b7 Development of five energy sources (efficacy, flexibility, craftsmanship, consciousness, and interdependence)\n- (d)     In what ways will the resolution procedures and processes contribute to the organization's reflection, continued learning, and systematically managed change?\n\nStep 3. Leaders phrase the assignment for the task force or ad hoc group:\n\n- (a)   Determine the level(s) of decision-making authority the group will have\n- (b)     Decide if the group is to present one resolution or three, with advantages and disadvantages for each.\n- (c)     Phrase the task with language such as 'What might we do in order that. . .' or 'In what ways might we provide the widest latitude to the task force and maximize potential for creativity?'\n- (d)     List the resolution criteria with language such as 'In ways that increase group efficacy, sharpen the management team's focus, and do so within existing budget guidelines.' This informs the group of organizational values and/or resolution restraints.\n\nStep 4. Leaders present the assignment to the group and initiate processes for clarification and understanding of the task:\n\nExample: This committee's task is to present to the superintendent of schools, by March 1, a recommendation regarding the issue stated below. The superintendent will take under advisement the committee's recommendation and will draft and recommend policy to the board of trustees. The board, after holding public hearings, will make a final decision at their June 8 meeting. Issue: In what ways might we develop teachers' capacity to teach for culturally proficient standards and authentically interact with families of minority cultures.\n\nThe committee's recommendations must do this in ways that will:\n\n- (a)   Bring us into full compliance with the law\n- (b)   Maximize individual choice\n- (c)   Work within the allocated budgets for professional and organizational development\n- (d)   Contribute to collective efficacy\n\nFigure 7 .6. Leaders Pose Questions for Delegated Assignments\n\n## Chapter 8\n\n## The Confident and Skilled Faciliator\n\nF resources. Perhaps  no  role  is  as  significant  to  developing  social  capital acilitation  is  the  group's  instrument  for  making  the  most  of  its  time  and and  producing  self-directed  groups  that  effectively  plan,  problem  solve, and  make  decisions  as  the  facilitator.  This  chapter  offers  definitions  of  facilitation work, addresses the requirements for facilitators, the tasks during the various stages of facilitation, ways to develop confidence and competence, and ways facilitators intervene when things go wrong in meetings. A special section is included on facilitation practices in groups of three or four members.\n\nand  often  allows  people  to  hear  one  another, even if their mind was somewhere else during the original statement. Paraphrasing is but one of several language tools the facilitator uses.\n\nBecause  meetings  are  inherently  messy, facilitation  is  essential.  A  person  serving  as facilitator makes  complicated  conversations manageable,  manages  energy  and  focus,  provides  structure  and  protocols,  accommodates differences  in  cognitive  style,  equalizes  the influence of new and veteran teachers, and accommodates the vocal and the shy.\n\nFacilitators make  a  group's  work  easier,  clarify  outcomes  and  manage  processes, make  sure  all  views  are  considered,  ask  the right  questions,  create  safe  environments, and strengthen  the  fabric  of  community.  Effective listening  is  embedded  in  all  of  this  (Davis, 2013). Listening, manifested by attentive paraphrasing, lets the speaker know he or she has been heard, connects one person's contribution to  another's,  summarizes  group  conversation,\n\nA great facilitator is like an accomplished dancer.  One  notices  the  dance,  but  not  the dancer.  She  directs  process,  yet  is  supremely flexible. She follows principles, not rules. She improvises.  She  is  comfortable  with  who  she is and sets aside judgments about others. And, changing  genders  for  balance,  he  is  clear  in the  moment  about  his  intentions.  He  thinks beyond activities to outcomes. He is reflective and  learns  from  experience.  He  can  direct  or request, be firm or soft, serious or light, focus on  task  or  on  relationships.  Male  or  female, the skilled facilitator has abundant knowledge about processes and groups and is effortlessly competent with many facilitation moves.\n\nAbove  all,  the  facilitator  is  an  observer who  helps  groups  mediate  tensions.  Every system is  influenced  by  demands  that  present mixed messages. The  principal  who  responds to  the  demands  of  the  central  office  without considering  impacts  on  staff  can  unwittingly contribue  to  teacher  reluctance,  resistance,  or rebellion.  Teachers,  driven  by  concern  for student learning needs, sometimes collectively\n\nwork in opposition to excesses of standardized testing.  Parents  and  teachers  look  at  a  system through  different  eyes.  Each  day,  there  are different  interpretations  of  the  same  data,  and stakeholders  respond  from  different  perspectives. A facilitator serves the system by bringing the different perspectives to consciousness.\n\n## Facilitation Compared to Other Leadership Roles\n\nAs  mentioned  in  chapter  3,  facilitation  is similar to but different from three other leadership roles: presenting, consulting, and coaching. Groups  need  clear  role  definitions  because  the name of a role influences people's expectations. The most common error we've noticed is for the presenter  and  facilitator  titles  to  be  used  interchangeably. This has become so pervasive thatthe spell-check on one of our laptops automatically changes the word facilitator to presenter. Just as a Ford is not a Honda, a facilitator is not a presenter, and a presenter is not facilitator. In one case both are vehicles, in the latter, both are leadership functions with important differences.\n\nIn a professional community dedicated to adaptive change leadership is shared. All participants  develop  the  knowledge  and  skills  to manage themselves and lead others. Leadership is  a  function  shared  in  teams,  in  professional development,  in  research,  and  in  projects. Recognizing  what  we  have  called  the  four hats of leadership (see chapter 3) and knowing when and how to change them becomes shared knowledge within the organization. When values,  roles,  and  work  relationships  are  clear, decisions about appropriate behavior are easy. Because the terms presenter and facilitator are sometimes used interchangeably we repeat key distinctions made in chapter 3.\n\n## Facilitators Make Work Easy\n\nFacilitate comes from the Latin stem facilis 'easy'  and  from  the  French faciliter 'to render  easy.'  Groups  convene  to  solve  problems,  make  decisions,  develop  plans,  or  clar- ify  information.  Facilitators  direct  processes, choreograph  energy,  and  maintain  a  focus  on one  content  and  one  process  at  a  time.  The facilitator  may not be the person in charge of the group. More ideas are generated and better decisions made when a facilitator serves groups than when no facilitator works with a group\n\nBecause presenters use many instructional methods, including facilitating learning in processes that actively engage adult learners, the roles are easily confused. While facilitators are neutral  to  content,  presenters  are  responsible for the content. When facilitators have essential  information  about  a  topic,  it  is  difficult to  stay  within  the  neutrality  boundary  (Bens, 2012).  We  periodically  witness  meetings  in which colleagues ask the group member who is facilitating to add to the conversation. Wanting  to  know  the  facilitator's  ideas  is  understandable, but it is a disservice to the group to lose a content-neutral facilitator. The strategy Signal  Role  Change permits  the  facilitator  to step out of the role to comment and yet protect the  integrity  of  the  role.  See  appendix A  for thirty-seven moves facilitators use to manage energy, focus, and information.\n\n## Signal Role Change\n\n- \u00b7 When  facilitating  a  meeting  and wanting  to  contribute  content,  ask, 'May I add something?' The group usually will concur.\n- \u00b7 Move off to the side of the group or be seated. From this space, make a contribution in a credible voice.\n- \u00b7 Without speaking, return to the facilitation space. In an approachable voice say,  'OK.  Let's  move  on,'  or  'How does that add to your thinking?'\n\n## Facilitator Qualities\n\nFacilitating  a  meeting  is  improvisational work,  requiring  a  foundation  of  knowledge and skills, a clear sense of purpose, a juggler's\n\ngift  of  attending  to  everything  at  once,  and knowing  what  to  do  when  you  don't  know what to do. You don't have to be flashy to be a good facilitator, but you do need to be developing  consciousness,  clarity,  competence, credibility, and confidence.\n\n## Consciousness\n\nFacilitators  are  simultaneously  aware  of multiple  events  in  the  external  environment and in their internal world. They work to hone their sensory acuity. Of the eleven million bits of data bombarding a person every second, ten million  come  through  the  eyes.  Facilitators pick up cues that group members are engaged, socializing, fatigued, impatient, apathetic, curious, excited, or just going through the motions. With  auditory  senses,  facilitators  detect  nuances in voice tone even when they are turned away  from  the  group.  They  pay  attention  to breathing,  room  temperature,  and  sight  lines. They shuttle from looking outward to looking inward.  Facilitators  maintain  their  own  resourcefulness, take stock of their energy, notice when  they  might  be  making  poor  judgments, remind themselves of context, and assess their relationship  with  the  group.  The  facilitator's internal focus complements, not dominates, the external awareness.\n\nFacilitators stay aware  of  multiple  outcomes and contexts. Most meetings are nested inside other circumstances or initiatives. Perhaps most  important,  facilitators  are  aware  of  their point of view at any given time, and they press themselves to understand interactions from various perspectives. Facilitators know that success often  depends  on  their  ability  to  see  things  in new  ways,  gain  new  understandings,  and  produce new patterns of group interactions.\n\n## Clarity\n\nFacilitators  are  clear  about  their  role,  its boundaries,  and  its  responsibilities,  and  they communicate  this  unambiguously  to  groups. They  know  to  whom  they  are  ultimately  re- sponsible. (See appendix F for the distinctions among  a  contact,  intermediate,  or  primary client.)  Facilitators  know  the  importance  of language and strive for precision. The following are examples of clear facilitator language:\n\n- \u00b7 To get attention. 'Look this direction.'\n- \u00b7 To  clarify  purpose. 'Today's  task  is  to ____  [approve,  generate,  select,  identify, explore, resolve].'\n- \u00b7 To  give  directions .  'Identify  some  ideas you would like to explore as a team. Prepare  to  share  your  two  most  important ideas.'\n- \u00b7 To  encourage  participation. 'Here  are some suggestions for how to get the most value out of today's meeting. Be responsible  for  your  comfort  and  learning.  Don't wait  for  a  break  to  make  yourself  comfortable. Be responsible for your learning. If  you  can't  hear  someone,  say  'Louder, please!'  If  someone  is  speaking  too  abstractly and you need a concrete example, please ask for it.'\n- \u00b7 To  enlarge  perspective. 'Who  is  not  in this  room and can't speak for themselves on  the  topic?  What  do  you  imagine  their concerns might be?'\n- \u00b7 To  invite  group  awareness. 'How  is  the group doing on its agreement about listening to one another? Tell your partner.'\n- \u00b7 To  foster  understanding. 'Who  can  offer an organizing paraphrase?'\n- \u00b7 To encourage agreements. 'Are you ready for a decision?'\n\nLanguage  obscures  or  clarifies.  Precise language  is  a  gift  to  the  facilitator  and  the group. It saves time and frustration, eliminates ambiguity, conveys respect for the group, and fosters facilitator credibility. Facilitators strive to  be  organized,  brief,  and  specific.  They  use words and phrases that have one meaning. Use nouns more than pronouns. Tell the group what it is to do, why or how that relates to the bigger context of its work, and the specific intention\n\nto  be  achieved  at  each  stage.  Use  advanced organizers like 'There are three steps. Number one is. . . .\n\n## Competence\n\nCompetence  develops  with  continuous learning, experience, and reflection on experience.  Facilitators'  competencies  are  grounded in  a  basic  knowledge  of  effective  meetings. This  includes  the  distinction  between  discussion  and  dialogue  (chapter  5),  a  set  of  facilitation  strategies  (see  appendix  A),  and  three structures  for  successful  meeting  (see  chapter 6). Additional competencies include designing an  agenda  (chapter  7),  reading  a  group,  paraphrasing,  asking  invitational  questions,  being comfortable with silence,  and  using  a  host  of nonverbal  strategies  and  moves.  Competence also means realizing that a plan is only a map of the territory and having the wisdom to know when  the  plan  is  not  working.  You  may  also want  to  see  a  book  on  resolving  problems  in meetings and workshops to self-assess yourself on a facilitator proficiency scale (Garmston and Zimmerman, 2013).\n\n## Credibility\n\nCredibility is a byproduct of clarity, competence,  and  confidence.  Credibility  does  not live inside the facilitator; rather, it is a perception the group forms about the person. When a group  believes  that  a  facilitator  is  competent, confident,  neutral,  trustworthy,  and  fair,  the group can say that this person is credible.\n\nCredibility,  like  trust,  can  temporarily  be lost.  Being  less  than  honest,  not  owning  mistakes,  or  speaking  disrespectfully  about  those who are not in the room will drive a wedge of discomfort  between  you  and  the  group.  One essential facilitator capacity is learning how to recover from mistakes. As a friend of ours says, if you step in it, know how to step out of it.\n\nThe strongest element of a recovery move is  to  step  away  from  the  place  you  made  the error. ('Did I say that?'-Pointing to the space you just left), or direct some humor at yourself ('I always wanted to be skillful, now I realize I  should  have  specified  at  what').  To  regain credibility for errors of greater magnitude use four  steps. (1)  Acknowledge  whatever  you did  that  evoked  discomfort  ('I  brought  you incorrect information that resulted in confusion and  upset');  take  responsibility  ('I'm  sorry,  I was supposed to bring that to you today, and I forgot'); (3) Apologize ('That was insensitive, please  accept  my  apology');  and  (4)  self-disclose ('I will make it my intention to not make that error again').\n\n## The Facilitator as Manager\n\nFacilitators  manage  four  vital  currents  to maximize the value of meeting time: attention, energy, information, and logistics. Facilitators monitor and stimulate energy when necessary. Information  flow  must  be  clear,  multidirectional,  relevant,  and  comprehensible,  and  logistics  for  room  arrangements, schedules, and announcements must be clear.\n\nFigure 8.1 . The Facilitator as Manager\n\nAttention is first. In chapter 6 we presented five  principles  for  developing  meeting  standards. The first two were to stay on one topic at  a  time  and  use  only  one  process  at  a  time. Facilitators  use  language,  space,  flip  charts, and their bodies to manage these two standards. Whether standing or seated with a small group these four tools are vital.\n\nEnergy,  the  second  current,  is  an  essential resource  of  groups  if  they  are  to  accomplish work.  Productive  energy  is  a  side  effect  of positive human relationships. A facilitator's pri-\n\nmary  task  is  to  amplify  and  direct  emotional, cognitive,  and  physical  energy  to  group  goals. Researchers  have  found  that  some  groups  are 'smarter' than others-that is they collectiveley have  higher  performance  or  greater  success  in solving problems than comparison groups (Fredrickson and Losada, 2005; Losada and Heaphy, 2004;  Woolley  et  al.,  2010).  The  researchers found substantial evidence for collective intelligence as real and measurable. Factors like turn taking, balancing inquiry with advocacy, higher positivity ratios, and  social  sensitivity were attributes of  the  more  accomplished  groups. Studies also find that collective efficacy, one of the  five  energy  sources,  is  consistently  related to high performance across subject areas, across locations and using multiple instruments (Eells, 2011; Goddard, Hoy, and Woolfolk-Hoy, 2004).\n\nInformation  is  the  third  essential  current. Groups  consume  and  construct  information  in order to plan, decide, solve problems, and take action. Information comes in a variety of packages:  abstractions, examples,  generalizations, details,  thoughts,  feelings,  research,  numbers, history, and dreams. There is typically too much data and too little time. Facilitators assist groups to select some data to study and others to ignore. They guide groups to know when to look for details and when to examine themes and patterns.\n\nThe  fourth  and  final  current  is  logistics. 'This  is  the  'ground'  of  group  process-the most constrained and, when mastered, the most enabling flow because it frees up attention and energy for other things' (Sibbit, 2002, p. 55). This  current  carries  the  management  of  the meeting-room environment, equipment, materials, time allotments, schedules, and reporting procedures (chapter 6).\n\nGive  instructions  for  room  arrangement and materials (see chapter 6 for ideas on organizing the room for different purposes). Arrive at least thirty minutes early to make whatever adjustments are necessary. Get any clutter out of the room. Often there are too many tables or chairs to work effectively.\n\nVisuals  are  indispensable  for  focusing attention.  Most  of  our  sensory  information comes  through  the  eyes.  One  major  value of  charts  over  images  on  a  screen  is  their potential  for  permanence.  People  know  that a  screen  image  will  disappear  and  therefore experience a muscular tension they don't have when  looking  at  a  chart.  On  a  chart,  information stays visible throughout the meeting, allowing the participants to know where they are on the agenda and the facilitator to refocus them on goals or norms. Charts are especially valuable if information is being presented that makes members uncomfortable. A facilitator can  use  the  strategy  Third  Point  to  direct attention to the data and away from him- or herself,  providing  a  separation  between  the message and the messenger. Place the charted agenda  where  it  can  be  easily  referred  to throughout the meeting.\n\nColor-code charted agendas or other data that has been prepared in advance. Use red for headlines; brown, blue, and green for text; and yellow  and  black  for  organizing  or  graphics. Always  print  in  block  letters,  never  in  cursive-and,  despite  what  some  books  advise, never use all caps. Any teacher will tell you that printed upper- and lowercase block letters are the most readable.\n\nColor-coding  is  not  advisable  when  you are recording during a meeting, because it can slow  the  flow  of  talk.  Graphics  aid  memory and communicate complex concepts metaphorically. ChartArt (Buckley, 2002) is a series of images  that  can  be  traced  onto  a  chart;  they are considered useful by both experienced and novice  facilitators.  Buckley  (2002)  describes how to work with charts and graphics.\n\n## Facilitation Functions\n\nThe  facilitator's  work  begins  before  the meeting  does  and  continues  after  the  meeting. During  a  meeting,  there  are  many  facilitator functions with unique purposes and tools. Meeting work is cyclical. The same functions-generating, organizing, and analyzing-can repeat, and complex strategies often have embedded in them  several  smaller  ones.  Focusing  attention will  be  repeated  many  times  throughout a session, along with framing the work and activating relevant knowledge.\n\nHere we describe tips, strategies, and overarching goals for each function.\n\n## Preparing\n\nIs  this  part  of  an  initiative  in  which  the group has already worked? Will there be meetings  to  follow?  Are  other  groups  involved? Learn the leader's perception of meeting goals. You might have to be a coach or consultant before you can be a facilitator, in some situations. Often the meeting outcomes have not been considered at the level of detail necessary to design an  effective  session.  Explore  specifics.  Find out if anything is happening in the group, or to the  group,  that  could  bring  counterproductive energy into the room. Occasionally you might arrange to meet with a small planning committee or conduct a phone conference to get multiple  perspectives.  This  is  essential  when  you have been asked to facilitate conflict-related or problem-solving  meetings.  See  appendixes  F, G, and H for tips on contracting for facilitation services.  Ask  to  see  the  meeting  announce-\n\n## Facilitator Check List\n\nSixteen  discrete  functions  comprise the work of a meeting facilitator. See Facilitating Small Groups for ways to apply these in groups as small as three members.\n\n- 1.  Opening\n- 2.  Focusing\n- 3.  Clarifying Role\n- 4.  Framing The Work\n- 5.  Acknowledging  Resistance  (if  necessary)\n- 6.  Developing Inclusion\n- 7.  Activating Knowledge\n- 8.  Giving Directions\n- 9.  Guiding\n- 10.  Suggesting Processes\n- 11.  Facilitating Work\n- 12.  Transitioning\n- 13.  Closing\n- 14.  Assessing the Meeting\n- 15.  Arranging for What's Next\n\nment; you want to know what information the participants have about the meeting.\n\n## Opening\n\nAn opening might take as little as ten minutes or as long as thirty minutes, depending on your  desired  outcome,  available  time,  group size, level of group maturity, and experience in working together. The first three to five minutes are  critical  in  developing  expectations,  receptivity,  and  relationship  with  a  group.  During the  opening  the  facilitator  must  get  people's attention, focus their energy, acknowledge any resistance that might be present, be especially careful  about  pronoun  use  (your  meeting,  not mine), provide for a public display of information and group memory, and clarify roles-the facilitator's,  the  participants,'  and  the  record-\n\ner's.  Members  want  to  know  the  topic,  its relevance to them, if it will be worth their time (Is  it  well  organized?),  and  the  credibility  of the person facilitating. All these questions must be addressed in the first few minutes. In video 8.1  we  see  the  facilitator  open  a  meeting  and address these points.\n\nVideo 8.1.\n\n## Focusing\n\nEveryone knows the importance of attention, yet it is not unusual for a facilitator who is stressed or pressed for time to begin talking before attention is fully gained. This will backfire and become a cumulative problem, indicating to the group that full attention is not expected.\n\nGrinder (2007) describes twenty-one nonverbal  tools  that  people  unconsciously  use  to enhance  their  speech.  Many  of  these  appear in  appendix  A.  Since  humans  are  influenced more  by  nonverbal  communication  than  by the spoken word, it is necessary for facilitators to  develop  a  nonverbal  vocabulary.  We  have incorporated many nonverbal tools of communication in training facilitators and have had remarkable success in helping them amplify their effectiveness. See appendix A for descriptions of over thirty facilitator moves.\n\n## Clarifying Role\n\nTake  time  to  specify  that  your  role  is  to guide the process and stay neutral to the content.  Encourage  group  members  to  tell  you  if they  think  that  you  are  stepping  out  of  role. Have them direct you about the type of facilitation they desire: tightly directed by you or with greater allowance made for the group to guide the process. Facilitation is essential to maintain focus, efficiency, and energy as well as to conserve time and achieve results.\n\nUltimately groups allow themselves to be facilitated. If it has not given its tacit permission,  a  group  will  resist  or  subvert  the  facilitator's  efforts  to  serve  them.  A  group  grants psychological  permission  to  the  facilitator  to manage the meeting process and to place issues before  the  group  to  consider.  Permission  is based on a number of intangibles. Among these are a perception of confidence, trust, and a belief  that  the  facilitator  can  remain  neutral  and nonjudgmental. Confidence and credibility are perceived by congruent language-that is, the body says what the words describe. Confident facilitators breathe from the abdomen. Facilitators whose breathing is high and shallow signal their own discomfort, which affects the group's sense of ease. Wellman and Lipton (2004) describe a permission-getting process that signals responsiveness  and  permits  the  group  to  provide direction to the facilitation services:\n\nOne  approach  to  empowering  a  working group, whether it is at a novice level of performance as a group or at a more expert level, is  to  negotiate  your  stance  as  a  facilitator. Stances may vary from hard to soft facilitation. An effective way to offer these options is to describe a physical continuum organized by  metaphors,  then  ask  group  members  to point  to  the  spot  on  the  continuum  they  believe  will  be  most  effective  for  that  session. Some  metaphors  that  we  have  used  include facilitation stances that range from Rambo to Mr. Rogers; from Xena the Warrior Princess to  Mary  Poppins;  or  from  a  lion  to  a  lamb. Presenting choices helps the group to gain or regain the power to control its own direction and  purposes.  This  is  especially  true  if  individual  group  members  are  dominating  the group's time and energies. Such a group will tend to select harder forms of facilitation and facilitator permission to intervene with problematic situations. (p. 15)\n\n## Framing the Work\n\nAs  a  noun, frame marks  the  boundaries within which an entire picture is displayed. As a  verb, frame means to create a mental structure, or frame, through which people interpret or make sense of a situation. Facilitators frame tasks to set a tone for participation and productivity-to  describe  the  purposes  of  the  work, how it  relates  to  a  larger  context,  and  how  it benefits participant interests.\n\nGroups  perform  at  their  best  when  they have  clearly  defined  outcomes.  You  might start  with  an  artfully  vague  statement  such as 'Today  you  will  explore  ways  to  save the after-school  program.'  Broad  outcomes maintain  momentum  because  people  relate  to the  intent  and  don't  get  bogged  down  by  the details.  Later,  after  framing  and  an  inclusion activity,  you  should  be  more  specific:  'The purpose  today  is  to  identify  what  resources we could make available for the program. You will  recommend  some  to  consider.  Next  you will assess the costs to other school programs and,  based  on  that,  make  a  go  or  no-go  recommendation  on  continuing  the  after-school activities.'  Working  outcomes  employ  a  verb that  specifies  what action is to be taken, such as decide , recommend , inform , assess , explore , advocate , inquire , or identify .\n\n## Acknowledging Resistance\n\nSome of the people, some of the time, will want  to  resist,  oppose,  refrain  from  participa- tion, or push back against proposals, programs, ideas, and even resist being in a meeting. Keep in  mind  that  their  resistance  is  just  a  way  of taking care of themselves and is not about you. The resistance often has nothing to do with the meeting.  One  of  the  authors  met  with  a  group of principals and sensed apathy and fatigue. He asked what was going on. He learned that this was the fourth day that week that the principals had been out of their buildings. In addition, they had  delivered  reductions-in-force  notices  the day before. Given these circumstances, the proposed agenda made little sense, and as the group modified its task, energy returned to the room.\n\nTo resist resistance is futile. To resist resistance is to have it persist. One cannot be reasoned out of resentment, hurt, anger, betrayal, blame, or discouragement, the typical sources of  resistance.  Only  if  you  acknowledge  the validity of the perceptions and feelings (which is  different  from agreeing with them) will the group have the choice to set them aside.\n\nFor extended resources see Garmston and Zimmerman's  (2013)  strategies  for  resolving twenty  types  of  problems  facilitators  face. Here we will identify three approaches to work with resistance. Each is a form of reframing. If resistance is present or anticipated, it must be addressed immediately at the start of a meeting. The three approaches are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Pace  and  lead.  The  facilitator  acknowledges  (by  pacing)  the  legitimacy  of  feelings a group is having, then (leading) suggests  the  temporary  suspension  of  those feelings  in  order  to  make  the  best  use  of this time. (Costa and Garmston, 2016)\n- \u00b7 Use strategies that acknowledge the resistance as natural and that generate humor, such as Banned Words (appendix A.).\n- \u00b7 Choreograph an opening. Imagine you are conducting  a  before-school  meeting  with teachers. They are attending because it is a workday at the beginning of the school year. Last year, scores went up across the district. They were promised a classroom day, but the district office decided to send\n\nyou to work with them instead. In choreographing an opening, the facilitator could describe the resistance in respectful terms and suggest that there are higher interests and benefits to come from the meeting. See Choreograph an Opening in appendix A.\n\nLanguage  precision  is  important.  The  resistance must be stated in vague terms so that people can identify with it. The following language forms offer ways you can modulate the resistance description: all of you , some of you , or a few of you (Zoller and Landry, 2010).\n\n## Developing Inclusion\n\nThe first four opening activities-focusing attention, clarifying  your  role,  framing  the work, and acknowledging resistance-can take very little time. These tasks do not have to be done as separate entities but can be blended.\n\nDeveloping inclusion, the seventh activity, can  also  be  blended  with  focusing  attention, framing  the  work,  and  activating  relevant  information. Occasionally it can also be used in acknowledging resistance. People always come to meetings from somewhere else-geographically, emotionally, and cognitively. While bodies may be in the room, often heads are not, but are attending instead to the last class, concern with  a  student,  or  social  needs.  Therefore,  it is  essential  that  you  provide  experiences  that help  them  to  make  a  transition  into  the  new space  and  group.  Plan  for  either  full  group or subgroup  inclusion  activities.  Full-group activities set norms, focus attention inside the room, generate energy, and help people to answer the question of who they are in relation to the  group. They  begin  the  process  of  moving from a focus on self to the group. Groundings or synectics activities shown in appendix A are full-group  activities.  Groundings  are  particularly  useful  for  groups  experiencing  conflict, for  merging  members  of  different  groups,  or preparing groups for difficult conversations.\n\nSynectic  activities  reveal  knowledge  and attitudes  about  a  topic  and  engage  the  metaphoric  brain.  As  an  example,  groups  might\n\n## Virtual Inclusion Activities for Remote Teams\n\nVirtual inclusion activities are as important  as  face-to-face  inclusions.  They get  voices  'in  the  room,'  serve  as  role calls, help  members  learn  about  one another, or challenge thinking about the topic  to  be  explored.  Keep  them  short. As in all  activities,  be  clear  about  your goals.  One  goal  set  might  be  to  get people's  voices  (or  faces)  in  the  room, represent a virtual role call, and get ownership  of  the  agenda. Another  might  be to  stimulate  creativity,  and  yet  another might be reveal to perceptions from different time zones.\n\n- \u00b7 Each  person,  in  turn,  says  their name, role, organization, and hopes for this meeting.\n- \u00b7 Each member posts a picture of their shoes  or  item  on  their  desk,  then explains  how  that  item  represents their interests.\n\nrespond  to  a  question  like  'assessing  student learning is like what household object because .  .  .'  if  that  is  the  focus  for  the  meeting.  We used that inclusion activity once, in an eastern state,  related  to  a  session  on  supervision. The majority  of  responses  had  to  do  with  toilets. The  group  clearly  communicated  its  attitude. Subgroup  activities  also  set  a  norm  of  active engagement and focus attention to the content of  the  meeting's  work.  Participants  take  turns speaking to a prompt. Prompts might be expectations  for  the  meeting,  or  naming  a  positive occurrence  of  the  week,  or  hopes  and  apprehensions for an upcoming event. See appendix A for other inclusion activities.\n\nWith all strategies, it is desirable to name the purposes of the activity. This is especially so at the beginning of a session, when, if you are not already known, you are still establishing your relationship with the group.\n\n## Activating Knowledge\n\nJust as teachers engage students by helping them  to  elicit  prior  knowledge,  the  facilitator does  this  to  generate  energy  and  activate  information that  is  relevant  to  the  group's  task. Doing it at the beginning of a meeting and each time  new  topics  are  introduced  has  multiple benefits.  First,  particularly  at  the  beginning of  a  meeting,  a  norm  for  engagement  is  reinforced. It energizes the group members as they work  and  frees  the  facilitator  to  observe  the group.  Second,  the  relevant  knowledge  that is  activated is instrumental in accelerating the pace of the meeting, for it brings information into play that is necessary to work on a topic. Sometimes this information is as simple as remembering what happened at the last meeting. Many meetings take unnecessary time getting started  because  group  members  do  not  recall what happened in earlier sessions.\n\nThird,  eliciting  prior  knowledge  levels the perceived playing field within the group. This is especially true with mixed-role groups when the activity is preceded by a quick writing  activity  so  that  each  group  member  has something  to  contribute.  Finally,  any  initial task has to be structured so that group members feel psychologically safe, confident that they  will  not  be  demeaned,  attacked,  or  ridiculed. The 'Sort Cards' strategy serves this purpose nicely. Members privately respond to a prompt on 3 \u00d7 5 cards, then they display and organize  the  cards  according  to  criteria  that they invent (appendix A).\n\nOther strategies in appendix A that activate relevant  information  while  maintaining  psychological safety are 'Paired Verbal Fluency'; 'Know,  Think  You  Know,  Want  to  Know'; 'Four-Box  Synectics';  'Three  to  Get  Ready and  Card  Stack  and  Shuffle';  and  'Give  One to Get One.' Keep in mind that members must always feel safe but as the meeting progresses, not necessarily comfortable. Discomfort is often a doorway to learning.\n\n## Giving Directions\n\nPrecise  directions  conserve  time  and  energy. Confusing directions make members feel dumb.  When  people  feel  dumb  they  lose  efficacy,  energy,  and  commitment  to  task.  The thinking-processes supporting direction-giving are  clear.  At  the  simplest  level,  they  include guidelines such as using declarative statements and a minimum number of words. As we will see  later,  personal  pronouns  can  be  problematic  with  this  function  and  others.  By  saying things  like  'Here's  what  I  want  you  to  do next' or 'Listen carefully to me as I describe this  process,'  a  facilitator  conveys  the  idea that the group is serving him or her rather than the group's goals. Instead, use phrases such as 'Your next steps are . . .' or 'This process has three stages . . .' or 'Turn to your neighbor and name your concerns about this topic.'\n\nThese forms maintain focus on the group and  on  the  task  rather  than  on  the  facilitator. Directions,  like  framing  statements,  can  be scripted. Charts and slides that hold directions visually aid retention. In the case of particularly difficult  tasks,  they  focus  participants'  attention on the process-task interaction-which is where it is supposed to be-rather than on the person guiding the work.\n\nAdopt  the  syntactical  pattern  of  'What,' 'Why,'  'How'  when  giving  directions.  The 'What' is the name of the strategy, structure, or pattern you are proposing for engaging the group. The 'Why' is the intention or purpose of that choice. The 'How' includes the details and procedures involved in the process.\n\nVideo 8.3.\n\nThe 'Why' is the most essential element for enlisting group member respect for the process and commitment to following the assigned pattern with integrity. 'Why' statements offer principles  of  practice  such  as:  'This  strategy presents opportunities for hearing and considering multiple viewpoints without judgment or comment.' Or, 'This paired interaction allows partners to engage with the text and each other's perspectives in a time-efficient manner.'\n\nNotice that this last 'Why' statement also embeds a subtle  pacing  for  those  participants who value time efficiency and may not always value their colleagues' contributions. For those participants  who  enjoy  collaborative  interactions,  the  embedded  message for them is that the strategy will be time bound so they should respect  the  protocol  and  time  frames  and not  get  lost  in  any  meandering  conversations during the process.\n\n'Why'  statements  have  both  immediate and  longer-term  intentions.  The  immediate impact  is  framing  the  purpose  for  the  task at  hand.  The  longer-term  intention  is  where facilitation  overlaps  with  group  development goals.  For  groups  to  be  ready  to  engage  with increasing cognitive and relational challenges, the  skilled  facilitator  paces  both  the  strategy choice and 'Why's' to at first meet, and then stretch, the learning capacities of group members. For  novice  groups,  the  'Why's'  will be  mostly  about  the  intention  of  the  strategy to  help  those  groups  develop  basic  habits  of following directions and working successfully with colleagues.\n\nUse a credible voice to give directionsone in which the tonal pattern is flat and tends to  curl  down  at  the  end  of  sentences.  This voice  pattern  universally  is  received  as  'this is important information, please attend.' Stand upright with head and body still in a posture of calm and centeredness with feet aligned under the  shoulders.  Drama  teachers  tell  us  this  is called  a  neutral  position.  If  there  are  subsets to  the  directions,  use  a  visual  paragraph  for maximum  congruence.  In  this  pattern  the  facilitator gives the first direction, pauses, breaks eye contact by dropping his or her head, moves to  a  new  spot,  looks  up,  and  gives  the  next direction.  This  pattern  can  be  used  for  up  to four steps in direction giving. Imagine the following statements (with expanded information for  each)  delivered  with  the  visual  paragraph after each of the first three directions. Table 8.1 shows what might be said while giving directions in a meeting and in a sixth-grade class.\n\nA facilitator's language choices will greatly influence success in giving directions as well as in offering guidelines and leading the process.\n\nAn often-overlooked yet powerful attribute of  clear  directions  is  pronoun  use  (Wellman, 2006).  Pronouns  are  substitutes  for  names. They label the speaker's place in any relationship and convey expectations of that relationship, such as compliance, affection, and whose group  it  really  is.  When  a  facilitator  named Sarah  says,  'Please  give  me  your  attention,' she  might  as  well  have  been  saying,  'Please give  Sarah,  not  somebody  else  in  the  group, your attention.' One of the authors once heard\n\nTable 8.1 .

On another occasion  a  superintendent  new  to  the  job  thanked one of us for coming to the district to work with 'his people.'\n\nWho you are by position and relation to the group should influence your choice of pronouns. If you are a group member who has stepped up to facilitate a session, the work very well might be  'ours.'  If  you  are  external  to  the  group  in any  way,  referring  to  the  work  as  'ours'  can generate  inferences  that  actually  interfere  with the group's work or its development.\n\nIt  is  usually  wise  to  carefully  plan  and script  your  comments.  For  an  upcoming  facilitation  session,  consider  whether  it  is  'our work today,' 'your work today,' or 'the work today.'  For  work  that  is  emotionally  charged in  any  way,  it  is  usually  safest  to  apply  the most  pronoun-neutral  forms  and  talk  about 'the work,' 'this task,' 'the data,' or 'the outcome.' Neutral forms, which use articles  and pronouns  such  as the and this ,  depersonalize the task and make it psychologically safer for group  members  to  engage  with  the  issue  and not the person before them.\n\nThe  neutral  pronoun  pattern  can  be  supported by the use of charts and visuals that hold important  technical,  and  perhaps  emotionally laden, information  off  to  the  side  (Grinder, 2007).  This  approach  removes  the  emotion  of the  message  from  the  facilitator,  guiding  the group's  emotional  energy  to  the  information rather than toward the facilitator. Be sure to keep your eyes on the chart as you use neutral pronouns. If you revert to making eye contact with group  members  while  framing  difficult  tasks, you run the risk of repersonalizing the task and drawing the emotional energy to the messenger rather than leaving it with the message.\n\n## Suggesting Process\n\nFluent  facilitators  are  able  to  anticipate bottlenecks  and  common  points  of  confu- sion. At  these  points,  they  succinctly  propose targeted  procedural  tips  and  offer  additional technical  resources  to  move  the  group  ahead. Again,  these  are  situations  in  which  careful pronoun choice can be important to the group's productivity. Given the wisdom of prior experience and an implicit desire for credibility with the group, you might be tempted to say things like 'In my experience the best thing to do is. . . .' Such phrasing has the effect of personalizing the advice or suggestions that follow.\n\nThe  alternate  approach  is  to  drop  the personal pronoun and cultivate a repertoire of phrases  such  as  'Groups  typically  get  stuck here and need to . . .' and 'At points like this, productive  groups  tend  to  .  .  .'  These  more pronoun-neutral  forms  frame  the  notion  of expertise as a capacity of some ideal group, not as a 'gift' from the facilitator. In all facilitator functions,  the  intention  must  be  to  place  the spotlight on the group, its development, and its task accomplishment-not on the facilitator.\n\n## Facilitating Work\n\nFacilitators  facilitate-that  is,  they  make work easier. Your awareness of the group combines  with  your  repertoire  of  facilitation  skills and knowledge to serve you as you maintain a neutral stance and guide the group through strategies and transitions. Appendix A describes over thirty  facilitator  moves  (often  nonverbal)  and one hundred and thirty strategies or protocols.\n\nVery small groups cannot afford the luxury of having one person stay in a neutral facilitation role, yet facilitation can still be present. We will discuss the concept of facilitating a small group shortly.\n\n## Transitioning\n\nA  transition  is  a  process  of  change  from one  state  to  another.  Managing  the  shifts  between  activities  or  topics  or  between  content and  breaks  is  part  of  the  art  of  facilitation. Without any warning, momentum can be broken. Group members can be so invested in the\n\ncurrent activity that they feel resentment if the activity is suddenly broken off (Sibbit, 2002). Near  the  end  of  a  process,  help  the  group  to anticipate a transition by announcing that you are  beginning  to  move  toward  closure  or  are turning  to  a  different  stage  in  the  process. To manage energy and attention, give people time warnings when they are engaged in self-managing  activities.  The  move  'Yellow  Light' (appendix  A)  serves  as  a  warning.  Another strategy  is  to  move  quietly  around  the  group and indicate the remaining time. Timers on the screen  will  also  let  people  track  the  time  for themselves.\n\n'Closing the Window' is a nonverbal strategy that signals that a full-group conversation is about to end. This often brings out those who have something to say before the time is up. In video 8.4 we watch the facilitator use 'closing the  window,'  a  facilitator  move  learned  from virtuoso Suzanne Bailey.\n\nVideo 8.4.\n\nBecause the group has not internalized the agenda sequence as you have, reminders about where they are now in relationship to the full agenda  can  be  useful.  Saphier,  Haley-Speca, and  Gower  (2008)  offer  the  metaphor  of  station  naming-as  if  riders  are  being  reminded of  what  they  are  leaving  and  where  they  are going-to help members know how what they are doing relates to what is completed and the next topic or process. 'Now that you've identified concerns, the next step will be to explore related assumptions. That will be the first task after a short break.'\n\nSome  form  of  transition  is  also  useful  to signal a shift in activity ('OK, that's it for brainstorming, the next stage is clarification'),  pace ('The  pace  is  going  to  slow  down  to  open  an opportunity for reflection'), and level ('Now the task moves from naming assumptions to exploring what inferences they might lead to').\n\nUse  transitions  to  have  participants  organize and integrate the work just completed when the  ideas  have  to  be  carried  to  a  next  stage  of thinking or when the content should be remembered  for  a  future  meeting.  Some  strategies (appendix A) that accomplish this are 'Journal,' 'Most Important Point,' 'Partners Report,' and 'Matchbook Definitions.' Strategies that engage the  full  group  are  'Walk About'  and  'Stir  the Classroom.'  'Sound  and  Motion  Symphony' brings physical expression to the integration of information (see appendix A).\n\n## Closing the Meeting\n\nAt the conclusion of the work, the group is ready to close the meeting.\n\nHigh  on  the  list  of  frustrations  that  people  express  to  us  is  the  feeling  that  at  the  end of  a  meeting,  nothing  was  accomplished.  A proper  closing  will  eliminate  this  complaint. The following tasks should be accomplished at this  stage:  clarify  who  is  to  do  what  by  when, test  commitments,  clarify  communications  and finally  assess  the  meeting  and  arrange  for  the next.\n\n## Clarify Who Does What by When\n\nIn  the  heat  of  conversations,  the  actionable part of decisions is often overlooked. Left overlooked,  they  are  the  cause  of  confusion, incomplete  follow-up,  and  poor  morale.  The facilitator  is  responsible  for  seeing  that  this question is asked: Who is to do what by when? If no one else asks, the facilitator must. Names of the responsible parties should be recorded on charts and made a part of the meeting minutes.\n\n## Test Commitments\n\nEveryone  is  busy.  In  the  enthusiasm  of the moment,  some  people  overcommit.  'I know  you  would  never  do  this,'  the  facilitator  might  say  with  a  smile,  'but  under  what conditions  might  you  be  tempted  to  violate\n\nthese agreements?' Although it could be fairly easy-perhaps to go along with the group-to agree  to  a  course  of  action  during  a  meeting, real pressures can evolve later when one must choose between conflicting commitments. The facilitator's question brings an awareness of the realities and tensions associated with commitments.  When  these  realities  and  tensions  are articulated, the group has an opportunity to explore strategies that can overcome any barriers to the agreements.\n\n## Clarify Communications\n\n'What we have here is a failure  to  communicate' is a line from the movie Cool Hand Luke . When  people  are  surveyed  about  the problems  in  their  organizations,  one  of  the top  items  mentioned  is  poor  communication. Because work life is so hectic and individuals have interests  and  responsibilities  in  so  many areas,  it  is  critical  to  have  a  communication plan before people leave the meeting.\n\nFor leaders, it is desirable to have a meeting summary in group members' hands within twenty-four hours. This signals that the group's work is important. Some facilitators and group leaders  reserve  fifteen  to  thirty  minutes  after the meeting to develop a summary draft from the notes on the charts.\n\nOther forms of after-meeting communication  include  scheduling reports at other meetings,  e-mailing  summaries  to  the  entire  staff, posting  minutes  in  the  staff  room,  or  having each member speak to a few colleagues about what  transpired.  In  some  schools,  grade-level teams  or  departments  post  agendas  and  minutes on the Internet to keep everyone abreast of what is occurring.\n\n## Assess the Meeting\n\nAny group too busy to reflect on its work is too busy to improve. Taking a small amount of time at the end of each meeting to fill out a meeting survey is a responsible form of professional development. Group members take three to four minutes at the end of a meeting to anon- ymously  complete  appendix  I,  a  Likert  scale questionnaire about meeting effectiveness. The data  are  collated  by  the  facilitator  or  group leader and brought back to the group at the next meeting, with frequency distributions for each item.  Small  groups  look  at  the  data  and  then engage  in  a  full-group  discussion  around  the question 'Given what we said about ourselves last time, what do we want to work on today?' This is a remarkably effective way to elicit concerns and rapidly improve group functioning.\n\n## Arrange for the Next Meeting\n\nMany groups rotate the facilitation role so that all the members have a chance to develop strength and an understanding of meeting dynamics. This is the time to select a next facilitator  wanting  to  develop  skills,  and,  ideally, arrange for this person to work with the group leader to design the next agenda.\n\n## Facilitating In Small Groups\n\nThree  members  comprise  a  team.  If  one stands  to  facilitate,  one  stands  to  record,  the seated  member  can  make  all  the  decisions. Right? Obviously this does not work. The essential concept for small groups is that facilitation is needed, not a full-time facilitator. The following problems are common to small groups:\n\n- \u00b7 In small  meetings  everyone  is  usually seated. Who is  facilitating  often  gets  lost in this arrangement.\n- \u00b7 Two  of  the  meeting  standards,  one  topic at  a  time  and  one  process  at  a  time,  are frequently violated.\n- \u00b7 In  a  group  of  three,  achieving  sufficient consensus  (80  percent)  is  artificial  with two to one splits. (Try rating an item from one to  one  hundred  to  see  distinctions  in perception.)\n- \u00b7 It  is  difficult  to  manage  a  third  meeting standard, balanced participation, if one is a dominator and incessantly talks.\n- \u00b7 The urgent often displaces the important.\n\nWhat follows next are ideas to manage the tensions above. Then we will introduce a special role we call the 'Citizen Facilitator.'\n\nWhen all are seated in a group of three to eight people, it is a greater challenge to manage the group's energy and focus. One solution is for  the  designated facilitator to position a flip chart or chalkboard nearby. To regain attention stand,  pointing  to  the  visual  display  behind you,  and  say  something  like,  'Here  is  where we are now,' or 'Are we ready to move to this next item?' or (writing something on the visual display) 'This seems to be the sticking point. Talk with a neighbor for a moment and generate some ideas.' A teacher in Mumbai told us she  has  her  group  do  lots  of  partner  work  to keep energy high. After she stands to redirect group energy, she returns to her own partner to engage in the conversation.\n\nTo  clarify  a  topic  or  process  in  a  large group, 'TAG/TAU' (topic as given/topic as understood)  and  'PAG/PAU'  (process  as  given/ process as understood) are used. Voice and the visual  paragraph  are  employed.  Both  can  be used in small groups in this manner.\n\n'Next  we  (now  the  inclusive  pronoun  is appropriate) need to ask ourselves the question, 'What might we be missing?' Take a moment, jot down names of groups that might be affected by this and prepare to share.' The facilitator makes a discernable shift-leaning to one side, forward into  the  group,  leans  back  in  the  chair ,  or  removes eyeglasses -and asks in an approachable voice-'So what's your understanding of what we do now?' The facilitator shown in video 8.5 uses space and voice variation in three stages to check the group's understanding.\n\nVideo 8.5.\n\nSufficient consensus  is  mathematically challenging  in  a  group  of  three  or  in  a  twoto-two  split.  Make  a  working  agreement  that disagreements  based  on  principles  will  be explored; disagreements based on preferences will  give  way  to  values-based  choices.  Use  a values  matrix  on  important  decisions.  Name values  important  to  protect  when  making  the decision. Rate each choice as high, medium, or low in meeting each value. Most often this will clarify the decision-making process.\n\nHigh talkers often have limited consciousness  of  their  behavior  and  its  effect  on  others. Two ideas might help. Anonymously ask members  to  respond  to  questions  on  post-it  notes. Each  should  list  three  to  five  aspects  of  the group's work they value, and three to five practices that make the group less effective. Use the wall of silence strategy (appendix A) in which members place the post-it notes on a flip chart or wall,  and  silently  rearrange  them  placing  them into categories. Allow time for reflection. Now ask, 'What are you seeing? What surprises are there? What might we keep doing? What might we  change?'  Another  approach  is  to  use  the round-robin reflection strategies in which members silently respond to this prompt. 'What are some of the decisions you were making about when  and  how  to  participate  and  what  were some of the effects of those decisions on you and the group?' After a minute or so, have members take turns reporting, with no interruptions.\n\nThe  urgent  is  always  present.  Scheduling  a  special  event,  determining  a  response to  an  emotional  event,  or  responses  to  an unexpected  change  in  schedule,  are  some examples. Two approaches help groups keep their  major  energy  on  the  important  items. First  post  an  agenda.  List  estimated  times for  each  item  and  what  the  group  is  to  do. Name each item as a product: develop, assess, decide, understand. Name who is to lead the conversation on each. Place the urgent last on the agenda because if it is first it will consume available time. List hard to talk about topics\n\nearly,  so  members  have  a  chance  to  recover equanimity. See agenda samples in chapter 7.\n\n## The Citizen Facilitator\n\nHow can small groups, such as those with only three or four members, retain facilitation functions even without a designated facilitator who stays outside the conversation?\n\nOne of the authors worked with an elementary school in which grade-level teams met one hour a week to focus on instructional improvement. In each team, one teacher was designated to  be  the  facilitator.  Each  team's  charge  was to set annual grade-level goals, develop units, plan  lessons,  and  assess  student  work  results. Yet  by  midyear,  the  teams  were  struggling. Many  teachers  were  frustrated.  Some  teams had  developed  three  goals  for  the  year;  some had none; some had just one. They were good people, smart teachers with time and resources, yet they were floundering.\n\nThe  school  in  this  example  began  its collaborative  work  without  clear  intentions. Of course, student improvement is a goal, but how does collaborative work help the group to achieve this? The school leadership established structures, roles, times for the group to collaborate, and a menu of tasks on which to work. Yet tools were not provided. Time without tools is counterproductive.\n\nIn  conversations  with  facilitators,  other administrators, and one of the authors, the principal began to articulate her intention in having groups work together to make systematic inquiries into the relationship between teaching and student  learning. Strategies  for  collaborative work were learned.\n\nThe notion of a citizen facilitator emerged, one who may be designated for any amount of time (i.e., from one meeting to one semester to the life of the group), and has three responsibilities:\n\n- \u00b7 To serve as a two-way conduit between the team and the principal, informing the team of  the  principal's  priorities  and  requests,\n- and informing the principal of the group's ideas and recommendations.\n- \u00b7 To serve as professional developer to the group-providing  foundation  knowledge about  group  processes,  an  awareness  of the  distinction  between  dialogue  and  discussion,  and  the  tools  for  conversing, planning, and problem solving.\n- \u00b7 To be the person in the group who maintains a macro perspective, using 'helicopter' viewing to anticipate and assess when members are stuck or fatigued, and to be the  person  who  initiates  the  processes  to get energy and information flowing again.\n\nRather  than  having  a  neutral  facilitator, the  intention  in  citizen-facilitated  meetings is to  have  facilitated  conversations.  If  the designated  facilitator  will  be  an  active  voice within  the  room,  then  the  group  itself  must take on the knowledge and skills base of the facilitator. It is imperative that group members acquire this knowledge, for in a small group led  by  a  citizen  facilitator,  group  members will want to suggest approaches to the group's work, take on charting responsibilities, or remind the group to get on task.\n\nThe following is a list of duties performed by a citizen facilitator.\n\n- \u00b7 Develop the agenda either before the meeting or with the group.\n- \u00b7 Open the meeting.\n- \u00b7 Achieve role clarification so that members can  periodically  and  informally  rise  to facilitate or record 'I will sometimes want to  comment, so will ask someone else to facilitate. While I am facilitating, if someone goes on for too long, what would you like me to do?'\n- \u00b7 Describe the task as a product-what the group will see or hear when done.\n- \u00b7 Call on others to start the conversation.\n- \u00b7 Engage in conversation as appropriate.\n- \u00b7 Protect processes, especially one topic and one process at a time.\n\n- \u00b7 Initiate transitions.\n- \u00b7 Ask who will do what by when.\n- \u00b7 Call for meeting assessment.\n- \u00b7 Close meeting.\n\n## Developing Confidence as a Facilitator\n\nExtensive literature supports the idea that beliefs about oneself translate into actions and results.  Facilitator  self-confidence  is  a  dimension  of  efficacy  applied  to  the  specific  work of  conducting  meetings. As  previously  noted, efficacious  persons  believe  that  they  have knowledge  and  skills  that,  when  applied  to  a goal, will overcome obstacles.\n\nSuch self-confidence derives from reflection  on  experiences,  conversations  with  colleagues, and support from coaches or leaders. This chapter closes with the topic of ways to develop confidence. No one who is beginning to  facilitate  is  a  blank  slate.  Each  person begins  the  journey  to  increasingly  effective facilitation  with  unique strengths and unique things to learn.\n\nBecause  there  are  fewer  opportunities  to facilitate than to teach, teachers invent ways to increase  their  facilitation  skills.  Gather  information about conducting meetings. Isolate and over-practice essential skills like paraphrasing, pausing, probing, and inquiring. Use these anywhere and everywhere. The more you practice, the sooner these skills will move to a level of unconscious  competence,  so  that  you  don't need  to  think  about  them  anymore  when  you are facilitating.\n\nIsolate and practice other skills as well. Listen to a group when your back is turned to them and  record  what  you  hear  on  a  chart.  Observe the group with diffused vision to get a sense of the  group  as  a  unit,  to  monitor  breathing,  and to assess energy levels. Select a small group of moves and strategies from appendix A and use them repeatedly until you are comfortable with them. If you are a teacher, most of the strategies can be used in the classroom. Use a 'Proficiency\n\nScale' to assess your current level of facilitation effectiveness  and  plan  steps  for  improvement (Garmston and Zimmerman, 2013).\n\nPractice in classrooms, in shopping malls, in conversations,  in  any  settings  in  which you  are  interacting  with  other  people.  Of  all the verbal skills, we encourage overpracticing paraphrasing.  Use  it  when  you  need  it  least, then you will have this skill available when you need it most.\n\nEnlarge  your  repertoire.  Pay  attention  to others' facilitation styles and language. Jot down phrases they use. Isolate certain language forms to  practice.  Jot  down  in  advance  any  phrases you would like to incorporate into your next facilitation. Practice facilitation phrases when you are  working  with  students.  Keep  in  mind  that knowing is different from understanding.\n\nSeek vicarious experiences. It's been demonstrated that one way to personal efficacy is to watch someone who performs well (Goddard, Hoy, and Woolfolk-Hoy, 2004) Talk with\n\n## Forget the Apple: Two Minutes a Day Brings Confidence Your Way\n\nConfident postures (taking more space  and  open  stances)  increase  testosterone  and  decrease  cortisol  leading to feelings of confidence and high tolerance for risk in both men and women. A simple two-minute power-pose manipulation  was  enough  to  significantly  alter the  physiological,  mental,  and  feeling states of  participants  (Carney,  Cuddy, and Yap, 2010). Measurements included electrocardiogram, saliva, and interview data. The daily practice implications are great for mental health. Facilitators could assume a superman (or woman) pose for two minutes before a meeting or important event. Admission: it works. Hint: do this in private.\n\nsuch  people;  explore  their  reasons  for  certain moves. Ask  them  to  offer  you  ideas,  suggestions, and support.\n\nHold  an  object  such  as  a  pencil  in  your hand. For some reason, that helps many people to stay grounded. Focus on the group, not yourself. Focusing on yourself is a sure ticket to discomfort. Know that mistakes are your teacher.\n\nFinally, inquire into your own inferences about others. 'The challenging internal work of  facilitation,'  Roger  Schwarz  reminds  us, 'is to identify and explore the core values and assumptions that guide your actions, to rigorously reflect on how they increase or decrease your effectiveness, and to develop a new set of  values  and  assumptions  that  you  can  use to increase your effectiveness and that of the groups you work with' (2002, p. 66). Presuming  positive  intentions,  the  last  of  the  seven norms of collaboration, influences good work with  groups.  However,  using  the  language of  positive  presuppositions  ('Given  your  interest in resolving this . . .') is not enough if your nonverbal behaviors belie what you say. Presuming  positive  intentions  is  a  matter  of respect for others. Its Latin origin, respecere , means  to  look  again,  highlighting  the  active nature of respect. Developing as an effective facilitator requires reflection and inquiry into your  own  attitudes,  assumptions,  and  beliefs about  others  and  the  potential  of  group  wisdom in a facilitative environment (Ravlin and Prickett, 2014).\n\nAccording to Ravlin and Prickett (2014) the  workings  of  positive  presuppositions  are grounded  in  expectancy  theory,  first  proposed  as  a  model  by  Victor  Vroom  (1964), and  brought  into  the  twenty-first  century  by Redmond (2010) and others. Positive presuppositions  convey expectancy , in the  theory's terms: the belief that one's effort can or will indeed  result  in  attaining  the  stated  outcome or  stance.  We  know  a  facilitator  who  sometimes  starts  with  a  new  group  by  saying. 'I'm pleased to be here as I only work with smart groups,' with a gesture drawing the full group into this definition. The group will live up to the expectancy of the facilitator just as teacher expectations influence teacher behaviors, which influence student achievement.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFacilitators manage group energy, focus attention, and manage information. They give directions, clarify tasks, frame group perceptions, encourage participation, test assumptions, synthesize ideas, encourage participation, and support the group in its own development. At times they intervene to help groups work more effectively and develop collective potential.\n\nStakeholders  have  different  perspectives. A facilitator serves the system by bringing consciousness about the different perspectives. As we depart  from  unproductive  school  cultures, the  facilitation  role  takes  on  even  more  value than  it  did  in  the  past.  It  is  one  of  four  leadership  roles  played  by  all  players  in  adaptive schools, yet it is still the role least occupied by teachers  and  classified  staff.  Developing  as  a facilitator is challenging, because it entails high levels  of  several  skill  sets.  Improvement  resources include self study, modeling, attending workshops,  and  self  assessement  with  proficiency scales and facilitian rubrics are helpful.\n\nFinally, great facilitators help their groups see themselves not as they are but as they might become. As  we  shall  see  in  the  next  chapter, both  design  and  facilitation  play  important roles in developing groups.\n\n## PART IV\n\n## RESOURCES FOR INQUIRY\n\nB leaders help groups articulate the underlying mental models that might be y shining the light of consciousness on essential inner structures, skilled limiting perspectives and possibilities.\n\nAdaptive  leaders  disturb  the  system  for positive change. They see the group's potential for  working  effectively  and  efficiently  on  the right work by providing support for steady performance  improvements.  These  leaders  move beyond  tinkering  with  surface  practices  by pushing their groups to work at deeper levels that engage the beliefs and values that motivate collective learning and growth.\n\nthe  surface  of  group  phenomena  to  seek  the underlying  drivers  of  these  observable  behaviors. This section continues by presenting an  intervention  model  for  directing  energy as a vital resource to increase the potency of groups as systems. Finally, we describe structures and tools for facilitating inquiry-driven data teams.\n\nPart IV offers a description of six domains of  group  development  leaders  can  target  to assess  and  modify  their  practices.  These  include: 'Getting Work Done,' 'Doing the Right Work,'  'Working  Collaboratively,'  'Managing  Systems,'  'Developing  the  Group,'  and 'Adapting to Change.'\n\nIn addition we will explore group energy as a powerful resource for this type of work. Here  we  present  a  model  for  looking  below\n\n## Chapter 9\n\n## Six Domains of Developing Groups\n\nD eveloping groups is one of three jobs assumed by leaders and professional developers. The other two are the task of getting work done and developing  process  skills.  This  chapter  describes  principles  of  group development and provides a way for groups to diagnose themselves on six fundamental aspects of group maturity. Chapter 10 provides a systems view of changing groups and reveals ways of working for long-range, sustainable change by assessing and intervening at the level of energy sources driving group performance.\n\nin which you don't have to touch everyone to make a difference. Adaptive leaders of groups and within groups-no matter what their titlerealize that developing a group is an ongoing, third  agenda  in  their  work;  the  first  is  getting work  done,  and  the  second  is  improving  the processes of accomplishing work.\n\nAll groups work at less than full potential. The best groups regard this not as a deficiency but as a healthy dissatisfaction with their current  performance.  They  consistently  commit their  resources  to  working  together  more  effectively. This is the way that research teams become better at researching, that  basketball teams win more games, and that theater casts improve  from  performance  to  performance. All groups become better at their tasks when they reflect on their work, acquire new knowledge and skills, and practice the fundamentals of their craft. As stated previously, any group that  is  too  busy  to  reflect  on  its  work  is  too busy to improve.\n\nAll groups are unique. All groups are complex systems in which everything affects everything else, tiny events make major disturbances\n\n## The Premises of Group Development\n\n## Each Group Is Unique\n\nHistory,  cognitive  styles,  setting,  mental models, and tasks all contribute to developing a  group  personality.  Each  group  is  not  only unlike other groups, it is also different from the sum  of  its  individuals.  For  example,  a  group might be composed of efficacious individuals who nevertheless believe that collectively they have little chance of making a difference.\n\n## Some Groups Mature\n\nSome groups will mature along a continuum from novice  to  expert  performance.  Not all  groups  make  this  journey,  just  as  not  all teachers  achieve  a  state  of  expertise.  David\n\nBerliner  (cited  in  Calderhead,  1996)  speculated that the novice stage in teaching usually lasts  for  the  first  year  and  that  most  teachers reach the third stage (competence) within three or  four  years.  Only  a  modest  percentage  of teachers  moves  to  the  next  stage  of  proficiency,  and  an  even  smaller  percentage,  says Berliner, achieves the expert stage. Contemporary teacher education programs are placing a greater emphasis on metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive regulation. This monitoring of  one's  own  progress  in  achieving  learning goals  may  abbreviate  the  novice  to  expertise journey.  This  is  especially  important  as  programs aim to develop 'adaptive expertise' the ability to engage in lifelong learning, especially from others (Darling-Hammond and Bransford, 2005; National Research Council, 2000).\n\nWe believe that much the same is true for group  development  and  that  groups  with  collaborative cultures, groups in which members practice  group  member  metacognitive  skills will  advance  faster  than  groups  with  cultures of individualization. Expert groups can do increasingly more in less time. They differ from novices in these ways:\n\n- \u00b7 Have  more  practical  knowledge  of  the social,  political,  and  systems  context  in which their work occurs.\n- \u00b7 Plan, monitor, and revise their approach to problems more effectively.\n- \u00b7 Spend  more  time  trying  to  understand  a problem  before  generating  solutions  and are  more  likely  to  monitor  their  solution attempts.\n- \u00b7 Are more likely to be reflective and continuously learn through experience.\n- \u00b7 Do  better  at  distinguishing  relevant  data from nonrelevant data in problem solving.\n\n## Attrition Does Not Have to Block Development\n\nWith intention and attention it is possible to  minimize and overcome the disruptive ef- fects  of  attrition  on  group  dynamics. Groups that emphasize developing group-member capabilities  and  norms  of  collaboration  informally provide induction experiences for new members (see chapter 4). We work with many international  schools.  In  these  settings  staff turnover  is  high  and  frequent.  Yet,  in  teams that  regularly  apply  collaborative  norms  and meeting standards as a matter of course, new members quickly adopt the behaviors of their new school.\n\n## Variables Affect Performance and Performance Capacity\n\n'Soft'  variables,  such  as  morale,  work culture, and trust not only influence the performance of a group but also influence the group's ability to learn from its experience (Hennessy, 1998).  As  we  shall  see  in  the  next  chapter also,  the  collective  energies  of  efficacy,  interdependence,  consciousness,  craftsmanship, and  flexibility  affect  a  group's  performance. In  data-driven  climates,  it  may  appear  that only student-related metrics such as test scores and  graduation  rates  have  value  in  guiding important  efforts.  Not  so,  say  a  number  of organizational  developers  in  the  private  sector,  sociology,  and  education  (Harner,  2015). Variables like trust are being measured (exemplified in the Chicago school research, such as Bryk and Schneider, 2002), work climate, and teacher  efficacy  contribute  to  understanding and improvement.\n\n## Learning Organizes Itself in Unique Domains\n\nLearning  occurs  through  different  processes, some centering in the neocortex, others at  the  limbic  system,  some  a  combination  of both. Depending on the model one adopts (all models are incomplete) you would say that it is nested in hierarchical levels of environment, behaviors,  capabilities,  beliefs,  identity,  and mission.  For  two  decades  we  have  applied concepts  from  this  model  with  success.  A\n\nnewer model (Garmston in Costa et al., 2015), described  in  the  next  chapter,  regards  these domains  as  interactive  within  a  complex  system, in which, as we have explored, everything affects  everything  else  and  tiny  events  cause major disturbanances. The greatest benefits of group development efforts come from strategically intervening in the different domains.\n\n## Metacognition and Style Diversity Accelerate Learning\n\nGroups that reflect about their experiences develop the executive consiousness necessary to  self-organize  and  manage  the  processes used  to  do  their  work.  In  other  words  they take time to learn about themselves and how they do their work. When diversity in cognitive  style  exists  in  groups,  such  learning  is accelerated. Teams that manage the style tensions between experiencing, reflecting, thinking,  and  acting  achieve  the  greatest  growth and greatest accomplishments. Knowledge of the six domains of group develoment, below, is  particularly  useful  for  such  groups  (Kolb and Kolb, 2009).\n\n## Maturity Manifests in Six Domains of Group Development\n\nGroup maturity manifests in the ways that a group manages its day-to-day work in order to  deal  with  its  external  environment.  How well  it  performs  in  six  interacting  domains determines the group's achievement. Each field is informed by the application of domain-specific  knowledge,  skills,  and  structures  as  well as  unique  combinations  of  efficacy,  flexibilty, craftsmanship, consciousness, and interdependence.  Each  of  the  chapters  in  this  book highlights  the  resources  for  developing  these domains. Readers may wish to turn to the end of  the  chapter  now  for  a  description  of  each field and a diagnostic instrument.\n\n## The Six Fields of Group Development\n\nThe  six  domains  of  group  development are (1) getting work done; (2) doing the right work; (3) working collaboratively; (4) managing systems; (5) developing the group; and (6) adapting to change.\n\nAll groups struggle to achieve a successful balance  between  managing  and  adapting  to external  relationships  and  maintaining  harmonious  and  effective  internal  relationships (Schein,  2004).  In  each  dimension,  the  issues of task accomplishment and process skills development compete for attention. Although it is useful for groups to realize this macroview of their work, it is difficult to assess and intervene with group development at this level. To effectively build strong groups capable of maintaining their own identity and adapting to external environments, groups must be able to function skillfully within each of the six fields. Knowing the knowledge bases, skills, and structures of each is an essential first step. Knowing the assumptions  held  by  the  group  about  each  of these  theaters  of  operation  reveals  the  mental models and drivers of group choices.\n\nBefore reading this section, think about a group with which you work, and ask yourself the following:\n\n- 1. What are our strengths as a group?\n- 2. What difficulties do we encounter as we work?\n- 3. How ready are we to take on increasingly complex or emotionally charged tasks?\n- 4. What are some potential growth areas for us as a group?\n\n## Getting Work Done\n\nLeaders  and  groups  understand  the  dynamic  relationship  between  task  accomplishment  and  process  skills  development.  The\n\nprevailing mental model in this domain is that the group assumes that its work is manageable. Essential  knowledge  includes  mastering  dialogue  and  discussion  (chapter  5),  conducting successful meetings (chapter 6), designing efficient and effective meetings (chapter 7), using facilitation  skills  (chapter  8),  and  facilitating data teams (chapter 11).\n\n## Doing the Right Work\n\nLeaders  and  groups  plan  work  to  realize their vision, values, and emerging goals (chapter 2). The organizing presupposition of this domain in  that  vision,  values,  and  goal  clarity  focus group energy as well as when and how to talk about  each  (chapter  5).  The  necessary  knowledge includes understanding adaptivity (chapter 2), facilitating data teams (chapter 11), living effectively with conflict (chapter 12), developing the capacities for change and adaptivity (chapter 13), and creating community (chapter 14).\n\n## Working Collaboratively\n\nLeaders  and  groups  work  to  create  and maintain  an  effective  environment  for  collaboration  and  interdependence.  The  dominant presupposition in this domain is that diversity is  a  necessary  resource  and  that  subcultures must connect with and value one another. The knowledge that is necessary to effectively work collaboratively  and  interdependently  includes focusing  on  both  things  and  energy  (chapter 2), the four group-member capabilities and the seven  norms  of  collaboration  (see  chapter  4), the mastery of dialogue and discussion (chapter 5),  successful  meeting  management  (chapter 6), time efficient meeting (chapter 7), facilitation  skills  (chapter  9),  facilitating  data  teams (chapter 11), and the ability to work effectively with conflict (chapter 12).\n\n## Managing Systems\n\nGroups develop new ways of looking at the world. An organizing presupposition here is that as systems become more complex, the ability to think systematically and know when to set aside linear logic is important. Critical knowledge includes understanding dynamical systems (chapter 2), working effectively with conflict  (see  chapter  12),  developing  the  capacities for change and adaptivity (see chapters  1,  2,  and  10),  and  creating  community (see chapter 14).\n\n## Developing the Group\n\nWhatever the degree of accomplishment, groups can become better at their work. Individuals and groups need to develop resources for  generating  ideas  and  adapting  to  change. An  important  presupposition  in  this  domain is that both individual and group orientations are necessary to produce innovations and implement  them.  The  necessary  knowledge  includes information about two ways of talking (chapter 6), norms of collaoration (chapter 5), about group development (as described in this chapter),  the  ability  to  work  effectively  with conflict  (see  chapter  12),  the  importance  of professional  community  (see  chapter  4),  and the principles of creating that community (see chapter 14).\n\n## Adapting to Change\n\nAn  effective  group  relates  to  multiple communities  that  are  external  to  the  group. The  agendas  and  resulting  demands  of  these communities are often in flux and inconsistent with  one  another.  The  prevailing  presupposition  within  this  domain  is  that  for  groups  to function effectively, they must constantly adapt to  external  environments.  The  more  turbulent the environment, the more the energy must be focused outward. Critical knowledge includes recognizing schools as complex systems (chapter 2), asking three focusing questions (chapter 2), working  with  conflict  (see  chapter  12), developing the capacities for change and adaptivity (see chapter 10), and creating community (see chapter 14).\n\nTable 9.1 .

The knowledge for one domain is also necessary in another. As in all dynamic systems, what affects one variable affects the others. Because of this interactive nature, an assessment instrument that seeks  detail  about  either  the  'things'  or  'the energy'  in  each  domain  would  contain  redundancies. Mastery of discussion and dialogue, for example, are requirements in the first and third domains. To be effective at dialogue, individuals must internalize the group-member capabilities and the norms of collaboration; these elements are also a prerequisite for managing conflict in the fourth, fifth, and sixth domains. To maximize discussion  effectiveness, successful  meeting skills are required, which is a focus in the first and third domains.\n\nIn  contrast  to  the  energies  involved  in assessing  'hard  data,'  the  energies  in  system dynamics  have  traditionally  been  harder  to measure, more prone to measurement error, and therefore less relied upon as a data source for group development. Nevertheless, 'the importance  of  measurement  error  diminishes  when the investigative focus shifts from concern over the system's current state to understanding the system's  behavior  over  time,  which  is  often the  purpose  of  a  systems  dynamics  model' (Hennessy, 1998, pp. 6-7). Measurement-error importance  also  declines  when  data  are  used to  promote  conversations  about  how  a  group might strengthen itself  rather  than  being  used for external evaluation.\n\nWe have found that a simple rating scale such  as  the  following  is  useful  for  group self-assessment:  1  =  Beginning;  2  =  Emerg-\n\ning; 3 = Developing; 4 = Integrating; and 5 = Innovating.\n\nOrganize  a  faculty  group  into  subgroups of three or four members each. Have them discuss each domain using the descriptions above. Have them rate their group by loose consensus on each domain, using this scale. Suggest that a  way  of  calibrating  their  place  on  the  scale might be to locate, in general, where the group functions along a continuum of unconscious incompetence (they don't know they don't know) to  unconscious  competence  (performing  with effortlessness). Rate the major knowledge areas in each domain as follows:\n\n| Beginning   | Unconscious incompetence: We don't know what we don't know.                                                                                                                                               |\n|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Emerging    | Unconscious incompetence to conscious competence: We are discovering areas in which we want to learn.                                                                                                     |\n| Developing  | Conscious competence: We are applying skills but with much effort, requiring more attention to how we are using a skill than to the results we are getting and possible needs for modifying our approach. |\n| Integrating | Conscious competence to unconscious competence: We are beginning to be able to focus on results and the skill we are employing.                                                                           |\n| Innovating  | Unconscious competence: Our skills are so internalized we can put our full attention on the realtionship and the results we are getting, allowing us to effortlessly modify our approach if necessary.    |\n| Adapting    | Reflective competence: Having gained unconsious competence, we routinely reflect, learn from, and modify future interactions.                                                                             |\n\nNow have  the  subgroups  report  their  assessments to the entire group. Search for agreement  among  subgroups  and  set  those  aside. Locate areas of disagreement and seek to un- derstand the differences in perception. Come to an accommodation in ratings. From this analysis, have the group select a domain for further study and development (figure 9.2).\n\nFigure 9.1 . Assessing Six Domains of Group Development\n\n## A Systems Approach for Developing Groups\n\nLike birds lifting off from far reaches in a meadow and flocking together in flight, ideas emerge from a variety  of  sources  in  a  group, suggestive of a systems approach to developing groups. Within the literature on organizational development and school change, it is now taken for  granted  that  teacher  work  and  learning  is largely influenced by socialization and that the culture of the workplace is significant in determining how teachers think, what they do, and how they express themselves (Hargreaves and Fullan,  2012;  Newmann  and  Wehlage,  1995; Rosenholtz, 1991). From anthropology, cybernetics, psychology, and organizational science (Dilts, 1996) come conceptions of nested levels  of  learning  in  which  learning  at  one  level influences learning at another. In this model, a sense  of  identity  organizes  and  informs  other levels  of  learning.  In  another  model,  learning domains are parts of complex systems (Costa and  Garmston,  2016).  In  this  model,  too,  the sense of identity is dominant.\n\nIn  the  following  chapter,  group  identity is  identified  as  a  catalytic  entity,  changeable through  circumstances  and  time,  that  when selected as a focus of intervention, can dramatically affect group performance. Like individual identity, organizational  identity  is  also  fluid. This instability is regarded as an asset to adaptivite change (Gioia, Schulz, Corley, 2000). Organizational idenity can be clarified in patterns of self-reflection. Four essential questions promote this  line  of  inquiry: Who  are  we? What do we take  to  be  central  to  our  work?  What  do  we believe makes our group distinct from the perceptions of other groups? What is perceived by us to be an enduring quality of our organization? Additionally,  five  collective  energy  sourcesefficacy,  flexibiity,  craftsmanship,  consiousness and interdependence are described as potential places of intervention to support stuck groups in moving toward their potential.\n\nThe  newer  sciences-quantum  physics, cognitive anthropology, complexity theory, and the study of fractals-portray a view of life organizing itself. Margaret Wheatley and Myron Kellner-Rogers (1996), articulate translators of the new sciences for leadership agendas, write the following:\n\nIdentity,  then,  is  another  essential  condition for  organization.  It  is  the  self  of  the  system that compels  it  toward  particular  actions and behaviors. . . . Organizational structures emerge  in  response  to  these  imperatives  of identity. Identity is at the core of every organization, fueling its creation. (pp. 85-86)\n\n## Chapter 10  Developing Groups for\n\n## Sustainable Change\n\nD on't fix it until it shows. Disappointing test scores, airline arrival records, or accidents due to improper seat belt use spur policymakers to action. Action too often involves applying fixes to surface events to stimulate changes in the data. Such approaches rarely do much but modify data points, and fail to address the root problems that led to the undesirable results. Also, it is rare that such changes are sustainable. The American saying, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it,' in practice is really, 'If it doesn't show, don't fix it.'\n\nEfforts  at  change  often  focus  more  on things than energy. Modifying schedules, making  curriculum  changes,  and  adding  new  instructional materials lead the list. While energy, too,  is  addressed,  it  may  be  in  the  form  of inservice  training  programs  directed  at  teachers who are seen as workers needing to be told what and how to teach rather than professionals  who  make  decisions  about  teaching  and learning.  Thankfully,  we  see  an  increase  in professional  development  programs  that  treat teachers as professionals. These long-term approaches focus on creating collaborative work cultures  with  attention  to  follow-up,  practice, and coaching.\n\nThis  chapter  examines  group  development through the lenses  of  intervening  not  at the  surface  practices  of  groups,  but  rather  at their source. Policymakers, novice groups, and leaders of silo organizations value individuality over  interdependence  and  analyze  data  in  a vacuum.  Experts  seek  patterns  and  look  beneath the surface, seeking driving forces. Natural systems such as schools, departments, and family units cannot be directed, only disturbed. After decades of absence, the reintroduction of disturbances, like the meteorologist's butterfly metaphor or the reintroduction of the grey wolf to Yellowstone National Park, affect everything else  in  their  systems  (Yellowstone Wolf  Project, 2013). Maturana and Varela (1987) write, 'Systems choose what to notice and how to pay attention.' Leaders disturb systems by bringing attention to what's being overlooked.\n\nIn this chapter we explore a way of inquiring  beneath  visible  behaviors  and  detectable patterns to search for potential sources of what groups do. Readers will find first, a description of  an  'iceberg'  model  (figure  10.1),  second, a  defintion  of  terms  in  the  lower  parts  of  the model,  and  finally,  ideas  for  intervening  at sources  of  behaviors,  rather  than  on  what  is seen and heard.\n\nLater,  we  examine  another  model  for  influencing  change  below  the  surface,  bringing forward a version of Robert Dilt's conceptual treatment  of  nested  levels  of  learning.  Dilts organized his thinking in vertical form, like the deep to surface model, and positioned identity as  the  variable  responsible  for  the  greatest change  in  beliefs,  values,  and  behaviors.  We have  modified  this  in  keeping  with  our  sense that  humans,  too,  are  complex  dynamic  systems  and  their  developmental  processes  are subject to the same system principles described in chapter 2.\n\n## Deep to Surface Structure\n\nFigure  10.1  has  its  genesis  in  the  work of  Noam  Chomsky.  In  the  1950s  Chomsky created  a  transformational  linguistics  model that was  later  elaborated  on  for  work  in therapy  (Bandler  and  Grinder,  1975).  Since then,  applications  of  this  'iceberg'  model have been developed in such diverse fields as cognitive-behavioral therapy and architecture. In  the  1990s,  Costa  and  Garmston  adapted it to their work  in  'Cognitive  Coaching' (Garmston and Von Frank, 2012). It is broadly accepted that humans (and groups) act on internal maps, models, beliefs, and perceptions of the world, rather than what could be considered real. The iceberg figure illustrates how inquiries into the sources of surface behaviors reveal, and can stimulate, changes to core aspects of deep structure.\n\nFigure  10.1  depicts  the  relationship  between the surface structure of what is seen and\n\nFigure 10.1 . Moving from Deep to Surface Structure\n\nheard from groups and their members (words, behaviors, norms, policies) and the underlying factors that inform and shape them-the deep structure  elements  of  beliefs,  values,  identity, and mental models. Below that, reference structure refers to emotionally laden events-like a tornado-ravaged school, or a teacher strike. In this model, anything in surface structure could theoretically be traced to origins below.\n\nBy  shining  the  light  of  consciousness  on essential  inner  structures,  skillful  leaders  help groups identify the underlying mental models that might be limiting perspectives and possibilities.  When  facilitators  or  group  members pose questions like ' Who are we?' 'Why are we doing this?' or 'Why are we doing it this way?' as described in chapter 2, mental models held  in  deep  structure  are  revealed. Additionally, the practice of dialogue and certain facilitation strategies can illuminate mental models, identities, beliefs, and values. Groups may pose questions to themselves referencing manifestations of the five energy sources:\n\n- \u00b7 'What is it we do not know, that if knowing  it, would  increase  our  chances  of success?'\n- \u00b7 'What might need to happen for us to increase our collective consciousness?'\n- \u00b7 'What appear to be our assumptions about this matter?'\n- \u00b7 'Whose thinking has not yet been tapped?'\n- \u00b7 'What ideas might help us stay the course even through frustration and ambiguity?'\n\nSome groups get stuck in limiting beliefs such as 'The administration is unresponsive to our needs,' 'These kids can't learn because of their  home  environments,'  or  'We  value  our autonomy  and  don't  need  to  coordinate  our efforts  with  others.'  Leaders  who  listen  below the surface, pausing, paraphrasing, posing questions,  and  presuming  positive  intentions, structure dialogues that permit group members to inquire about their own assumptions, beliefs, and  values.  These  dialogues  explore  driving behaviors and choices appearing in the surface struture. One cannot influence what is invisible.\n\n## Reference Stucture Content\n\nThe  word  'reference'  is  derived  from the Latin referre , 'to carry back.' It means to link  back,  and  in  the  iceberg  model  denotes that this is the source for what lies above. The reference  structure  houses  emotionally  vivid experiences. A divisive teacher strike and its aftermath affect emotional responses for many years-long  after  the  school  board  members and the administrative teams have left or retired. Other reference structures might include the closing of a cherished program or school, feelings  of betrayal  related  to continuing misunderstandings  in  decision  making,  or  a sudden  influx  of  a  different  type  of  student. Individuals  also  carry  reference  structures that  inform  meaning  making.  Some  of  these storage  and  interpretive  processes  begin  before speech develops. The reference structure informs  collective  mental  models,  beliefs, values,  and  identities.  Of  course  individual reference structures also exist, making leadership messy enough to be interesting.\n\n## Deep Structure Content\n\nIt  is  here  that  the  'rules'  for  how  the world  works  or  is  supposed  to  work  are encoded.  Some  of  these  meanings  are  held consciously,  and  some  are  outside  conscious awareness,  yet  all  inform  and  direct  choices and  behaviors.  Responses  to  change  initiatives, problem-solving models, and the criteria for  effective  solutions  are  all  rooted  in  the deep structure of the group.\n\nThe  actual  workings  and  influences  of the deep-structure  elements  are  not  always apparent  to  group  members.  Like  an  iceberg, seven-eighths of which lies hidden below water, special tools are necessary to illuminate and mediate what is there. Remarkably, the simple paraphrase is such a tool, and all forms of in-\n\nquiry will disclose portions of this underworld. Examining  discrepancies  between  espoused beliefs  and  actions  often  reveals  unconscious sources  of  tension  and  inconsistent  choices. Schools  that  champion  inclusive  cultures  can undermine their efforts with awards programs that recognize only a few high achievers.\n\n## Five Sources of Energy as Places to Intervene\n\nsciousness, and interdependence influence states  of  performance  and  are  modifiable  by mediated experience. They are related to stages of cognitive,  moral,  and  ego  development. Skilled  leaders  take  a  developmental  view  in working with individuals and groups.\n\n## Consciousness\n\nOur premise is that the five energy sources of efficacy, flexibility, craftsmanship,  con-\n\nConsciousness is depicted in figure 10.1 as giving access to what lies below a group's behavior. Language is the medium for revealing deep structure content. To be conscious is to be\n\nFigure 10.2. Group Performance and Energy Sources\n\naware  of  one's  thoughts,  feelings,  intentions, behaviors, and the effects they have on others. Consciousness is a prerequisite to self-control and  self-direction  for  both  individuals  and groups.  Although  all  groups  are  capable  of reflective consciousness, many do not practice this. Stevens and Campion (1994) refer to this energy  source  as  a  group's  'executive  consciousness,' required to self-organize and manage its work. Groups that use this energy source maintain an awareness of their values, norms, and  identity;  monitor  the  congruence  of  their espoused  beliefs  and  their  manifest  beliefs; and stand outside themselves to reflect on their processes  and  products.  Such  groups  are  also aware of their criteria for decision making and of how their own assumptions and knowledge might interfere with their learning.\n\n## Efficacy\n\nPerceived  collective  efficacy  refers  to the  judgment  of  teachers  in  a  team  that  the group as a whole can organize and execute the courses of action required to have a positive effect  on  students. The  choices  groups  make are influenced by the strength of their efficacy beliefs. Goddard,  Hoy,  and  Woolfolk-Hoy (2004)  find  that  to  have  a  high  degree  of collective  efficacy  group  members  must  believe  that  they  and  others,  individually  and together,  are  capable  of  producing  increased student  success  and  of  overcoming  obstacles to that goal. Participating in decision-making contributes strongly to teachers' beliefs in the capabilities of their peers, fosters commitment to school goals, and promotes gains in student achievement. The RAND change-agent study (McLaughlin, 1990) found a staff's collective efficacy  to  be  the  most  consistent  variable related  to school  success.  Bandura  (1986, 1997)  proposes  three  sources  of  efficacyshaping  information  relevant  to  groups:  accomplishments in which the group attributes its  achievements to its  own  decisions,  skills, and hard work, rather than fate or luck; vicarious experiences; and social persuasion.\n\nEfficacy  is  particularly  catalytic  because it is  a  determining  factor  in  the  resolution of  complex  problems.  If  groups  feel  little efficacy,  blame,  withdrawal,  and  rigidity  are likely  to  follow.  Teams  with  robust  efficacy, however,  are  likely  to  expend  more  energy in their work,  persevere  longer,  set  more challenging  goals,  and  continue  in  the  face of  failure.  Efficacious  groups  regard  events as  opportunities  for  learning,  are  motivated by and committed to achieving shared goals, learn from experiences, focus resources where they will make the greatest difference, know what they know and do not know, and develop strategies  to  learn  what  is  needed  (Goddard, Hoy, and Woolfolk-Hoy, 2004).\n\n## Flexibility\n\nAs groups develop cognitively, they value and  more  consistently  view  situations  from multiple  perspectives.  Piaget  called  this  overcoming egocentrism.  Cultivating  group  member flexibility helps them to see others as more than their roles and not be trapped by constantly checking for agreement with personal views. In this way they form broader perspectives by seeing themselves and others as players in a larger drama  in  which  they  all  simultaneously  play central and secondary parts.\n\nThe peak performers Garfield (1986) studied  displayed  an  ability  for  flexible  attention that  he  called  microattention  and  macroattention. Microattention involves logical analytical computation  and  seeing  cause  and  effect  in methodical  steps.  It  is  important  in  problem analysis  or  curriculum  planning.  It  encompasses attention to detail, precision, and orderly progressions. Macroattention is useful for discerning  themes  and  patterns  from  an  assortment of information. It is intuitive, holistic, and conceptual. Macrothinking is good for bridging gaps, and it enables one to perceive a pattern even when some of the pieces are missing.\n\nGroups  that  develop  this  energy  source honor  and  value  diversity  within  and  outside the group, attend to both rational and intuitive\n\nways  of  thinking,  can  collectively  shift  perspective,  and  utilize  a  wide  array  of  thinking and process skills. Such groups can also navigate  the  internal  tensions  of  confusion  and ambiguity and become unstuck by generating multiple actions for moving ahead.\n\nFlexibility is a prerequisite to demonstrating  respect  for  diverse  perspectives.  Flexible teachers are empathetic. Flexible groups listen with their ears, eyes, heart, and mind. They are cognitively  empathetic  with  students,  which enables them to predict misunderstandings and anticipate the most useful learning experiences. Flexibility, like efficacy, is related to risk taking.  Creative  groups  live  close  to  the  edge, pushing  frontiers,  generating  new  knowledge, experimenting with new ways, and constantly growing into new abilities.\n\n## Craftsmanship\n\nData  from  the  League  of  Professional Schools (Glickman, 1991) found that in schools where  teachers  are  the  most  successful,  they have  the  highest  dissatisfaction  with  the  results of their work. Success, for craftsmanlike groups,  produces  self-imposed  higher  standards in an ongoing cycle of improvement. In a study using cognitive coaching with university professors, Garmston and Hyerle (1988) found that as craftsmanship increased, the professors grew in their ability to be critically self-reflective  and  effective  in  producing  self-analysis and evaluation.\n\nTo appreciate this energy source, consider the mindset of expert performers such as musicians, artists, teachers, craftspeople, race car pit  crews, and athletic teams. They take pride in their work and consistently strive to improve current performance. Craftsmanship-the drive for  elaboration,  clarity,  refinement,  and  precision-is  the  energy  source  from  groups  who ceaselessly learn and deepen their knowledge, skills,  and  effectiveness.  Groups  that  access this  resource  invest  energy  in  honing  and  inventing  better  ways  to  do  their  work,  honor in  themselves  and  others  the  arduous  journey from novice to expert, manage time effectively, and continually improve inter- and intra-group communications. They  create,  hold,  calibrate, and refine performance and product standards for their work.\n\n## Interdependence\n\nInterdependence  is  a  recognition  of  the interconnections among  individuals, other groups, the school, distrct, the community and all  aspects  of  cultures  in  their  setting.  Interdependence is a key value in communities of practice;  groups that share a common interest and  meet  to  extend  their  learning  together  to refine  their  crafts.  Teams  that  have  grown  in interdependence manage individual differences and trust the group enough to voice dissimilarities (Kolb and Kolb 2009). Sergiovanni (1994) tells us that the German sociologist Ferdinand Tonnies called this way of being gemeinschaft . Gemeinschaft is  a  community  of  mental  life. Gemeinschaft contrasts  with gesellschaft , in which  community  values  have  been  replaced by contractual ones. The more policies a group has,  the  less  the  sense  of  community.  This  is the  case  in  most  modern  organizations.  Interdependent  peoples'  sense  of  self  is  enlarged from a conception of me to a sense of us . They understand that individuality is not lost as they connect with the group; only egocentricity is.\n\nInterdependent  groups  value  and  trust the  process  of  dialogue,  have  an  awareness of  their  multiple  relationships  and  identities with other groups, and regard disagreement as a source of learning and transformation. They regard  knowledge  as  fluid,  provisional,  and subject  to  new  interpretation  with  additional experience. Perhaps most important, interdependent groups see the group not just as it is but also for its potential.\n\n## Surface Structure Content\n\nBehaviors,  placed  at  the  surface  structure in  the  iceberg  model,  are  what  individuals  or groups  do.  They  represent  what  is  visible,  yet\n\noffer  few  cues  as  to  the  sources  of  actions. Language is used to describe behaviors, and the paraphrase  is  supremely  qualified  as  the  first move in intervention. First, it is not as intrusive as an initial question might be, it generates elaboration and clarification, and is a natural bridge to futher understanding through questions. One cannot  intervene  with  the  invisible.  Opening  a window to deep structure content permits even further understanding and mediation.\n\nKegan  and  Lahey  (2001)  propose  that work  settings  are  language  communities  and that  group  leaders  are  leading  language  communities:  '[Al]though  every  person,  in  any setting,  has  some opportunity to influence the nature of language, leaders have exponentially greater access and opportunity to shape, alter, or  ratify  the  existing  language  rules'  (p.  8). By attending to the verbal and nonverbal communication  cues  of  group  members,  skilled group leaders frame their own communication patterns to positively influence the perceptions, choices, and decisions of their groups.\n\n## Deep Structure Content\n\nMostly unarticulated in deep structure are five influential entities: identity, beliefs, values, mental  models,  and  energy  sources.  Others, too, reside there and will be described later.\n\nIdentity .  This  is  a  group's  sense  of  itself; it  is  related  to  beliefs  and  values. Albert  and Whetten  (1985)  characterized  organizational identity  as  a  self-reflective  question: Who  are we  as  an  organization?  They  concluded  that organizational  identity  could  be  summarized in three major dimensions: (a) what is taken by the  organization  to  be  central  to  its  work;  (b) what  insiders  believe  makes  the  organization distinct from other organizations; and (c) what is  perceived  by  members  to  be  an  enduring quality of the organization.\n\nMelucci (1995) describes collective identity as a shared definition generated by a number  of  individuals.  This  collective  perception shapes communication models and interactions with outside groups. More recently Polletta and\n\nJasper (2001) defined collective identity as the cognitive,  moral,  and  emotional  connections individuals have with the practices of a broader community or institution.\n\nGroups  interpret  experiences  and  choose behaviors  that  are  intended  to  maintain  the continuity of self-generated self-concepts over time.  Self-concepts  are  also  maintained  by comparisons  with  others.  Groups  seek  positive differences between themselves and other groups as a way of enhancing their own self-esteem. Like individuals, they see themselves as distinct and act as if they are unique.\n\nBeliefs .  Beliefs  are  what  a  group  is  emotionally invested  in  based  on  assumptions and convictions regarding people, concepts, or things.  Groups  that  believe  they  are  effective (efficacy) act that way and actually are. Groups that feel powerless to influence decisions within the school  act  that  way.  Behaviors  driven by  beliefs  reinforce  beliefs  which  reinforce behaviors in an endless cycle. School communities who share a sense of collective efficacy provide students with instructional experiences that  contribute  to  higher  learning  than  school groups who do not share this belief. They are more effective and likely to be more effective (Hoy, Tarter, and Woolfolk-Hoy, 2006).\n\nValues. Values are about right and wrong, professional or unprofessional, good or bad and most often have a strong emotional component. 'We are all in this together,' 'Cultural differences are to be valued,' or 'Critical thinking is the most essential disposition for students,' are examples  of  values.  They  are  often  grounded in universal 'truths' like dignity, compassion, or independence.\n\nMental  Models. Mental  models  can  be conceived  as  'small-scale  models'  of  reality used  to  explain  how  things  work,  anticipate events, and to reason. Mental models are generally  founded  on  unquantifiable,  obscure,  or incomplete facts. As a result, all mental models  are  incomplete;  they  contain  distortions, deletions,  and  generalizations.  They  serve  as perception  filters,  interpreting  the  behavior  of all  people to 'see' what they want to. People\n\nmake decisions based on their mental models, not on objective reality.\n\n## Intervening at Deep Structures\n\nAll  linguistic  expressions  are  incomplete from  their  total  meaning.  'Atyaf  is  a  bright student' is incomplete in many ways. The word bright is  undefined. Also  undefined  is student . ' Is ,' might also bear elaboration as Mr. Clinton once  observed.  The  speaker,  often  below  conscious levels, has elaborate and detailed models for what is meant by the five words in the sentence. It is only in deep listening that the speaker can articulate meanings, beliefs, or values internally held. The greater the simplicity of a mental model, the less it represents things as they actually are. To become more effective, groups must refine and add the unstated complexity.\n\nResources for making explicit deep structure content largely rely on the skill sets related to the seven norms of collaboration. These are employed in dialogue posed around penetrating questions-'What might be some evidence we are growing in collective efficacy?'-and strategies like 'Card Sort' and 'Shuffle' or 'First Turn  Last  Turn'  found  under  the  discourse heading in appendix A.\n\n## Identity Interventions\n\nIdentity is not fixed, but rather it is a moving target according to neuroscientist Damasio (2010).  Group  development  approaches  that refine  collective  identity  include  constructing metaphors that expand senses of identity, and questions  designed  to  stimulate  reflection  at this  level  ('In  what  ways  are  we  a  teaching school and in what ways a learning school?'), and  meeting  practices  that  shift  the  spotlight from group members as information receivers to group members as constructors of meaning.\n\n## Beliefs and Values Interventions\n\nAsk groups to compare their espoused behavior to acted behaviors. They gain clarity and sharpen practice to more clearly align with their values.  Conduct  a  dialogue  on  group  values, then make a criteria matrix with group values on one side and program choices on the other. Conduct the 'Assumptions Wall' strategy described in  appendix A. In this activity, group members nonjudgmentally  illuminate  and  examine  their assumptions  about  sources,  rationale,  values, and consequences. This develops a greater understanding of the  presenting  issue  and  of  one another. Another way to challenge mental models  is  to  hold  a  values  challenge  seminar.  Best done in a retreat  setting,  this  is  a  conversation in  which  the  group's  core  values  are  identified and then tested against a variety of increasingly complex scenarios. Other options are the' Card Sort  and  Shuffle'  strategy,  'In  and  Out  of  the Frame,'  'Issues  Agenda,'  and  'Causal-Loop Diagram' (see appendix A).\n\n## Capabilities Interventions\n\nCapabilities are not described in the iceberg model,  but  inferred  in  mental  models,  and  are the metacognitive activities related to behaviors. To know one's intention and choose congruent behaviors is an example of a capability. Engage members in a study of the four group-member capabilities from chapter 4. To start, invite conscious  application  of  one  capability  at  a  time with periodic reflection and reports.\n\n## Improving Collective Effectiveness\n\nGroups cannot improve behaviors of which they are unaware. In this section we offer several  lenses  and  approaches  for  helping  group members to see themselves as a group. Group development  is  a  responsibility  shared  with each group member. Ultimately it is the group's group,  and  leaders  support  groups  in  owning the intentions and processes of improvement.\n\nAt least five intervention strategies can be used to illuminate and enhance the five energy sources: mediating, structuring, teaching, modeling, and monitoring.\n\n## Mediating\n\nMediating any of the five energy sources brings  them  into  view  for  groups  and  offers platforms for improvement. The intent of mediating is self-directed learning. To mediate is to shine  a  judgment-free  'flashlight'  on  internal or external data in order to lead to self-directed learning. While  invitational  questions  may  be the  initial  entry  into  an  energy  source,  other tools of mediation include many of the norms of collaboration. Mediation most often occurs in  relation  to  reflecting  on  prior  experiences, planning, or problem solving. Costa and Garmston  (2015)  offer  detailed  maps  for  how  to coach in these three dimensions.\n\nFigure  10.2  describes  behaviors  of  effective groups as they relate to each energy source. You  might  hear  members  posing  these  questions  to  themselves,  or  as  a  group  developer, you might ask similiar questions of groups.\n\n## Efficacy\n\n'How  might  we  focus  our  resources  to make the biggest difference?'\n\n'When are some times when our perseverance led to great success?'\n\n## Consciousness\n\n'Who are we?'\n\n'Why are we doing this?'\n\n## Flexibility\n\n'How might  we  incorporate  some  of  the diverse ideas on the table?'\n\n'What  other  perspectives  might  we  take on this?'\n\n## Craftsmanship\n\n'What parts  of  our  values  should  inform our criteria for deciding X?'\n\n'So  the  first  draft  is  good.  How  can  we make it better?'\n\n## Interdependence\n\n'Who might be some of our allies on this topic?'\n\n'What could we be doing to align our energies with team 6?'\n\n## Structuring\n\nTo  structure  is  to  manage  the  physical environment,  the  agenda,  the  tasks,  and  the grouping  of  participants  in  ways  designed  to promote certain levels of learning. This intervention acts on the level of environment in the Dilts model below. Stategically modifying the environment can increase the likelihood of extending capacities, perspectives, and behaviors related to any one of the energy sources. Some examples follow:\n\n- \u00b7 Arrange the room so that the visual focus of members is on a chart, not one another, during problem-solving conversations. This  helps  to  put  problems  'out  there' and not in the participants (flexibility and interdependence).\n- \u00b7 Use  the  Learning  Partners  strategy  (see appendix A) to break up cliques (flexibility and interdependence).\n- \u00b7 Use role diversity as a criterion for forming  subgroups.  On  a  school  site  council, for  example,  place  a  parent  within  each small cluster of teachers to list experiences on  a  topic.  One  typical  byproduct  is  a respect for one another's experiences that leads  to  universal  perceptions  of  being  a valued  member  of  the  group  and  being able  to  contribute  (flexibility,  interdependence, and efficacy).\n- \u00b7 Organize  the  agenda  so  that  subgroups work on specific tasks during the meeting (craftsmanship, efficacy).\n\n## Teaching\n\nThe intervention of teaching is best suited to behaviors and capabilities. When combined with  mediated  experiences,  exposition  and story  can  influence  learning  at  the  levels  of belief  system  and  identity.  Ultimately,  this form of intervention includes the entire repertoire  of  good  instruction:  assessing,  explaining, giving examples, scaffolding, practicing, reading, and so on.\n\nSelf-assessments  provide  a  starting  point for an adult learning experience. This notion is very much in line with the growing literature on  the  influence  of  formative  assessments  as guides  to  student  learning  (Stiggins,  2007). To  focus  on  specific  energy  sources,  group developers might share descriptions of the five energy sources and ask group members to share their  impressions  of  which  ones  are  strength areas and which ones are stretch areas for this group. These impressions are starting points for planning group growth goals.\n\nA group inventory has been developed by our colleagues Carolee Hayes and Jane Ellison. (See www.thinkingcollaborative.com/tc-apps/.)\n\n## Modeling\n\nLeaders and group members practice modeling when they display exemplars of specific skills (like paraphrasing)  or  complexes  of skills (like balancing inquiry and advocacy) in work settings with colleagues. Two refinements add  to  the  potency  of  modeling  as  a  learning device.  First  is  to  talk  out  loud  about  one's rationale in order to have metacognition about the particular behavior being modeled. Second is to practice public modeling, in which for example you announce to a group that in today's meeting you are going to work on improving your use of pausing. Reveal your reasons and ask the group members to be prepared to share their  perceptions  on  the  effectiveness  of  your application of the behavior.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nMonitoring  involves  collecting  data  on  a dynamic of interest to the group and reflecting on  how  this  informs  the  group  of  its  working patterns  and  how  the  group  might  improve  its effectiveness. A critical mindset is that the group is gathering and examining data to improve, not prove or judge, a level of performance. Groups may gather information on their use of the norms of collaboration, the degree of congruence with meeting standards, an assessment of the operating  energy  sources,  the  inclusion  of  members, the  value  placed  on  diverse  perspectives,  and other subjects that interest them.\n\nWe have learned that the use of a process observer, a member who gathers data on participant behaviors while the group is working, might  generate  more  negative  effects  than positive ones. A pattern of externally provided data will often lead a group toward a greater dependence  on  outside  assessment,  reduce the capacity for accurate self-assessment, and diminish the capacity for self-directed learning.  Work  with  both  students  and  adults  has confirmed this (Sanford, 1995). Observers can effectively support learning when they follow a pattern in which the data are displayed without interpretation and the group is invited to interpret it.\n\nA  strategy  that  employs  both  monitoring and  mediation  involves  asking  two  questions of  group members for their private reflection: 'What  are  some  of  the  decisions  you  made about when and how to participate in the preceding conversation?' and 'What are some of the influences of your decisions on yourself and others?'/  'How  did  your  decisions  influence yourselves and others?' After silent reflection, the  members  might  write  a  response,  share and interact with a neighbor, or practice a full round-robin reflection.\n\nExpert groups are more likely than novice groups  to  be  reflective.  The  more  reflection, the greater the learning from experience. Nonreflection  dooms  a  group  to  repeat  the  same behaviors over and over, regardless of whether they are producing desired results.\n\nEvery  working  group  has  far  more  task than time. This contributes to a natural reluctance  to  use  any  precious  time  to  monitor  or reflect on the group's working processes. Some groups  resolve  this  tension  by  committing themselves to  a  task-process  ratio. They  budget  a  certain  portion  of  each  meeting  to  their own learning, exploring how well the group is working and what it might do to improve.\n\n## A Second Intervention Model\n\nIn  a  quantum  world,  everything  influences  everything  else.  Anthropologist  and cyberneticist  Gregory  Bateson  was  fond  of saying that all beings exist within holonomous systems. That is, each person is part of several greater systems (e.g., families, teams, schools) yet maintains a unique identity and palette of choices, both as an independent agent and as the  member  of  a  group.  Each  system  influences the individual, and, to a lesser degree, the  individual  influences  the  system.  Based on work by Bateson and conceived by Robert Dilts (1994, 1996), this model shows identity as  influencing  all  other  aspects  of  learning. Dilts  describes  four  operating  principles  in this model:\n\n- 1. Any  system  (of  activity)  is  a  subsystem embedded  inside  another  system.  Each system is also embedded in an even larger system.\n- 2. Learning  occurs  in  each  subsystem  in  a manner  specifically  related  to  that  subsystem.\n- 3. Learning at each level organizies and controls the information on levels below.\n- 4. Learning something on an upper level will change things on lower levels, but learning something on a lower level might or might not influence the levels above it.\n\nDilts borrowed the 'levels' metaphor from Bateston's  work  on  learning  to  learn  and  assumed learning as cascading from one level to the ones below. He identified the levels as follows: identity; beliefs and values, capabilities; behaviors; and environment. We have applied this model to our work with groups for over a decade and found great value in using it as an intervention  model,  not  only  with  groups  but with  individuals.  Today  our  agreement  with Dilts  is  that  identity  influences  all  the  other elements.  However,  based  on  our  continuing learning  about  complex  systems,  our  examination  of  Bateson's  work,  and  critiques  of the  Dilts  model  we  are  replacing  the  'levels'\n\nmetaphor in our thinking with something more congruent  with  our  knowledge  of  complex systems and holons, refering to the Dilt's levels, instead, as domains (Armour 2015; Tosey 2006; and Dilts 1994, 2003, 2014).\n\nIn  Garmston's  view  (figure  2.3)  of  the  elements  of  learning,  we  see  the  elements  as dynamical in which everything affects everything else. Yet there are two dominant players within this system. Identity, we believe, is the major  influence  on  all  the  elements  within the  system,  informing  beliefs,  values,  capabilities, and behavior. Next, environment can modify the expressions of  identity.  To  show this idea, we have placed environment as the surround  and  note  that  one's  environment has  a  modifying  effect  on  the  expression  of beliefs,  values,  capabilities,  and  behaviors. Changing the environment-say, from one in which mediation is a primary leadership activity to one in which command and control is more common-modifies not only behaviors but also the potential for learning. (Costa and Garmston, 2015)\n\nOur thinking is influenced by Arthur Koestler's  (1972)  introduction  of  holons.  A  holon is a system in which everything is at the same time  a  part  of  something  else  and  a  whole  in and of itself. In this view a school is a whole and  simultaneously  part  of  a  district.  The district  also  is  part  of  a  larger  system. Wilber (2001)  extended  this  idea  by  introducing  the concept of 'holorchies,'  which  are  hierachies of holons.\n\nDilts held that the levels are embedded in one  another  and  called  them  nested  levels  of learning. In his view each level is more abstract than the next and has a greater degree of impact on the individual or group. We agree with Dilts that  identity  is  the  most  influential  of  all  the domains in this model.\n\nFrom  the  psychological  point  of  view  there seem  to  be  five  levels  that  you  work  with most  often.  (1)  The  basic  domain  is  your environment,  your  external  constraints.  (2) You  operate  on  that  environment  through\n\nyour behavior. (3) Your behavior is guided by your mental maps and strategies, which define your  capabilities.  (4)  These  capabilities  are organized by belief systems. . . . (5) Beliefs are organized by identity. (Dilts, 1994, p. 1)\n\nInstead of levels, our view is that each domain interacts with each of the others.\n\nIn  our  current  practices,  we  are  finding  it useful  to  regard  Dilts's  model  not  as  a  hierarchical,  linear  map  that  assumes  clocklike operation in which the same inputs will consistently produce the same result. Rather, we are seeing it as describing a complex system made of many moving parts operating within environmental  systems  that  are  constantly changing.  Complex  systems  are  those  in which everything affects everything else, tiny inputs  cause  major  disturbances,  more  data are  not  a  greater  predicator  of  results,  and both things and energy matter. (Costa, Garmston, Ellison, and Hayes, 2015a, p. 31)\n\nFigure  10.3  below  shows  the  Dilts  elements  as  conceptualized  by  Garmston  as operating  within  a  dynamical  system  (Costa, Garmston, Ellison, and Hayes, 2015b p. 33).\n\nTwo factors in figure 10.3 have the greatest influence  on  group  development:  identity  and environment.  Identity,  as  in  the  Dilts  model,\n\nFigure 10.3. Identity Influencing Systems. Graphic Credits: Kendall Zolller. Foresthill, California. Sierra Training Associates, Inc.\n\ninfluences all elements within a system except environment.  Equally  important,  environment can  modify  the expressions of  identity.  We have  witnessed  work  cultures  transitioning from  authoritarian  structures  to  collaborative settings modifying not only behaviors, but also potentials for learning.\n\nCollective  shifts  in  identity,  we  believe, primarily occur through experiences rich enough to rattle mental models if opportunities are  provided  for  extensive  reflection. A  community coming together to support one another in response to a tragedy comes to mind. Disruptive events like labor conflicts can also create profound  identity  shifts  for  several  parts  of  a school community. More hopefully, processes that challenge or examine assumptions, beliefs, or  values-processes  similar  to  the  two-hour identity intervention described on page 146can also be effective.\n\n## How to Work with Dilts\n\nHere we offer a few perhaps overly simple ideas  for  seeking  change  through  elements  of the  Dilts  model-identity,  beliefs/values,  capabilities,  behaviors,  and  environment.  Keep in  mind  that  these  elements  interact  with  one another  and  additional  elements  in  complex systems.  The  image  opposite  shows  the  front office  'environment'  of  the  Creative  Science K-8 School  in  Portland,  Oregon. As  one  can imagine, this  open  office  environment  evokes reactions  of  openness  rather  than  barriers, friendliness  rather  than  distance,  and  partnership rather than authority.\n\nKate  Bennett,  the  CSS  Principal's  Secretary,  noticed  that  the  original  layout  of  the front office created  confusion  and  tension. The  solid  U-shaped  counter  was  a  barrier  to communication. Adults were uncertain how to communicate with staff, with some waiting behind the counter to interact while others walked around  it.  In  addition,  students  were  required to  record  tardiness  on  a  sheet  that  resided  on this high counter. Approaching it with the staff on the other side, left students feeling scolded.\n\nFigure 10.3. How to Work with Dilts.

Collaboratively, the three worked to redesign the environment, creating a child-friendly sign-in/out area in an alcove in the process.\n\n## Identity\n\nRecently we worked with an international school  struggling  with  a  persistent  problem of too many initiatives. Using a concept from Kristine Quade (2015), we met with the Head\n\nof  School's  cabinet  in  a  small  room  with  lots of  wall  space  on  which  to  write.  Here  is  the process we used.\n\n- 1. Individuals listed myths people have about their group; this is the container in which they work and in some ways contributes to the identity they work from.\n- 2. Pairs  worked  on  four  flip  charts  about their responsibilities, purposes,  culture, and resources .\n- 3. The  full  group  made  refinements  and achieved agreement.\n- 4. The group was asked, 'Given all this, who are  you?'  and  a  list  of  ideas  was  brainstormed,  then  summarized  into  one  tight statement.\n- 5. The  group  was  asked,  'What  needs  to happen  next?'  Following  the  admonition in  chapter  8,  we  asked  who  will  do  what by  when  and  four  specific  action  steps were  identified.  The  group's  identity  was reshaped into that of a proactive leadership team.\n\n## Beliefs/Values\n\nThe  'Card  Stack  and  Shuffle'  and  'Assumptions Wall' strategies in appendix A both require participants to examine beliefs and assumptions. Groups must articulate beliefs and values  in  order  to  examine  them.  These  two strategies  and  asking  groups  to  compare  their espoused and actual beliefs take members into this territory.\n\n## Capabilities\n\nHave  members  read  about  group  member  capabilities  described  in  chapter  4.  With others,  ask  them  to  identify  which  are  most important  and  how  they  will  remember  to employ  them.  Periodically  pose  the  self-reflective question, 'What decisions did I make about how and when to participate in that conversation and what effect did those decisions have on me and others?'\n\n## Behaviors\n\nConsistent with the Dilts model engaging persons in examining capabilities improves the related  behaviors.  The  'What  decisions  did  I make?'  question  above  is  one  form. Another is  to  invite  members  to  describe  the  mental processes  involved  in  a  behavior.  Participants that identify metacognitive processes refine the behaviors driven by those processes.\n\n## Environment\n\nWilliam  Isaacs  (1999)  tells  a  story  of presenting to a group of Silicon Valley executives. After the presentation, instead of having a  question  and  answer  period,  he  suggested the  twenty-five  people  put  their  chairs  in  a circle  and  say  whatever  thoughts  or  feelings were present at the time, a common activity in dialogue. The first few made some comments and then one man said this reminded him of a camping trip  with  his  two  sons  when  he  was not sure how they were experiencing the event. From  that  point  forward,  each  person  told  a story of heart and meaning. Educators too, influence behaviors and emotions through similar environmental  changes.  As  another  example, the  third  point  strategy  in  appendix A  directs disagreements  to  topics  rather  than  persons. Most  importantly,  however  is  affecting  the emotional environment by the form of leadership one employs.\n\nThe  next  chapter  describes  ways  teams proactively  seek  and  explore  potential  challenges to student learning.\n\n## Chapter 11  Facilitating Data Teams\n\nD ata have no meaning. Meaning emerges from collective sense-making by well-structured and skillfully facilitated collaborative groups. Working with data to improve practices and student learning outcomes is a common expectation for grade-level teams, departments, Professional Learning Communities (PLCs), and school leadership teams. Yet, many groups struggle with  this  essential  task.  Relational  tensions,  feelings  of  vulnerability  and  the cognitive demands of collective analysis, problem finding, and action planning often  overwhelm  groups.  Given  these  pressures  many  groups  stumble  toward the quick fix for the poorly defined dilemmas in front of them. Groups operating in this fashion lurch from problem to program, slapping remedial bandages on issues and concerns.\n\nThoughtfully  applying  many  of  the  concepts,  tools,  and  ideas  that  precede  this  chapter  helps  groups  avoid  the  pitfalls  mentioned above.  Seeing  the  system  that  is  producing learning  gaps  or  behavioral  issues  (chapters 1,  2,  and  9),  developing  group  member  capabilities, norms of collaboration, and two ways of  talking  (chapters  3  and  4),  and  conducting well-designed  and  skillfully  facilitated  meetings  (chapters  5,  6,  and  7)  all  contribute  to better run and more satisfying data team work. In  this  chapter  we  will  add  specific  protocols for structuring data-based collaborative inquiry along with tips and tools for facilitating these processes. Collective efficacy (chapter 10) increases  when  groups  learn  to  manage  their external and internal challenges as they come to trust the process and one another.\n\nDistricts, schools, and teams have to learn how to improve. This requires looking deeply at  the  systems  that  are  producing  any  performance  gaps  that  are  of  concern  to  staff  and community  members.  Anthony  Bryk  and  his colleagues  (2015)  offer  three  core  improvement questions:\n\n- 1. What  specific  problem  are  we  trying  to solve?\n- 2. What  changes  might  we  introduce  and why?\n- 3. How will  we  know  whether  the  changes are actually improvements?\n\nProblem finding is an essential capacity for data teams. Two potential pathways guide teams in this endeavor. One is to start with an issue or concern expressed by some group or other member of the school community and frame this topic in wording that leads to purposeful data gathering. The other approach is to start with available data and query it for the stories they might tell. Both pathways are equally productive.\n\n## Starting with an issue or concern\n\nProblem  finding  exercises  sometimes  develop  into  'Reality  Wars'  (Lipton  and  Well-\n\nman,  2012).  These  occur  when  participants have conflicting mental maps of their worlds. These  maps  influence  what  we  see,  how  we see,  and  how  we  interpret  information  in  our environment.  Since  all  data  are  subject  to interpretation,  the  same  information  that  engages some group members may be dismissed, diminished, or denied by others depending on their frames of reference.\n\nStarting  with  an  issue  calls  for  careful framing.  This  requires  skillful  facilitation  and thoughtful  process  design.  Public  recording (chapter 6) is a vital part of the process. There are three basic ways of framing an issue (Lipton and Wellman, 2012). These are (1) constructing a problem statement; (2) crafting an inquiry; and (3) generating a hypothesis. The context, group resourcefulness,  and  the  nature  of  the  specific issue at hand are some of the factors that influence the final choice of the problem frame. It is important that the facilitator avoid imposing his or her preferred frame on the group.\n\n## Constructing a problem statement\n\nConstructing  shared  problem  definitions is crucial to success. The patterns of both dialogue and discussion support groups in generating and honing thoughtful problem statements. Without  these  processes  problem  definitions can be challenging to develop. Completing the stem 'The problem is________' seems deceptively simple on the surface, but in reality this requires precise thinking and attention to specificity in language. We've had the experience, on  more  than  one  occasion,  of  spending  forty-five minutes to an hour helping groups sort through their perspectives and coalesce around a statement that all could agree to. This is time well spent since the problem statement greatly influences the data quest. There is a significant difference between 'The problem is that many students  are  floundering  when  presented  with nonfiction texts in the content areas.' And 'The problem is that many of our students lack the technical reading skills for comprehending and analyzing nonfiction texts in the content areas.' The first problem statement leads the group to focusing on student performance in the content area. The second problem statement leads to an exploration  of  the  specific  skills  that  students need for grappling with the assigned texts and to the teaching repertoire teachers need to learn to develop these skills. It might also lead to an exploration of successful students and the ways in  which  they  have  acquired  these  essential reading skills.\n\n## Crafting an Inquiry\n\nFraming  concerns,  anecdotes,  and  observations as inquiries opens thinking and widens the  potential  solution  set.  The  trick  here  is  to avoid  either/or  thinking  and  craft  open-ended questions  that  have  multiple  appropriate  answers. A variety of question-generating strategies might be used (see appendix A for examples).  Some  typical  questions  include:  'What are some essential differences between . . . and . . . ?' 'How are we doing with . . . ?' 'What are some of the reasons for . . . ?' and 'What are the most productive ways to . . . ?' In the reading example shared above, a driving question might be, 'What are the essential reading skills that students need to successfully engage with content reading?'\n\n## Generating a Hypothesis\n\nAnecdotes and observations often lead to proposals for solutions. In the worst cases, this develops into a competition between advocates causing  group  members  to  struggle  with  one another  in  unproductive  conversations.  Framing  these  proposed  solutions  as  hypotheses opens pathways to problem solving. The very construction  and  labeling  of  these  ideas  as hypotheses often reduces tension in the group and invites group members to embrace a spirit of inquiry and discovery. Hypotheses typically follow  an  if/then  format.  In  our  example  this might sound like, 'If we directly taught reading comprehension and textual analysis skills in the content areas then more students would master the course material.'\n\nMany groups find that framing their issues with all three approaches is helpful. By crafting inquiries  and  generating  hypotheses  they  frequently discover that they need to refine their problem statement. Also, offering a group three different ways of framing an issue offers choice that  leads  to  greater  ownership  and  deeper commitment to problem solving\n\n## Starting with the Data\n\nStarting with the data requires a thoughtful survey of the hard and soft data available in the school  (James-Ward  et  al.,  2013).  (See  table 11.1 for examples of hard and soft data.) Hard data are data that are quantifiable and expressed in numbers and percentages. These data types lend themselves to statistical analysis. Soft data are  qualitative  and  anecdotal  resulting  from surveys, questionnaires, and observations. The goal is to gather relevant information to triangulate  the  issues  of  concern.  Once  sufficient data  have  been  gathered,  groups  search  for patterns of both strengths and needs. This leads to  developing  theories  of  causation  and  when these are confirmed, clarified, or disconfirmed the group can then move on to crafting theories of action and action planning. The Collaborative  Learning  Cycle described  next  elaborates specific steps in this process.\n\nProductive  data-driven  inquiry  requires structure  and  attention  to  process.  'Thoughtfully  designed  processes  increase  focus,  minimize distractions, and deepen exploration and analysis of data' (Lipton and Wellman, 2012). Group members that lack process attention and process  monitoring  habits  get  lost  in  storytelling,  side-talk,  and  jump  quickly  to  selling solutions to one another.\n\nThe Collaborative  Learning  Cycle establishes  a  forum  for  collective  exploration of  data.  By  embracing  a  learning  orientation within carefully applied protocols, group members engage in collaborative inquiry that leads to  problem  finding,  problem-solving  and  focused planning for action.\n\nEach phase of the Collaborative Learning Cycle is driven by questions that organize and direct  specific  cognitive  processes.  The  first phase,  'Activating  and  Engaging'  surfaces prior experiences, background knowledge, and frames  of  reference  for  thinking  about  the issues  at  hand.  The  second  phase,  'Exploring  and  Discovering'  structures  the  group's inquiry  into  the  data  in  a  search  for  pop-outs and patterns that will then influence the search for deeper causations. The third phase, 'Organizing and Integrating' is a two-stage process with an initial drafting of theories of causation and a search for confirming and clarifying data.\n\nTable 11.1 . Examples of Types of Data\n\n| Hard Data-Quantifiable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Soft Data-Qualitative                                                                                         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Norm referenced assessments Criterion referenced assessments Demographic data Special education population and referrals Students receiving special services Attendance data Class size data Program enrollments Suspension and expulsion data Graduation rates | Surveys Interviews Opinion polls Observations Portfolios Exhibitions Artifacts Bulletins Agendas Report cards |\n\n## The Collaborative Learning Cycle\n\n## Structuring Dialogue for Connection Making\n\nFigure 11.1 . The Collaborative Learning Cycle Used with permission of MiraVia LLC\n\nWhen the group is confident it is on the right track  they  move  to  the  final  stage  of  drafting theories  of  action  and  identifying  processes, plans, goals, and monitoring systems for moving ahead. Continuous improvement is a cyclical  process  so  as  new  data  emerge  the  group then applies the Collaborative Learning Cycle to this information.\n\n## Phase 1: Activating and Engaging\n\nA  central  intention  of  the Collaborative Learning Cycle is to develop a stance of shared curiosity  that  avoids  premature  certainty  and locking  in  on  the  first  proposed  course  of action.  This  initial  phase,  Activating  and  Engaging,  sets  the  scene  for  exploring  the  data without the data being present. It starts with dialogue about what group members predict that data will look like and a sharing of assumptions about  why  people  think  these  predictions  are likely.  The  norms  of  collaboration  (chapter 4)  are  a  vital  resource  during  this  phase.  The goal  is  to  establish  conditions  of  low  threat and  full  participation  so  that  all  group  members  feel  free  to  contribute  their  thinking  and ideas. When done well, this creates conditions of  psychological  safety  for  group  members, especially if they are uncertain about the content, the data, or the group processes of inquiry. Psychological  safety  ultimately  means  that individuals feel safe enough not to know in the presence of their peers.\n\nWhen the data to be explored will be presented as tables of graphs the facilitator offers blank copies of the graphic forms upon which to  record  predictions.  These  predictions  are what  people  think  the  data  will  look  likespecifically  how  high  the  bars  on  the  graph will  reach  for  specific  standards  or  specific subgroups or what data they think will appear in the cells of the table. As predictions emerge, the facilitator pushes group members to name the  assumptions  that  are  informing  these  predictions.  Working  with  the  blank  templates also orients group members to the actual data displays they will be working with during the next  phase.  At  times,  group  members  have similar  predictions  and  different  assumptions. At  other  times,  group  members  have  similar assumptions but varying predictions based on those same assumptions.\n\nIndividuals  surface  their  frames  of  reference  by  articulating  their  predictions  and assumptions.  These  interactions  help  group members to better understand the mental models that are guiding the teaching practices and instructional thinking of their colleagues.\n\nDistinguishing  between  assumptions  and predictions is difficult for some group members and it can take up to three experiences with the Collaborative  Learning  Cycle for  participants to appreciate the value and importance of this phase. For example, a team member might say, 'My prediction is that there will be a 40 percent difference  on  the  writing  assessment  between the  girls  and  the  boys.  This  is  driven  by  my assumption  that  the  girls  are  better  readers than  the  boys  which  shows  in  their  writing.' Activating  and  Engaging  provides  the  safety of  dialogue to encourage participation in data tasks that might be intimidating for some group members. This phase fans the flame of curiosity so that group members want to look at the data and are ready to do so knowing in advance how their  colleagues  are  thinking  about  the  issues involved in a specific inquiry cycle.\n\n## Facilitation Tips for Success\n\n- \u00b7 Listen  for  ways  that  group  members  are distinguishing between predictions and assumptions. Paraphrase and label predictions as they occur and inquire for the underlying assumptions if they are not provided. Paraphrase  and  label  assumptions  and  inquire for  the  specific  predictions  that  these  assumptions might produce in the data.\n- \u00b7 Use  public  recording  to  capture  predictions and their related assumptions for all to  see.  Use  separate  recording  sheets  or charts for this purpose.\n- \u00b7 Publicly record predictions on a facsimile of  the  data  display.  Use  a  graph  or  chart that  reflects  the  actual  format  of  the  data display. This serves as an advanced orga-\n\n- nizer and orients the group for viewing the data at the next phase.\n- \u00b7 Record more than one set of predictions and their  related  assumptions. The  goal  during this  phase  is  to  seek  to  understand,  not  to persuade. When members struggle for consensus or think they need consensus, group work  bogs  down.  Recording  the  diversity of predictions increases curiosity, especially when the facilitator encourages clarification of the different driving assumptions that are informing the predictions.\n\n## Phase 2: Exploring and Discovering\n\nThis  phase  is  the  heart  of  collaborative inquiry. Productive Exploring and Discovering require collective focus, discipline, and group members who are as interested in the observations of others as they are in their own observations. The goal is to create a shared learning experience in which group members can learn from the data and from one another. In many ways  this  is  a  special  form  of  dialogue  with data at the center.\n\nSkillful facilitators promote  a  spirit  of purposeful  uncertainty  during  this  phase.  The goal  here  is  to  help  group  members  remain open  to  possibilities  and  multiple  viewpoints. By  exploring  several  storylines  in  the  data, group  members  discover  patterns  and  trends that might otherwise remain hidden from view. Cognitively, this is the phase of observing, noticing, distinguishing, sorting, comparing, and contrasting.\n\nManaging  working  group  size  is  an  important  consideration.  Group  sizes  of  three  to four work best. Each data team needs a shared data  display  and  recording  materials.  This is  an  essential  third  point  for  structuring  the exploration  (see  chapter  4).  The  data  display establishes the third point with group members and the facilitator forming the other two points. When  working  groups  are  too  large,  participants may disengage; this occurs when the data display is difficult to see or there are too many voices in the crowd for shyer members to cut through. An additional barrier to success in this phase occurs when there is too much data present. This  leads  to  overload  and  fragmentation of group energy.\n\n## Facilitation Tips for Success\n\n- \u00b7 Provide time to orient to the data displays before  encouraging  group  members  to share  their  initial  observations.  Two  to three minutes of silence allows individual group  members  to  orient  to  the  data  displays and provides a space for the varying processing  needs  of  individuals  in  the group.  This  leads  to  fuller  participation and  increased  confidence  on  the  part  of group  members. This  is  especially  so  for the 'data shy.' The purposeful pause also slows  down  the  'data  enthusiasts'  who may  inhibit  or  intimidate  others  in  the group. One way to do this is to provide individual thinking and writing time before people start talking to ensure opportunity for each group member.\n- \u00b7 Propose a sequence for exploring the data and designate a starting point. Agreement on  initial  talking  points  saves  time  and energy and establishes focus. This is especially important when multiple data sets or complex displays are on view.\n- \u00b7 Apply structures and protocols to balance participation. Structuring group work increases engagement, increases focus, and increases  time  efficiency.  Some  possible group  member  roles  include:  recorder, process  checker,  materials  manager,  and timekeeper.\n- \u00b7 Use  public  recording.  Create  common charts or recording space for observations. Keep  a  separate  chart  for  questions  or comments that are 'outside the phase.' For example,  should  conclusions  or  explanations emerge, it is helpful to record them and set these aside, rather than debate them in that moment. This recording and setting\n\n- aside process is also effective for questions that are not directly relevant to the data.\n- \u00b7 Chart  observations  in  language  that  is concise, specific, and quantified. Each observation statement should communicate a single idea clearly and numerically. These statements  should  focus  only  on  observable  facts  contained  in  the  data  without interpretation or inference. Less and more, greater than, and smaller than are concepts. Quantifying these observations reveals the magnitude  of  differences.  Using  relevant data  terminology,  such  as  mean,  median, mode, range, and distribution increases the precision of observations.\n\n## Phase 3: Organizing and Integrating\n\nThe  third  phase  of  the Collaborative Learning  Cycle  Organizing  and  Integrating guides the transition to formal problem finding  and  problem  solving  that  establishes  a foundation  for  thoughtful  and  detailed  planning processes. During this phase, the group makes the transition from dialogue to discussion to decision making.\n\nThis  phase  is  divided  into  two  stages: causation and action. Here the facilitator guides the group in the transition from observing to understanding and then to action planning. During the  causal  stage  of  thinking,  group  members generate  multiple  interpretations  for  why  the data  look  the  way  they  do.  Generating  these theories  of  causation  and  then  deciding  on  the most likely avenues of inquiry marks the transition  from  dialogue  to  discussion.  Here  again skillful application for the Norms of Collaboration (chapter 4) supports the group in this quest. Paraphrasing and posing questions for specificity are especially important during this process.\n\nIssues  tend  to  fall  within  one  or  more  of five  causal  categories  (Lipton  and  Wellman, 2012). These are:\n\n- 1. Curriculum: The design and implementation of units of study.\n- 2. Instruction:  Teaching  methods  and  materials.\n- 3. Teachers:  Knowledge,  skills,  and  dispositions.\n- 4. Students:  Knowledge,  skills,  and  dispositions.\n- 5. Infrastructure:  Schedules,  programming, space, and resources.\n\nMost data sets are incomplete and do not tell the full story. This stage of the Organizing and  Integrating phase  includes  the  collection of additional data that may be indicated by the theories  of  causation  that  emerge.  By  using these new data to confirm, disconfirm, or clarify the selected causal theories, group members increase  their understanding  of  the  deeper causal  factors  underlying  the  issue  they  are exploring. This increases confidence and commitment to any ultimate implementation plans.\n\nWhen groups have sufficient confirming or clarifying data they then make the shift to developing theories of action. This stage embeds the use of skillful discussion and decision-making language tools and protocols. 'Theories of action  lead  to  problem-solving,  planning  and action  research  guided  by  the  ongoing  use  of formal and informal data, thus continuing the learning cycle started by a given round of data-driven collaborative inquiry' (Wellman and Lipton, 2004, p. 49).\n\nConfident  facilitation  of  the  Organizing and  Integrating  phase  of  the Collaborative Learning  Cycle helps  groups  own  their  challenges  and  increases  collective  responsibility for  student  learning.  Effective  plans  require specific outcomes, clear criteria for measuring progress  and  success,  necessary  action  steps, monitoring strategies for determining progress and goal achievement, assignment of responsibilities, and projected timelines.\n\n## PART V\n\n## CONFLICT, CHANGE, AND COMMUNITY\n\nLeadership is a function, not a role. Adaptive  leaders  orchestrate  conflict  by  initiating conversations  about  hard  to  talk  about  topics central  to  student  success.  Conflict  is  'good' when it centers on ideas, values, and ways of doing things. It is 'bad' when it swims in seas of  emotion,  distrust,  and  personalization.  We present  practical  tools  for  dealing  constructively  with  conflict,  offer  ways  of  insulating yourself  from  negative  energies,  and  suggest methods for teaching staffs and teams ways to disagree with grace and respect.\n\nThis  section  frames  six  capacities  for  organizational development and six capacities for professional development as lenses for analysis and intervention. We also explore ways to address wicked problems-those that seem to be ongoing,  complex,  and  for  which  there  seem to be no easy, or in some cases good, answers. Finally, we return to the finding that interaction among  teachers  and  administrators  that  focus on  student  learning  makes  large  and  measurable  differences  in  student  achievement  and reveals  practical  methods  for  energizing  and supporting such communities.\n\nAnd in conclusion, we note that community  does  not  last  forever.  Yet  communities do recover, clarify values, and reengage in the quest for continuing student improvement. We close  with  a  metaphor  intended  to  help  each group find their own beat, their own rhythm in the continuing quest for joy in serving others.\n\n## Chapter 12  Constructive Conflict\n\nC have led us to this point. Getting the right work done and learning to fight onflict and collaboration are two faces of community. Previous chapters gracefully about important things require the capabilities, skills, and tools described earlier in this sourcebook. This chapter offers frames, approaches, and additional tools for seeing and using conflict as a resource for group and personal development. We describe the workings of conflict in complex nonlinear systems such as schools, and present ways to increase your conflict quotient (CQ) and learn to see and avoid energy traps.\n\nAs the current generation of teachers and administrators struggles with the cultural shift from working in isolation with norms of autonomy and independence to working in more collaborative  ways,  conflicts  are  inevitable. The most important of these are values conflicts,  engagement  in  hearing  views  different from  one's  own,  exploring  what  a  cocreated future  might  look  like,  and  facing  difficult truths  about  current  situations.  Obstacles  for such  work  include  conviviality  and  surface harmony  that  mask  underlying  tensions  and differences about the purposes and processes of  learning  and  teaching.  Amplifying  these differences  are  accountability  pressures,  sophisticated  data  management  systems,  and rewards  for  student  performance  (Newman, King, and Rigdon, 1997).\n\nIndividuals approach conflict informed by personal history, and the culture in which they work.  Four  orientations  are  common:  being passive, aggressive, passive-aggressive, or assertive.  Only  the  last  is  healthy  and  effective for individuals,  families,  and  organizations. The passive individual avoids conflict. It is not surprising  that  fear  and  resentment  might  be a  part  of  this  person's  internal  world.  Passive persons accommodate others, placing their own interests  last.  In  aggressive  approaches,  however personal desires are placed above those of others.  Persons  acting  aggressively  often  express and stimulate intense emotion in others: sometimes striking out, blaming, belittling, or boisterously demanding their own way.\n\nOf  the  four  approaches,  the  passive-aggressive  is  the  most  destructive.  This  person throws a rock through your window, then hides the hand that threw it, as if to say, 'Who me?' This  person  uses  negative  presuppositions, 'Even  a  department  head  should  know  that,' leaving the other wounded while not being sure what produced the injury.\n\nFinally, the assertive person is clear about personal  outcomes,  personal  boundaries,  and the right to protect his or her values and self. This  person  engages  others  with  a  nondefensive attitude, verbally confident responses, and is open to collaboration. Clinical-experimental psychologist  Manuel  Smith's  (1975)  seminal book  on  assertiveness  included  theory  and learnable phrases for a range of situations and is  still  a  valuable  resource  today.  The  seven norms  of  collaboration  provide  assertive  language patterns.\n\nWhat  are  your own  tendencies?  Are you  most  likely  to  be  passive,  aggressive,\n\npassive-aggressive,  or  assertive?  In  a  study of  workplace  culture,  Ames  and  Wazlawek (2015) found that we might not perceive ourselves as others do. Test your own perceptions by  gathering  anonymous  assessments  from peers and colleagues.\n\nConflict  within  groups  is  made  messy because  often  each  of  the  four  orientations is  simultaneously  present.  Additionally,  how groups work with and learn from their conflicts is related to their work culture and says much about who they are and who they wish to be. Betty Achinstein (2002) notes the following:\n\nCommunities that can productively engage in conflict have a greater potential for continual growth  and  renewal.  Conflict  is  a  critical factor  in  understanding  what  distinguishes  a generic  professional  community  of  teacher colleagues  from  a  learning  community  engaged in ongoing inquiry and change. (p. 11)\n\nFour types of information are needed to be at  your  most  effective  in  situations  with  conflict: (a) understanding self; (b) understanding of trust; (c) understanding conflict, its dynamics,  its  dangers,  and  its  opportunities;  and  (d) knowledge  of  a  variety  of  conflict  tools  and ways to use them skillfully.\n\nThe sequence in which you will want this information  depends  on  your  learning  style (abstract or concrete), urgency (are you thinking about conflict in general, or are you in the middle  of  one),  and  personal  history.  If  you have an immediate need for learning new tools, move  ahead  to  the  section  '10  Energy  Traps and the related tools.' If you aren't hurting at the moment, begin here searching for personal descriptions and read on.\n\n## Understanding Self\n\n'The  challenging  internal  work  of  facilitation'  (and  we  would  add  being  an  adaptive educator)  Roger  Schwarz  (2002)  reminds  us, 'is to identity and explore the core values and assumptions that guide your actions, to rigorously reflect on how they increase or decrease your effectiveness and to develop a new set of values and assumptions that you can use to increase your effectiveness and that of the groups you work with' (p. 66).\n\nIn  the  spirit  of  reflection,  you  might  ask what  is  your  pattern  of  explaining  things  to yourself?  Seligman  (2006)  notes  that  people have  explanatory  styles  that  can  lead  them  to pessimism or optimism and that with awareness and attention they can change these orientations. What  are  your  own  patterns?  In  general,  we create what we perceive, which, in turn mirrors back to us what we see. Disaster is occasionally in  the  eye  of  the  beholder.  School  yourself  to positively  presume  the  intentions  of  others. Remember that in doing so, you don't need to know why the  other  person is choosing certain behaviors, just be willing to believe that in some way this person is taking care of themselves.\n\nThe  seventh  norm,  presuming  positive intentions,  is  a  matter  of  respect  for  others. Its Latin  origin, respecere , means  to  look again, highlighting the active nature of respect. 'Where once we saw one aspect of a person,' explains  William  Isaacs,  'we  look  again  and realize  how  much  of  them  we  had  missed' (1999, p. 111).\n\nWhat do you anticipate from others? Expectations of others often become a self-fulfilling prophecy. One's perceptions, assumptions, and expectations have a lot to do with the presence or absence of affective conflict.\n\n## Be the Best You\n\nThe  best  of  who  you  are  comes  from overcoming  your  biology  and  taking  action based  on  self-examination.  Adaptive  leaders are 'open to their own growth and learning that eventually infuse larger change efforts' (Senge, Hamilton, and Kania, 2015, p. 29). The human brain is guided by an overarching survival principle. So, its job is to classify the world around us  into  two  categories:  those  that  hurt  you  or help you to stay alive (Rock, 2009).\n\nGiven  the  self-protective  drive  for  survival, without conscious awareness, our brains\n\n- What might be some of the assumptions you tend to hold about people in general?\n- In what ways are the conclusions that you reach with regard to people in general based on the accurate processing of as much observable data as possible?\n- What beliefs do you hold about the goodness of people?\n- What are your beliefs about positive intentions; in even those situations that struggle to understand? you\n- What are your beliefs about the proposition that any person is acting in a way that is guided by some degree of positive intent, from that individuals of view? point\n\n(Ravlin &amp; Prickett 2014)\n\nFigure 12.1.\n\nautomatically  process  all  new  input  for  both physical  and  emotional  risk.  The  brain's  reticular  activating  system  (RAS)  automatically controls whether the cerebral cortex (thinking) or the limbic system (feeling) acts on the new input. As perceived risk or threat rises, the RAS routes input to the limbic system, the home of our freeze, flee, fight, or befriend responses. On the  other  hand,  when  risk  and  threat  are  low and new input offers challenge, the RAS activates the prefrontal cortex, where our resourcefulness as data analyzers and decision makers is at its maximum. During the Pleistocene era, frequent  and  dramatic  environmental  changes occurred, requiring humans to be adaptive and wary  within  their  environment.  Our  inherited brain  has  a  hard-wired  defensive  orientation, which  first  presumes  negative  intentions.  The best of who you are overcomes this biological tendency  in  order  to  manage  disputes  with common sense.\n\nFeeling  is  first.  When  emotional  needs are not addressed in problem solving, tensions persist  at  a  subterranean  level,  affecting  everything else. People have emotional needs for influence, approval, inclusion, justice, self-esteem,  autonomy,  and  affirmation  of  personal values. Rock (2009) calls these social needs of the brain: status, certainty, autonomy, respect, and  fairness.  Studies  of  the  brain,  according to  Rock,  are  revealing  that  much  of  human motivation  in  social  intercourse  is  driven  by the  principle  of  minimizing threat and maximizing reward.\n\nAdaptive  educators  are  agile,  seeking  to be  effective,  not  comfortable.  To  be  effective each needs to challenge one's own tendencies. Each of us can modify what we discover to be unproductive within ourselves. Adaptive leaders, in fact, are committed to their own learning and growth.\n\nFinally, what is your risk quotient? To what degree do you feel secure in your present environment? What is your assessment of personal risk in speaking out as a member of a group or disagreeing with an authority figure? Run a punishment-reward assessment. If you find you can live with the realistic extremes of either, you've given  yourself  permission  to  speak  up.  Additionally,  to  what  degree  have  you  automated the norms of collaboration, especially the paraphrase,  the  pause,  paying  attention  to  self  and others, and presumption of positive intentions? We regard the paraphrase as verbal aikido, moving with rather than blocking the other person's energy. A paraphrase is probably the most effec-\n\ntive tool in conflict. It embodies the admonition of St. Francis Assisi, 'Seek first to understand, then  to  be  understood.'  To  this  we  would  add harvesting the emotional resources to lead with inquiry when you most disagree.\n\n## Trust Matters\n\nTrust is essential. Trust has a direct impact on productive conflict resolution (TschannenMoran, 2004); standardized test scores (Bryk and Schneider, 2002; Tschannen-Moran, 2004);  teacher  collaboration  (Meier,  2002); participation  in  decision  making  (Hoy  and Sweetland,  2000);  and  collective  teacher  efficacy  (Goddard,  Hoy,  and  Woolfolk-Hoy, 2004;  Tschannen-Moran,  2004).  Bryk  and Schneider's (2002) longitudinal study of four hundred Chicago Elementary schools stunned the  educational  community  when  they  documented the direct role relational trust had on mathematics  and  reading  gains.  They  concluded  that  an  interrelated  set  of  mutual  dependencies  are  embedded  within  the  social exchanges  in  any  school  community  among teachers,  parents,  students,  and  principals. These create a feeling of vulnerability as each party relies on the others to fulfill their responsibilities  (Bryk  and  Schneider,  2003).  They used the term 'criteria for the discernment of trust'  to  describe  the  dynamics  of  the  social interactions that occur in the school environment.  Relational  trust,  they  determined,  was composed  of  four  factors:  respect,  personal regard, competence, and integrity. In a school, teachers, parents, students, and principals are mutually dependent on each other to achieve their goals. This mutual dependence creates a feeling of vulnerability as each party relies on the others to fulfill their responsibilities. Satisfaction results when the parties have a shared understanding of their roles and believe each other to be acting with good intentions (Bryk and Schneider, 2002).\n\n## Understanding Conflict\n\nThe definition of conflict varies, and each variation  illuminates  a  different  and  useful understanding  that  provides  a  framework  for constructive conflict. Here are five definitions of conflict:\n\n- 1. Conflict is the condition in which people's concerns appear to be incompatible.\n- 2. Conflict is energy in the system-nothing more, nothing less. People bring meaning to  conflict.  The  ways  they  do  so  is  influenced by personal history, cultural norms, family  patterns,  and  the  practices  of  the group within which they work.\n- 3. Conflict  is  a  situation  that  presents  both danger and opportunity. The Chinese character  for crisis combines  these  symbols and, like conflict, draws attention to each dimension.  Danger  emerges  with  the  violation  of  personal  needs.  Opportunity emerges  when  clarifying  the  issues  and generating workable solutions.\n- 4. Conflict stems from a perceived competition for limited resources: budget, power, status, respect, time or more universallyair, water, land, or food.\n- 5. Conflict has different meanings to different individuals;  therefore,  multiple  meanings exist within a conflicted group.\n\nThe  truth  about  conflict  lies  somewhere in  the  vortex  of  these  definitions.  Becoming smart  about  conflict  and  having  it  work  for you requires an understanding of conflict from all these perspectives as well as understanding yourself  and  schools  as  complex  nonlinear systems. It also requires being clear about your personal goals and values.\n\nGroups need cognitive conflict-task conflict-to produce good work. The absence of  any  conflict  often  leads  to  apathy,  with decisions  defaulting  to  leaders  or  those  with\n\nTrust as a Three-Legged Stool\n\nSteve Barone offers a snapshot view congruent with the Bryk and Schneider' s research. Steve is a former New York administrator and international school consultant who uses the metaphor of a three-legged stool to describe three trust essentials: sincerity, competence; and reliability .\n\nThe origin for the word sincere is Greek. It means without wax. Earlier in history; the Italians would sometimes melt paraffin into the cracks of marble; let it and polish it. Since top dollar went to perfect marble, this became common for stone damaged in the ground or in the removal process. The Greeks; savvy to this, demanded sincere marble from their suppliers. Sincere means to tell the truth all the time, about what you think and how you feel. Barone describes his 5-year-old daughter sent to her room for telling a lie and told to stay there until she reasoned why truth is preferable . \"When you tell the truth you only have to remember half as much; she concluded. dry ,\n\nCompetence means you can deliver on promises. You have the capacity to perform what you offer. Competence, of course, requires prerequisite skills. One of the author' s grandsons needed his appendix out during a trip to Mexico. While his grandfather might have been happy to remove it, he had no competence: Thankfully found a capable surgeon. Being competent applies to keeping confidences; on time, honestly assessing one's instruction when examining student work, and working collaboratively with others. they being\n\nReliability means all the time. If the brakes on your car fail, do you trust them anymore? How many hamburgers have to kill someone for McDonald s to be out of business? How often can a principal fail to keep his word and maintain trust?   Being human of course, we make mistakes . When so, ask for forgiveness . Requesting forgiveness involves three steps: admit you screwed up, apologize for the hurt it caused, and resolve to not do it again.\n\nFigure 12.2. Trust as a Three-Legged Stool\n\nthe  loudest  voices.  Yet,  cognitive  conflict  is a slippery slope. What starts as disagreement about ideas will sometimes slip into affective conflict-relationship  conflict-when  people lack  the  skills  for  distinguishing  and  managing  productive  disagreements  (Rafferty, 2012).  Affective  conflict  is  'disagreements, either  person-to-person  or  group-to-group, that involve  antagonism.  Such  interactions sap energy, derail tasks, and block much group work' (Ensley, et al., 2002, p. 369). One major goal of group development is to amplify cognitive conflict and minimize affective conflict. Accomplish this with the seven norms of collaboration and the many strategies referenced in this book that provide psychologically safe\n\n## Centering is First: What, Why, How\n\nWhat: To be the most effective you can  be  during  conflict,  use  the  ancient Aikido  visualization  art  of  centering. Centering  brings  you  into  the  here  and now,  takes  power  away  from  concerns and negative thoughts, and helps you remain stable and grounded. Aikido Master  Thomas  Crum  brought  this  to  our attention  recently  when  he  wondered  if centering  might  not  be  taught  in Adaptive  Schools  seminars  (2015).  'Center' refers  to  a  relaxed  yet  focused  state  of mind and is a productive way of being in conflict or not.\n\nWhy: The concept of 'ki' holds that all physical  and  mental  power  comes from  the  flow  of  energy  around  your body. Energy is lost when you are tense.\n\nHow:  In  a  delightful  story  about how harried businessman Angus breaks negative habits leading to anger, exhaustion, and poor performance, Crum (2009) describes three profoundly effective and learnable steps. First, focus on breathing in the present moment with balance and energy; next, breathe in the 'me I want to be'  with  power  and  purpose;  and finally,  let  go  of  judgment,  breathing  in the mystery.\n\nstructures with which to address hard-to-talk about topics (see appendix A).\n\n## Learning from Social Psychology\n\nSocial  psychologists  study  efforts  to  resolve  human  conflict.  Advice  found  in  the popular press often has its origins in social psychology.  In  our  explorations  of  conflict  from the perspective of this field, we have identified the following three principles to be of value to educators who work with any form of conflict:\n\n- 1. Define fairness.\n- 2. Identify and label the social norms for preventing  conflict,  regulating  conflict,  and finding solutions to conflict.\n- 3. Address the sources of conflict.\n\n## Defining Fairness\n\nAgreement  is  more  likely  and  can  be reached more quickly when a single standard of  fairness  applies  than  when  a  group  uses multiple standards or no standards. It is best to  negotiate  the  fairness  criteria  early  in  the process.  Groups  usually  select  from  three definitions. Test the working definition of each with 'what if' scenarios.\n\n## Equality\n\nEverybody benefits or contributes equally. Three variations of this criterion have been observed: (a)  equal  outcomes, (b)  equal  concessions (i.e., all parties make the same degree of movement toward the middle), and (c) outside precedent (e.g., What are other districts paying their teachers?).\n\n## Equity\n\nBenefit is proportional to contributions or work  done.  Merit-pay  systems  operate  with this principle. Ideally, such systems should be based on student learning data and on a teacher's  contribution  to  the  greater  good  through skillful collaborative engagement.\n\n## Needs\n\nBenefit  should  be  proportional  to  need. Federal funding formulas for grants to schools with high populations of low-income children represent  this  line  of  thinking.  It  is  striking to  us  that  most  local  and  state  governments have left it to the federal system to apply this definition and have chosen not to do so with local funding.\n\n## Identifying and Labeling Social Norms\n\nPeople will often attack the process when they are not happy with a resolution. Prevent this by identifying and labeling ahead of time the norms that the involved parties will agree to use.\n\n## Norms for Preventing Conflict\n\nThe  norms  for  preventing  conflict  are either  productive  or  destructive.  Destructive patterns  include  being  excessively  polite, avoiding issues, using humor as a distraction, and  emphasizing  congeniality  (i.e.,  making nice) over professional collegiality. Overregulating  the  process  for  resolving  issues  with an avalanche of policies, forms, and detailed chains of command is a counterproductive approach used by some large organizations. We know of a school overseas in which conflict is  'managed' by banning all employee organizations. Such approaches drive expressions of  conflict  underground,  affect  relationships, and ultimately destroy personal and collective efficacy and morale.\n\nProductive patterns for preventing conflict include assigning resources and responsibilities on the basis of some agreed-upon definition of fairness (e.g.,  all  teachers  rotate  yard-duty  responsibilities except Mrs. Lopez, who runs an after-school tutorial clinic). Interactive patterns for conflict prevention include the seven norms of collaboration and an agreement to trace rumors back to their sources.\n\n## Norms for Regulating Conflict\n\nTo  talk  first  with  one's  adversary  before going to a third party is an example of a norm for regulating  conflict.  Groups  define  what constitutes fair fighting. Agreements to address issues, not personalities, speak about the future, not  the  past  are  examples  of  ways  in  which groups might define fair fighting. Agreements to discuss the undiscussable, personal feelings, values,  or  student  achievement  in  the  math department  constitute  norms  for  regulating conflict.  Groups  make  regulatory  agreements about  language.  Instead  of  saying,  'You're wrong,'  they  agree  to  say,  'I  see  it  another way.'  (See  the  strategy  'Disagreement  Grid' in appendix A.)\n\n## Norms for Finding Solutions\n\nAgree  first  about  solution  criteria  and solution processes (Who will decide?). Identify and explore the assumptions that underlie the different positions. Raise questions like the following to help groups confront conflict:\n\n- \u00b7 What  is  the  worst  possible  outcome  of addressing this?\n- \u00b7 What is the best possible outcome of addressing this?\n- \u00b7 What are the worst and best possible outcomes of not addressing this?\n- \u00b7 What outcome do you imagine  that  your adversary has?\n- \u00b7 Would  it be OK  if your adversaries achieved their outcomes?\n\n## The Context in Which Conflict Occurs\n\nThe traditional working culture of schools challenges  the  effectiveness  of  much  of  the established knowledge about conflict. Adaptive leaders know that schools are living paradoxes, operating simultaneously as thing models and energy  models.  In  the  spirit  of  'thingness,' schools  have  been  organized  for  more  than  a century  as  machines,  a  collection  of  smaller units  making  a  part-to-whole  universe:  objectives  to  lessons  and  units  to  curriculum,  a racecourse  of  relatively  standardized  ground that students must cover in their journey to the finish line (Tyler, 1949; Wiggins and McTighe, 2005; Zais, 1976).\n\nIn  this  model,  principles  of  cause-andeffect prevail, values are formalized into contracts,  event-level  thinking  is  the  norm,  and tacit rules govern daily behavior. Transactions tend  toward  formality  and  politeness  (Sergiovanni,  1994).  A  teacher  once  told  us  that each year students were coming to her without\n\nrequisite skills, but that she would be hesitant to bring up the problem with the students' prior teachers for fear of offending them.\n\nSchools are also quantum systems-'bundles of energy in motion,' more like communities  than  businesses. Drawing from the science of  chaos  and  complexity  theory,  we  get  a  different picture of the organizing energies of the planet (Gleick, 1987). Using sophisticated mathematical  modeling,  scientists  who  study  complex systems provide us with images of different and  often  nonlinear  patterns  of  organization. Such  systems  are  best  understood  by  studying the behavior of the complex whole rather than the behavior of the parts (Gharajedaghi, 2006).\n\nComplex systems organize around 'strange attractors.' For schools, some of these strange attractors are the core values, vision, and mission of the school or district that draw people together  like  magical  magnets  in  a  common purpose.  In  these  schools,  the  staffs  energetically  work  to  provide  children  and  young adults with more than a sense of artificial belonging; the principles, passions, and conflicting energies of living systems apply.\n\nOur central premise is that schools are enterprises of both things and energy, yet 'thing' mental  models  dominate  most  approaches  to conflict.  When  educators  learn  to  see  their schools  as  dynamic  systems  of  energy  and information,  they  are  liberated  to  practice more effective ways of working with conflict. To understand how behavior operates in these systems,  we  have  identified  ten  energy  traps that serve as lenses for analyzing and responding to conflicts.\n\n## Energy Traps\n\nCertain  ways  of  perceiving  conflict  limit possibilities  and  constrain  energy  in  increasingly destructive loops. Energy traps establish counterproductive, recursive patterns throughout  a  system.  Microphone  feedback  is  an example: The closer the microphone is to the speaker, the louder the squeal as the signal cycles repeatedly through the sound system, grat-\n\n## Contention\n\nContention  occurs  when  disagreement is  poorly  dealt  with.  Four  conditions create contention. (1) The natural desire  to  explain  one's  own  side  first. Instead,  paraphrase  first.  This,  keeps one from being defensive, causes one to consider more carefully what the other person  is  attempting  to  communicate. (2) The first condition relates to the second,  our  general  ineffectiveness  as  listeners. Listening requires attention and energy. Thought takes place at about the same rate as visual recognition but hearing takes place about four times as fast. (3) Fear that we will not get our way is the  third  condition  leading  to  contention. Finally, (4) is the assumption that one of us has to lose.\n\ning on the nerves of the listeners. The summer sun beating down on Death Valley, California, produces  waves  of  energy  that  heat  the  rock walls of the valley, trapping energy that builds up throughout the day. A similar phenomenon occurs  over  cities  on  warm  days  and  nights with  cloud  cover;  heat  is  trapped  beneath  the clouds,  making  the  air  sticky  and  uncomfortable.  One  person  who  is  being  grumpy  sets up  an  energy  trap  if  other  people  respond  by matching the grumpiness. A teacher who talks above the volume of the class to get attention simply  leads  to  the  students  increasing  their volume so they can hear one another.\n\nRecognizing  traps  in  order  to  release  energy  is  the  first  step  in  problem  resolution. When they  detect  energy  traps,  skilled  group leaders can open emotional and cognitive space by establishing new frames for viewing situations for themselves and for other group members. 'Frames are mental structures that shape the  way  we  see  the  world.  As  a  result,  they shape the goals we seek, the plans we make, the way we act, and what counts as a good or bad outcome of our actions' (Lakoff, 2004, p. xv).\n\nThese  frames,  or  mental  maps,  have  two critical features that apply directly to working with  conflicts  (Kelly,  2006):  (1)  Faulty  maps lead us to faulty actions, and (2) it takes purposeful effort to modify or change a map once it has been established.\n\nTen common traps, which can be reframed to  provide  fresh  perspectives  and  additional solution options, are as follows:\n\n- 1.  Operating  metaphors,  like  the  'war  on drugs.'\n- 2.  Time orientations that confuse past, present, and future.\n- 3. Time horizons that are too short or too long.\n- 4.  Nominalizations: naming  processes as things.\n- 5.  The illusion of human separateness.\n- 6.  A focus on production to the detriment of production capacity.\n- 7.  Fixing what shows, not what is broken.\n- 8.  The myth that problems require solutions.\n- 9.  Personalization of conflict.\n- 10.  Being emotions rather than having emotions.\n\nWe were once asked to consult at what we will call the Unhappy Elementary School. The school's  difficulties  had  reached  such  proportions  that  the  school  board  had  threatened  to remove the principal unless she could 'turn the school around' before the end of the year. We were contacted in March.\n\nThe  previous  principal  had  been  at  the school  for  eighteen  years  and  was  a  laissez-faire leader. The current principal had been there  for  eighteen  months,  bringing  a  strong background in curriculum and instruction and a more directive leadership style to the role. We decided to conduct information interviews with each staff member in preparation for a full-day staff meeting.\n\nOur  private  interviews  revealed  that  the teachers were not only complaining about the principal,  they  were  also  complaining  about each  other.  We  learned  that  many  individuals made disparaging remarks about fellow teachers  to  colleagues,  certified  staff,  and  parents. Privately,  a  stream  of  vicious  communication existed.  'We're  shooting  at  our  wingman  instead  of  working  together,'  one  teacher  confided.  Publicly,  the  staff  wore  polite  faces  to one another and discharged their negative feelings on a common irritant, the principal. Some staff members had pipelines to board members and regularly reported their versions of events at the school.\n\nSeveral  classical  features  of  conflict  are present  in  this  example.  First,  conflict  was perpetuating  itself,  ricocheting  around  in  the energy  traps  of  time  orientations,  nominalizations,  fixing  what  shows,  and  personalizing  conflict  amid  a  labyrinth  of  underground communications.  Second,  conflict  is  always contextual. In this case, the school's history, a hands-off  principal,  and  a  building  organized into  pods  contributed  to  separate  and  disconnected units of teachers, with each unit unique in identity, norms, and team leaders. Third, the teachers  were  bright,  highly  verbal,  and  passionately committed to action. The mix worked reasonably  well  with  a  laissez-faire  principal who left each pod free to do its own thing, but it became an obstacle when the school was faced with a common crisis.\n\nTo  release  trapped  energy,  first  you  must identify the trap. Understand it as a conceptual shape that holds energy within certain configurations. One way to identify the frames through which you are viewing a conflict-whether you are directly involved or simply on the periphery  as  an  observer-is  to  free-write  for  a  set amount  of  time  about  the  conflict.  Resist  the temptation to analyze as you write; keep your pen  moving  until  the  time  is  up.  Then  read through the descriptions of the ten traps below to see which ones might be operating in your situation. Consider ways to release the energy by  changing  the  frame  and  opening  the  trap, allowing the possibility of new resolutions into the situation.\n\nStrategies  and  tools  in  the  'What  to  Do' column below can be found in appendix A.\n\n## The Trap\n\n## Ten Energy Traps\n\n## What To Do\n\n## 1. Operating Metaphors\n\nThe human conceptual system is primarily metaphorical in nature. Concepts structure what people perceive. Language labels concepts and directs perception. A group's metaphorical language provides containers for thinking that hold unconscious assumptions, beliefs, goals, and values.\n\nThe \"reading wars\" or the \"war on drugs\" are examples. Listen to groups or leaders in groups. Those thinking in war metaphors will use words like fight, position, shoot down, bomb, attack, and defend.\n\nSports metaphors drive group into \"winning\" against an adversary. Others, like golf, challenge each person to do his or her individual best.\n\nBut what if we never had a war on drugs, and instead had a rally for health? Changing language puts energy in new containers and opens fresh possibilities for resolution.\n\nYou can either extend concepts within a metaphor or change the metaphor. All metaphors illuminate some portions of reality and hide others.  Search for unstated images within a prevailing metaphor to reframe group thinking. F or example, if a committee is intent on \"battling illiteracy,\" focus attention on \"training the soldiers\" rather than \"gathering weapons.\" Or change the metaphor. Why not a ship instead of a war, a journey instead of an attack, a garden rather than a field or battle?\n\nWhat people name a thing determines their perception of it and hence their choices and behaviors.\n\n- \u00b7 Listen to the language that group members and group leaders use.\n- \u00b7 Illuminate and extend unstated images within a metaphor-war ... supply lines  ... training the troops.\n\n\"If we're a team, what sport are we playing? Who is the quarterback? Who is the coach? What kind of coach do we have?\"\n\n\"If the faculty is a family, who is the mommy, the daddy, the little brother, or the eccentric uncle?\"\n\n\"If parents are our customers, what are we selling?\"\n\n## \u00b7 Change the metaphor.\n\n\"A rally for health instead of a war on drugs.\"\n\n- \"Conducting an orchestra instead of giving orders to the troops.\"\n- \u00b7 Surface and label assumptions, values, and goals within the metaphors the group is using.\n\n\"Y  ou frequently use the term autonomy, what are some of your assumptions about the ways that this value influence choices and behaviors in this organization?\"\n\n## The Trap\n\n## 2. Time Orientation (past, Present, Future)\n\n\"We've always done it that way\" identifies a speaker who is focusing on the past. Energy gets stuck when groups focus exclusively on either past,  present, or future or when conversations jump randomly across all three time dimensions. Free energy by addressing one temporal zone at a time. In general, we find that in problem-solving conversations energy is most freed when it is directed towards the future. Help groups to describe the desired state. Then back up to the present or the very near future to determine what must be done to achieve the envisioned future.\n\nSome groups get stuck in the past. Free them by providing a vehicle to tell their stories. Our friend and colleague,  Suzanne Bailey, teaches a timeline strategy to help groups get themselves unstuck.  The group designates \"eras\" in history:  the year the new superintendent came,  the years of declining or increasing enrollment, the period of a major reorganization. Chart paper is hung on walls in the form of a time  line and icons used to illustrate different eras and the significant events that occurred. Groups of people complete the timeline with words, icons, and their memories delivered to one another as verbal histories. As a result, people hear about the same event from different perspectives, forming a more complex history with greater understanding of conflicting perceptions. What is expressed and understood is released.\n\nTime confusions occasionally cause meeting energy carom off the walls like the rubber ball in a racquetball court. In such cases, a skilled facilitator directs the conversations to one time zone at a time.\n\n## What To Do\n\n- \u00b7 Focus group members on one temporal zone at a time.\n\nIn meetings say, \"First, we will address what outcomes we want and then we will explore strategies that might help us to achieve those outcomes.\"\n\n- \u00b7 Adhere to the meeting standards of one content and one process at a time.\n- \u00b7 Use facilitator interventions to maintain energy focus in the group.\n\nBy focusing and directing energy, the facilitator maintains one content and one process at a time.\n\n- \u00b7 Introduce the Existing State-Desired State Map.\n\nThis tool brings the future into the room and links it to present actions.\n\n- \u00b7 Teach and apply Outcome Mapping to the situation.\n\nThis tool links the present to the future.\n\n- \u00b7 Teach and apply The Futures Wheel to the situation.\n\nThis tool provides images of possible future effects of issues and innovations.\n\n- \u00b7 Teach and apply a Histomap with groups that are stuck in the past.\n\nThis tool honors the past and brings it forward to the present.\n\n## The Trap\n\n## 3. Time Horizons\n\nThe unit of time within which parties plan to resolve a conflict limits solutions options. Negotiations literature advises that everything is negotiable, including deadlines. Our friend and colleague Laura Lipton intuitively knows this and frequently moves to extend deadlines on pro jects. In return, she gets release from deadline stress, more time for reflection, fmer detail in her work, and better products.\n\nMany time horizons are taken for granted because of past practices. Take, for example, the practice of assigning teachers to students for a single year. The moment a teacher decides to follow a class from second to third grade or from fifth to sixth grade, everything changes. Perceptions of student development burst from a 9-month window of growth to 2 years; diagnostic and relationship-building time at the beginning of the second year is practically eliminated; social norms of the class are understood and can be more effectively utilized; and parents' relationships with the teacher carry on into the second year.\n\nEither lengthening or shortening time horizons modifies energy. A group of parents in a Colorado school wanted a principal removed. Stretching out the time period for seeking resolution to this controversy would have stirred up more problems as more people became involved and rumors multiplied. Keeping the processing time tight, kept attention focused on facts and issues and not on hearsay.\n\nExtending time horizons also provides benefits. Plotting a multiyear curriculum revision allows full communication with all parties, reliable baseline data, and  judiciously set expectations.\n\n## What To Do\n\n- \u00b7 Assess the consequences of a longer or shorter time line.\n- \u00b7 Lengthen time lines when deeper dialogue will allow group members to work through options, emotions, and obstacles to change.\n\nProvide a year for a faculty to dialogue about block scheduling instead of a month before making a decision.\n\n## \u00b7 Shorten time lines when issues are of lower order importance.\n\nFor the question, \"What color should we paint the staff room?\" take exactly one meeting with the principal making the decision based on what she has heard if group members cannot come to agreement.\n\n## \u00b7 Teach and apply Outcome Mapping to the situation.\n\nCarefully calculate time requirements for implementing the strategies required for goal achievement.\n\n## \u00b7 Teach and apply The Futures Wheel to the situation.\n\nThis tool offers images of possible futures related to the issue or innovation under consideration.\n\n## The Trap\n\n## 4. Nominalizations\n\nSpeakers nominalize when they talk about a process as a thing or an event.  Teachers at one school said that the principal didn't \"respect\" them. Respect is a noun and is static, or unchanging; respecting is a process that is active in time with observable manifestations. Verbs are process words and imply active participation by persons or elements. As such, they imply choice and point to behaviors.\n\nSome groups tell us that \"trust\" is missing in their organization. Groups cannot improve trust, they can only increase trusting behaviors.  We've learned to ask what people will be doing and saying when they are trusting.\n\n\"Conflict\" is another nominalization. With conflict-as with love, anger, happiness, fear, or any emotion we tend to nominalize-there is a starting point, varying levels of intensity, a cooling off, and transition into another emotional state.  In each case, the language that labels these processes as things freezes these dynamic flowing activities into static conceptual abstractions. When groups act on the abstraction instead of the real issue, they experience failure and frustration.\n\nConversely, the more groups use the language of logic,  emotion, and process, the greater their awareness and ability to direct and control conflicting energies.\n\n## What To Do\n\n- \u00b7 Notice nominalizations in oral and written language.\n- \u00b7 Trust\n- \u00b7 Team\n- \u00b7 Department\n- \u00b7 Conflict\n- \u00b7 Relationship\n- \u00b7 Attitudes\n- \u00b7 Friendship\n\nAsk group members to freewrite about the issue to surface potential nominalizations.\n\n## \u00b7 Denominalize the language.\n\n\"What would they be doing when they are respecting you?\"\n\n\"What might you see and hear when they are showing you respect?\"\n\n\"How will you know when they are trusting you?\"\n\n\"What is it about the way that they are relating that is troubling you?\"\n\n- \u00b7 Create See and Hear T  -Charts to publicly denominalize critical terms.\n\n## The Trap\n\n## 5. The Illusion of Separateness\n\nDuring intense periods of Middle Eastern shuttle diplomacy, then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger used to say that he would remind himself of three things. First, he would remember to forget his culture; second, he would remember to forget his agenda; and third, he would remember his humanness. From such perspectives, conflicts remind people that they are irretrievably connected and that any sense of separateness is illusion.\n\nRandy Swigert, an astronaut in the Apollo program, tells this story about one mission. For several days, they orbited the Earth until conditions were right for reentry. With relative leisure, he now had time to gaze from the spaceship to the Earth below. Hurtling over the Pacific Ocean, the West Coast of the United States suddenly appeared below them. He was aware of a visceral reaction, a sense of  joyful belonging as he recognized his \"home.\" Then a little later, Cape Canaveral appeared, and he had another gut reaction of connection as he viewed the place from which the spaceship had been launched. Soon, he noticed, that he began to anticipate the view of the West coast and the launching site, and his sense of connection grew.\n\nAround and around the globe he orbited, each time anticipating the  joy of recognition a little earlier, until finally he realized that he was connecting with the entire planet. He came to realize that all the lines that separate us on Earth are artificial.\n\n## What To Do\n\n- \u00b7 Use inclusion activities to help group members learn the ways that they are connected, such as:\n- \u00b7 First  job\n- \u00b7 Ajob  I might have taken ifI had not become an educator\n- \u00b7 Cross interviews among group members to discover \"some things you might not know about __ \"\n- \u00b7 Use fishbowl conversations\u00ad\n- administrators in the center, teachers outside listening. The inner group describes desired outcomes, the outer group listens. Then, the groups switch positions and tasks.\n- \u00b7 Share stories such as the examples in the left hand column.\n- \u00b7 Share information about another group, such as single parents who are just making ends meet, have two jobs, and are intimidated about coming to school to deal with issues there.\n- \u00b7 Use In and Out of the Frame to surface and label the frames of reference through which group members are viewing an issue. Then surface and label frames of reference through which others might be viewing the situation.\n- \u00b7 Parent\n- \u00b7 College graduates\n- \u00b7 Veteran staff member\n- \u00b7 Administrator\n- \u00b7 Male / female\n- \u00b7 Local tax payer\n- \u00b7 Newcomer to town\n- \u00b7 Elected official\n\n## The Trap\n\n## 6. Focusing on Production to the Detriment of Production Capacity\n\nSchools operate in demanding environments. Faculties sometimes press so hard for achievement that they forget to take care of themselves. A school in California was recently in crisis.  Overnight the school population had doubled.  Flooded with new students and staff, conflicting program demands,  and inadequate facilities, the faculty worked hard to address these issues.  They ran communication skills courses after school for two semesters in which 90% of the staff participated.  The skills that were learned there helped the group to manage tough conflicts with the board, the teachers' union, themselves, and a few years later, a district wide strike.  This staff recovered faster and better from the trauma of the strike than any other unit in the district.\n\nGroups avoid this trap when they honor and protect time for reflection.  Since adults do not learn from experience, any group too busy to reflect about its work is too busy to improve. Knowing this, some groups set task/process rations.  For every 60 minutes of meeting time, for example, 10 minutes is spent on reflecting about meeting processes.\n\nSome school boards and at least one state (Missouri), have policies establishing that a certain percentage of funding go to staff development efforts.  Offer schools use the first 5-10 minutes of faculty meetings for journal reflections.\n\n## What To Do\n\n- \u00b7 Teach, apply, monitor, and reflect upon two ways of talking.\n- \u00b7 Introduce, inventory. and develop the seven norms of collaboration.\n- \u00b7 Introduce, adopt, and self monitor five meeting standards.\n- \u00b7 Train and rotate facilitator and recorder roles within meetings.\n- \u00b7 Institutionalize processes and programs that support self-directed learning\u00ad Cognitive Coaching, mentoring, peer coaching, data-driven dialogue, lesson study, action research.\n- \u00b7 Develop a process toolkit.\n- \u00b7 Design meeting agendas with both topic and process outcomes. Protect time for reflection on both types of outcomes.\n\n## The Trap\n\n## 7. Fixing What Shows, Not What is Broken\n\nOne common energy trap is a tendency to fix what shows rather than what is broken.  Ours is a quick fix culture.  Television mysteries are solved in 30 to 60 minutes, minus time for commercials. Daily newspapers headline new solutions for school improvement, poverty, and crime. Legislative bodies adopt simple fixes for complex problems,  and in many cases the answers have nothing to do with the problem.\n\nTeacher evaluation systems are another case in point. As a profession, we've spent millions of dollars and as many hours learning and applying teacher evaluations systems, yet there is no clear evidence that such efforts improve instruction.\n\nWhen groups fix what shows, it often leads to new problems.  Fixing the new conflict that then shows merely leads to another.  Since work is being done only at the level of appearances, the underlying tensions are left unattended and will erupt again at the next fissure.\n\nThe airlines' decision to monitor and report on\u00ad time schedules resulted in air carriers padding their flight times between cities to produce higher percentages of on-time arrivals. Air traffic efficiencies,  group crew tum around procedures, baggage handling, and the like could then be ignored. What showed was the on-time arrival data.\n\nFixing what is broken requires a deep understanding of the interacting energies that are creating the undesirable conditions. Experienced problem solvers spend the bulk of their time on problem finding not on solution generation.\n\n## What To Do\n\n- \u00b7 Paraphrase to understand and clarify how others in the group are framing an issue.\n- \u00b7 Teach and apply the Assumptions Wall process.\n- \u00b7 Create an Issues Agenda\n- \u00b7 Develop Causal Loop Diagrams\n- \u00b7 Craft a Desired State Map\n- \u00b7 Create a Fishbone Diagram\n- \u00b7 Structure conversations about data\n- \u00b7 Assess group Energy Sources\n\n## The Trap\n\n## 8. Accepting the Myth That Problems Require Solutions\n\nAfter a century of movie watching, most of the world uncritically assumes that most problems have solutions. However, many situations exist in which no clear resolution is possible. In these cases, the wise person seeks the counsel of St. Francis's prayer, \"God, grand me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.\"\n\nTurf issues in departmentalized settings are examples of problems that never go away.  They are a deeply rooted manifestation of territoriality, self-interest,  and survival.  The most useful question to ask is, \"How can we work together compatibly, holding service to students as our first priority while recognizing and honoring the needs of individual departments?\"\n\nConflict within and between groups will always be a problem. We cannot wish it away, avoid it away, or pretend that there is some ideal organization that experiences no conflict.\n\nAnd, there will never be enough time or resources to do all of the things schools are asked or want to do.\n\nAll of these problems have no permanent solutions.  They are conditions of life in organizations, the problem to solve is how to live with them with grace and dignity.\n\n## What To Do\n\n- \u00b7 Structure dialogues to explore, \"What do we need to do to get the best of the upside of this situation and least of the downside?\"\n- \u00b7 Teach and apply a Futures Wheel to forecast the ripple effects of actions or inactions the group might take.\n- \u00b7 Recite the St. Francis Prayer (facing column).\n- \u00b7 Develop and explore a Polarity Map.\n- \u00b7 Teach and apply a Fishbone diagram.\n\n## The Trap\n\n## 9. Personalizing the Conflict\n\nA wise person once said that you will never grow up until you stop thinking that your parents' life was about you.  To ruminate on childhood memories, pretending that we were the central character in the play, is natural but is only one version of the story.\n\nConflicts are hardly ever about you.  They most often arise from some surface interference with another person's needs or desire.  To release yourself for the personalization trap, step onto a mental balcony and regard the conflicting interactions as part of a system.  What might possibly be going on for that other person that could open up a feeling of threat, uncertainty,  or anger? Ask yourself what is the most generous interpretation of the outcome. Would it be OK with you if the person were to achieve that outcome?\n\n## What To Do\n\n- \u00b7 Allow your self-regard to be stronger than your critical self-voice.\n- \u00b7 Adopt a body posture of calm and centered  ness. Remember to breathe.\n- \u00b7 Go to the balcony. Look at the interaction as a system. What needs does the other person have? What is the other person feeling?\n- \u00b7 Paraphrase to diffuse the emotional tension for yourself and others.\n- \u00b7 Ask yourself what is the most generous interpretation of the other person's or group's behavior.\n- \u00b7 Ask yourself it would be OK with you if the other person or group achieved their outcomes.\n\n## The Trap\n\n## 10. Being Emotions, Not Having Emotions\n\nRecall a recent experience of intense feeling. Were you happy, or feeling happiness? Were you angry, or feeling anger? Were you upset, or feeling upset? Language can decoy us into the energy trap of being at the cause of another person's behaviors. All emotions spring from choice. \"The board makes me angry\" is an inaccurate perception of reality. You get angry all by yourself  The board has better things to do than to irritate you.\n\nWhen you shift language from I am to I am having or I am feeling, you notice that you are not your feelings,  you are not your thoughts,  and you are not your point of view. Rather,  you have feelings,  thoughts,  and points of view. It is freeing to discover that whatever you are conscious of, you can direct and control with consciousness, we can become more resourceful and draw on a range of coping strategies.\n\nWe are wired from birth to respond with primary emotions to certain features in our environment such as sounds, types of motion, and physical pain. These  physical factors trigger automatic emotional reactions in the limbic systems of our brains which release chemicals that alter cognition in response to the stimulus.\n\nOur brains and bodies also respond to the content of our thoughts, triggering secondary emotions. Both primary and secondary emotions create surges of electrochemical response throughout the body. Each type of emotional response uses the same neural pathways. In other words, perception is reality.\n\n## What To Do\n\n- \u00b7 Recognize and label your feelings as you are having them.\n- \u00b7 Listen for \"makes me\" language in yourself and others. Replace \"makes me\" with \"I am choosing,\"  or \"I have.\"\n\nInstead of \"he made me angry,\" say, \"When he does that, I feel anger.\"\n\nInstead of \"They upset me,\" say, \"I feel upset when they do that.\"\n\n- \u00b7 Take two deep breaths to restore oxygen to your brain.\n- \u00b7 Adopt a body posture of calm and centeredness.\n- \u00b7 Walk or vigorously exercise to burn off excess adrenaline.\n- \u00b7 Learn about your body's responses. Respect its physiological functions. Walk away from the conflict when you are too tired, too hungry, or too provoked to be flexible and resourceful.\n\n## How to Double Your CQ\n\nWhen  you  are  presented  with  conflict, you bring your entire personal history to the stage. You  also  bring  consciousness,  the  human  capacity  to  overcome  conditioning  and to  work  effectively  with  your  physiological responses  to  fear,  anger,  disagreement,  discomfort,  and  discord.  When  you  notice  that your response to conflict and your strategies for dealing with it change according to whom you are in conflict with, it is a reminder that conflict begins inside you.\n\nWe've  experienced  tremendous  value  by freeing  ourselves  from  energy  traps.  Groups can easily learn to apply these ideas in order to learn from discord. By honoring deeper principles they will double their capacity to live and work more gracefully with conflict.\n\nPrinciples  are  important  because  maximum success in any enterprise is guaranteed by clear outcomes and by applying principles-not rules-to achieve them. Rules are principles in chains. Rules restrict; they are useful some of the time, but disastrous at other times. To start and end meetings on time is a rule. To honor a group's time and energy is a principle. Sometimes you must break the rule to maintain the principle. At a community meeting in a western state,  for  instance,  a  parent  raised  an  important  concern,  about  the  district's  effort  to  set student learning standards, ten minutes before the  announced  closing  time  for  the  meeting. The  superintendent  wisely  asked  the  group's permission  to  stay  and  engage  this  topic  for the  next  forty-five  minutes.  By  doing  so,  she averted  three  months  of  potential  community upset and untold hours of communication and conflict-resolution efforts.\n\nBoth  the  literature  and  our  own  experiences provide several important principles for using  conflict  as  a  resource  within  groups. Betty Achinstein (2002), building on the work of Louis and Kruse (1995), reminds us of the importance for leaders to do the following:\n\n- 1. Develop  forums  for  teachers  to  explore their differences.\n- 2. Reinforce  community  values  to  set  the frame  for  what  to  talk  about  and  how  to talk about issues and differences.\n- 3. Demonstrate  a  willingness  to  live  with ambiguity  and  reinforce  the  idea  that  all problems don't have neat solutions.\n- 4. Model  critical  self-exploration  and  vulnerability.\n- 5. Foster openness to different perspectives.\n- 6. Don't become the final authority; support teachers in resolving conflicts themselves.\n- 7. Provide structures, resources, professional development, and practice in the skills of inquiry and shared decision making.\n\nThe ultimate principle for seeing and using conflict as a resource is to listen well to yourself and others. By calming down and calming others, we develop empathy for both ourselves and them. Then we can maintain our own resourcefulness and develop shared capacities for graceful fighting about the important issues that are at the heart of true community in schools.\n\n## Chapter 13  Capacities for School Change\n\nT developing the underlying capacities for school change. To be adaptive, he essential notion of adaptivity (see chapters 1 and 2) frames the work of schools and school personnel must continually clarify their identities and not  be  attached  to  form.  Earlier  chapters  examined  fundamental  strategies  for carrying out this work. In this chapter we expand on the what of adaptivity-the twelve capacities for school change. The first six capacities are organizational, and the last six are professional. They are as follows:\n\n- 1.  Vision, values, and goal focus;\n- 2.  Systems thinking;\n- 3.  Initiating and managing adaptation;\n- 4.  Interpreting and using data;\n- 5.  Developing and maintaining collaborative cultures;\n- 6.  Gathering and focusing resources;\n\nis never a case of either-or, but always a case of  both-and.  We  are  persuaded  that  all  the staff  development  in  the  world,  and  all  the knowledge and skill building that we provide to individuals, will have only minimal impact if  districts and schools do not also put energy and resources into altering the deep structure of the organization.\n\n- 7.  Collegial interaction;\n- 8.  Cognitive processes of instruction;\n- 9.  Knowledge of the structure of the discipline;\n- 10.  Self-knowledge, values, beliefs, and standards;\n- 11.  A repertoire of teaching skills;\n- 12.  Knowledge of students and how they learn.\n\nThe  twelve  capacities  for  school  change interact  with  one  another  and  cannot  be  addressed in isolation if schools and professionals are  to  become  increasingly  adaptive  in response to the changing needs of the students they  serve.  These  capacities  are  living  examples of the dynamical principle that everything influences everything else.\n\nThe  six  organizational  capacities  and  the six  professional  capacities  form  a  synergistic whole  that  must  be  continually  addressed.  It\n\nAt the beginning of this book (see chapter 2) we  introduced  three  focusing  questions: Who are we? Why are we doing this? Why are we doing this this way? The answers to these questions are the short response to the how of adaptivity  in  schools.  The  twelve  capacities make up the long answer.\n\nSteven  Covey  (1989)  reminds  us  of  the need to balance production and production capacities. His retelling of the fable of the farmer who killed the goose that laid the golden egg points to the ongoing need to develop the capabilities to do important work as much as the need to do the work itself. If we are not careful, the  'goose'  of  school  improvement  will  die from a lack of food and water.\n\nThis is a perennial problem in schools that are starved for time: to do the important work for  students  and  to  support  continual  adult and organizational learning. We will make the case here that time is just one element in the\n\npuzzle.  Many  factors  organize  time  choices; the clock and the calendar are only two of the elements at work.\n\nSchools are living organisms, and like all healthy living organisms they are characterized by continual flow and changes in their metabolism  that  involve  thousands  of  biochemical reactions.  Stable  systems  are  dying  systems (Capra,  1996).  In  scientific  terms,  chemical and  thermal  equilibrium  leads  to  death.  Vital schools,  like  all  living  organisms,  continually maintain themselves in a state far from equilibrium. This is the state of life. Stability emerges through the average, over time, of the ebb and flow of energy through the system. Attention to the six organizational capacities for adaptivity and the six professional capacities for adaptivity helps this energy flow.\n\nAs you read this chapter, please have in mind  some  of  the  persistent  problems  you see  in  the  schools  around  you.  As  with  the languishing  high  school  profiled  earlier  (see chapter  3),  you  may  notice  particular  capacities  that  are  underdeveloped.  We  hope  that you  also  notice  specific  capacities  that  are well-developed in your settings. The essential question, then, is: Where should leaders now focus the system's attention to make a difference in the situation?\n\n## The Organizational Capacities for Adaptivity\n\nSchools  do  not  develop  organizational capacities  as  abstractions.  They  do  so  by  addressing meaningful problems. Skilled leaders use problems as opportunities for learning. This approach  meets  both  production  and  production capacity needs. Working alongside leaders who  understand  this  informs  our  learning  as well. Recently we spent time with a school that addressed the six organizational capacities (figure 13.1) in the manner described below.\n\nA school that we will call Sea View Elementary  tackled  the  issue  of  low  scores  on  a statewide fourth-grade writing assessment. The test was new to both this school and others in\n\n## Vision; Values, and Goal Focus\n\nSystems Thinking\n\nFigure 13.1. The Six Organizational Capacities\n\nthe state. It emphasized expository writing and using evidence from the text to support one's argument. Although  the  fourth-grade  teachers were not happy about the scores, they were not terribly surprised. When they first saw the test, they realized that the school's writing program had some gaps, given the expectations embedded in the examination. As a clearer picture of student writing performance began to emerge, the  principal  organized  a  series  of  meetings. We  were  fortunate  enough  to  participate  in some of them. Chapter 11 offers some practical approaches to engage others in collecting and analyzing data and ways to structure conversations about data.\n\nThe  first  two  organizational  capacitiesvision,  values,  and  goal  focus,  and  systems thinking-forge the context for the other four.\n\n## Vision, Values, and Goal Focus\n\nWhen we learned about the writing problems at Sea View Elementary, our first question was  'In  what  way  is  this  issue  about  raising test  scores,  and  in  what  way  is  it  about  longterm  improvements  in  student  writing  and  in the  writing  program?'  The  principal  assured us  that  the  change  effort  was  aimed  at  long-\n\nterm systemic improvements in the teaching of writing. In fact, she was willing to take some political  heat  from  parents  and  central  office administrators, if necessary, to keep the focus long-term and not just fix what was showing.\n\nSeveral  other  values  contributed  to  the project's  success,  such  as  a  belief  in  the power of  cumulative  effects  for  learners. As we describe  in  the  systems  thinking  section, collective  efforts  matter.  September  of  the fourth  grade  is  much  too  late  to  start  a  concentrated  writing  program.  The  assessment of the system at that point was viewed by the school as an assessment of the whole, not that specific part.\n\nThe other operating value and vision was an  image  of  continual  improvement  for  all students.  The  emerging  writing-skills  matrix was seen as a developmental road map, not as a curriculum to be covered by each grade level in turn. If a third grader had difficulty crafting simple  sentences,  that  is  where  the  teacher started.  Paragraphs  could  wait  until  foundational skills were in place.\n\n## Systems Thinking\n\nThe writing problem at Sea View Elementary was soon seen by the teachers as a systems problem. A fledging sense of collective responsibility for student learning motivated the work of  vertical  teams.  K-3  staff  members  were openly  supportive  of  their  fourth-  and  fifthgrade colleagues and agreed to work collaboratively on an improvement plan and effort.\n\nOne of the vertical teams produced a draftskills  matrix  for  the  teaching  of  expository writing  and  reasoning  with  textual  evidence. This  systems  view  was  developed  through rotating two-hour planning sessions, with each new team adding to and filling in the gaps in the work of previous teams. Several teachers even came back during their lunch breaks to participate with colleagues on other teams.\n\nOne byproduct of this work was increased confidence on the part of the lower-grade teachers that their efforts in developing fundamental writing  skills  would  be  appreciated  by  their upper-grade  colleagues.  When  they  could  see the system of which they were a part displayed in matrix form on the wall of the meeting room, they could see where their efforts led and view with ease their part in the whole.\n\nUpper-grade teachers also benefited when they spotted the gaps in the writing instruction on the grid. One glaring example was the lack of  emphasis  on  expository  forms.  The  state assessment first pointed this out, and the skills matrix reinforced it. This also inspired changes in another part of the system, because the district  writing  rubric  did  not  provide  guidance or  standards  in  this  area.  Several  Sea  View Elementary teachers  volunteered  to  be  on  the revision  committee  to  tackle  the  rubric.  With their  draft-skills  matrix  in  hand,  they  greatly influenced  the  process.  In  the  course  of  this work, they shared their efforts informally with several other schools and engineered a resource swap with teachers in other buildings who were working  on  different  parts  of  the  writing  and literacy-development puzzle.\n\nSystems  thinking  is  a  critical  skill  in  a world  of  messy  problems.  In  this  emerging field, practitioners model systems using mathematics, complex diagrams, and rigorous analysis  of  variables.  Ultimately,  such  work  leads to  leverage  points  in  the  system  that  can  be modified or perturbed enough to positively influence systems change. One challenge here is that both thing and energy models apply to the same system. Finding and modifying systems requires ways of both seeing and acting.\n\n## Initiating and Managing Adaptation\n\nThe  principal  at  Sea  View  Elementary intuitively  knew  that  shared  dissatisfaction  is the  first  step  in  initiating  change.  This,  along with shared vision and knowledge of practical tools and strategies, must be strong enough to outweigh the cost of any change.\n\nThe  following  simple  formula  (adapted from Beckard and Harris, 1997) captures these factors:\n\n- Change = (A \u00d7 B \u00d7 C) &gt; X\n- X = the cost of change\n- A = shared dissatisfaction\n- B = shared vision\n- C = knowledge of practical tools and strategies\n\nWithout  shared  dissatisfaction,  all  the vision and strategies in the world do not promote a desire  to  change. Too  much  dissatisfaction without practical tools will shut down the  system. Vision  that  is  neither  shared  nor connected to the other two resources sputters out  into  inspirational  vagueness.  All  change has a cost for both individuals and organizations. The left side of the change formula must overcome the right side.\n\nThe  work  of  William  Bridges  (1991)  is a useful guide in this area. He points out that change in  organizations is not the problem; it is transitions that  are  bewildering. Transitions are the psychological readjustments to change. They have three phases: (1) endings; (2) a neutral zone; and (3) new beginnings. Each phase has special characteristics and special requirements if it is to be navigated successfully.\n\nEndings  must  be  marked  concretely  and symbolically.  Many  change  processes  stall because the people in the organization have not let go of the old. Curriculum changes in schools often meet this difficulty. Teachers cling to the tried-and-true, and in some cases they hope to leap to the new like a trapeze artist high above the  crowd. They are often unwilling to let go and  hang  suspended  in  midair  with  one  hand on each trapeze.\n\nAt Sea View Elementary, the writing meetings  that  were  initiated  marked  a  transition from old ways of working to new ones. They were symbols of a new order and at the same time marked the ending of isolation and scapegoating. The principal did not have to explain this.  Freeing  teachers  for  these  meetings  with substitutes  symbolically  and  practically  conveyed this message.\n\nDuring  an  ending,  a  group  needs  to  ask, 'Who  is  losing  what  in  this  change?'  and 'Who needs what support to work through the transition?' At Sea View Elementary this took the  form  of  a  change  in  curriculum  materials for  the  language  arts  program.  Although  it was widely recognized that the textbooks were outdated and falling apart, some teachers still needed  an  opportunity  to  express  their  concerns about the new materials and the need for greater  planning  and  lesson  preparation  time. Early  meetings  provided  the  opportunity  for these conversations and the emotional support that was needed by these staff members.\n\nThe neutral zone is a time of anxiety and discomfort for many participants, but it is also a  time  of  great  creativity.  At  Sea  View  Elementary,  dialogue,  reflection,  and  the  sharing of practical materials and tools organized this phase. The principal was always supportive and nonjudgmental,  allowing  teachers  to  express their feelings and concerns about increased accountability and their work in progress.\n\nBridges (1991) reminds us that new beginnings  require  an  acknowledgment  of  the  problem, not a solution. At Sea View Elementary, the writing issue was owned by the staff. In fact, as the teachers began this project, they knew much more about the shortfalls in student writing performance than they did about the solutions.\n\nBridges (1991) also admonishes readers to remember  the  marathon  effect.  Thousands  of runners compete in the Boston Marathon each year. The world-class runners, with their faster qualifying times, line up at the start of the pack. By  the  time  the  runners  in  the  rear  cross  the starting line, these leaders are several miles up the course.\n\nIn  school-change  processes,  early  adapters must remember and pay attention to those who follow. To produce cumulative effects in schools,  these  people  must  pace  themselves and support the learning of their reluctant colleagues. The race is not fully under way until everyone crosses the starting line.\n\n## Interpreting and Using Data\n\nThe assessment results from the state had merely  confirmed  the  fourth-grade  teachers'\n\nexpectations of low performance by their students. Thus, rather than discounting the results or  questioning  the  validity  of  the  test,  these teachers  began  an  informal  dialogue  with  the principal  and  other  teachers.  Part  of  this  dialogue explored comparisons between the state assessment and writing samples collected from the  fifth-grade  students.  This  in  turn  led  to conversations with the third-grade teachers and an  examination of writing samples from their students.  These  explorations  motivated  teachers'  desire  to  learn  and  apply  more  consistent formative assessments with their students.\n\nAs this example illustrates, data can be both quantitative and qualitative. The number of Sea View Elementary students in each performance quartile carried some meaning for the teachers. Actual samples of student writing carried other meaning. In these ways, teachers with a variety of mindsets had the opportunity to engage with the problem in the manner that was best suited to  their  preferences.  Numbers  spoke  to  some people,  whereas  artifacts  of  learning  spoke  to others. See chapter 11 for tips about structuring conversations about data and engaging others in collecting and reporting data.\n\n## Developing and Maintaining Collaborative Cultures\n\nA  sense  of  collaboration  governed  this project from the beginning. A leadership team composed of a cross-section of teachers and the principal organized the project and monitored its  progress.  This  team  steeped  itself  in  the norms  of  collaboration  (see  chapter  4).  They kept communication open among grade levels and  provided  a  bird's-eye  view  of  the  school and the project.\n\nVertical  teams  attended  the  meetings.  In this  way,  each  group  had  information  about K-5 writing approaches and access to knowledgeable practitioners from every grade level.\n\nAt  one  point  it  became  obvious  that  all the  teachers  in  the  school  were  not  teaching and using the same proofreading marks. Group members said, 'You know, we all don't need to talk about this.' So we asked them to name three  people  in  the  school  whom  they  all  respected and who had the technical knowledge to handle this task. They quickly named three people, who agreed to develop a simple set of grade-level appropriate proofing marks for faculty approval at the next whole-group meeting.\n\n## Gathering and Focusing Resources\n\nThis  project  demonstrates  the  power  of the capacity to gather and focus resources. Our contract with the district and the school emphasized  the  development  of  collaborative  skills and  process  tools.  Schools  need  an  engaging vehicle  to  carry  this  work. At  Sea  View  Elementary, the principal and leadership team used the writing issue as their mode of transport.\n\nTime and money were budgeted for meetings, for some staff members to attend in-depth training  in  expository  writing,  and  for  new curriculum materials. Other issues in the school that could be set aside were set aside. A bulletin board  in  the  hallway  near  the  office  proudly displayed  an  ever-changing  sampling  of  student  work  in  this  area.  The  parent  newsletter provided updates and progress reports.\n\nOne of the innovations that most contributed to project success was the use of substitute teachers and a careful scheduling of the vertical-team  meetings  to  best  align  with  teacher preparation  periods.  In  this  way  the  teachers were free, while school was still in session, to participate  in  two-hour  sessions  for  planning and problem-solving purposes. On most project days this  required  the  services  of  six  to  eight substitutes.\n\nThe district staff-development director understood  the  nature  of  this  work  and  readily agreed to cover the cost of substitutes. District staff-development practices are moving beyond the notion of course-based training as the only means of professional development. Time with peers  in  focused  work  sessions  contributes  to learning for all participating adults and simultaneously  supports  direct  payoffs  for  student learning.\n\n## The Professional Capacities for Adaptivity\n\nThe professional capacities  for  adaptivity (figure 13.2) work in tandem with the organizational  capacities.  In  the  example  from  Sea View Elementary School, improvements in the writing  program  arose  from  attention  to  both areas.  Within  this  arena,  individual  teachers and teams of teachers set out to become smart about both writing and the teaching of writing.\n\n## Collegial Interaction\n\nCognitive Processes of Instruction\n\nFigure 13.2. The Six Professional Capacities\n\n## Collegial Interaction\n\nWho teachers are to one another matters. In a  sometimes lonely profession, isolation  in  the individual  cells  of  an  'egg-crate'  school  does not  promote  personal  or  professional  growth. Parallel play might socialize youngsters in sandboxes, but it limits learning for adults.\n\nTo  be  a  colleague  requires  sharing  one's knowledge and sharing when one does not have knowledge. It means sharing and creating materials together. It means teaching one another about the craft of teaching. We are still somewhat  surprised  when  we  find  out  how  many teachers  in  a  given  school  have  never  seen another teacher teach. Their experiences of the other teachers consist mostly of passing in the hallways, with or without students in tow.\n\nStudy  after  study  (e.g.,  Little  and  McLaughlin,  1993)  stresses  the  importance  of collegial  interaction  for  growth  in  teaching and  growth  in  student  achievement.  Adult learning, like all learning, is both an individual  and  a  collective  act.  Where  collegiality is strong,  communities  of  practice  bloom (Brown,  1994).  These  communities  support distributed  cognition,  which  means that people become smarter together.\n\nAt  Sea  View  Elementary  School,  it  was safe not  to know  everything  there  was  to know about teaching writing. Several teachers immersed themselves in learning to teach expository writing. As they tried out these ideas in their classrooms, they shared their successes and shortfalls with other teachers and encouraged them to adopt the techniques that seemed to be working.\n\nA  new  kindergarten  teacher  brought  a wealth of experience in language development for  early  childhood  programs.  The  first-  and second-grade  teachers  opened  up  a  dialogue with  her  as  they  eagerly  awaited  the  next school year(s) and the arrival of these youngsters in their classrooms.\n\nThe hallway bulletin board, with its rotating display of student work, became a focal point for conversations  about  student  writing  and  teaching students to write. These conversations led to lesson swapping and more conversations.\n\nCollegiality is different from conviviality. The teachers at Sea View Elementary had both, but  they  didn't  confuse  lunch-table  chatting with  professional  dialogue.  Mindfully  talking about one aspect of the instructional program allowed the school as a community to focus its energy  and  use  talk  as  a  vehicle  for  learning and productive change.\n\n## Cognitive Processes of Instruction\n\nTeaching is a cognitively demanding profession. Decisions made in quiet moments and decisions made on the fly influence success and\n\nfailure in the classroom. Many variables add to the complexity of the thinking tasks that confront teachers every day. Planning and reflecting skills energize and organize good teaching.\n\nIn planning, teachers consider the following (Borko, Livingston, and Shavelson, 1990):\n\n- 1. Information about students-who they are, what they know and can do;\n- 2. The nature of the instructional task-subject matter, activities, materials;\n- 3. The  context  of  the  school-class  size, scheduling, grouping;\n- 4. Their  own  beliefs-their  conception  of learning, of teaching, and of the particular subject or topic.\n\nIn reflecting, skilled teachers  consider three areas: the technical, the practical, and the critical  (Calderhead,  1996).  Technical  reflection  focuses  on  whether  the  objectives  were met,  based  on  specified  criteria  for  success. Practical reflection focuses on the effectiveness of  the  actions  and  the  ends  to  which  those actions  led.  Critical  reflection  focuses  on  the purposes of education and the assumptions that underlie practice.\n\nThe 'bookends' of planning and reflecting frame lesson execution. It is here that additional cognitive resolving power pays off for students and  teachers  as  learning  comes  into  focus. A teacher's 'with-it-ness' supplies the necessary cognitive  and  emotional  flexibility  for  maintaining concentration on the big picture while modifying  and  adjusting  along  the  way.  One of the early and ongoing challenges for the Sea View  Elementary  writing  project  was  to  not get hung up on a lesson plan during the actual lesson. Learning to write is a messy business. Following the students and their needs is much more important than following the plan.\n\nSea  View  Elementary  teachers  are  still hard  at  work  learning  to  plan,  teach,  reflect on,  and  apply  new  understanding  from  their writing-skills matrix. Becoming better teachers of writing calls on all their cognitive processes of instruction.\n\n## Knowledge of the Structure of the Discipline\n\nWhat  teachers  know  and  can  do  greatly influences student learning. A teacher's knowledge  of  the  structure  of  a  given  discipline translates directly into daily instructional decisions, curriculum choices, and lesson designs. Individual  teachers  teach  different  subjects differently  (Shulman,  1987).  An  elementary teacher's  math  lesson  will  be  structured  and conducted in a manner different from the same teacher's literature circle.\n\nExpert teaching calls for an understanding of the subject matter that is thorough enough to organize the topics so that the students can create meaningful cognitive maps (Darling-Hammond,  1997).  Teachers  with  such  a  level  of knowledge can use it flexibly to address ideas as they come up in the course of teaching. Real learning is messy. Students do not always stay within  or  even  fit  within  the  boundaries  of  a lesson  plan.  Teachers'  knowledge  of  content topics and of fields of learning must therefore always be wider and deeper than that of their students.  This  enables  fluid  movement  within subject  matter  and  enables  responsiveness  to student questions and perceived student needs.\n\nShulman  (1987)  breaks  down  knowledge of the structure of disciplines into several important  subsets.  One  is  content  knowledge  itself. If the teacher does not know a subject, the students will not come to know it. Another area is knowing the structure of the subject matterthe organizing principles and concepts.\n\nA  second  grader  sorted  out  an  important idea in mathematics one day when he observed with excitement, 'Numbers are made up of other numbers-you can take them apart!' Many second graders never reach this conclusion on their own. It is more likely to happen if their teachers understand this big idea themselves.\n\nIt  is  also  important to know the habits of mind in a given field. The principles of inquiry are  different  in  literature  than  they  are  in  the physical sciences. How are ideas developed in social  studies? Who is a valid source in liter-\n\nary  criticism?  How  do  mathematicians  solve problems? These are all examples of this idea applied to different content areas. This supports students  in  understanding  how  new  ideas  are added  to  a  field  and  how  deficient  ones  are dropped  by  those  who  produce  knowledge  in a domain.\n\nStudents,  too,  have  habits  of  mind.  Each content  area  is  a  minefield  of  misconceptions and  error  patterns.  Knowing  these  allows  the expert teacher to anticipate, carefully structure lessons  and  units,  and  respond  appropriately to the fragile half constructions of their novice learners.  Shulman  (1987)  calls  these  adaptations pedagogical  content  knowledge.  This blending of content knowledge, learner knowledge, and teaching knowledge binds the subject matter  to  specific  learning  devices.  Expert teachers draw from a rich menu of analogies, models,  and  explanatory  devices  that  support them  and  their  students  in  representing  ideas and understanding in a variety of ways.\n\nThe  writing  project  at  Sea  View  Elementary  struggled  with  all  these  issues.  The teachers'  knowledge  of  writing  and  writing processes grew alongside that of their students. A  practical  developmental  continuum  for  the stages  of  student  writing  began  to  emerge, and the teachers forged important connections between  student  writing  and  other  areas  of literacy,  such  as  student  reading  difficulties. This triggered an inquiry into the structure of the reading program as the teachers wondered aloud about the most appropriate balance of fiction and nonfiction books to use with students at all grade levels. They are still exploring the connections between exposing students to quality  nonfiction  through  guided  reading  experiences and translating that into writing lessons.\n\n## Self-Knowledge, Values, Standards, and Beliefs\n\nLittle children playing school vividly demonstrate  beliefs  about  teaching  that  shape the  rules  of  this  play  and  the  power  relationships among the players. When some of these children  grow  up  and  become  real  teachers, their  beliefs,  values,  and  personal  standards will implicitly and explicitly guide their decisions about what and how to teach.\n\nValues  and  beliefs  influence  the  perceptions  and  judgments  that  carry  teachers through  their  days.  They  are  not  always consciously understood or named by individuals,  but  their  presence  simmers  beneath  the surface  of  a  teacher's  practice.  Values  shape the standards that teachers hold for their own work and for that of their students. Values are filters  for  what  elements  of  the  vast  subject matter  are  emphasized  and  reinforced.  Ultimately,  they  are  each  teacher's  true  curriculum and true lasting lessons.\n\nOne of the central issues at Sea View Elementary was-and is-What is good writing? This standards issue is an interactive construction  forged  by  individual  teachers  and  their collaborative colleagues. The ebb and flow of changes in their students' writing focuses this clarification  process  while  challenging  their beliefs about teaching and learning. This clarification process is the deepest level of inquiry at Sea View Elementary. Teaching writing is a vehicle for exploring the ways and means of learning about learning, both for students and for adults.\n\n## Repertoire of Teaching Skills\n\nTeaching is a craft skill built on actionknowledge honed by trial and error. It begins with the teacher's own understanding of what is to be learned by students and how this learning  is  most  appropriately  orchestrated  for  the population that is being served. Understanding teaching is a lifetime journey. There is always something  new  to  learn  about  oneself,  one's students, the content, the process, and the dynamic interactions of these elements.\n\nMaster teachers, like concert artists, consciously expand their performance repertoires. They  develop  and  assemble  microroutines that can be combined and reconstituted to fit a  variety  of  settings.  These  experts  automa-\n\ntize many routines to free cognitive space for more  complex  perceiving  and  more  sophisticated instructional  problem  solving.  This unconscious competence is the hallmark of an expert in the classroom.\n\nOne  of  the  tensions  and  energy  drains for  the  novice  writing  teachers  at  Sea  View Elementary was this very lack of automaticity. Daily  writing  tasks  demanded  that  conscious attention be placed on seemingly mundane lesson details. When everything is important, sensory  overload  sets  in.  Peripheral  vision,  both literal  and  metaphorical,  was  not  a  sufficient resource for managing the physical, emotional, and cognitive demands of high-quality writing instruction at this stage of teacher learning.\n\n## Knowledge of Students and How They Learn\n\nLearners  and  teachers  need  each  other. Each  is  incomplete  without  the  other.  Who they  are  in  this  relationship  forms  a  delicate balance of minds, hearts, and souls. The desire for  smaller  class  sizes  and  smaller  schools  is a  response  to  the  need  to  know  each  other. In  an  increasingly  diverse  world,  direct  and personal knowledge is even more necessary as old assumptions and operating rules lose their guiding power.\n\nAll  the  teaching  repertoire  in  the  world is wasted  if  it is not  well-matched  to  the needs  of  learners  (Saphier,  Haley-Speca,  and Gower, 2008). The exploding knowledge about learning  styles,  multiple  intelligences,  developmental  differences,  and  cultural  variation supports Shulman's (1987) notion of the need for pedagogical learner knowledge on the part of all teachers.\n\nDevelopmental  differences  do  not  end  in the  third  grade.  Grade  by  grade,  the  span,  in Piagetian terms, widens. Many learners in middle school and high school operate at a solidly concrete operational level. They often stumble when  they  bump  head-on  into  a  curriculum organized  by  abstraction  and  taught  through symbol  systems.  When  flexible  teachers  start with the concrete and scaffold learning to the abstract,  these  same  students  grasp  complex ideas and perform at high levels.\n\nDeveloping culturally respectful teaching  approaches  is  an  increasing  need  in  many schools. Methods and materials that work with one population might confuse or offend another. Language  differences  play  an  important  role here.  One  often  unnoticed  variable  is  the  difference  between  students'  social  discourse  and their  knowledge  of  the  structure  and  norms  of academic discourse. Lee and Fradd (1998) refer to  this  sophisticated  matching  as  instructional congruence.  This  means  that  teachers  mediate the  nature  of  academic  content  with  students' language  and  cultural  experiences. This  makes content accessible, meaningful, and relevant.\n\nLearning about student writers at Sea View Elementary  energized  and  at  times  terrorized the teachers. The more they looked, the more differences  they  spotted.  This  led  to  dialogue and  discussions  about  the  best  ways  to  intervene with individuals-when and how do you coach young writers, and when and how do you consult with them in a more directive manner? Other conversations explored alternative ways to group students for instruction. One direction this  took  was  to  experiment  with  cross-grade groupings for targeted mini-lessons.\n\n## A World of Both-And\n\nNeither  the  organizational  nor  the  professional capacities for adaptivity would have sufficed  on  their  own  to  make  a  difference  at Sea View Elementary School. In this world of both-and,  the  twin  goals  reinforced  one  another. Developing each capacity within a spirit of collegiality and inquiry led to a natural flow within and among the areas.\n\nThese  twelve  capacities  frame  the  windows through which we can look at schools and districts. Current project successes can usually be located here. Current logjams in the system also have their roots in these areas. This, then, is a diagnostic tool and a curriculum for organizational and professional development.\n\n## Chapter 14  Community Doesn't Just Happen\n\nThrough community character is built. The schools that do it best 'are those that cultivate intense, think community. Most of the time, character is not an individual accomplishment. It emerges through joined hearts and souls. And in groups.'\n\n-Brooks, 2015\n\nC resource and a state of being. 'Community is an outward and visible sign ommunity doesn't just happen in schools. It is simultaneously a fragile of an inward and invisible grace, the flowing of personal identity and integrity into the world of relationships' (Palmer, 1998, p. 90). These networks of relationships bind people to one another and to important ideas and work.\n\nThe  modern  sense  of  schools  as  communities is relatively new. Not long ago, the individual  teacher  was  the  center  of  most attempts  to  improve  the  quality  of  teaching and learning in schools. Today, new promise is held in the growing recognition of the power of  school-based  professional  communities  to support  teacher  development  and  improve student  learning.  Louis,  Marks,  and  Kruse (1996)  found  that  professional  communities in schools are characterized by a shared sense of purpose,  a  collective  focus  on  student learning,  collaborative  activity,  deprivatized practice,  and  reflective  dialogue.  Such  communities develop collective responsibility for student learning, producing schoolwide gains in student achievement.\n\nturing do not necessarily result in student learning. In fact, he finds only a weak relationship between  the  two.  Reorganizing  the  school  by modifying  schedules,  grouping  patterns,  and teaching  arrangements  does  not  automatically ensure a collaborative climate.\n\nRosenholtz  (1989)  found  that  a  major difference  between  stuck  schools  and  moving schools  is  teacher  talk  and  teacher  efficacy. Studying  secondary  schools,  Little  and  McLaughlin  (1993)  found  that  teacher  membership in a learning community is strongly related to student learning in specific subject areas and at  entire  schools,  significantly  exceeding  the learning  of  control  groups.  However,  Elmore (1995)  cautions  that  efforts  at  school  restruc-\n\nTrue collaboration arises from beliefs and skills.  In  this  dynamic,  teachers  are  reinventing  instruction  and  cocreating  responses  to educational  dilemmas.  We  have  stressed  that for  professional  community  to  exist,  teachers must talk. Equally important, however, is what they talk about. We have identified the sources for professional  conversations  that  lead  to improved student learning. It seems that when teachers  talk  about  real  students,  real  student work,  and  ways  to  reinvent  instruction  to support  greater  student  learning,  achievement soars.\n\nDeveloping  school  communities  is  even more  complex,  because  all  group  members belong to other groups as well. The site-based decision-making team has members who think of themselves as primary teachers, special education  teachers,  parents,  administrators,  taxpayers, and many other roles. To be a member of  a  given  group,  each  individual  must  sort\n\nout and resolve conflicting loyalty and identity issues. This is a central 'Who am I?' question that each group member must clarify.\n\nDavid  Brooks  (2015)  notes  that  community  contributes  to  character  development  for students  and  cites  the  Denver  School  of  Science  and  Technology  (where  one  of  us  has  a niece) and the Leaders School in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn,  as  exceptional  examples.  Patterns we have described in Adaptive  Schools  forge similar  benefits.  Just  a  few  of  these  are  allocentrisim, working for the benefit of the whole, valuing differences, norms emerging not from rules but from shared understandings of one another, and effective ways of working together.\n\n## The Principles of Community\n\nCreating communities requires vision, values, perseverance, hard work, and time. Community doesn't just happen. Sergiovanni (1994) notes  that  schools  are  more  like  a  functional family than a fast-food chain. Like any healthy family, a community requires work to develop it and keep it together. We offer the following seven principles in this important journey:\n\n- 1. Community doesn't just happen.\n- 2. Community is the other face of conflict.\n- 3. Diversity enriches community.\n- 4. Both things and energy matter.\n- 5. We cannot not be connected.\n- 6. Community lives within.\n- 7. Community doesn't last forever.\n\n## Community Doesn't Just Happen\n\nIf  values  are  the  heart  of  a  community, communication is the pulse, bones, and physiology.  Most  teaching  groups,  isolated  from peers for so many years, need to learn ways of talking  together.  The  task  is  complicated,  because it requires at least four languages. First is the language of emotion and passion, providing speech  for  what  moves  us.  After  nearly  two thousand years in Western civilization, the role of emotion in professional life and its necessity for sound decision making is finally being legitimized by Goleman (1995), Damasio (1994), and  others.  Second  is  the  language  of  logic and analysis, to apply a variety of perspectives in  reasoned  reflection  and  planning.  Third  is the  language  of  dialogue,  to  develop  shared understanding;  and  fourth  is  the  language  of discussion,  to  make  decisions  that  stay  made. Dialogue  and  discussion  are  ways  of  talking that are fundamental to the success of any community (see chapter 5).\n\nDeveloping community also requires paying  attention  to the environmental  aspects described  in  chapter  8.  Teachers  need  space and  time  to  collaborate.  Darling-Hammond (1997)  describes  how  'push-in'  efforts  in  a number  of  restructuring  elementary  and  high schools  allow  more  time  for  collaboration, involve staying with the same students for two or  more  years,  and  provide  teaching  teams with  distributed  expertise.  These  schools  are eliminating 'pull-out' services to students, and special staff members are reassigned to reduce teacher-pupil  classroom  ratios.  Darling-Hammond describes an elementary school in Chicago in which the teachers teach four full days of academic classes each week and spend the fifth  day  planning  in  multigrade  teams  as  the students rotate to resource classes in music, fine arts,  computer lab, physical education, library science, and science lab.\n\nAt an elementary school in South Carolina, the  teachers  have  eighty  minutes  per  day  for planning. In Cincinnati, an elementary staff reorganized the schedule to free up five and a half hours per week for planning time and reduced the pupil-teacher ratio to fifteen to one by using  push-in  strategies. We've  even  heard  of  a school in the central valley of California where an impenetrable fog sometimes delays the start of school. Buses are delayed until visibility is safe.  School leaders realized that if fog could keep the kids home, so could the teachers' need for collaborative work time. Once a week, now,\n\nthe schools in the district have a 'teachers' fog day.'\n\nOnly 32 percent of instructional-staff time in  traditional  high  schools  is  spent  teaching, compared  to  60  percent  to  85  percent  of staff  time  in  elementary  schools,  intermediate schools,  and  alternative  high  schools,  according  to  Cooper,  Sarrel,  and Tetenbaum  (1990). Yet  high  schools,  too,  are  creating  more  time for  the  school's  major  purpose:  teaching. The same study finds that nonteaching time in traditional high schools is not spent on collaborative planning  and  curriculum  work,  which  is  the case  in  other  countries.  Changing  this  is  not easy, yet restructuring high schools are modifying these realities, most often at a great cost in terms of the psychological effects of change.\n\nDarling-Hammond (1997) describes International  High  School,  in  which  the  principal, the  assistant  principals,  and  all  the  other  staff work with students in advisory councils. Guidance counselors are attached to teaching teams. The  librarian  is  a  teacher  with  classes.  Fulltime teachers constitute 67 percent of the staff. At  Central  Park  East  Secondary  School,  virtually everyone works with students, and fulltime teachers constitute 73 percent of the staff. Darling-Hammond observes the following:\n\nShared  time  for  planning,  professional  development,  and  governance  is  much  more extensive in the restructured schools. In International  High  School,  cluster  teachers  share 70 minutes of planning time daily and a half day  each  week  for  staff  development  and collective  work  while  students  are  in  clubs. (1997, p. 185)\n\nTo  accomplish  the  structural  changes  described  above  requires  more  than  communication skills. Communities must keep their values clear  and  continue  developing  the  resources  to see themselves and their students through rough times.  Not  the  least  of  these  resources  are  the five  energy  sources  for  high  performance  that we  have  discussed:  efficacy,  flexibility,  craftsmanship, consciousness, and interdependence.\n\n## Community Is the Other Face of Conflict\n\nCommunity  and  conflict  are  intertwined. Conflict is a manifestation of interdependence; without  people's  need  for  one  another,  there would be no conflict. Conflict is necessary in order to have community. Conflict forges new lifeforms.  Canyons,  beaches,  and  mountains are created from conflicting energies. Because human conflict is uncomfortable, groups often seek to avoid it. When they do so, they live in a state of community building that Scott Peck (1987) calls pseudocommunity. This is a stage of extensive  politeness.  Being  comfortable is  the  goal.  Members  of  pseudocommunities ignore or make light of problems, withholding their true feelings. They ignore individual differences and avoid people or issues that make them uncomfortable.\n\nGroups  move  from  this  stage  by  asking transition questions: 'Who are we?' 'Why are we doing this?' 'What is our purpose?' Challenging  nominalizations  and  generalizations will  also  move the group to the next stage of development: chaos.\n\nPeck's  use  of  the  term chaos is  different from, but not totally unlike, the meaning of the term  in  quantum  physics:  a  dynamic  system  in which  many  variables  are  constantly  interacting-each  affecting  another,  which  affects  another, and so on. In Peck's model, chaos is a time of fighting and struggling. Differences move into the open. Most often the fighting at this stage is neither  respectful  nor  skillful.  Members  try  to convert others to their views. They demonstrate fix-it behaviors and try to heal. Others resist the attempts  to  change.  They  look  for  someone  to blame and develop cliques and alliances.\n\nGroups  have  two  choices  at  this  point: to  move  toward  community  or  away  from  it. Many  groups  and  leaders  attempt  to  achieve peace  by  overregulating  potential  problems. Organizations attempt to resolve differences by developing policies, structuring committees, and establishing chains of command, but these treat only the surface manifestations of conflicts.\n\nThe way toward community at this point is  through  engaging conflict and embracing it with special tools. Peck calls this stage emptiness.  Members empty themselves of the need to convert or fix others. They empty themselves of the need to control, of the sense that there is one right way, of ideologies, and of prejudices against  other  people.  Members  empty  themselves of barriers to communication and work to  make  a  transition  from  rigid  individualism to an acceptance of interdependence. Individualism is valued, but so is collegiality. Ways are sought to achieve the best of both worlds. Silence is an asset. Also prominent in the toolkit are the metacognitive strategies of suspension and the balcony view (see chapter 5). Concepts about and tools for conflict (see chapter 12) are also helpful.\n\nAt  Peck's  next  stage,  groups  realize  true community. Here people are open, lucid, vulnerable,  and  creative.  They  bond  together across their differences for common purposes.\n\n## Diversity Enriches Community\n\nHealthy  biological  cultures  are  diverse. Monocultures are at greatest risk for disease and trauma. If  only  one  type  of  pine  tree  grows  in the forest, then one species of insect, fungus, or other parasite can destroy all the trees. Botanists cross-pollinate, splice genes, and graft stems to different root stocks to increase the resistance to pestilence and disease. On the edges of ecosystems,  at  points  of  transition  between  habitats, lifeforms are the most profuse and evolving.\n\nAs  long  as  the  group  and  its  subgroups know that they are a system, diversity of cognitive style, educational beliefs, ethnicity, culture, gender, role, and age increase the quality of group decisions and offerings to students. In fact, there are some indications that a staff that is  too  heavily  weighted  with  males  will  have greater difficulty working collaboratively than a  group  that  has  more  gender  balance  (Louis and Kruse, 1995).\n\nDiverse ideas help groups to form rich responses  to  educational  perplexities.  Disagree- ments  that  focus  on  substantive,  issue-related differences  of  opinion  actually  improve  team cohesiveness,  commitment,  and  effectiveness. Disagreements  that  become  expressed  as  personal attacks or judgments about others, however, insert a destructive energy flow into group work. What groups need to know and be able to do in order to engage in cognitive conflict without affective conflict includes the collaborative norms (see chapter 4), dialogue and discussion (see chapter 5), and using conflict as a resource (see chapter 12).\n\n## Both Things and Energy Matter\n\nThroughout this book we have advocated building  the  energy  resources  of  schools;  yet energy  is  not  enough.  Prairie  Ridge  High School in the Crystal Lake District in Illinois was designed as an adaptive facility, capable of supporting independent and interdependent activities within the building (Saban et al., 1998). Constructed to operate as an 1,800-student high school,  the  building  can  also  be  transformed to  work  as  two  900-student  schools  or  four 450-student schools. The thoughtful placement of special spaces, such as science labs, and the flexibility of interior walls that are not weight bearing  make  this  so.  Prairie  Ridge  was  designed  to  serve  the  relationships  among  the mind (classroom and academic areas), the body (physical education and athletic areas), and the spirit (the theater and art area).\n\nEach of these areas is zoned to be able to act  independently  from  the  others,  yet  in  the course of a normal school day the three areas interdependently  form  a  total  learning  community. In addition, each area contains design elements to support the staff and the students in developing the five energy sources of high performance:  efficacy,  flexibility,  craftsmanship, consciousness,  and  interdependence.  A  prime example of this is the lack of separate offices for each academic department. Teachers share a well-provisioned common preparation area.\n\nAlthough  this  example  is  exceptional  in its  scope  and  execution,  things  do  matter  in\n\nachieving educational aims. The 'surround,' as David Perkins (1992) terms it, is tantamount to being a thinking member of the human community, interacting in countless ways to influence human learning.\n\nOne of the authors is reminded of his first year as a fully credentialed teacher. The principal met him outside the building on the first day of school and asked, 'Are your desks in rows?' Trembling  with  anger  and  anxiety,  the  young teacher asked if the conversation could be continued in the principal's office. Once there, he asserted  that  he  understood  his  role  to  be  the responsibility for learning in that class, and if that was the case, he would decide the furniture arrangement that would best suit that purpose.\n\nValues matter. Values have life as energy. Statements  of  mission  and  beliefs  are  things that  are  printed,  framed,  and  hung  on  the wall. Things without energy are not enough; the things must support the energy. To focus group  energy  we  offer  the  following  tipsbased on our work over the last decade with many seminar participants and group leaders in a variety of settings-for setting and maintaining goal focus:\n\n- 1. Adopt the meeting standards (see chapter 6).\n- 2. Rotate  the  facilitator  and  recorder  roles (see chapter 6).\n- 3. Select  one  or  two  of  the  collaborative norms to develop (see chapter 4).\n- 4. Decide what is nonnegotiable.\n- 5. Teach the essentials of group development (see chapter 9).\n- 6. Provide space, tools, and time.\n- 7. Lighten up: Laugh a lot, learn from experience, and locate power within the group.\n\n## We Cannot Not Be Connected\n\nIf  there  is  no  other,  there  will  be  no self.  If  there  is  no  self,  there  will  be none to make distinctions.\n\n- -Chuang Tzu, Chinese philosopher\n\nWherever we look, we find only ourselves. This appears to be true at every level of organization of which we can conceive.\n\nPhysicist  Fritjof  Capra  (1982),  writing about quantum theory, explains that subatomic particles are not  isolated  grains  of  matter. Rather,  they  'are  probability  patterns,  interconnections  in  an  inseparable  cosmic  web that includes the human observer and her consciousness' (pp. 91-92).\n\nAlbert  Einstein  disclosed  that  even  space and  time  are  products  of  our  five  senses.  We see and touch things and experience events in sequential order.\n\nDepak  Chopra  (1993)  advises  that  the atoms of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen that you exhale were, just a moment ago, locked up in solid matter. 'Your stomach, liver, heart,  lungs  and  brain  are  vanishing  into  thin air, being replaced as quickly and endlessly as they are being broken down' (p. 9).\n\nScientists  and  sages  seek  to  understand  a universal  connectedness  in  which  individual entities exist but have no separation. About the process  of  self-creation,  Wheatley  and  Kellner-Rogers (1996) say the following:\n\nDifferentness comes into the world, a desire to be something separate. From a unified field, individual notions of self arise. This process, like all those that describe self, is enticingly paradoxical.  First, something  appears  for which there is  no  known  antecedent. Where does the self that is organizing originate? Or why  does  it  attempt  to  separate  itself  from the  unified  fields?  Why  does  this  movement toward differentiation even start? (p. 51)\n\nAikido master Thomas Crum recommends that personal  boundaries  not  determine  our identity.  Boundaries  are  misperceived  if  we interpret  them  as  separations  from  others.  If the self does not remember its connectedness, it will expire. Each act of ours creates the conditions for other lives.\n\nCapra  (1996)  reminds  us  that  to  understand our essential interdependence is to understand our relationship to other people and other\n\nthings. 'It requires the shifts in perception that are  characteristic  of  systems  thinking-from parts  to  the  whole,  from  objects  to  relationships, from contents to patterns' (p. 298).\n\n## Community Lives Within\n\nAs  a  friend  of  ours  used  to  say,  'This one  is  an  inside  job.'  Being  in  community involves a tension, nearly always present, between self-assertion and integration. It requires an  acceptance  of  the  self  as  both  whole  and part,  a  dichotomy  described  by Arthur  Koestler  (1972)  as  holonomy. The  word holonomy comes from the Greek holos , meaning 'whole,' and on , meaning 'part.' This conveys a combination of opposites, functioning autonomously while  working  interdependently. Although  all five  energy  sources  contribute  to  consciously holonomous living, interdependence makes the most direct contribution.\n\nUltimately,  the  success  of  individuals depends on the success of the community as a  whole,  and  the  success  of  the  community depends  on  the  growth  and  development  of each member.\n\nThere  seems  to  be  no  objective  reality; perception  combined  with  intention  creates reality. As you see a thing, that is what you will have. As you describe a thing, that is what you will see.\n\n## Community Doesn't Last Forever\n\nOf one thing we are certain: Things change. Experiences  accumulate;  learning  occurs  at different  rates  in  different  areas  for  different people.  Life  stages  bring  new  developmental challenges to the young adult, the middle-age professional,  and  the  person  near  retirement. Although community is robust and can prevail for long periods, it is also fragile and subject to changing conditions. Groups that lose their capacity to work effectively with conflict plunge back into chaos. They can recover, move back toward organizing conflict away, or move into pseudocommunity. Wheatley and Kellner-Rogers (1996) ask the following questions:\n\nAs we act together  in  the  world,  our  organization's  identity  grows  and  evolves.  It helps periodically to question what we have become. Do we still love this organization? Do  we  each  organize  our  work  from  the same  shared  sense  of  what  is  significant? We return to the place where our community took form, where we first became inspired by what we could be in the world. From remembering  that  place,  together  we  can  decide what we want to be now. (p. 62)\n\n## Widening Our View\n\nWe've  been  talking  about  collaboration and  being  in  true  community  as  the  cutting edge  of  our  work,  the  leading  edge  of  professional  learning.  Yet  it  might  be  the  oldest story of all human stories. Our ancestors on the plains of Africa lived in collaborative communities: the hunters and the gatherers, the fishers and the cooks, the weavers and the spinners, all working together and sharing a life.\n\nWhat  are  the  organizers  for  community? For West African cultures, it is the drum. It is from these  cultures  that  drumming  music  has become  an  essential  element  in  the  music  of much of the world: In South America, Central America, and North America, the beat is present.  The  Afro-Cuban  rhythms  sound  through salsa, blues, jazz, rock, and country music. The essential difference in the music of the villages of  West  Africa  is  that  the  beat  is  polyrhythmic-twos, threes, and fours, interacting, intertwining, setting the rhythms for the dance. As West African women pound corn, the children don't mimic the beat, they clap and pat counter rhythms, seeking their voice within the village.\n\nTo  be  a  drummer  in  this  culture  is  to  be a  person  of  distinction.  For  the  drummer  not only keeps the rhythm but also knows the history  of  the  people. The  drummer calls people to the dance by naming their ancestors: Bring all  of  who  you  are  to  the  center  and  dance.\n\nThe tradespeople are called to the dance with their own signature rhythm-the carpenter, the potter, the weaver, the shepherd. The dancers, too, play off the beat, adding their own rhythm to  the  mix.  The African  dancer  picks  up  and responds to the rhythms of one or more drums, depending on his or her skill. In the best dancing, the dancer, like the drummer, adds another rhythm, one that is not already there. The dancer's ear is tuned to hidden beats, responding to gaps in the music (Chernoff, 1981).\n\nYou  don't  have  to  dance  on  the  beat  to be  part  of  the  village,  but  you  are  expected to  honor  the  beat  and  blend  your  movement with the movements of others. In fact, to dance with disregard for the beat is considered to be mentally  disturbed,  because  this  represents  a breakdown of communication, awareness, and community. The goal is to find the beat, honor the beat, add your voice, and dance. Welcome to the dance!\n\n## APPENDIXES\n\n## Appendix A Facilitation  Strategies and  Moves\n\n## Introduction\n\nReaders of this section will find two sets  of protocols for leading groups.  One set we will call \"Facilitation Moves\"  and they  are labeled as:\n\nThe 35  moves are distinguished from strategies in that they are often, once learned, used intuitively to support a group, and usually have not more than two parts in contrast to the several steps necessary in most strategies.\n\nAnother  set  we  are  labeling  Facilitation  Strategies  and  includes 125 entries in the following categories:\n\nClear  intentions,  the  ability  to  read  groups,  and  flexibility  are  keys  to  selecting  processes  to facilitate  groups.  This compilation of  160 protocols  is a resource for varied and flexible approaches to  situations encountered by  groups:  bonding, information processing, marking transitions, giving directions, dialoguing about data, converting negative energy, making decisions, surfacing assump\u00ad tions,  problem  solving,  starting  sessions,  and  much  more.  An  ultimate  goal  for  facilitators  is  to invent  their  own  strategies,  and  familiarity  and  application  of  processes  in  this  collection  should help build this capacity.\n\n## A Word about Moves\n\nFacilitators  make a number of subtle  \"moves,\"  perhaps not noticeable  unless  one is  looking for them, that increase or deflect group energy, direct attention, affect information flow, promote memory, communicate respect, and create psychological safety.  These are largely nonverbal. We classify them as moves in contrast to a strategy when they  are unplanned, executed spontaneously and  have  no  more  than  one  or  two  parts  to  them.  \"Choose  Voice,\"  \"Visual  Paragraph,\"  \"Finger Minutes,\"  and \"Most Important Twenty  Seconds\"  are examples  in this appendix.  These, and the majority  of  nonverbal  ideas  in  this  collection  emanate  from  the  work  of  our  friend  and  mentor Michael Grinder (Grinder, 2007).\n\n## What-Why-How\n\nThe fundamental format for offering directions is to use the syntactical pattern of 'What,' 'Why,' 'How.' The 'What' is the name of the strategy, structure, or pattern you are proposing for engaging the group. The 'Why' is the intention or purpose of that choice. The 'How' includes the details and procedures involved in the process. These directions are offered visually whenever possible.\n\nThe 'Why' is the most essential element for enlisting group member respect for the process and commitment to following the assigned pattern with integrity. 'Why' statements offer principles of practice such as: 'This strategy presents opportunities for hearing and considering multiple viewpoints without judgment or comment.' Or, 'This paired interaction allows partners to engage with the text and each other's perspectives in a time-efficient manner.'\n\nNotice that this last 'Why' statement also embeds a subtle pacing for those participants who value time efficiency and may not always value their colleagues' contributions. For those participants who enjoy collaborative interactions, the embedded message for them is that the strategy will be time bound so they should respect the protocol and time frames and not get lost in any meandering conversations during the process.\n\n'Why' statements have both immediate and longer-term intentions. The immediate impact is framing the purpose for the task at hand. The longer-term intention is where facilitation overlaps with group development goals. For groups to be ready to engage with increasing cognitive and relational challenges, the skilled facilitator paces both the strategy choice and the 'Why's' at the first meeting, stretching the learning capacities of group members. For novice groups, the 'Why's' will be mostly about the intention of the strategy to help those groups develop basic habits of following directions and working successfully with colleagues. For emerging groups, give the 'Why's' to offer opportunities to stretch collaborative skills so that the group can engage confidently with cognitively and emotionally challenging content.\n\nFinally,  all  highly  evolved  processes  reoccur  in  simpler,  repeating  processes.  It  is  better  to know a few processes well than attempt many poorly.\n\n## Strategies\n\nStrategies provide structures for conversations that might otherwise meander, cost unnecessary time, and are less productive. Effective strategies provide four functions: focus, efficiency, development of social skills, and psychological safety. Participants need a certain sense of safety to risk putting one's ideas on the table, to acknowledge when they do not know, and to participate. Safety is different from comfort. Members should occasionally be uncomfortable in work conversations; if they are not, they are probably not talking about the right issues. Discomfort is the expression of disequilibrium experienced when current knowledge and conceptions give way to new perceptions and solutions. It is a doorway to learning. Yet conversations must be safe enough to learn, contribute, decide, and plan.\n\nTo cognitively engage with others, especially in hierarchical groups, requires psychological safety. For some this means an opportunity to talk and not be overridden by others. It means having a sense that one's contributions are recognized. It means being free of losing face, embarrassment, and feelings of inequality. Very importantly, it also means freedom from having to be certain. To speak always with certainty is one of the greatest barriers to deeply understanding situations and generating informed theories of causation and solution. These four attributes and the simple pattern of turn-taking are characteristic of high-performing groups.\n\n## Selecting a Strategy\n\nTwo considerations  are  important  in  selecting  strategies.  First  is  the  degree  of  tightness  or looseness.  Facilitators  develop  a  repertoire  of  tight  to  loose  structures. When  hard-to-talk-about topics are on the table, the facilitator tightens the degree of structure to provide greater emotional safety and more focused thought. Cognitive complexity, high emotion, or new content may call for tight structures. 'First Turn/Last Turn' in this appendix is an example of a tight structure. It gives shape to the conversation by providing a focus for talking, naming processes to be used, indicating the cognitive skills required, and setting boundaries for behavior and topic.\n\nWhen the topic is easier to discuss, less restrictive strategies are used. 'Tell the person next to you one of your experiences with this idea.' This is a very loose structure, in which the only musts are the topic and with whom to talk.\n\nGroup size also influences safety. In general, pairs are safer than trios, which are safer than quartets and so on. The least safe is the full group conversation.\n\n## Task, Relationship, or Process\n\nA second consideration is the degree of focus on task, relationship, or process. Wellman and Lipton (2004) offer a metaphor of a street entertainer spinning plates. In selecting processes facilitators may choose to give more support to one of three 'plates': task, process, or relationship. As in a vaudeville act, all plates do not require constant attention. The facilitator notices which plate is wobbling and gives that one a little more spin, noting the spin by saying something like, 'This interaction has been structured so that you can appreciate the views of others at your table. Notice how others at the table give you ideas you did not have on your own.'\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to the many people who have contributed to our understandings about protocols for working groups. We especially want to thank Michael Dolcemascolo, former co-director of Thinking Collaborative, who not only pioneered many of these protocols but gave himself to the arduous task of editing this section. Any errors that appear, however, are ours. What appear in this collection are contributions from the sources below and inventions of our own. We have made every effort to locate citations for specific strategies, and in many cases could not locate an original source. Where we have found a source we have noted it in the list of all strategies with classification codes.\n\n## Facilitator Moves\n\n*Check-marked items ( \uf0fc ) can be seen in the video 'Focusing Four: A Consensus Seeking Activity for Prioritizing,' Robert Garmston and Michael Dolcemascolo, Denver, CO (www.thinkingcollaborative. com 2009).\n\n## Outcomes\n\nAn outcome is shown for each move. This is the desired result the facilitator intends to produce with a group or individual.\n\nTable A.1.

attention moves . He called this concept attention first. The concept is supported by the following moves: stance, freeze gesture, credible voice, and then break and breathe described below. The first three occur simultaneously.  While it is common sense to wait for a group to attend, other considerations sometimes improperly override this function. Facilitator fatigue, feeling pressed for time, or having a number of subgroups conversing all at once will sometimes lead to poor practice.\n\n## Break and Breathe \u2713\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 When over 90 percent of the group is attending, momentarily break eye contact, perhaps by looking down, then step to one side, engage eye contact again and say 'Thank you' in a credible voice.\n\n## Choose voice \u2713\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Use a credible voice. This is congruent with messages that give information and increases the 'authority' of what is said.\n\n## NOTES\n\n- \u00b7 A credible voice has a limited range of modulation and tends to drop at the end of a phrase or sentence. This voice communicates information. An alternative voice is the approachable voice with a higher range of modulation. The approachable voice is somewhat melodic and tends to rise at the end of sentences. This voice is used to elicit responses rather than for gaining attention.\n\n## Stance \u2713\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Assume a credible stance, with an erect posture, arms to the side and straight legs-knees slightly bent--in alignment with shoulders.\n- \u00b7 Freeze Gesture \u2713\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Hold one gesture still as and after making a call for attention. A gesture might be one or two hands pointing to self, accompanied with the words, 'Look this direction, please,' (or words of the faciliator's choice) delivered in a credible voice.\n- \u00b7 Other gestures could include pointing to a chart while maintaining the frozen body. The only principle for selecting a gesture is that the gesture should be above elbow level.\n\n## Manage Attention\n\nOutcome: Members maintain focus on topic or process\n\n## Above, Pause, Whisper\n\n## OUTCOME\n\nMembers return attention to facilitator\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 'Above' in this context means the faciliator's voice briefly starts above the volume level in the room.\n- \u00b7 Listen to the collective voice volume in a group rise and fall.\n- \u00b7 As the volume begins to drop from its loudest point, speak a partial phrase in a voice just louder than what you are hearing. Examples are: 'As you stop\u2026' or 'This next stage\u2026'\n- \u00b7 Pause as a momentary hush fills the room, than in a whisper finish your statement. For example, 'As you stop\u2026.and look this way, the next step will be to locate a new partner and share what you are learning.'\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 The volume of voices in a group cycle every 8 to 10 seconds from high to low. Listen until you can identity these ranges. Timing is essential to achieve the desired effect. The pause in this sequence provides a break in pattern, which brains are hardwired to detect, causing the momentary silence into which you interject directions.\n\n## Applause\n\n## OUTCOME\n\nBreak rapport in subgroups, bring focus to full group\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 At the close of small group work, ask participants to give themselves a hand.\n- \u00b7 Model by clapping your hands.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Collective  applause  generates  electro-chemical  energy  in  the  brain  that  contributes  to  a  resourceful learning state.\n\n## Cape\n\n## OUTCOME\n\nMember returns to topic under discussion\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Should a member offer an idea unrelated to the topic being discussed, the facilitator records the idea on a chart and says, 'That's an important idea.  Let's come back to it when we can give it full attention.'\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Facilitator directs the recorder to record.\n- \u00b7 Some may know this strategy by the name 'Parking Lot'.\n- \u00b7 Encourage self-directed recording.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 It is important to return to this item in some way. Options include: at the end of the meeting, in a subgroup after the meeting, or on the next agenda.\n\n## Eye Hand Coordination\n\n## OUTCOME\n\nMembers' eyes go to where facilitator points\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Presenter looks in the direction (s)he points.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Member's eyes look in the direction in which the facilitator looks. Facilitators err when they look at the group while pointing to a chart. This becomes especially important when a facilitator/recorder team is at work.  Recorders avoid eye contact with the group so as not to split the group's attention between the facilitator and recorder.\n\n## Finger Minutes\n\n## OUTCOMES\n\n- 1. Subgroup awareness they are part of the full group\n- 2. Facilitator has data with which to announce additional time to be allotted the activity\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 During an activity, ask the group to pause.\n- \u00b7 Participants in a group decide how many minutes they need to finish and designate one person to raise his/her hand indicating how many minutes the group needs to finish the activity. Set a limit by indicating a fist (0) to the maximum number of minutes you want to allow (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).\n- \u00b7 Name the finger numbers you see so the large group is aware of variation.\n- \u00b7 Estimate an average time that you think will allow most groups to finish without frustrating those groups already done.\n- \u00b7 Report the remaining time to the group.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Without giving a time range, ask groups how much more time they need.\n\n## OUTCOME\n\nMembers return attention to facilitator\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 With frozen body and a frozen gesture, and with eyes downcast, the facilitator raises one hand at right angle to the body and waits until the room is quiet.\n- \u00b7 Members raise their hands, finish their current thought, then silently attend to the facilitator.\n- \u00b7 The facilitator breaks and breathes, says 'Thank you' and makes a transition statement to the next order of business.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Explain this is the most respectful signal you know, as it allows adults to finish their thought before attending to full group business.\n- \u00b7 Using the same spot to do this will begin to anchor the space as a signal to fall quiet and attend.\n- \u00b7 Visually oriented members are first to notice the hand signal, begin to quiet, and then the more auditorily oriented members notice the decrease in volume, and also fall quiet.\n\n## Relevancy Check\n\n## OUTCOME\n\nMember adjusts behavior to match topic\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 A group member says something unrelated to the group's topic.\n- \u00b7 The facilitator, with an approachable voice, says, 'Name, help us understand how your comment relates to the topic being explored?'\n- \u00b7 Speakers will either explain the relevance, in which case the conversation proceeds, or takes it off the table.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 The facilitator  records  the  item  on  chart  paper  announcing  the  group  will  return  to  it  at  an appropriate time.\n- \u00b7 See the strategy Cape elsewhere on this list.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 A topic delayed must be returned to at some stage. Options include: subgroup after the meeting, added to this or next meeting agenda, or a subgroup drafts a statement about the topic to be talked about at the next meeting.\n\n## Hand Signal\n\n## Stand and Share\n\n## OUTCOME\n\nMembers self-organize group reporting: Rather than depend on the facilitator to choose who speaks next, members look to who else might be standing and adjust reporting sequences accordingly\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 The facilitator explains that when members hear the direction 'Stand and Share,' the group manages the order in which members report.\n- \u00b7 When a member stands, if no one else is standing, the member shares. If others are standing, by verbal or non-verbal communication they arrange the order of reporting.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Any move that releases member dependency on a facilitator contributes to self-directed learning and the reality that it is the 'group's group'. Facilitators reinforce this by assuming members will read page numbers on slides and not need to hear the facilitator's voice.\n\n## Show, Don't Say\n\n## OUTCOMES\n\n- 1. Attend to facilitator's instructions or\n- 2. separate facilitator from data\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 The facilitator holds two fingers in the air and says, 'You have this many minutes.'\n- \u00b7 Hold the posture and gesture until members have visually acknowledged the signal and have gone back to work.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Stand to the side of a chart (or whatever the visual focus is to be) so that you, the chart, and the group form a triangle. Swing your shoulders and arm into a pointing gesture toward the chart. Keep your eyes on the chart. Be silent.\n- \u00b7 Use in a conference when presenting difficult to accept data (e.g., with a parent to document student's late assignments).\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Use the variation when you want to direct energy away from you or toward important information the group can read by itself. Look at the data, not at the group. The group's eyes will go where yours are focused; you want them to be examining the data toward which you are pointing.\n\n## Visual Paragraph \u2713\n\n## OUTCOME\n\nIncreased understanding as members unconsciously match content with space\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Stand in one space and speak.\n- \u00b7 Without speaking, break eye contact, move to a new space, pause and resume speaking.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 If seated, change position in chair by leaning forward, to one side or backward.\n\n## Yes, Start\n\n## OUTCOME\n\nMembers confirm they are ready to start\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 After giving directions for an activity, the facilitator remains standing, motionless, and visually scans the group for about 20 seconds.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 When the facilitator remains motionless after giving directions, members get the message that they are to start the activity. Should members glance at a facilitator who is moving during the first 20 seconds, the message is that it is not necessary to start yet. Michael Grinder discovered this and named it The Most Important 20 Twenty Seconds .\n\n## Airplane Stacking\n\n## OUTCOMES\n\n- 1. Reduce or eliminate member anxiety when facilitator calls on speakers\n- 2. Members hear ideas of others because they're not worried about their place in a queue\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Explain metaphor related to control tower at airport directing the order in which planes are to land.\n- \u00b7 Assign numbers to those with raised hands. Advise them to remember their number.\n- \u00b7 Call on #1, then #2 and so on.\n- \u00b7 Do not comment on participant responses. If a question is posed, list on a flip chart for later attention.\n- \u00b7 When more hands are raised, add these to this list or start another list.\n\n## Choreograph an Opening (Kendall Zoller)\n\n## OUTCOMES\n\n- 1. Acknowledge resistance\n- 2. Members achieve states of neutrality or acceptance\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 'Thank you for coming.' High eye contact with group. Use credible and approachable voice. Open, palms up gesture.\n- \u00b7 'On the agenda are four topics.' Credible voice, look at agenda, pause after reading each topic. Turn to the group, freeze body, and count internally 3,2,1.\n- \u00b7 'Before we start.' Walk a few feet from the flip chart (presentation space).\n- \u00b7 'I imagine some of you would rather be in classrooms today. And for good reason. Rooms need to be set up, final touches done for opening day and materials need to be organized.' Gesture outside, toward classrooms. Pause periodically. Use credible voice, pause, and internally count 3,2,1. Then move halfway back to the flip chart.\n- \u00b7 'At the same time, given your passion for serving students in the most complete ways possible, you may be wondering what can happen here that can make this worth your while.' Approachable voice. Palms up gesturing to group. Inclusive language.\n- \u00b7 'The first topic today is _________.' Walk back toward flip chart. Look at and point to flip chart. Credible voice.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Language choices: some of you, all of you, a few of you, many of you.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Language for reasons for being in classrooms and passion for students needs to be artfully vague. If it is too specific, you will lose some listeners, as they say to themselves, 'That is not me.'\n\n## Closing the Window\n\n## OUTCOMES\n\n- 1. Alert group time is ending\n- 2. Members know time for process is ending\n\n## PROCESS\n\nThe facilitator says, 'You have this much time left on this topic,' while moving hands closer together starting at shoulder width apart.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Move hands slowly together while scanning the group for any signals someone wants to speak.\n- \u00b7 This strategy may stimulate contributions from people who have been sitting on an idea but have not yet said it.\n\n## Decontaminate Problem Space\n\n## OUTCOMES\n\n- 1. Regain positive energy\n- 2. Members regain resourcefulness, often evidenced by posture, facial expressions, etc.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Locations evoke memory. When a negative or counterproductive statement has been made, the location from which it was made evokes emotional recall.\n- \u00b7 Step away from any location in which a statement distressing to the group was made by anyone.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 If the person introducing you is disliked by the group, or says something that causes distress, begin your work in any space other than the space occupied by the introducer.\n- \u00b7 If you say something clumsy or offensive, step out of the space in which it was said, point back to the space and say, 'Did he say that?' Or 'That was wrong, I apologize for that.'\n- \u00b7 Rooms also evoke memories. If required to work in a room in which participants have negative reactions, redesign the workspace and change furniture arrangements.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 The stronger the emotional message, the greater the decontamination effort. Move to the back of the room to decontaminate the effect of intense negative messages.\n\n## Foreshadow\n\n## OUTCOMES\n\n- 1. Signal a transition\n- 2. Members anticipate next events\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Before a break, name the next topic or activity to occur.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Build suspense by not naming the topic but suggesting that the information will be surprising.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Anticipation serves the function of an advance organizer.\n\n## PAG/PAU (Process as Given, Process as Understood) (Doyle and Strauss)\n\n## OUTCOMES\n\n- 1. Check for understanding\n- 2. Members are clear about the next process(es)\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 With a credible voice, the facilitator gives directions for the next activity.\n- \u00b7 Next, the facilitator pauses, breaks eye contact, silently moves to a new space and in an approachable voice says, 'Just to be sure that I stated that clearly, what are you about to do?'\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Ask specific questions such as 'What will you do first, next, etc.?'\n- \u00b7 Invite pairs or table groups to clarify directions.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 This strategy respectfully places any failure of communication with the facilitator.\n- \u00b7 The effectiveness of the message is enhanced because it is communicated in space, voice and language.\n\n## Satisfy, Satisfy, Delay (Michael Grinder)\n\n## OUTCOMES\n\n- 1. Recover positive energy\n- 2. Members attention are diverted from distressing member\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 The facilitator notices that when one particular group member speaks, the group appears annoyed. The signals might be eye rolling, deep sighs, or facial expressions.\n- \u00b7 Noticing this is a pattern, at the third time this member asks to be recognized, the facilitator does NOT call on the member, but calls on another, or closes the conversation.\n- \u00b7 Later, make an attempt to rehabilitate this member's status in the group by calling positive attention to a later contribution.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Move to another part of the room and ask if anyone from that area would like to add something.\n- \u00b7 Direct pairs to talk on a related topic.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 The facilitator's relationship is with the group, not an individual.\n\n## Signal Role Change\n\n## OUTCOMES\n\n- 1. Role clarity\n- 2. Members know the person facilitating has left that role\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 When facilitating a meeting and wanting to contribute content, ask, 'May I add something?' The group usually will concur.\n- \u00b7 Move off to the side of the group. From this space, make a contribution in a credible voice.\n- \u00b7 Without speaking, return to the facilitation space. In an approachable voice ask. 'OK. Let's move on,' or 'How does that add to your thinking?'\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Instead of moving off to the side of the group, ask a participant to stand in your place while you occupy that seat and make your contribution.\n- \u00b7 If seated, signal the change by broad changes in posture, e.g., leaning back, removing glasses, briefly standing.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Physical signals are essential. Without them, some will not realize you are temporarily stepping out of the role and feel the processes are less than honest.\n\n## Stop. Redirect\n\n## OUTCOMES\n\n- 1. Maintain one topic at a time\n- 2. Member off topic will save comment for more appropriate time\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 In a credible voice say, 'Name, please hold on to that idea. We will return to it in a moment'.\n- \u00b7 Accompany words with slight move toward the participant with arms hugging opposing arms as in 'holding on'.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 See Caping and Relevancy Check.\n- \u00b7 Vary language and non-verbal expressions to match the culture of the group.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Use when a group member has violated the one topic at a time standard.\n- \u00b7 You have permission to use this only when the group is clear about the topic and the one topic at a time standard.\n\n## Third Point\n\n## OUTCOME\n\n## Direct attention\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Get the group to look at a screen or flip chart by using a frozen hand gesture pointed toward the screen and directing your own eyes at the screen.\n- \u00b7 Walk away without making eye contact with the group. The group will continue to look at the screen.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Direct attention to a section of text for members to interact with.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 The group's eyes go where the facilitator's eyes are directed. When the facilitator maintains eye contact, this is two-point communication.\n- \u00b7 Three-point communication separates the message from the messenger.\n- \u00b7 When two-point communication is used related to hard-to-talk-about  data,  the  facilitator  is considered to be connected to the problem\n\n## TAG/TAU (Topic as Given/Topic as Understood) (Doyle and Strauss)\n\n## OUTCOMES\n\n- 1. Check for understanding\n- 2. Members are clear about the next topic\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 With a credible voice, the facilitator names the next topic or task, with the information clearly displayed on a chart.\n- \u00b7 The presenter defines key words.\n- \u00b7 Next, the facilitator pauses, breaks eye contact, silently moves to a new space and in an approachable voice says, 'Just to be sure that I stated that clearly, what is the next topic (or task)?'\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Ask pairs or table groups to restate the topic and report to the group.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Like PAG/PAU, the effectiveness of the message is enhanced because it is communicated in space, voice and language.\n\n## Volunteer Stand\n\n## OUTCOMES\n\n- 1. Redirect energy\n- 2. Surprise and laughter\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Announce the need for a spokesperson for each group.\n- \u00b7 Ask a volunteer from each group to stand.\n- \u00b7 Ask for applause for the standing members' willingness to serve.\n- \u00b7 Instruct standing members to raise their right hand, move in a circle above their heads, and allow the hand to drop on the shoulder of the person who will be spokesperson for the group.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Add anything that will add to the suspense and light atmosphere of the instructions.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 It is not necessary for members to remain standing.\n- \u00b7 You may have to coax volunteers from some groups.\n\n## Yellow Light\n\n## OUTCOMES\n\n- \u00b7 Signal transition\n- \u00b7 Members mentally prepare for transition\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Stop the group and gain attention.\n- \u00b7 Indicate how many minutes are left in the activity.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Use Show, Don't Say in this appendix instead of verbally announcing the remaining time.\n- \u00b7 Indicate that if groups have not started on ____ task they should do so now, as only _____ minutes remain.\n- \u00b7 When groups are deep at work in lengthy tasks, move to groups silently and show a large sign showing the remaining minutes.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Use this to prepare members for transitions.\n\n## Grouping To Regroup and Energize\n\n## COMMENTS\n\n- \u00b7 When  seating  is  modified,  members  extend  their  conceptual  horizons  by  interacting  with people  with  differing  experiences,  perspectives  and  roles.  Regrouping  participants  has  the additional advantage of adding energy when members have been engaged in an activity for a length of time. Four principles apply in regrouping:\n- \u2218 First alert members that a partner change is ahead. The Pack and Stack signal described below accomplishes this.\n- \u2218 Choice is the second principle. Repeated choice supports perspectives of self-directedness and efficacy.\n- \u2218 The third principle is diversity. Over the course of a meeting provide opportunities for members to meet with others least likely to encounter in the flow of their work.\n- \u2218 Fourth and finally is an immediate prompt. Assigning people a topic can be used to either summarize what just occurred or activate and engage members on the topic to enter. A prompt also preserves meeting time by directing immediate attention to the next task.\n- \u00b7 If energy is needed, create pairs through use of learning partners, eye contact partners, shoe partners or any device that will get people to move about the room.\n- \u00b7 First, give instructions on the structure of the task, then name the partner with whom they will be working.\n- \u00b7 Participants need to stack, pack and move their possessions.\n\n## Card Games\n\n## OUTCOME\n\n- \u00b7 Energize and randomly regroup\n\n## PROCESSES\n\n- \u00b7 Distribute playing cards in a specific fashion. For example, place sets of three similar cards (e.g., Aces) randomly throughout the room, or sets of two distributed in a similar manner.\n- \u00b7 Instruct members to locate a card partner, sit and respond to a prompt.\n\n## High Fives\n\n## OUTCOME\n\nEnergize and randomly regroup\n\n## PROCESSES\n\n- \u00b7 Demonstrate three persons grasping hands above their heads for a 'high five.'\n- \u00b7 Instruct members to stand with one hand in the air. Locate and grasp a hand of two other persons. This is the group for the next task.\n- \u00b7 Sit and respond to a prompt.\n\n## Learning Partners\n\n## OUTCOME\n\nMembers choose four partners for future paired work\n\n## PROCESSES\n\n- \u00b7 Provide a page displaying four partner choices. These might be seasons, places on a clock, sports teams or other symbols meaningful to the group.\n- \u00b7 Instruct members to make appointments with four people. If using a clock, for example, members would choose a partner for 3, 6, 9, and 12 o'clock and record the appointments on the provided page.\n- \u00b7 Check to see that each has a partner for each partner space. Form partnerships from those indicating they are missing the same partner slot.\n- \u00b7 Indicate a space to which members can move if they cannot locate their partner. If no one is available to pair with, advise them to join the brightest group.\n\n## Mix-Freeze-Pair\n\n## OUTCOME\n\nEnergize and regroup\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Instruct members to stand and move around the room.\n- \u00b7 At a signal, freeze and pair with the nearest person.\n- \u00b7 Sit together and respond to a prompt.\n\n## Pairs Squared\n\n## OUTCOME\n\nCreate quartet-working groups\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Instruct current pairs to join another pair, sit together and respond to a prompt.\n\n## Stack and Pack\n\n## OUTCOMES\n\nAlert members that a transition is coming in which they will be moving their materials to work in a seat different from the one in which they are now seated.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Display a stack and pack slide.\n- \u00b7 Initially, explain that this slide indicates a transition is about to occur in which members will bundle their materials in readiness to sit with new partners.\n\n## Facilitator Strategies\n\nPurposes and intentions are shown for each strategy. These are the rationale a facilitator would have for using the strategy.\n\n## Analogy Prompts\n\nActivate Ideas Corresponding to a Challenge\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nAccess and transfer concepts to a current situation.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Pose prompts as analogies such as:\n- \u2218 How do runners manage to have a speed-up kick left for the finish?\n- \u2218 How did the stagecoaches of the American West manage to race across great distances in just a few days?\n- \u2218 How do the answers to the above relate to a challenge faced by the group?\n\n## EXAMPLE\n\n- \u00b7 Making the observation that stagecoaches changed horses frequently, might lead to the idea of rotating and delegating school improvement tasks.\n\n## Banned Words\n\nInclusion\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nEvoke humor, playfulness, and efficacy in reluctant or discouraged group.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Table groups identify a few words they would like banned from this session.\n- \u00b7 One or two words are heard from each group and charted.\n- \u00b7 The group agrees to collectively groan whenever one of these words are heard.\n- \u00b7 The group practices the groan.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Explain that sometimes words are overworked in organizations. This will give participants an opportunity to be free from them during this session.\n- \u00b7 Periodically use one of the banned words to playfully stimulate a response.\n\n## Choreograph an Opening (Kendall Zoller)\n\nActivate and Engage\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nAcknowledge resistance\n\nMembers free themselves from a resistant state of mind\n\n## PROCESS\n\n| Verbal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Nonverbal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Thank you for coming                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Eye contact with group.

If group becomes too large, divide into smaller subgroups.\n\n## First Job\n\nInclusion\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nLevel the social perceptions of group members to similar youth-related experiences.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 In round-robin style, each person reveals his or her first paid job. Responses might include jobs like babysitting, shucking corn, and picking fruit.\n\n## Four Box Synectics\n\nActivate and Engage\n\n## PURPOSES AND INTENTIONS\n\nEvoke energy, creativity, and humor related to new topic.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 On chart paper, draw a 2 \u00d7 2 box. Post.\n- \u00b7 A recorder at each table group draws a similar box to collect table group's thinking.\n- \u00b7 Elicit recommendations for an object or concept to place in each of the boxes. Suggest each time that the next recommendation be as different as possible from the previous recommendation (Ex: lamppost, sailboat, hammer, daisy or shopping, sailing, cleaning, fishing).\n- \u00b7 Instruct  table  groups  to  brainstorm  three  or  four  responses  for  each  box  to  the  prompt  you provide. (Ex: 'Professional communities are like a lamppost because_____________.' 'Professional communities are like a sailboat because_____________.')\n- \u00b7 Give groups two minutes to select their best items and a spokesperson.\n- \u00b7 Elicit responses from table groups using the full phrase: 'A professional community is like a lamppost because__________.'\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 People synectics. Provide each table group with three to five postcards that have images of famous persons. Ensure that postcards represent diversity.\n- \u00b7 Direct table groups to talk about what they know about each person on the cards.\n- \u00b7 Have table groups select one card and complete the phrase: (name the person) is like (the topic you are working on) because__________.\n- \u00b7 Complete  the  phrase:  (name  the  person)  is  NOT  like  (the  topic  you  are  working  on)  be-cause__________.\n- \u00b7 Synectic questions can be posed. 'What game are you playing in this organization?' Responses carry insights and humor, as, 'We are playing badminton in a hurricane.'\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Explain that 'Synectics' is derived from two Greek roots: syn (bringing together) and ectics (diverse  elements). This  activity  draws  from  the  metaphoric  brain  which  holds  information holistically.\n\n## Give One to Get One\n\nActivate and Engage\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nGenerate  energy,  community  building  by  interacting  with  others,  and  generate  information about the new topic.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Individuals write data on 3 \u00d7 5 card. (Ex: name, role, agency, time I spend doing ____________, a trick of the trade about ____________, a technique that works for me during ____________.)\n- \u00b7 Members  move  about  room  and  share  the  information  on  their  card  with  another  person. Members paraphrase and inquire so they can, in a moment, share their partner's card and information with another person.\n- \u00b7 At signal, members trade cards.\n- \u00b7 Members then locate a new partner and share the new card and information they just acquired with their new partner.\n- \u00b7 At a signal, return to table groups. Share what you learned.\n- \u00b7 As a group, identify what patterns or themes you detected.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n\u2022 Go a third round.\n\n\u2022 Provide a template for the sharing of patterns. 'There were three themes here, ____________,\n\n____________, and ____________.\n\n\u2022 Use to activate concepts such as, 'A belief I have about adult learners is. . . .'\n\n## Greeting Circle\n\nInclusion\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nAccess affective states and establish a sense of group and self within group.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Form a circle.\n- \u00b7 The facilitator (or designated person) moves inside the circle and greets the person to his or her left.\n- \u00b7 They continue inside the circle greeting each person in turn.\n- \u00b7 Those who have been greeted follow the person who greeted them inside the circle.\n- \u00b7 When the facilitator returns to his or her original location, those inside the circle continue to greet them, a second time.\n- \u00b7 This time, the person inside the circle is the greeter, not the greeted. This balances the circle.\n- \u00b7 When the greeting is complete, ask two questions. (1) How do you feel about the activity? (2) What did you learn from it that will make you successful?\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Moving right around the circle.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 No ritual is older, and none more anxiety-ridden, than that of greeting each other. The natural tendency is to seek out those one is comfortable with, those who are like them.\n\n- \u00b7 The greeting circle allows the anxiety and apprehension of the individuals to be encountered. It releases energy into the room in the sound of high voices, and laughter.\n- \u00b7 The emotional material must be expressed first to allow learning to take place. It grounds the person in the moment and allows people to be real.\n- \u00b7 Useful as a grounding for sessions on conflict, hard-to-talk about topics and, or when, two or more groups are brought together for difficult conversations.\n\n## Group Groan\n\nInclusion\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nThrough humor, induce ownership and responsibility for personal reactions in the session.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Table groups list what are the best and worst things that can happen in this session.\n- \u00b7 Hear a few and record them on flip charts.\n- \u00b7 Make an agreement that should any of the worst things occur, all will participate in a group groan.\n- \u00b7 Practice the groan once.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Give think time before receiving items.\n- \u00b7 With groups of twelve or less, elicit both best and worst from the full group. Record in two columns.\n\n## Grounding\n\nInclusion\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nActivate internal resources for addressing sensitive topics with respect and skill.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Form groups of four, six, or eight.\n- \u00b7 Explain that the purpose for this activity is to set a norm for respectful listening, to get everyone's voice in the room in a manner that is nonconfrontational, to allow people to connect with one another, to allow for the expressions of hopes and apprehensions, to value thinking and feeling, and to surface agendas that might not otherwise be heard.\n- \u00b7 Explain the procedure:\n- \u2218 Members take turns talking.\n- \u2218 When one member talks, all others are silent.\n- \u2218 Full non-verbal attention is given to the speaker.\n- \u2218 After everyone has talked, the first speaker will summarize what was said.\n- \u2218 When the members indicate that they understand the process, the facilitator names the first speaker. Alert in advance.\n\n- \u00b7 Post on a flip chart what members are to talk about:\n- \u2218 My name is . . .\n- \u2218 My relationship to this topic is . . .\n- \u2218 My expectations are . . .\n- \u2218 How I feel about being here is . . .\n- \u00b7 When all groups are finished, the facilitator calls on the first person in each group to give a summary statement to the full assembly.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Another prompt might be: What is the commitment that brought you into this room?\n- \u00b7 With twelve members, the grounding can be done with the full group.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Since this activity's primary purpose is to provide participants' with an opportunity to be heard, this activity operates on earth time, not clock time.\n- \u00b7 Use when a meeting is going to address hard-to-talk-about topics. The harder the topic is to talk about, the more valuable the full group grounding is.\n- \u00b7 With a group size of forty to fifty people, this activity might take as much as forty-five minutes.\n\n## Hopes and Fears\n\nInclusion\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTION\n\nEstablish common ground and normalize member's reaction to setting or topic.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Briefly write your fears and hopes about this session or topic.\n- \u00b7 Pairs share their greatest fear and greatest hope.\n- \u00b7 Quartets meet (pairs squared) and identify themes in fears and hopes.\n- \u00b7 Report themes to full group.\n- \u00b7 Facilitator makes comments to normalize fears and identify common hopes.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Pairs report all fears and hopes.\n- \u00b7 Conduct process as full group with facilitator eliciting and charting.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 With either alternative, start with private reflection.\n\n## I'm In\n\nInclusion\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nFacilitate  mental  and  emotional  transition  from  outside  the  meeting  to  being  present  in  the meeting.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Members go around the circle briefly naming anything on their mind. (Examples: 'I'm concerned about my eighth grader. She says she doesn't have any friends. I know she is just down and does have friends. I'm figuring out how to handle this. OK. I'm in.' or 'I've never had a third grade class so excited about creative writing. Their enthusiasm lifts me up every day. OK. I'm in.')\n- \u00b7 Stress that there is no side talk.\n- \u00b7 At the end, make a summary paraphrase.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Be the first speaker to model brevity.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Stop anyone who interrupts a speaker.\n- \u00b7 Should someone ask to pass, that is OK, though we suggest not offering that as an option as you set up the activity.\n\n## Knots (Bob Chadwick)\n\nInclusion\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nLeaving the familiarity of words, kinesthetically forming a working group. Evoke humor and energy.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Form groups of eight. Form a circle.\n- \u00b7 Everyone places left hand in circle and grasps the hand of ONE other person whose hand is in the circle.\n- \u00b7 Now place right hands in circle and grasp the hand of ONE other person whose hand is in the circle.\n- \u00b7 Everyone now should be holding the hands of two other people.\n- \u00b7 Without letting go of the grips, untangle the human knot.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Place the right hand in first.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Groups of six to eight are ideal. Ten are possible. Twelve are too many.\n\n## Know, Think You Know, Want to Know\n\nActivate and Engage\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nEngage constructivist-learning experience working with a fresh topic.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Label chart paper with three columns: Know; Think You Know, Want to Know.\n- \u00b7 Give topic to groups and have them complete the charts.\n- \u00b7 Post charts and have group look for patterns and themes.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Facilitator responds to the Want to Know columns by providing responses to the large group.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 If groups disagree on the 'Know' column, encourage them to place content in the 'Think You Know' column.\n\n## Like Me\n\nInclusion\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nRecognize sense of self within community.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Participants move chairs back from tables so it will be easy to stand if appropriate.\n- \u00b7 Name categories like 'my work is done at the elementary level, high school, middle school central office,' or ' I have been in this district five or more years, ten, twenty, thirty, more,' or ' I am a teacher, principal, consultant, etc.' or I am typically up before 6:00 a.m.'\n- \u00b7 As people stand, remind them to look around and see who else is also in that group.\n- \u00b7 Finally ask the question 'other' regarding roles. In other words if your role has not been called, please stand. The facilitator asks standing members to state their roles.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 For parent groups change the prompts. My first child in this school, I attended this school, I speak a language other than English, etc.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Because this strategy is done as an inclusion activity when you do not yet have relationship with the group, it is important to state the multiple purposes of inclusion activities like this: They include setting norms of participation, focusing mental energy inside the room, answering the question who am I in relation to others in the room and beginning the journey from an aggregate of individuals to a group.\n- \u00b7 The category 'other' is essential. People feel left out if their role is not acknowledged.\n- \u00b7 DO NOT ask participants to say 'like me' when they stand. Perhaps appropriate for elementary children, it is embarrassing for adults.\n\n## Line-ups\n\n## OUTCOMES\n\nEnergize, regroup participants, and sometimes learn about each other.\n\n## PROCESSES\n\n- \u00b7 Announce that the purpose is to regroup and energize.\n- \u00b7 Designate a space in the room for members with low responses to stand and members with high responses to stand. Others will form a line representing their response in relationship to those two points.\n- \u00b7 Provide a topic [e.g., how hot people like their salsa, birthdates (not year), alphabetically by desired profession or other topics.]\n- \u00b7 Sample responses from different parts of the line-up.\n- \u00b7 Cluster people into working groups by counting off, or moving along the line by threes, fours, or whatever group size desired.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Have one-half of the line step forward. They walk toward the other half forming a double line with people facing each other. Facing members become partners for the next activity.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Structure line-ups around the perimeter of the room for the best use of space.\n- \u00b7 Choose topic based on group's knowledge of each other; intact groups might be more interested in alternative professions than groups who do not know each other.\n\n## My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean\n\nActivate and Engage\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTNIONS\n\nRecover energy as it begins to wane.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Describe the purpose of this activity is to promote energy for the next portion of the meeting.\n- \u00b7 Lead the group in singing 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean.' When the letter 'B' is used in the song stand if you have been seated, and sit if you have been standing.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Advise members to take care of any physical needs during the activity. Protect knees, back.\n\n## Pair-Share\n\nActivate and Engage\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTION\n\nQuickly energize a group to stimulate engagement on a topic. Facilitators use this to energize, activate, and engage or to give self-recovery time when stumped.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Assign pairs.\n- \u00b7 Direct them to 'Talk with the person next to you for three minutes about_________.'\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Have members work with the 'person behind them' for novelty and added energy.\n- \u00b7 Use trios.\n\n## Paired Verbal Fluency (see also Generate Ideas)\n\nActivate and Engage\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nRecall prior knowledge.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Form pairs.\n- \u00b7 Describe the process:\n- \u2218 A and B will take turns responding to a prompt.\n- \u2218 At a signal one will speak and one will listen.\n- \u2218 At a signal the other will speak while the first speaker listens.\n- \u2218 Each time, no one is allowed to repeat anything that was said by the other.\n- \u2218 Check for clarification.\n- \u00b7 Repeat the cycle two or three times. For activating prior knowledge:\n- \u2218 First round twenty seconds each.\n- \u2218 Second round forty seconds each.\n- \u2218 Third round sixty seconds each.\n- \u00b7 For organizing and integrating:\n- \u2218 First round sixty seconds each.\n- \u2218 Second round forty seconds each.\n- \u2218 Third round twenty seconds each.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Gauge the time allotted for the second and third round by the level of participant engagement. The purpose for the declining amounts of time is to focus thinking. The purpose of the increasing amounts of time is to broaden thinking.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Announce the time allotted for rounds only after the exercise is completed so participants can apply this strategy elsewhere without knowing the structure until experiencing it.\n\n## People, Places, Things Cards (PPT Cards)\n\nActivate and Engage\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nProvide a variation of an A/E activity through attention to third point objects.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Place cards on each table. These may be postcards of famous people, pictures of places or things cut out from magazines.\n\n- \u00b7 Ask table groups to engage in a question regarding the cards. (See variations below.)\n- \u00b7 Share with large group.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Put enough People, Thing, or Place Cards on a table so that each person can chose one. Ask a processing question (e.g., 'Which picture best describes where you are in your journey right now?'). Ask each person to share their response with their table.\n- \u00b7 Put one Person Card on each table and ask table to fill in the blanks with a stem. (E.g., _______ is  like  a  facilitator  because:  _________  ;  _____________  is  not  like  a  facilitator  because _____________.) Each table shares with large group.\n- \u00b7 Use Thing Cards for a Visual Synectics.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Be sure People Cards represent diversity.\n\n## People Search\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nInformation Processing: Activating and Engaging/Organizing and Integrating.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Construct a handout listing content information being learned (e.g., can name seven norms of collaboration) or ways in which participants might have applied content (e.g., used a norm in a meeting) or interesting information about participants (e.g., drives a sports car). Provide a space by each item for a name to be recorded.\n- \u00b7 Ask participants to stand and find one person who can respond positively to an item on the page. The participant places the person's name beside the item, thanks the person, and then finds another person who can respond to another item.\n- \u00b7 Continue until time is called, filling blanks with different names.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Provide a prompt with each item so that participants engage in a brief conversation about the effect of that item.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Be sure participants understand that they must ask each other questions; they cannot just hand their sheet to a person and ask them to sign one of the lines.\n- \u00b7 Use information about participants to help people get to know each other.\n- \u00b7 Use content information to connect people to their learning.\n\n## Propose Working Agreements\n\nActivate and Engage\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nFor one-time, short, or initial meetings agree to selected working agreements.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- Display and describe posted Working Agreements as shown below.\n- Describe  Sufficient  Consensus and its  benefits  as  shown  in this appendix.\n- Ask if  members can agree to these during this meeting.\n\n## ALTERNATIVES\n\n- Eliminate sufficient consensus.\n- Have the group develop meeting Working Agreements.\n- Once a group has agreed to these Working Agreements, print them on each succeeding agenda.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- Working agreements are not always needed or  wise as they might signal negative presupposi\u00ad tions about a group's working capacity.\n- When time is short and the meeting routine,  this  process  can respectfully set agreements.\n- Group-developed agreements may be useful when little working experience or trust exists.\n\n## Process Text and Information\n\n## Meeting Working Agreements\n\nDemonstrate Mutual Respect (Respect people and ideas - such respect does not represent agreement)\n\nEmploy Skillful Listening (seek first to understand, then to be understood) Sufficient  Consensus (each person has equal voice, the group works to understand all views, distinguish between dialogue and discussion and 75% agreement of those present constitute consensus)\n\nStrategies  in this  section  are  conversation containers.  They  support  learning  in that learning takes  place  only  when processed by learners.  They are  valuable because they  provide  structures for talking about information making it more likely that conversations are efficient,  focused, and safely  allow  full  participation.  They  are  designed  to  draw  meaning  from  text  or  other  sources, analyze, infer, develop hypotheses, extend ideas, relate content to selves, entertain questions, or reconsider and tentatively refine new ways of understanding.  Because members come to a group with  multiple  cognitive  styles  and  various  levels  of  social  skills  and  interests,  strategies  that name specific  ways  of  talking  and  the  cognitive  processes  to  be  used  bring  these  diverse  styles of  individuals to  common  working focus.\n\nStrategies in the previous section (Activate and Engage) are used either as inclusion activities or to trigger member's knowledge before participating in new learning. The current collection provides the two final phases in Lipton and Wellman's (1998) learning model in that learners process the  data  in  a  variety  of  ways  to  make  it  their  own. These  strategies  accommodate  two  types  of learning: explore and discover, and organize and integrate.\n\n'Explore and Discover' is used when new content is introduced and must be processed by learners. Content may be provided in a variety of ways-paired reading activities, lecturette, case study, demonstration, inventories, and more. For learners to explore the new content-related to what they have previously activated-they must use skills of cognitive processing. How much and what kind of processing leads to a perennial facilitator dilemma in which time, outcomes, group energy, and group skills are criteria for decisions. Learning with the 'Key Concepts/Key Ideas' strategy, for example, requires each partner to identity and reflect upon the most important parts of a text they have both read. This strategy is relatively brief, loosely structured, and uses cognitive skills well within the range of each participant.\n\nFinally, in the third phase of the Lipton and Wellman model, participants organize and integrate their learning to make it uniquely their own. Developing personal organizational schemas to show the relationships of concepts is the work of the group member. Members catalogue and index new understandings; develop frameworks and models; or synthesize and represent learning. Synthesis and evaluative thought are called for. It is this stage, in fact, in which members crystallize meaning for themselves.\n\nSkilled facilitators use several criteria to select strategies with tight structures. Either emotion about the topic is high, the group is unskilled in group processes, the topic is complex or the group's composition includes a range of roles and the voices of the less senior need to be protected. Available time and group size are other considerations. Facilitators working with intact groups support groups in becoming familiar with a few of these strategies before adding more.\n\n## 3-2-1 Plus 1\n\n## Explore and Discover\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nRecall and explain previous learning or what occurred at a recent event.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Members draw a right-hand margin on a piece of paper. Label the margin 'Plus 1.'\n- \u00b7 Individuals in groups of three or four write three key ideas they remember from the last meeting, two things they want to explore, and one point to ponder.\n- \u00b7 Next, round-robin sharing of one idea from each category. As members share, listeners may record personal notes in the right-hand margin.\n- \u00b7 Plus 1 refers to notes members take as they listen to others.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Start the sharing at the second item (Two things to explore) as more value probably comes from the second two categories.\n- \u00b7 Process the activity with the full group.\n\n## 5-3-1 Organize and Integrate\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nInterdependently synthesize information.\n\n## PROCESSES\n\n- \u00b7 Members identify five words that represent today's learning.\n- \u00b7 Share the ideas, one at a time, in round-robin fashion. Explore the ideas as they emerge.\n- \u00b7 Select three central ideas.\n- \u00b7 If these three ideas were to go into a container with a label, what would that label be?\n\n## ALTERNATIVES\n\n- \u00b7 Use for what you want to remember from today's meeting or accomplishments.\n- \u00b7 See 'Most Important Point,' 'Scrambled Sentences,' or 'Three Balloons' in this collection.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Foreshadow several steps, but do not tell name of strategy.\n- \u00b7 Use as follow-up to instruction.\n- \u00b7 Vary the prompts.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Assign time, perhaps twelve minutes, so the group stays focused and brief.\n\n## A B Each Teach\n\nExplore and Discover\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nExplain content from text or other input.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Pairs designate one partner as 'A' and one as 'B.'\n- \u00b7 Person 'A' reads one section of text.\n- \u00b7 Person 'B' reads another section of text.\n- \u00b7 When both are ready, they 'teach' their section to their partner.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Pairs conclude by developing a summary of the text essence.\n- \u00b7 Pairs join another pair and develop a summary.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 If energy is needed, create pairs through use of learning partners, eye contact partners, shoe partners, or any device that will get people to move about the room.\n\n## Expert Jigsaw\n\nExplore and Discover\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nInterdependently acquire, summarize, and communicate information.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Cluster members into home groups of five (if five topics are to be studied) and number off one to five. Each number is assigned a reading.\n- \u00b7 Have all the number ones, two, threes, etc., move into expert groups of like numbers.\n- \u00b7 Provide questions to expert groups to help them process information.\n- \u00b7 In the expert groups, members read the material, report on the questions, then converse about its meaning.\n- \u00b7 Members determine what ideas they will share and how they will share the ideas in their home groups.\n- \u00b7 Return to home groups and share what has been learned in the expert groups.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Expert groups develop an image or perform a skit to convey information.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 While there is value in member choice, assigning topics takes less time than allowing members to choose their own topics.\n\n## Key Concepts/Key Ideas\n\nExplore and Discover\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nSelect and interpret information and relate to member's experience.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Organize members into pairs.\n- \u00b7 Assign a reading.\n- \u00b7 Individuals read text, marking key concepts and ideas.\n- \u00b7 When both have finished reading, take turns sharing and exploring concepts/ideas marked by each partner.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Assign the reading in sections. After each section, share concepts and ideas.\n- \u00b7 See the 'Say Something Strategy.'\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 As with all text-based learning, remind members that a key value of this strategy is the different experiences and perspectives each member brings to the topic.\n\n## Modified Jigsaw\n\nExplore and Discover\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nA high-energy and time-saving alternative to 'Expert Jigsaw' that also requires members to acquire, summarize, and communicate information.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Form a team.\n- \u00b7 Apportion a reading to members of the team.\n- \u00b7 Each member reads an assigned section and plans how to teach it to the team.\n\n## Partners Report\n\nExplore and Discover\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nSynthesize constructed meaning.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Partners engage in conversation knowing they may be asked to report their partner's ideas.\n- \u00b7 Provide two minutes for each to be sure they can paraphrase their partner correctly.\n- \u00b7 Ask for a volunteer to share.\n- \u00b7 Repeat the pattern as time permits.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 To increase energy, partner people from different locations and have them stand throughout this exercise.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 It is not necessary for both partners to share. One speaker does not obligate the other.\n- \u00b7 When possible, sequentially call on persons from different quarters of the room because this causes listeners to adjust body positions to hear, thus maintaining energy.\n\n## Read and Example\n\nExplore and Discover\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nSummarize, interpret, and construct examples.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Letter off A and B.\n- \u00b7 Each partner reads the first paragraph.\n\n- \u00b7 Pairs generate examples of this idea in action.\n- \u00b7 A summarizes.\n- \u00b7 Repeat the pattern, alternating the summarizing role.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Structure as a trio with each person reading the paragraph, A and B giving examples and C paraphrasing and summarizing. Rotate roles.\n\nTIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Producing examples may be challenging for some individuals so always have at least a pair generating examples.\n\n## Say Something (Jerome Harste)\n\nExplore and Discover\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nSelect and interpret information and relate to member's experience.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Choose a partner.\n- \u00b7 Read silently and simultaneously to designated stopping points.\n- \u00b7 When each partner is ready, stop and 'say something.'\n- \u2218 The something might be a question, a brief summary, a key point, an interesting idea, or personal connection.\n- \u00b7 Continue the process until you have completed the selection.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 See the 'Key Concepts/Key Ideas' strategy for a more holistic approach to the construction of meaning.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Stop and share at the end of each paragraph for an incremental approach to the social construction of meaning.\n- \u00b7 Do not use with readings longer than four to five paragraphs.\n\n## Sort Cards\n\nExplore and Discover\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nGenerate, organize, display, and compare ideas.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 On your own generate examples of strategies used in successful meetings. One idea per 3 \u00d7 5 card.\n- \u00b7 Table groups share, categorize, label categories, and make a display.\n\n## ADD A MUSEUM TOUR\n\n- \u00b7 Each group selects one person to stay at table and answer questions.\n- \u00b7 Others tour the displays and search for new ideas.\n- \u00b7 Members return to home base and exchange information.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Other topics:\n- \u2218 Knowledge about any topic the group is about to address.\n- \u2218 Recollections and insights about any topic the group has already addressed.\n- \u2218 Considerations that should drive a decision. Then identify and explore values the considerations illuminate.\n- \u00b7 After a museum tour, tables identify and report themes in the data.\n- \u00b7 Eliminate the museum tour.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Levels the playing field in mixed groups.\n- \u00b7 Stress  rationale  for  the  activity  to  include  honoring  member  expertise,  leveling  the  playing field, equalizing member status, and getting a lot of information in a short period of time.\n\n## Strategy Harvest\n\nOrganize and Integrate\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nRecall, clarify, and construct.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 With a partner, review and clarify a list of strategies so you can explain them.\n- \u00b7 Select two to three strategies and develop applications for your work.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Assign task to an affinity group members that work together.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 When triple-track presenting is used, strategies will be recorded on flip charts as they are used.\n- \u00b7 Few learners apply without specific tasks like this, which invite application thinking.\n\n## Text Rendering\n\nExplore and Discover\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nSelect, interpret, explain, and synthesize.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Members review a document and highlight a sentence, a phrase, and a word that are meaningful.\n- \u00b7 Provide strips of paper of varying lengths to accommodate a sentence, phrase, or word.\n- \u00b7 Each member, in round-robin fashion, posts and explains his or her strips.\n- \u00b7 Once all the strips are posted and explained, the group agrees on one sentence, one phrase, and one word that are most meaningful.\n\n## ALTERNATIVES\n\n- \u00b7 Instead of sentence strips, have a facilitator guide a conversation as first a sentence is shared by each, then a phrase and a word. Record the phrase and word on chart paper. The group shares insights about the document.\n- \u00b7 In either alternative use summarizing insights or selection of final sentence, phrase, and word.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 When working with a large group, divide into clusters of about six, allowing the small groups to share results.\n\n## Triad Inquiry\n\nExplore and Discover\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nSelect, interpret, paraphrase, and analyze/categorize.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Trios read and highlight first section of text.\n- \u00b7 Person A says, 'A key point for me is___.'\n- \u00b7 Person B pauses and then paraphrases.\n- \u00b7 Person C pauses and then asks, 'What are some things that make that important to you?'\n- \u00b7 Rotate roles and continue process with remaining sections.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Person C scripts the paraphrase for later analysis.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Connect the two purposes-conversations about data and skills practice.\n\n## Trios PPPI (Pause, Paraphrase, Pause, Inquire)\n\nOrganize and Integrate\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nRecognize, interpret, and construct skills practice (paraphrasing).\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Letter off A and B and C.\n- \u00b7 Each reads a section of text.\n\n- \u00b7 A reads the text selection aloud.\n- \u00b7 B pauses and paraphrases.\n- \u00b7 C pauses and inquires.\n- \u00b7 Repeat the pattern alternating roles.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\nA can share a key idea, B can pause and paraphrase, C can pause and inquire.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Encourage A to choose one of the productive areas for inquiry such as: personal meaning, values, goals, consequences, examples, counter-examples, applications.\n\n## Two Sides of the Coin\n\nSelf-management\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nManage one's inner states during discourse.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Direct members to write one word on a 3 \u00d7 5 card indicating how they want to feel at the end of this meeting.\n- \u00b7 Next, on the other side of the card, members write a short phrase or 'self-talk' that they will use to guide their choices and attain their outcomes.\n- \u00b7 In small groups and in round-robin fashion (one speaker at a time with no responses or comments from others) members share side one of their cards.\n- \u00b7 Next, in round-robin fashion (one speaker at a time with no responses or comments from others) members share side two of their cards.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 After  about  an  hour,  invite  members  to  examine  their  cards  and  in  small  groups,  report  in round-robin fashion (one speaker at a time with no responses or comments from others) their goal, strategy and current progress.\n- \u00b7 At the end of the day, members may, in small groups, reflect on their strategies, outcomes, and transferable learning.\n\n## Vocabulary Review\n\nOrganize and Integrate\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nRecall.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Ask individuals to brainstorm and list words they've learned in the work so far. The words can be new or have new meanings as a result of their learning. The more words the better. Participants should try to think of words others might not remember.\n\n- \u00b7 After a few minutes instruct participants to stand up, take their list and a pencil with them, and share their list with one other person.\n- \u00b7 For every word that one person has on their list that the other does not, a point gets tallied. After sharing lists with one person, participants continue sharing until time is called.\n- \u00b7 At the end of ten to fifteen minutes, participants sit down and tally their points.\n- \u00b7 Share at the table and determine who at the table collected the most points. (Do not ask for a table total.)\n- \u00b7 Survey the room by asking each table to identify the person with the most points.\n- \u00b7 Acknowledge the highest point person and ask them to identify the words on their list that received the most points.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Provide a small prize to the winner.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 If more than one person in the room has close to the same number of points, acknowledge all of them.\n- \u00b7 Be sure to emphasize that the brainstorm includes both new words and words that have new meanings.\n\n## What Comes Up\n\nOrganize and Integrate\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nInvestigate, compare, and apply instructional concepts to student work.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Arrange six to twenty people seated in a circle with two or three pieces of recent student work.\n- \u00b7 Presenter offers first piece of student work (read or posted or copies distributed). Participants review.\n- \u00b7 Presenter asks, 'What comes up for you when you examine this piece of work?' Provide a few moments think time.\n- \u00b7 Each responds to the question in turn. No repeats.\n- \u00b7 Open conversation in which members compare observations, relate elements of student work to local standards, hypothesize about student thinking, and generate teaching ideas.\n- \u00b7 The process is repeated with a second piece of student work and perhaps a third.\n- \u00b7 Close the conversation with a summary of new understandings or learnings.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Allow about thirty to forty-five minutes.\n\n1-2-6 Generate Ideas in Large Groups\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nIn large groups of sixty to two hundred, engage each member in generating ideas for decision making.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Give a written task to individuals such as, name one area we could work on this year (two minutes).\n- \u00b7 Pairs meet, share, and agree to one statement (six minutes).\n- \u00b7 Each pair meets with two other pairs, shares and agrees to one statement (twelve minutes).\n- \u00b7 Each group of six records their one idea on a sentence strip (eight to twelve words) and posts in the front of the room.\n- \u00b7 The facilitator leads an inquiry session, in which members can ask questions for clarification. Authors of the item being questioned respond.\n- \u00b7 Next the facilitator leads an advocacy session in which members advocate for items they feel are most important.\n- \u00b7 Rank ideas by using the rule of one-third (see in this appendix) to determine the few items of greatest interest to the group.\n- \u00b7 Name a subcommittee to gather data on these items and bring back information or recommendations on which should be persued.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Have pairs converse before either inquiry or advocacy.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Individuals, not groups, should inquire, advocate, and rank.\n- \u00b7 See the 'Focusing Four Strategy' for details of this structure with smaller groups.\n\n## Around the Room and Back Again\n\nGenerate Ideas with Physical Activity\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nUse novelty and physical activity to energize idea generation.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Write one response only to a prompt.\n- \u00b7 Next, without taking notes, move about the room and share your response, mentally cataloguing the responses of others.\n- \u00b7 When your head is full, or when signaled, return to your seat and list the responses you heard from others.\n- \u00b7 Next, table groups pool responses.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Connect the prompt to something being studied (e.g., things that go wrong in meetings) and refer back to the pooled list during the presentation.\n\n## Brainstorm\n\nSafely Generate Ideas\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nCollective creativity without debate.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Members call out ideas while a recorder charts them.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Post topics or questions on charts.\n- \u00b7 Cluster members into groups of three to five and have each group stand before a chart with a marker color that is different from other groups.\n- \u00b7 Each group calls out ideas that are recorded on the charts.\n- \u00b7 Each group moves clockwise to the next chart, reviews what the previous group(s) has written, and adds ideas with the color pen with which they first recorded.\n- \u00b7 Members take a gallery walk to read all posted ideas.\n\n## HISTORY AND WARNING\n\n- \u00b7 Brainstorming was invented in 1984 by Alex Osborne who theorized that a squad could generate more ideas than individuals by 'storming' the objective without criticism of others' ideas. More recent studies have found that free association activities without dissent lead to mostly predictable ideas and that imagination can be stimulated by conflict. A 2003 study by Nemeth at the University of California at Berkley found that teams encouraged to debate brainstormed ideas generated 20 percent more ideas than those that withheld criticism. This does not mean that traditional brainstorming processes should not be used. On the contrary, most people are more creative when working in teams. Familiar brainstorming processes provide voice, they\n\nstart  projects  from  members'  concerns  and  information,  therefore  representing  a  vital  stage in collaborative work. See 'Brainstorm and Critique' for a brainstorming format that safely includes criticism.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Stress that brainstorming means that there is no talking about the items, but rather the groups are to just list items. Even mature groups tend to forget this.\n\n## Brainstorm Modalities\n\nSafely Generate Ideas\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nCollective creativity on a topic using modalities as a lens.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Define the subject.\n- \u00b7 Give everyone a minute or two to think.\n- \u00b7 Invite members to call out ideas.\n- \u00b7 A member records ideas on flip chart.\n- \u00b7 Code the first ten ideas as either visual, auditory, or kinesthetic.\n- \u00b7 Compute a ratio for each modality.\n- \u00b7 Brainstorm again, focusing on the least represented modality.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Use paired conversations for think time.\n- \u00b7 Have pairs or small groups brainstorm; code and brainstorm again instead of working as a full group.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Explain that considering the topic from the least used perspective will bring fresh ideas to the surface.\n\n## Brainstorm Questions\n\nSafely Generate Ideas for Inquiry\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nDevelop lenses for inquiry.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Define the subject.\n- \u00b7 Give everyone a minute or two to think.\n- \u00b7 Invite members to call out questions.\n- \u00b7 A member records questions on flip chart.\n- \u00b7 Categorize the questions and determine what information is needed and how it might be gathered.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Use paired conversations for think time.\n- \u00b7 Have the work done in pairs or small groups.\n- \u00b7 Precede the activity with dialogue.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Explain that generating questions can illuminate the group's work.\n\n## Brainstorm and Critique\n\nGenerate Ideas\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nEnrich idea generation with psychologically safe critiques.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Instruct the group of brainstorming research (see chapter 6 and 'History and Warnings' under the brainstorm strategy). Brainstorming as commonly practiced has been found to be only partially effective, asserts Paulus (2000). Researchers find that idea generation and idea quality increases when after traditional brainstorming, members individually study the list thinking of downsides or alternatives.\n- \u00b7 Define the subject.\n- \u00b7 Give everyone a minute or two to think.\n- \u00b7 Brainstorm in which members call out ideas without commenting or questioning other items on the list.\n- \u00b7 Provide time in which members silently critique items, and then share and discuss.\n\n## ALTERNATIVES\n\n- \u00b7 Instruct trios to offer critiques, downsides or counter arguments for as many ideas as possible within a time frame (twelve to fifteen minutes), report, and process by full groups.\n- \u00b7 Arrange the recording sheets in such a way that small groups can move to the sheets and record their ideas.\n- \u00b7 Use the rule of one-third to identify the top few ideas. Critique these.\n\n## Carousel Interview\n\nGenerate Information About a Group\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nSurvey and explore a group's concerns or interests.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Prepare interview-recording sheets, one for each question.\n- \u00b7 Groups of six, each person with one question.\n- \u00b7 Round 1-write a response to your own question in the top space.\n\n- \u00b7 Round 2-1 and 2 interview each other; 3 and 4 interview each other, 5 and 6 interview each other.\n- \u00b7 Round 3-1 and 3; 2 and 5; 4 and 6.\n- \u00b7 Round 4-1 and 4; 2 and 6; 3 and 5.\n- \u00b7 Round 5-1 and 5; 2 and 4; 3 and 6.\n- \u00b7 Round 6-1 and 6; 2 and 3, 4 and 5.\n- \u00b7 Join others with the same question. Share the responses and create a synthesizing statement. Be prepared to share your statement with the large group.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Groups of four, each person with own question.\n- \u00b7 Have groups create a graphic to share with the large group, rather than a statement.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Provide recording page for each question, six spaces on each page.\n- \u00b7 Make sure questions are open-ended and varied.\n\n## In and Out of the Frame\n\nGenerate Information Key to Planning or Problem Solving\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nIdentify and explore frames of reference other groups and members of this group may be holding.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Form groups of four to six persons.\n- \u00b7 Stand before charts showing large rectangle.\n- \u00b7 Group members brainstorm associations with the topic. Use only one pen color.\n- \u00b7 Stop. Categorize the brainstormed items. Record categories in the top portion of chart.\n- \u00b7 Assign each group another frame of reference as a lens, based on other perspectives that might need to be considered such as parents, students, community members, etc.\n- \u00b7 With a new pen color, circle the ideas in the frame that this new group might have named had they been present.\n- \u00b7 Below the frame add ideas this new group might have added.\n- \u00b7 Reflect. Ask, 'How might knowledge of these other perspectives influence planning and action on the topic under consideration?'\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Use to plan new initiatives.\n- \u00b7 Think about this framing map as a way of anticipating different perceptions and using knowledge of those perceptions in communicating, planning, and action.\n\n## Paired Verbal Fluency (see also under Activate and Engage)\n\nGenerate Ideas\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nPrimes the pump for full group conversation.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Form pairs.\n- \u00b7 Describe the process:\n- \u2218 A and B will take turns responding to a prompt asking for ideas on a topic.\n- \u2218 At a signal, one will speak and one will listen.\n- \u2218 At a signal, the other will speak while the first speaker listens.\n- \u2218 Each time, no one is allowed to repeat anything that was said by the other.\n- \u2218 Check for clarification.\n- \u00b7 Repeat the cycle two or three times:\n- \u2218 First round sixty seconds each.\n- \u2218 Second round forty seconds each.\n- \u2218 Third round twenty seconds each.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Prompts might ask for solutions, concerns, assumptions.\n\n## Pyramid\n\nFind Common Elements in Member Thinking\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nGive individual input to develop group thinking.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Give a written task to individuals.\n- \u00b7 Pairs meet and share common elements.\n- \u00b7 Quartets meet and share common elements.\n- \u00b7 Octets meet and share common elements with large group.\n- \u00b7 The work of the octets can be charted for large group processing.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 It is difficult for groups larger than eight to find common elements. If there is lack of consensus when charts are shared with the large group, time for dialogue should be scheduled.\n\n## Sensing Interviews\n\nGenerate Information Key to Planning or Problem Solving\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nLearn about the culture of a work group: its pride, perceived problems, and recommendations.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Arrange for thirty-minute confidential interviews with affected individuals.\n- \u00b7 Advise that sources of information will remain confidential, but if the same idea is heard from three or more people it will be shared with the full group without identifying authors.\n- \u00b7 Ask: 'What are you feeling good about here? What problems exist? What recommendations do you have?'\n- \u00b7 Organize the data and 'publish' it with the full group. Display ideas on flip charts.\n- \u00b7 Ask if you got the information right in order to start conversation about the data.\n- \u00b7 Paraphrase and inquire as members offer 'corrections' to the data. If appropriate, change the text on the flip charts.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Publish the data in text for pairs to read and explore before full group conversation.\n- \u00b7 Share the data with the leader; the leader shares the data and his or her analysis with the group.\n- \u00b7 Facilitator might engage in 'Public Coaching' with the leader.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Have small groups talk about the data if comments are not easily forthcoming; then engage the full group in conversation.\n- \u00b7 Use when entering a new group as a leader or when problems exist within a group, but information is not being shared about it.\n\n## Stem Completion\n\nExplore and Discover\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nGenerate and report a group's perceptions of itself.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Members complete a thought from a prompt. For example: 'I believe my culture affects my coworkers by . . .' or 'In order to be more inclusive we should . . .'\n- \u00b7 Pairs or small groups share and explore meanings from responses to the prompts.\n- \u00b7 Small groups summarize and report.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Change groups and share again.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Select stems that would be psychologically safe for members to talk about.\n\n## Stir the Classroom\n\nRecover Ideas and Concepts\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nRecall, discern, integrate, and report information.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Arrange group members around the perimeter of the room in groups of four.\n- \u00b7 Number off one to four in each cluster.\n- \u00b7 Clusters respond to prompt.\n- \u00b7 At a signal, one member moves to the next cluster to bring information from the home group and learn information from the new group.\n- \u00b7 Repeat the pattern with new prompts for the new group.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Conduct the strategy with clusters seated at tables instead of standing.\n- \u00b7 Can also be used to review learned material-prompts would include recall, apply, and assess questions.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Draw from a deck of playing cards to randomly select the next person in each group to move.\n- \u00b7 Benefits wane after three or four rounds.\n\n## Dialogue Discuss ~Decide\n\nThe term discourse with origins in Middle English (denoting the process of reasoning) encompasses both dialogue and discussion. While the outcome of discussion is decision; the processes of discussing and deciding are distinct. For example; in discussing one may compare features of a program; is deciding, one chooses one over the other in part from what was learned in the comparisons. We have clustered the three functions of 'dialogue; discuss and decide under the broad category of discourse.\n\n## Discourse\n\nActivate and Engage\n\nProcess Text and Information\n\nGenerate Ideas\n\nDialogue\n\nDiscuss\n\nDecide\n\nPlan\n\nSummarize\n\nAsk for Sabotage Ideas\n\nTest Commitments\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nAchieve realistic commitments.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 State the agreement the group has made.\n- \u00b7 Say, 'I know none of you would ever deliberately sabotage this agreement, but if you were to, under what conditions might you make that choice?'\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Ask pairs or small groups to talk about this question.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Brings to the surface hidden reservations or unconsciously held conditions under which members would not keep an agreement.\n- \u00b7 This  data  provides  an  opportunity  to  clarify  misunderstandings,  develop  ideas  to  overcome perceived obstacles, or reshape the decision.\n\n## Assumptions Inquiry\n\nTest Ideas for Workability\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nPush beyond first easy and simple solutions.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Participants set aside two to four 'good ideas' from a generated list.\n- \u00b7 Each idea is explored for conditions in which the idea would be productive and conditions in which it would be counterproductive.\n- \u00b7 Discuss how good ideas are rarely rules, but instead represent principles.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Use the process above to select ideas that address the needs of the group.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Especially when the group has generated the idea list, stress that this is not a right or wrong conversation.\n\n## Assumptions Wall\n\nLocate Assumptions Sources\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nUnderstand own and others' assumptions on a topic.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Individuals list assumptions about a topic.\n- \u00b7 Have participants choose one that most informs their behavior.\n- \u00b7 Participants write their choice on sentence strip in eight to twelve words.\n- \u00b7 Post assumptions on wall.\n\n- \u00b7 Facilitator models inquiry (approachable voice, plurals, invitational stems, and positive presuppositions) and inquiry categories (importance, under what conditions, source, data, beliefs, values). For example: 'I'm curious about that assumption. Whose is it? Help me understand what may be some reasons you value that highly.'\n- \u00b7 Individuals inquire about posted assumptions in round-robin fashion.\n\n## VARITIONS\n\n- \u00b7 The group lists assumptions related to a topic. One to three assumptions are selected. The group makes inquiries about these assumptions. The group then identifies implications of the selected assumptions.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Use groups of four to six.\n- \u00b7 Caution the group not to beat to death the first assumption explored.\n- \u00b7 Model approachable voice.\n- \u00b7 Intervene and correct whenever the inquiry begins to sound like interrogation and disbelief.\n\n## Card Stack and Shuffle\n\nClarify and Understand Members' Thinking\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nIdentify implications of assumptions.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Participants complete two stems, such as 'Good student writers . . .' and 'Good teachers of writing . . .'\n- \u00b7 Each response is written on a separate 3 \u00d7 5 card.\n- \u00b7 Table groups, stack cards, and shuffle them. Pass them to the table on your right.\n- \u00b7 Person 'A' selects a card and reads it to the group.\n- \u00b7 Members identify possible assumptions related to the response on the card.\n- \u00b7 Group members then explore the implications of those assumptions.\n- \u00b7 Repeat the pattern with 'B,' 'C,' and 'D' drawing cards in turn.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Use only one stem.\n- \u00b7 Preface this activity with instruction about assumptions and implications.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Demonstrate drawing a card and eliciting assumptions.\n- \u00b7 Demonstrate exploring implications of one of those assumptions.\n- \u00b7 Encourage paraphrasing and inquiring.\n- \u00b7 This can be a scaffold for dialogue.\n\n## Causal Loop Diagram\n\nRecognize that the Way a Problem Is Defined Can Be the Source of the Problem\n\n## PURPOSES AND INTENTIONS\n\nExamine underlying values, beliefs, and goals when repeated attempts at resolution are unsuccessful.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Advise members that:\n- \u2218 In single-loop learning groups modify their actions according to the difference between expected and obtained outcomes.\n- \u2218 In double_loop learning groups question the values, assumptions, and policies that led to the actions in the first place.\n- \u00b7 Identify and list the intended and unintended results of an action.\n- \u00b7 Identify and list the mismatches between intentions and outcome.\n- \u00b7 Through dialogue, question ways in which the framing of the problem, assumptions, values, and policies might have affected the outcome.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 This can be an appropriate time to talk about other language forms such as using 'and' instead of 'but' when responding to a previous speaker. 'But' conveys the message that the previous speaker was wrong.\n\n## Corners\n\nReveal Preferences\n\n## PURPOSES AND INTENTIONS\n\nIdentify, make public, and process members' preferences.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Post labels in corners of room.\n- \u00b7 Participants move to corner of greatest interest.\n- \u00b7 Form clusters of two or three. Ask participants to explore and share their reasoning for selecting this topic.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Can also use three or five 'corners/locations' instead of four.\n- \u00b7 After a period of time, instruct people to move to the corner of their second choice and repeat the sharing in clusters of two or three.\n- \u00b7 Ask people to stand in the corner that represents their position on an issue.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Learning is enhanced when participants identify interests within a topic.\n\n## ALTERNATIVES\n\n- \u00b7 Use corners to represent different levels of agreement with a proposal.\n\n## Delve and Dialogue\n\nText-based Learning\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nDeepen understanding of concepts and others through a structured dialogue.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Read a selection of text and make connections to some aspect of your work.\n- \u00b7 In groups, share some of your connections.\n- \u00b7 Honor the spirit of inquiry with pausing, paraphrasing, and posing questions.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Assign this to trios instead of a group.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Review principles of dialogue prior to starting this process.\n- \u00b7 Because speaking, not listening, is a common default pattern, you may want to periodically stop the action and ask people to notice what is happening in the conversation, or engage them in the Round Robin Reflection described in this appendix.\n\n## Energy Sources Team Survey\n\nSelf-assessment\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nSelf-monitor and self-modify five group energy sources.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Team members individually respond to questions about their team.\n- \u00b7 Tabulate scores for each Energy Source for each person.\n- \u00b7 Use the data to dialogue about its meaning.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Use either an electronic version or paper version.\n- \u00b7 It may be useful to calculate a mean, median, and mode.\n- \u00b7 Use the instrument in a prescriptive manner to determine what actions might be taken to increase certain Energy Sources in the group.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Emphasize the data is non-evaluative and serves as baseline impressions.\n- \u00b7 Use the data to dialogue about its meaning.\n- \u00b7 Consider the strengths of the group as well as discrepancies.\n- \u00b7 It is particularly useful to do item analysis.\n- \u00b7 When items are considered, they become sources of understanding for goal setting.\n- \u00b7 Copies and scoring can be purchased at www.thinkingcollaborative.com.\n\n## First Turn/Last Turn\n\nDialogue Scaffold\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nThis scaffold for dialogue enlists many cognitive and affective skills necessary for dialogue. This activity  requires  cognitive,  emotional,  and  social  skills  including  turn-taking,  self-management, comprehension, interpretation, application, relating, integrating, metacognition, and appreciation of others.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Form groups of four to eight.\n- \u00b7 Silently and simultaneously, members read a section of text and highlight three to four items that have particular meaning for them.\n- \u00b7 Facilitator names a person to start in each group.\n- \u00b7 In turn, members share one of their items but do not comment on it. They simply name it.\n- \u00b7 In round-robin fashion, group members comment about the identified item WITH NO CROSS TALK.\n- \u00b7 The initial  person  who  named  the  item  now  shares  his  or  her  thinking  about  the  item,  and therefore, gets the 'last turn.'\n- \u00b7 Repeat the pattern around the table.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 When possible, have members read the text before coming to the meeting. When they have read prior to the meeting, allow three to four minutes for them to 'review' what they marked. This can save face for those who forgot to read.\n- \u00b7 Reading sources can include journal articles, policy statements, mission statements, a sample of student work, or original writing by members on a common topic.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Select the first speaker geographically (e.g., the person sitting with their back most directly against that wall). Selection that is both structured and random can interrupt problematic patterns that occur in group dynamics, such as having one person always be the first responder.\n- \u00b7 Stress that there is no cross talk. Explain that when cross talk occurs, it takes the focus off the speaker, changes the topic, diminishes the speaker's influence, and interferes with listening.\n- \u00b7 Explain that structured dialogue allows members to develop the emotional skills and values needed for high-quality dialogue. This experiential learning will serve as a scaffold as participants learn to dialogue.\n- \u00b7 Monitor and intervene when cross talk occurs as groups begin.\n- \u00b7 Groups of six are ideal, sometimes four as a first experience.\n\n## Here's What, So What, Now What\n\nData Analysis\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nMove beyond data to implications.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Distribute a three-column worksheet.\n- \u00b7 Explain the purpose of each column: Here's What Is for specific data the group is working with; So What Is for an interpretation or meaning of the data; Now What can be a predication, implication or question for further study.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Structure the task to provide skills practice in paraphrasing and posing questions.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Provide an example and elaborate a response for each column.\n- \u00b7 Provide specific Here's What data such as '60 percent of female students scored X while 40 percent of male students scored Y,' or have groups generate their own data for this column.\n- \u00b7 In pairs or in small groups, members complete the Now What and So What columns.\n- \u00b7 Conduct a full group dialogue.\n\n## Inside Outside Circle (Spenser Kagan)\n\nExplore and Extend Ideas\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nIn the spirit of dialogue, small groups augment concepts.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Form inner circle facing outward and outer circle facing inward with one-to-one correspondence.\n\n- \u00b7 Provide a prompt such as 'Students in grade six should be able to . . .' or 'We could enhance student's sense of belonging by . . .'\n- \u00b7 Inner circle persons generate a response.\n- \u00b7 Outer circle persons paraphrase and extend the idea.\n- \u00b7 Outer circle people rotate clockwise three or four persons.\n- \u00b7 Outer circle people respond to the same prompt, while the inner circle paraphrases and extends.\n- \u00b7 Repeat the pattern with another prompt, if desired.\n- \u00b7 Have members be seated and respond to the prompt 'We are learning . . .'\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 If space does not permit one large set of circles, run activity in more than one circle.\n- \u00b7 Use to review or refine other skills such as pausing or posing questions to specify thinking.\n- \u00b7 Use as a preface to extended dialogue.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Demonstrate the double circle configuration with eight participants.\n\n## Left-Hand Column (Chris Argyris)\n\nSelf-assessment\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nIncrease awareness of personal assumptions, thoughts, and feelings that govern one's thinking and contribute to blocking hearing others.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 During dialogue, members maintain a split-sheet format for recording items in either a right- or left-hand column.\n- \u00b7 Record in the right-hand column data or ideas one wants to remember.\n- \u00b7 Record in the left-hand column what one notices about self-talk and reactions to the conversation.\n- \u00b7 Examples include, what I need to set aside in my listening in order to stay present; what are my intentions; what are my judgments; what am I feeling in the moment, and is the feeling evoked by a correct interpretation of the interaction, or am I responding to 'noise in my head' or personal history in some way; what are my assumptions; what can I learn about me from my reactions.\n\n## ALTERNATIVES\n\n- \u00b7 Provide members with two-column recording sheets with prompts in the left-hand column like assumptions, feelings, judgments, and supportive data.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Invite members to keep right-hand column, then reflect together on what they learned about themselves and dialogue.\n\n## Round-Robin Reflection\n\nSelf-assessment and Self-modification\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nDiscover thoughts, feelings, and internal talk influencing participation.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 At a stopping point or at the end of the meeting the facilitator asks, 'What were some of the decisions you made about when and how to participate, and what were some of the effects of those decisions on you and the group?'\n- \u00b7 Members reflect privately.\n- \u00b7 In round-robin fashion, each member shares one decision and the effects of the decision.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 During the round-robin the facilitator paraphrases and inquires: 'How did the effects of your decision compare to what you intended?' 'How might this be a pattern for you?' 'What might be some ways you can apply this learning to future meetings?'\n- \u00b7 Pairs share instead of full group.\n- \u00b7 Journal writing only.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Be clear that the prompt refers to decisions about participation, not the meeting content.\n- \u00b7 Members  self-direct  performance  improvements  through  this  process  faster  and  more  permanently  than  having  process  observers  report  participant  behaviors.  Teams  become  more accomplished.\n\n## Success Analysis\n\nReflection on Practice\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nGain insights into improving practice.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 In advance of the meeting, participants develop notes describing an area where they are finding success or making progress.\n- \u00b7 In the meeting, participants share their 'case studies' of successful work with a student or with a group of students.\n- \u00b7 In round-robin fashion, members share while colleagues take notes.\n- \u00b7 Next, colleagues paraphrase, then ask questions of clarification seeking specificity related to the presenter's language such as, 'When you said 'those students,' to which ones were you referring?'\n- \u00b7 Next, colleagues paraphrase then ask questions seeking elaboration such as, 'How did you know to move on at that point?' or 'What is your sense of the most catalytic decision you made?' or 'What are some learnings you are taking from this situation?'\n- \u00b7 Next, colleagues offer thoughts and ideas while presenter takes notes without responding.\n\n- \u00b7 Finally, the presenter initiates conversation with colleagues inquiring more deeply about their thoughts.\n- \u00b7 After the last round, the group summarizes what was learned and what can be applied from this session.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Use this process for events that were not successful.\n- \u00b7 Use with trios.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 A total round for one person should take about thirty minutes.\n- \u00b7 Use small groups of three to six members.\n- \u00b7 Expressed  judgments,  positive  or  negative,  are  more  threatening  than  data  or  open-ended, nonjudgmental questions.\n\n## Discourse\n\n## Discuss\n\nTo discuss is to talk about something with a group. Synonyms include converse, confer, exchange views, and deliberate. Its Latin root is discussus for struck asunder, or shaken. In organizations, discussions lead to decisions and are properly preceded by dialogues in which the purpose is to build understanding.\n\n## Appoint a Devil's Advocate (Doyle and Straus)\n\nHear Differing Views\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTION\n\nBreak 'Group Think.'\n\nMany people will not speak out at meetings for fear of retribution, low group trust, or just the fear of looking stupid. As a result 'group think' becomes the norm and poor decisions result. By appointing a devil's advocate, you give official permission for raising differing views.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 For each issue discussed, appoint the role of 'devil's advocate' with the function of offering differing views.\n- \u00b7 Rotate this role. Change for each topic or meeting.\n- \u00b7 At the end of the meeting explore the effects this role had on group thinking and make revisions if necessary, for the next time the role is used.\n\n## Close the Discussion\n\nClarify and Flexibility\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTION\n\nMembers are clear about when a discussion is to be closed.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Person in charge displays decision options:\n- \u2218 Participants can vote on whether to keep discussion going or not.\n- \u2218 Person in charge decides whether to end the discussion or extend it.\n- \u2218 Everyone gets one more chance to make a point.\n- \u2218 Continue the discussion, but limit it to a specific topic.\n- \u2218 Close the discussion if someone calls for closure and two others agree.\n- \u2218 Delegate the decision making to a subgroup.\n- \u2218 Talk until a predetermined time limit has been reached. Person in charge makes an executive decision if group hasn't decided by then.\n- \u00b7 Members explore advantages and drawbacks of each option.\n- \u00b7 Group selects an option to use on a regular basis.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Group selects a few options for consideration when approaching a decision.\n\nTIPS\n\n- \u00b7 The goal is efficiency, consistency, clarity, and flexibility.\n\n## Criteria Matrix\n\nGroup Decision\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nDecisions based on identified values.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Identify a decision you wish to make and the alternatives you are considering.\n- \u00b7 Identify the criteria you consider important.\n- \u00b7 Assign each criterion an importance score.\n- \u00b7 Determine the extent to which each alternative poses each criterion.\n- \u00b7 Express as High, Medium, or Low.\n- \u00b7 Assign number values such as High = 3, Medium = 2, and Low = 1.\n- \u00b7 Record on criteria matrix and analyze scores to see which alternative has the highest total points.\n- \u00b7 Based on your reaction to the selected alternative, determine next steps.\n\n## ALTERNATIVES\n\n- \u00b7 Assign point value to each criterion if some are more important than others.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Group needs only rough agreement on High, Medium, and Low ratings.\n- \u00b7 Should two alternatives appear to be equally desirable, add other criteria.\n\n| Criterion                                           | Alt. A   | Alt. B   | Alt. C   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Available resources                                 | H        | H        | H        |\n| Could serve as stimulus to an- other desired change | H        | M        | M        |\n| Staff readiness                                     | M        | L        | L        |\n| Congruence with Prog.

(See 'Criteria Matrix' in this appendix.)\n\nTIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Select an option before discussion begins.\n\n## Disagreement Grid\n\nDisagree Agreeably\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nMembers can disagree respectfully.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Ask participants  to  participate  in  the  next  activity  as  a  warm-up  to  conversations  in  which diverse opinions are held.\n- \u00b7 Draw a four-by-four grid on a chart. Ask participants to assume that each square is equal in dimension to the other squares.\n- \u00b7 Ask participants how many squares they see.\n- \u00b7 As each number is offered, write it on the chart margin without comment.\n- \u00b7 After  several  numbers  are  recorded,  stop.  Ask,  'Who  saw  (one  of  the  higher  numbers  of squares)? Would you please explain to the group where you see these squares?'\n- \u00b7 Mark on the grid as a member explains what they see.\n- \u00b7 Ask: 'Was the person who said sixteen wrong? Seventeen? Twenty-four?'\n- \u00b7 Addressing the whole group, say, 'As we move into the conversation that follows, let me suggest that when you have a difference of opinion you say, 'I see it a different way.''\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 This can be an appropriate time to talk about other language forms that can be used when disagreement occurs. Suggest participants use the word 'and' which implies addition, instead of 'but' which implies the first speaker is wrong.\n\n## Focusing Four\n\nAchieve Agreement\n\n(See Garmston, Dolcemascolo (2009) The Focusing Four: A Consensus Seeking Activity For Prioritizing: DVD Viewers Guide. www.thinkingcollaborative.)\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nEach member feels heard, understood, and contributes to decision.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Explain task, topic and process.\n- \u00b7 Check for understanding.\n- \u00b7 Brainstorm ideas and record on chart paper.\n- \u00b7 Push for between twelve and eighteen ideas.\n- \u00b7 Next, members ask questions of clarification. The 'author' responds.\n- \u00b7 Next members advocate for items.\n- \u00b7 Finally, use the rule of one-third to determine which items are of greatest interest to the group. Use a hand count. (See p. 261 for details)\n- \u00b7 Conclude by determining a process to narrow the choices down to one or two if necessary. See 'Close the Discussion' options in this appendix.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Occasionally have partners confer before a new step in the process begins.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Each step in the process must be kept separate.\n- \u00b7 Statements of advocacy must be stated in the positive, as in, 'I advocate for this because . . .' and never 'I don't like this because . . .'\n- \u00b7 Tell group they will be guided, not bound by the numbers. For example, in a group of fifteen members, item A gets nine counts and item B gets eleven; that may not be a sufficient enough difference to select B. In cases like this, the facilitator will ask the group how it wants to handle the situation.\n- \u00b7 See a detailed description of this process in the 'Adaptive Schools Syllabus,' useful for instructing groups.\n\n## Gatekeeping\n\nInvite Participation\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nOpen opportunities for quiet members to speak\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 A member notices that a colleague has not talked.\n- \u00b7 The member says, 'Booker, I'm aware you have not talked for a while. Is there anything you would like to add?'\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 'Monica, I know you served on a committee addressing this. Do you have anything you'd like to say?' or 'What might you like to add?'\n- \u00b7 'Ken, from where I'm sitting, your eyebrows look furrowed. What comments might you like to add?'\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Phrase the questions so that the colleague can gracefully decline to speak.\n\n## Issues Agenda\n\nIdentify Issues\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nIlluminating issues\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Brainstorm issues related to a project.\n- \u00b7 Dialogue on degrees of importance, desirable attention sequences, and connections.\n- \u00b7 Develop and agree to a timeline.\n\n## ALTERNATIVES\n\n- \u00b7 After brainstorming, develop a criteria matrix (appendix A) to analyze importance and attention sequences.\n- \u00b7 An issues agenda can be conducted informally focused only on topics to be addressed during the current meeting.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Remind  members  of  brainstorming  guidelines.  Even  experienced  groups  may  forget  these without a reminder.\n\n## Jigsaw Carousel\n\nInformation Processing: Exploring and Discovering\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Form groups, one for each concept (ex: If working with four concepts, will need four groups).\n- \u00b7 Each group describes a concept in its own words.\n- \u00b7 Give behavioral examples: what they would see and hear as indicators of this concept.\n- \u00b7 Have table groups identify and describe situations in school, life, or work in which it would be important to draw on this concept.\n- \u00b7 Pose questions intended to help others become aware of this concept in their life or work.\n- \u00b7 Have table groups create a logo or simile as a reminder for this concept (e.g., 'Complete the simile: This concept is like a ________ because________').\n- \u00b7 Compose a brief statement or slogan that summarizes the concept.\n- \u00b7 Report work to full assembly.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Provide an advance organizer for the entire process.\n- \u00b7 Have each member be responsible for learning one concept and then teaching it to others.\n\n## Lasso (Doyle and Straus)\n\nLanguage Specificity\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTION\n\nMembers gain clarity on terms.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Circle or lasso words on flip chart that lack specificity.\n- \u00b7 Invite members to define the words within the context of the group's work.\n- \u00b7 Ex. 'How to solve drug use at schools.' Ask what do you mean by drugs, which ones, which schools,  what  age  levels,  and  even  what  do  you  mean  by  solve:  reduce,  eliminate  entirely, prevent, etc.\n\n## ALTERNATIVES\n\n- \u00b7 Ask pairs or small groups to define the words and report out for group reinforcement or adoption.\n- \u00b7 Record the definitions on chart paper.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Classes of language most useful to question for specificity: vague nouns or pronouns; vague verbs  or  action  words;  universal  quantifiers  like  all,  everyone,  never;  modal  operators  like must, have to, can't; and comparators like better, worse, greater.\n\n- \u00b7 As a general rule, clarify vague nouns and pronouns first.\n- \u00b7 If there is an 'and' in the definition, make sure you are not trying to solve two problems at once.\n\n## Na\u00efve Question-(also a group member strategy)\n\nDirect Topic or Process Back on Track\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nMembers influence group's fidelity to meeting standards (one process at time, one topic at a time, clarity about decision making, etc.). (See chapter 4.)\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 A group member asks a na\u00efve question to which the group responds. Examples are: Who is making this decision? How much detail do we need to move this item? What parts of this issue live in our area of responsibility? Who will do what by when? And is there something we are not talking about?\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 The facilitator says to the group: 'Given what you know about meeting standards, what seems to be going on right now?'\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 A na\u00efve question is one asked with innocence, a desire to know, and in a melodic approachable voice. This is a powerful way for group members to offer corrections to group work.\n\n## Set and Test Working Agreements\n\nGenerate and Adhere to Agreements\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTION\n\nMembers influence group process.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 A group member says, 'I notice that our meetings are not starting on time. Could we make an agreement to start on time? (Set agreement.)\n- \u00b7 The facilitator leads a conversation in which the group develops an agreement.\n- \u00b7 In a later meeting a group member says, 'I'd like to talk about the agreement we made to start our meetings on time. I notice we are not doing it. What needs to happen to keep our agreement?' (Test agreement.)\n- \u00b7 The facilitator leads a conversation in which the group develops an agreement.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 A group member requests this topic be placed on the agenda.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 This relates to the group member capability-know when to self-assert and when to integrate.\n\n## Setting Group Working Agreements\n\nEstablish Ground Rules\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nMember ownership of working agreements.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Sometimes, when a group is beginning a long-term relationship, invite the group to develop their own working agreements.\n- \u00b7 Brainstorm and record possible agreements.\n- \u00b7 Clarify brainstormed items.\n- \u00b7 Select the five to seven most important to group success.\n- \u00b7 Post these at each meeting or place on each printed agenda.\n- \u00b7 Later, should members stray from an agreement, the facilitator or a member intervenes.\n\n## ALTERNATIVES\n\n- \u00b7 For mature groups this might convey negative attitudes about the group's capacity. When this is so, or when a group is working well, do not use this.\n- \u00b7 For ad hoc groups suggest a set of predetermined working agreements such as demonstrate mutual success, employ skillful listening, develop sufficient consensus, and ask if the group is willing to adopt them. Define each set of terms.\n\n## Thumbs-Up\n\nPoll the Group\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nDip-stick group sentiment.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 The facilitator or any member can call for a thumbs-up to determine the degree of agreement the group has on an item.\n- \u00b7 Thumbs up means yes, thumbs down means no, thumbs held sideways means not sure or it doesn't matter.\n- \u00b7 Call for a show of thumbs.\n- \u00b7 Announce the result.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Use as a poll to learn what direction/thinking the group is favoring prior to further conversation.\n- \u00b7 Use as a mechanism for sufficient consensus.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Ask members with thumbs held sideways to explain their reasoning.\n- \u00b7 Ask members with thumbs held down what would need to be modified in the proposal for them give it thumbs-up.\n\n## Discourse\n\nDiscussions often culminate in decisions. This set of strategies is used when the leader desires that a group be involved in either recommending a decision, making a decision, or having subgroups decide and bring a decision back to the full group for approval. Decisions by vote are perceived as the least useful, and often counterproductive in that issues are often not fully explored and votes produce both winners and losers. Those who did not vote on an item typically have low commitment and motivation to follow through. Sufficient consensus is the most practical participative approach to decision making in school settings. Rarely would a group have the time to reach full or 100 percent consensus on an item, so reaching a level in which 80 percent agree is considered sufficient to move along. Critically important in this approach is that the voices of those who do not agree are heard, and they know others understand their reservations. Sufficient consensus, or full consensus for that matter, is not designed to make people happy but rather to reach a decision that represents the best feasible course of action.\n\nThis form of decision making involves everyone clearly understanding the situation at hand, analyzing  the  relevant  facts  together,  and  then  jointly  developing  solutions  that  represent  the group's best thinking about an optimal decision. Dialogue, a lot of listening, and the understanding of divergent opinions precede it. Sufficient consensus generates a decision about which everyone says, 'I can live with it.'\n\nParticipative decision-making takes longer than decisions made independently from a leader, but requires very little time in gaining acceptance by a group. Participant decision-making is used in situations in which choices affect behaviors of members; complex decisions are under consideration affecting several groups of people; and when understanding, commitment, and motivation to implement are desired.\n\n## 100% Consensus (Bob Chadwick)\n\nFull Consensus on Guiding Documents such as Mission Statements or Values\n\n## PURPOSES AND INTENTIONS\n\nCommitment of each member to adoption of a document.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 In a group of six or less, invite someone to volunteer to be a facilitator and someone to be a scribe.\n- \u00b7 Define the facilitator's role as calling on people and keeping the process intact. The scribe's role is to chart exactly what each person says, then make the exact corrections requested by subsequent group members.\n- \u00b7 The facilitator poses a question such as, What should be the role of the project leader?' or 'How shall we define completion?'\n- \u00b7 In round-robin fashion, members are called on to contribute one sentence which is recorded word-for-word by the scribe.\n\n- \u00b7 Before the process is complete, both the facilitator and scribe can have someone briefly take their roles while they contribute a sentence.\n- \u00b7 When all sentences are charted, the facilitator asks, 'Is there anyone who cannot live with this as stated?'\n- \u00b7 Members may raise their hand, and offer different wording for parts of the sentence. Without consultation, the scribe scratches out the original and adds the new.\n- \u00b7 The facilitator asks again, 'Is there anyone who cannot live with the first sentence?' The process continues until no more changes are suggested for the first sentence.\n- \u00b7 The facilitator repeats the process for the second sentence.\n- \u00b7 The process is repeated for all the remaining sentences.\n\n## ALTERNATIVES\n\n- \u00b7 For larger groups, have subgroups work on the same task-report results to the full group, then have the scribes draft a statement containing all the words of the several versions.\n- \u00b7 Develop a full paragraph before editing.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Schedule a couple of hours for this strategy.\n- \u00b7 Don't wordsmith. Request corrections only if the corrections refine the meaning.\n- \u00b7 Do not 'go along' with something you are uncomfortable with.\n- \u00b7 This will go slow at first. About midway through it will pick up speed.\n\n## Combine Opposites\n\nDecisions\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nSubgroups resolve impasse without audience.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Use when the group is stuck. Ask if two sets of persons with divergent views would be willing to step outside and bring a recommendation back to the group.\n- \u00b7 Ask the group if this recommendation is agreeable.\n- \u00b7 Determine a time for the subgroup to converse. Their choices are: now, outside the meeting room, or later at a break. The only limitation is that the recommendation must be made today.\n- \u00b7 Clarify the subgroup's decision-making authority with the full group. Determine whether the subgroup will be making a decision by which the group will abide or bring a recommendation for group consideration.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Request or suggest that certain members serve on the committee. Asking the most impassioned voice to serve increases the likelihood of group acceptance.\n- \u00b7 Set a time limit for the subgroup.\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nReduce decision complexity\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Assuming members have clarified items on a list, ask, 'Are there any items you would be okay removing?'\n- \u00b7 When a member names an item, ask if anyone objects. If not, remove the item.\n- \u00b7 If there is an objection, do not remove the item. No discussion required.\n- \u00b7 When this process is complete, move to the next step in the decision-making process.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Explain that this process saves the group the time of talking about items in which the group has limited interest.\n\n## Existing State-Desired State Map\n\nDecisions\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nFocus on outcomes\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Display a desired state map, as shown below.\n- \u00b7 Explain that defining the desired state establishes a goal and is more important than exploring why the problem exists.\n- \u00b7 The group names a desired state in broad terms.\n- \u00b7 Next develop a behavioral description. What would one see and hear when the desired state is achieved?\n- \u00b7 Next identify the resources needed to achieve the desired state. Consider skills, knowledge, and behavior.\n- \u00b7 Select the most catalytic of resources and develop a plan for developing them.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Generate a description of the existing state, and then describe the desired state as a direct contrast to existing state elements.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 The facilitator should preview the stages and sequence of thinking required in this approach.\n- \u00b7 When members do not have the same information about an issue, it is useful to describe the existing state from the various perspectives. Otherwise, public display of the existing state is rarely of great value unless using the direct contrast approach described as an alternative.\n\n## Eliminate the Negative\n\nDecisions\n\n## Forced Choice Stickers I\n\nDecisions\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nProvide interactive decision-making protocol\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 List options on flip chart.\n- \u00b7 Distribute an equal amount of stickers to each member.\n- \u00b7 Instruct members to spend all their stickers.\n- \u00b7 Members place stickers near preferred options.\n- \u00b7 The stickers represent a vote and are binding. See variations.\n\n## Forced Choice Stickers II\n\nDecisions\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nProvide advocacy and interactive decision-making protocol\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Chart and post various options from which to select.\n- \u00b7 Invite members to stand by the chart of their first choice. Ask members to talk about why they value this option. Have each group select a spokesperson.\n- \u00b7 Each spokesperson gives a brief advocacy statement.\n- \u00b7 Entertain questions of clarification.\n- \u00b7 Provide each member with an equal amount of stickers.\n- \u00b7 Stickers are spent.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 The group examines sticker distribution and decides which few options should receive further consideration and conversation.\n- \u00b7 Post options on several flip charts. Subgroups stand by options representing their choices and tell group rationale for their choice.\n- \u00b7 After advocating and inquiring about members' choices, fresh stickers are distributed and spent.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Some members will want to know if they can spend all their stickers on one option. Discourage this.\n- \u00b7 It is acceptable to place more than one of one's stickers on an item.\n- \u00b7 Prior dialogue is valuable.\n\n## Freeing Stuck Groups\n\nDecisions\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nFacilitate decision-making\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 The facilitator asks, 'What's stopping us from making a decision?' or 'Who would be willing to meet with (name) and (name) and develop a proposal for the next meeting?' or 'Are you willing to give the subcommittee the authority to make that decision?' or 'Would it be agreeable to the group if we asked (name) to bring us more information before we proceed?' or 'I think this is a decision for (name). Shall we ask her to make it?'\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Group members can also pose these questions.\n- \u00b7 See 'Na\u00efve Questions' in this appendix.\n- \u00b7 See 'Close the Discussion' options in this appendix.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Identify, when possible, the time available in the meeting to reach closure.\n\n## Is/Is Not (Doyle and Straus)\n\nDecisions\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nIdentify most relevant data\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 In one column write the facts that are known about a problem, where it is, what its effects are, when it occurs, and so on. For example, the boys scored higher than the girls in four of the five test batteries.\n- \u00b7 In a second column write facts that are known to not be part of the problem. For example, boys and girls are doing equally well in daily assignments.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Small groups generate is and is nots. Report and agree on the most significant examples.\n- \u00b7 Follow this with data gathering based on the is/is not analysis.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Provide categories for 'is': where, when, to what extent, and with whom does the problem occur?\n- \u00b7 Provide categories for 'is not': where, when, to what extent, and with whom does this not occur? Therefore, what might explain the pattern of occurrence and nonoccurrence?\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nEliminate decision obstacles\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 The group is polarized on two options.\n- \u00b7 Ask if anyone can suggest a third option (C) that might contain what seems to be attractive about the first two (A and B).\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 List desirable features of A.\n- \u00b7 List desirable features of B.\n- \u00b7 Have small groups generate options that contain the positive aspects of A and B while minimizing the negative aspects of each.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 If the group remains stuck, use a criteria matrix shown in the appendix.\n\n## Paired Weighting\n\nDecisions\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nRank larger groups of items.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Individuals compare each item with every other item according to importance.\n- \u00b7 Example: Which is more important, A as compared to B, A as compared to C, A as compared to D, etc. Then B as compared to A, B as compared to C, B as compared to D, etc.\n- \u00b7 Participants go through the items, comparing each pair, circling their preferences. They count up all the As, the Bs, the Cs.\n- \u00b7 When counting up their responses, participants count across the A line: From then on they count down and then across, starting with B in the top line and then down (counting only the circled letters); then C down and across, then D down and across, etc.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 You can also compare the items in reference to performance: How are we performing? Which are we performing better? A or B, A or C, A or D, etc. Then B or C, B or D, etc.-You can do either or both processes.\n- \u00b7 Numbered cards are thrown on the table and members scramble for their question of choice.\n- \u00b7 Add other summary checks for groups larger than four. Some examples might be:\n- \u2218 Who needs to know what happened in this meeting?\n- \u2218 By when are the next steps due?\n- \u2218 What should be highlighted in the minutes of the meeting?\n\n## Not A or B, but C\n\nDecisions\n\nB =\n\nC D E F G\n\nD D D\n\n## TIPS\n\n\u2022 These processes are complicated and require a lot of time.\n\nThe recording page for participants looks something like the following:\n\n## Rule of One-Third (Doyle and Straus)\n\nIdentify the Most Important Ideas\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nAchieve agreement\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Alert the group that after sufficient items have been identified, members will be asked to pick about a third of the items they feel are most important. Explain that this will identify the items most important to the group for further analysis.\n- \u00b7 Use the formula one-third plus one in this way: For a list of twelve items each member would choose five. For a list of twenty items, each member would choose 8.\n- \u00b7 For each item on the list, the facilitator asks for a show of hands and records the number of hands on the chart, circled, in a color not yet used.\n- \u00b7 After counting is completed, ask the group to identify the top few items-mark these in some fashion.\n- \u00b7 When about a third have been identified, or at the point in which a large gap appears between two numbers as in 20, 18,16, 12 , the group will be asked if they want to include the last number (in this example 12).\n\n## NEXT STEPS\n\n- \u00b7 Depending on the purpose for identifying high priority items, a number of options exist including: (1) accept all as in a staff development menu, (2) have a subcommittee study and return with recommendations when only one choice is to be made, (3) address the high priority items with other tools of discernment, such as pros and cons or measuring items against a list of criteria.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Explain that numbers will not make the decisions; group members will be able to advocate for an item not selected and if the group agrees, add it to the list.\n- \u00b7 See the video 'Focusing Four: A Consensus Seeking Activity for Prioritizing,' Robert Garmston  and  Michael  Dolcemascolo,  Denver,  Colorado  (www.thinkingcollaborative.com,  2009) for a demonstration of the entire process.\n\n## Six-Position Straw Poll\n\nDecisions\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nDiplay proposition preferences\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Members give poll page to designated person who records the tallies on a wall chart.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 If you have a lot of 5s and 6s, you should think carefully before implementing it.\n\n| 1                                                                       | 2                                           | 3                                                  | 4                                                                               | 5                                                                             | 6                                                     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| I strongly agree                                                        | I agree                                     | I agree with some reservations                     | I disagree but I'm willing to go with the majority                              | I disagree but don't want to stop others                                      | I disagree strongly and will work to block it         |\n| I really like it                                                        | I like it                                   | It's OK                                            | I don't think it's all that great but I'm willing to go along with the majority | I don't like it, but am willing to go along because I don't want to stop them | I really don't like it and will work to change it     |\n| I'll advocate for it publicly and privately whether or not it's adopted | I'll advocate for it publicly and privately | I'll support it publicly even with my reservations | I'll support it publicly and privately when asked                               | I won't advocate against it publicly or privately                             | I'll actively advocate against it publicly if adopted |\n| I'll actively support its implementation                                | I'll support its implementation.            | I'll participate in its implementation             | I may be involved in its implementation.

Discard duplicate, ambiguous, or illegible items.\n- \u00b7 Present and study categories and ideas.\n\n## ALTERNATIVES\n\n- \u00b7 Use slips to prioritize items. On each slip, members record a letter for the item (A, B, C, and so on) and a number representing the priority weight they assign to it. Assuming they have twleve items, 12 would be highest weight, 11 the next highest, and 1 the lowest.\n- \u00b7 Slips are turned in and stacked alphabetically. The numbers for each letter are tabulated and presented to the group.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Fifteen participants should be able to generate 150 ideas.\n- \u00b7 Because it so mechanical and free from influence, this form of prioritizing is useful when there is low trust in the group.\n\n## Spend a Buck\n\nDecisions\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nReveal individual or collective choices\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Members have one hundred imaginary pennies they can distribute across a few options.\n- \u00b7 Explain the options.\n- \u00b7 Individuals decide how many pennies they will spend on each option.\n- \u00b7 Gather and present the data to the group.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Use for individual choices rather than a collective expression of priorities.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Provide think time before members assign pennies.\n\n## Sufficient Consensus\n\nDecisions\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nAchieve agreement\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Determine a figure-like 80 percent-that will represent sufficient consensus.\n- \u00b7 Keep to one process at a time.\n- \u00b7 Members clarify and advocate for items.\n- \u00b7 Members may inquire as to the reasoning of another member's choice.\n\n- \u00b7 Minority view voices must be encouraged to speak.\n- \u00b7 Member views can be paraphrased.\n- \u00b7 Call for a show of hands.\n- \u00b7 Announce the result.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Determine what percentage will qualify as sufficient consensus in general.\n- \u00b7 In any meeting, an item can be singled out for even a 100 percent consensus. This should be very rare.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 No member has the right to block a group.\n- \u00b7 Employ a guideline for members not budging from a position. Ask if this is a matter of principle or preference. If a principle, encourage dialogue; if a preference, after others understand the preference, set it aside.\n\n## Thumbs-Up\n\nDecisions\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nMembers and facilitator understand tentative degrees of agreement.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 The facilitator or any member can call for a thumbs-up to determine the degree of agreement the group has on an item.\n- \u00b7 Thumbs up means yes, thumbs down means no, thumbs held sideways means not sure or it doesn't matter.\n- \u00b7 Call for a show of hands.\n- \u00b7 Announce the result.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Use as a poll to learn what direction/thinking the group is favoring prior to further conversation.\n- \u00b7 Use as a mechanism for sufficient consensus.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Ask members with thumbs held sideways to explain their reasoning.\n- \u00b7 Ask members with thumbs held down what would need to be modified in the proposal for them give it thumbs up.\n\nValue Voting\n\nAssess preferences\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nDisplay member preferences\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Ask the group to express their response to a statement visually.\n- \u00b7 Show five fingers for strongly agree, four for agree, three for neutral, two for disagree, one for strongly disagree.\n- \u00b7 Ask each person to respond to this question on a Post-It note: 'What would it take to get me reenergized?'\n- \u00b7 Phrase the statements as 'I'm satisfied with the direction the group is taking,' or 'We should move forward on this initiative now.'\n- \u00b7 Say the number of fingers you see as you scan the group, as 3, 3, 2, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 3, 2.\n- \u00b7 Interpret what you see as, 'Seems to be an average of about four,' or ' I notice responses on both ends of the scale. Can members voting low share some reasons for their response and members voting high do the same thing?'\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Ask members to look around the room and compare what they see with the number of fingers they are displaying.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 The benefit of value voting is that the responses are public, giving the group a sense of the whole.\n- \u00b7 Use this as a straw poll only, not a final decision-unless you see unanimous display of five fingers.\n\n## Set and Test Working Agreements\n\nGenerate and Adhere to Agreements\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nMembers influence group practice.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 A group member says, 'I notice that our meetings are not starting on time Could we make an agreement to start on time?' (Set agreement.)\n- \u00b7 The facilitator leads a conversation in which the group develops an agreement.\n- \u00b7 In a later meeting a group member says, 'I'd like to talk about the agreement we made to start our meetings on time. I notice we are not doing it. What needs to happen to keep our agreement?' ( Test agreement. )\n- \u00b7 The facilitator leads a conversation in which the group develops an agreement.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 A group member requests this topic be placed on the agenda.\n- \u00b7 When working agreements have previously been made by the group, either the facilitator or member can call attention to agreement fidelity.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 This relates to the group member capability-know when to self-assert and when to integrate.\n\nTo plan is to envision the steps necessary to reach a goal; who should be involved in what ways, and determining what time frames and materials are necessary. This collection of strategies support groups in understanding the contexts and issues about which are planning, ways of involving others and ways to assess progress they\n\n## Accordion Planning\n\nReceive Full Group Input in Planning\n\n## PURPOSES AND INTENTIONS\n\nAllow planning teams to work deeply while informing and getting feedback from the larger group at various planning stages.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Planning team adopts a template such as define the problem, analyze causes, identity possible solutions, and implement and test solutions.\n- \u00b7 After each stage, planning team members work with others in the organization, informing of the team's work and seeking reaction and guidance.\n- \u00b7 The planning team takes into account responses from the larger group, refines that stage of their work, then repeats the process for the remaining stages up to implementation.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Select different planning templates.\n- \u00b7 Have each team member report to a group in which they hold membership like a grade level or department.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Team members must be clear they are to think for themselves, rather than represent and only speak for the thinking of a group they are a member of.\n- \u00b7 Accordion planning takes longer than using a process in which a planning team does the full work, then reports to the larger group. The benefit of this form of planning that makes it worth the extra time is the degree of ownership held by other members of the organization.\n\n## Denominalize\n\nRender Concepts Amenable to Problem Solving\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nBe  proactive  in  response  to  statements  like  'We  have  a  problem  with  communication,'  or 'There is limited trust in our group.'\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Inform a group that when verbs or adjectives have been converted into nouns, they become nominalizations. It is not possible to solve nominalizations, so for planning to start they must be denominalized.\n- \u00b7 Invite the group to denominalize by phrasing challenges as 'What will we see and hear ourselves doing when we are communicating more effectively? This way of stating the problem reveals the desired state about which a group can plan.\n\n## Done-Yet to Do-Questions\n\nName Action Steps\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nIdentify and agree on what yet needs to be done.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Regarding a group project, individual members record a list of tasks that are done, tasks that are yet to be done, and questions about getting the work done.\n- \u00b7 In table groups, share the information.\n- \u00b7 Get agreement on the next most important things to be done.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Identify tasks that should be discarded if not done.\n- \u00b7 Run the process as a facilitated full-group activity.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Members are often so deep in the complexity of work that it is hard to see where they are and generate focus and energy for the next tasks.\n\n## Fishbone Diagram\n\nPlanning for Technical Change\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nDiscover cause and effect relationships.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Draw a fishbone diagram on chart paper as shown below.\n- \u00b7 Code sections of the chart that may be related to an existing condition of an issue. For tardiness, for example, getting to school, school responses to tardiness, school staff, and home might be listed.\n- \u00b7 Brainstorm factors that might be affecting the existing condition and record on the diagram.\n- \u00b7 Explore pros and cons of various combinations of solution approaches.\n\n## ALTERNATIVES\n\n- \u00b7 Have subgroups brainstorm each of the categories and record them on a separate chart.\n- \u00b7 Next, report and explore the various charts. Allow additions.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Protect the group from delving into too much minutia.\n\n## Fishbone Diagram\n\n## Force Field Analysis\n\nTechnical Change Planning\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nSelect opposing forces to weaken and favorable forces to strengthen.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Post a T-bar chart with a topic or goal at top. In the left side, write 'forces for' and in the right side, write 'forces against.'\n- \u00b7 Members list forces that fall into either category.\n- \u00b7 Members may paraphrase or question for clarity.\n- \u00b7 Limit each list to about six items. Once the list is deemed complete, mark the three strongest forces on either side.\n- \u00b7 Explore how the forces against might be made weaker and the forces for, strengthened. This phase may take the form of dialogue.\n- \u00b7 Rate the forces and how feasible it would be to modify them.\n- \u00b7 Select one or more on which to work.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Assign the first three tasks above to small work groups, then chart and post group results.\n- \u00b7 As a full group, entertain questions of clarification\n- \u00b7 Continue with the process as a full group.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Some forces may legitimately appear on either side of the chart.\n- \u00b7 It is usually easier to weaken the forces restraining change than it is to strengthen the helping forces.\n\n- \u00b7 Topics such as decreasing dropout rates, increasing attendance, or increasing student motivation to write might prove challenging, as their complexity exceeds this simple analysis.\n\n## Futures Wheel\n\nIdentifying Possible Consequences\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nReveal factors to consider in planning.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Display a futures wheel on chart paper.\n- \u00b7 Write the name of the innovation or idea that the group will be working with in the center of the wheel.\n- \u00b7 Work outward from the center to the first layer of circles.\n- \u00b7 Identify  two  positive  consequences  and  two  negative  consequences.  Have  the  positive  and negative be as different as possible.\n- \u00b7 Continue in this manner to the second layer, then the third, or fourth.\n- \u00b7 Dialogue about the findings. How might this information influence the perceptions and decisions of a planning team?\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Through this process, a need for more information may surface. Determine what is needed and how to gather it.\n- \u00b7 Two small groups could work on the same decision, then share results to gain greater perspective.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 These are not predictions. They are possible consequences.\n- \u00b7 An analysis of the data may lead a group to abandon the idea.\n- \u00b7 An analysis of the data may inform a group of ways of implementing the idea that would avoid some negatives.\n- \u00b7 Use the information to learn what needs to be communicated to whom and in what ways.\n\n## Futures Wheel\n\n## Histomap (Suzanne Bailey)\n\nLearn from Group History\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nRelease emotional barriers to working toward a desired state.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Hang chart paper on wall like a timeline.\n- \u00b7 Mark eras in the group's history-the year the bond issue passed, the year the new principal arrived, the loss of a federal program, etc.\n- \u00b7 Use icons to illustrate the different events that occurred within each of the eras.\n- \u00b7 Next, groups of people add words and icons to the timeline and share their memories.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Organize groups randomly or as intact working groups.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 When people hear about the same event from different perspectives, a more complex history is understood.\n- \u00b7 What is expressed and understood can be released and need not dominate the working space of the group.\n\n## Outcome Mapping\n\nResolve Persistent Performance Problems\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nDiscover and strengthen internal resources to improve performance.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Reveal purpose and process to group.\n- \u00b7 Display six columns with these headings:\n- \u2218 Presenting problem\n- \u2218 Tentative outcome\n- \u2218 Desired behavior of selected others\n- \u2218 Internal resources required to achieve desired behaviors\n- \u2218 Change agent strategies to build resources\n- \u2218 Internal resources required for change agent to perform strategies.\n- \u00b7 Elicit responses from group; paraphrase and record responses.\n- \u00b7 If  there is disagreement regarding what group members say, dialogue may be scheduled for another meeting.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Facilitate the use of this map with a change agent desiring change from another group or individual.\n\n- \u00b7 Use as a group facilitation tool.\n- \u00b7 Direct the focus to others or to self as a group.\n- \u00b7 Use to explore potential strategies to promote growth for an individual.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 This is task analysis work and must be followed in sequence.

It might be implementing rigorous content standards.\n- \u00b7 In the outer circle list the systems and practices that would be affected. For implementing standards these might include curriculum alignment, parent expectations, data collection, special education, teacher evaluation, district culture, professional development, reporting practices, and so on.\n- \u00b7 Identify complexities and factors that would need to be taken into consideration in developing an action plan.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Generate list of affected systems and practices in small group conversations prior to developing the problem map.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Apply to 'wicked problems' for which no known solution processes are available. Often these require new mental models or are dynamical, producing emergent phenomena within systems and subsystems.\n\nTo summarize is to restate fewer words, to abstract the essence of information or to make a communication more concise, Groups often use a summarizing strategy to closure and understanding to discourse or to concisely evaluate a the value or effectiveness of a meeting: using bring\n\n## 7-11 Conversations\n\n## Organize and Integrate\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nRecall, clarify, and correct misunderstandings regarding what happened in a meeting.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Members prepare comments they would make to a friend summarizing this meeting.\n- \u00b7 After composing-either mentally or on paper-members mill about the room sharing their comments with others.\n- \u00b7 After a few minutes, the facilitator redirects members to report to the full group some of their summaries.\n- \u00b7 The facilitator and group edit for consistency and accuracy.\n\n## ALTERNATIVES\n\n- \u00b7 Summaries can be written and passed around a table for editing.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Frame this as a conversation in a convenience store needing to be brief, informal, and without academic language.\n- \u00b7 People often report different versions of what happens in meetings. This corrects this tendency.\n\n## Content Check\n\nSummarize\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nClarify the what, why, and how of next steps.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Randomly distribute cards numbered one through four.\n- \u00b7 Display a chart with the following ideas:\n- 1. Walk out knowing what to do.\n- 2. Why are we doing it?\n\n- 3. What are we expecting to see?\n- 4. What are our next steps?\n- \u00b7 The numbers members received determine which meeting summary statement they make.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Members draw a playing card.\n- \u00b7 Numbered cards are thrown on the table and members scramble for their questions of choice.\n- \u00b7 Add other summary checks for groups larger than four. Some examples might be:\n- \u2218 Who needs to know what happened in this meeting?\n- \u2218 By when are the next steps due?\n- \u2218 What should be highlighted in the minutes of the meeting?\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Make the process routine for greatest results or alternate with 'Process Check' in this appendix.\n\n## Gots and Wants\n\nMeeting Assessment\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nAdjust ways of working with group based on group feedback.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Individuals compose 'gots' on sticky notes, one idea per sticky note. A 'got' might be an idea received, something learned, or a positive response to working with colleagues.\n- \u00b7 Individuals compose 'wants' on sticky notes, one idea per sticky note. A 'want' might be a comment about process (go faster or slower), a request for information, or a comment about materials.\n- \u00b7 As the group adjourns, members place their sticky notes on charts labeled as GOTS or WANTS.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 See 'Plusses and Wishes' in this appendix.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 After the event, categorize and label the gots and wants.

Members will report to the full assembly the Most Important Point of their partner. The reporting need not be reciprocal and reporting is best done while members are still standing.\n- \u00b7 Instead of locating another partner, share MIPs at tables and agree on a table MIP.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Learning partners, eye contact partners, or any configuration of partnerships can be used. See 'Learning Partner' in this listing of strategies and moves.\n- \u00b7 When partners report, because they are reporting their partner's ideas, they will be briefer.\n\n## One-Word Summary\n\nSummarize\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nSynthesize a conversation or information from a text.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Write one word that summarizes the central idea from this conversation or text.\n- \u00b7 Share with a neighbor or table group.\n\n## ALTERNATIVES\n\n- \u00b7 See  'Most  Important  Point,'  'Scrambled  Sentences,'  'Three  Balloons,'  or  '5-3-1'  in  this appendix.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Allow 'open text' in which members might review notes or text before arriving at a one-word summary.\n\n## Pluses and Wishes\n\nMeeting Assessment\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nAdjust ways of working with group based on group feedback.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Inform the group you will be requesting members to name pluses (things they appreciated or things that supported their learning) and wishes (things they wish the group had done more of, less of, or differently).\n- \u00b7 Use two to four flip charts depending on size of group. Each chart is displayed as a T-Bar with plusses at the top left and wishes at the top right\n- \u00b7 Recruit recorders.\n- \u00b7 Request pluses first. As each plus is named, paraphrase and direct it to recorders in turn.\n- \u00b7 Ask for wishes and repeat the patterns.\n- \u00b7 Members orally report pluses-what they valued about content or processes-while a recorder charts the ideas.\n- \u00b7 Next, report wishes-what they wish had been done more, less, differently, or wishes for the next session.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 'Gots and Wants' (elsewhere in this list) is another strategy that serves this purpose.\n- \u00b7 With a small group, up to ten or so people, you can serve as both facilitator and recorder.\n\n## ALTERNATIVES\n\n- \u00b7 Use multiple recorders to speed the charting process.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 After initial contributions always ask 'What else?' rather than 'Is there anything else?' to elicit further comments.\n- \u00b7 State as 'What are some pluses . . .,' not 'Are there any plusses?'\n- \u00b7 After the session, organize each category into sub-topics and report to the group at the next session how their ideas have informed this next session.\n- \u00b7 Keep your facial and verbal responses neutral.\n\n## Recipe\n\nReview and Condense\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nEngage both sides of brain in review.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n\u2022 Provide  format:  'Recipe  For__________;  Name  of  Dish____;  From  the  Kitchen  of____; Serves____; Ingredients____.'\n\n\u2022 Table groups develop and post recipes on chart paper.\n\n- \u00b7 Spokesperson from each table makes a brief presentation to the group.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Provide ingredients with which the recipe will be made.\n- \u00b7 Use a 'Gallery Walk' to share recipes.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Give a time estimate, usually about fifteen minutes.\n\n## Scrambled Sentences\n\nReview\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nEnergy and collective review.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Each person writes one word on a card or sticky note illustrative of the individual's learning.\n- \u00b7 The group constructs a sentence using all the words while adding as few words as possible.\n- \u00b7 Group spokespersons read the sentences to the full group.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Write words for a common experience.\n- \u00b7 After creating one sentence, have participants take their word and form another group, creating another sentence.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Give a signal for the group work to begin.\n\n## Song Writing\n\nReview\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nEngage right and left brain in summarizing important points.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Have individuals write the name of a song from their childhood on a sticky note.\n- \u00b7 Next have them write the name of a song from their high school years.\n- \u00b7 Next they write a song they associate with celebrations.\n- \u00b7 Using these songs as activators, direct table groups to develop a song that expresses something about the full group in which they are participating, and prepare to perform it.\n- \u00b7 Ask which group wants to go first, second, etc. Perform and appreciate.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 Use this to celebrate accomplishments or transitions in the life of the group.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Use this only when table groups have five or more members. This provides enough musical repertoire and style variance for a group to be successful.\n\n## Sound and Motion Symphony\n\nFull-bodied Review\n\n## PURPOSE AND INTENTIONS\n\nEnergy, creativity, and group cohesion.\n\n## PROCESS\n\n- \u00b7 Table groups select a collective sound and a motion to represent their learning.\n- \u00b7 Stand and rehearse.\n- \u00b7 When groups are ready to perform, facilitator assumes role of symphony conductor.\n- \u00b7 After each section of 'instruments' is rehearsed, the facilitator conducts the group bringing different sections in and out as appropriate.\n\n## VARIATIONS\n\n- \u00b7 The facilitator might stand on a riser or table for greater visibility.\n\n## TIPS\n\n- \u00b7 Emphasize rationale. Explain that of the many ways humans organize and integrate knowledge, body movements bring a special opportunity for the kinesthetic learner. This activity focuses more on the affective domains of learning than the cognitive.\n- \u00b7 Prerequisites for this activity are safe learning environment and trusting relationship with facilitator.

First, any employee-supervisor  relationship  is  governed by  multiple  factors:  district  policy,  negotiated agreements  with  employee  organizations,  the management and leadership style of the principal, the work culture in the school, the style characteristics of the employee, and the interpersonal  relationship  of  the  principal  and  the teacher-leader.\n\nBecause informal personalized factors have a greater influence on working procedures than do the hypothetical relationships described in program descriptions, the actual relationship is negotiated between the two people.\n\nHowever, becoming clear about the working relationship is further complicated, because knowing who is to be served in a support role is complex for even the most practiced consultant or facilitator.\n\nBecause one cannot serve two masters, an early  task  for  a  consultant  or  facilitator  is  to learn who the primary and ultimate clients are. It is these parties whom the resource person is committed to serve. Thus, besides the question of  the  teacher-principal  working  relationship, there are several other questions that the teacher-leader and the principal must address:\n\n- 1. Because of the potential for having role requirements given to the teacher-leader from sources  beyond  the  principal,  who  exactly is the teacher-leader's primary and ultimate\n- client,  and  what  are  the  teacher-leader's responsibilities to those clients?\n- 2. Under what conditions can the principal be a primary client?\n- 3. Under  what  conditions  can  a  working committee  of  the  entire  faculty  be  a  primary client?\n- 4. What  are  the  core  values  that  will  guide this work?\n- 5. Who is the client?\n\nA contact client is a person who makes the initial contact with the teacher-leader. This establishes an expectation for serving a principal or a school according to the goals and descriptions  of  the  funding  program.  Sometimes  the contact comes from the following:\n\n- \u00b7 A personnel office;\n- \u00b7 A staff development office;\n- \u00b7 An administrator in charge of special programs.\n\nAn  intermediate  client  is  involved  in  the early  contracting  arrangements  between  the teacher-leader  and  the  school.  This  person is often  responsible  for  administrating  the districtwide program under which each teacher-leader  has  been  assigned.  The  intermediate  client  will  communicate  program  goals, procedures to follow, and job descriptions for the  teacher-leader.  These  guidelines  set  the parameters  within  which  the  principal  and teacher-leader are to work.\n\nThe  primary  client  is  the  group  with which the facilitator will work. Because specific  goals  and  working  procedures  can  be developed  only  with  the  primary  client,  the teacher-leader must be clear about who this is.\n\nThree prerequisites for being successful as a primary client are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The  primary  client  has  made  a  free  and informed  choice  to  ask  the  facilitator  for services.\n- \u00b7 The  primary  client  has  accepted  responsibility for the problem being worked on.\n- \u00b7 The primary client has or can access the information necessary to develop solutions.\n\nThe ultimate  clients  are  the  stakeholders, whose  interests  should  be  protected  even  if they are not in direct contact with the meeting processes.  These  would  include  the  organization as a whole, students, parents, and community members.\n\nThe larger  the  school  system,  the  greater the  chance  that  communications  between  the support-role  person  and  the  contact,  intermediate,  and  primary  clients  will  be  incomplete, contradictory, or confusing. Large school systems,  even  with  the  best  of  intentions,  have communication  problems.  This  is  a  systems problem, not a people problem. The most effective level for aligning incongruent understandings  about  role  and  function  is  with  the  two people closest to the action, the teacher-leader and the principal. If necessary, the district resource teacher or the administrator who leads the program can help.\n\nIn some  situations,  the  primary  client might  also  be  the  contact  and  intermediate client. For example, a department chairperson asks  you  to  facilitate  a  meeting  to  develop faculty consensus on a set of educational values.  The  chairperson  then  works  with  you  to develop agreements on mutual responsibilities as well as the goals and agenda for this meeting. During the meeting that you facilitate, the chairperson is also a member of the group that is receiving your services.\n\nA principal can be the primary client when he or she will receive, or be a member of the group  that  receives,  direct  services  from  the facilitator.  The  principal  will  be  an  effective primary client when he or she has met the three prerequisites listed above for being successful as a primary client.\n\nA working committee of the entire faculty can be the primary client when it represents the full range of opinions of the faculty and when the same three conditions for success as a primary client have been met.\n\nThe ideas below are recommended as generic core values to guide all facilitation work.\n\nWhat are the presenting problem, diagnosis, and plan? Facilitators should not assume that the client has accurately or inaccurately defined and diagnosed the problem. The confident client has already  defined  the  problem,  its  causes,  and  a method for solving it, and asks, 'Can you help me accomplish this?' The searching client has identified  the  problem  but  is  not  clear  about its  causes  or  the  methods to solve it, and asks, 'How can you help us with this problem?' The puzzled client has not yet identified the problem, and asks, 'Can you help us to figure out what is going on and what to do about it?' The reluctant client talks with a facilitator because job expectations require it; this person asks, 'What does the project want you to do?'\n\nWhat  are  the  resources  and  motivation for  change?  Two  often  overlooked  resources for  change  are  the  group's  strengths  and  the critical voices of selected group members. Just because a group seeks help does not mean that it is interested in changing its behavior. Groups require  resources  to  change.  These  include time, information, skills, knowledge, and motivation. Motivation to change can result from the following forms of discomfort:\n\n- \u00b7 An internal dissatisfaction with the status quo;\n- \u00b7 Organizational pressure to improve;\n- \u00b7 An unachieved vision;\n- \u00b7 A drive toward craftsmanship and continual improvement.\n\nWhat type of facilitation services are being requested? In basic facilitation, the group seeks  only  to  solve  a  substantive  problem. The group engages a facilitator to temporarily\n\nimprove  its  processes  in  order  to  work  on the  problem.  When  the  problem  is  resolved, the group's process knowledge and skills are relatively  unchanged. The  basic  facilitator  is like a mechanic who fixes the group's car well enough to get it to a destination. Facilitation and agenda development tend to be done by one or two individuals, and the group expects the facilitator to use whatever processes he or she considers effective.\n\nIn  developmental  facilitation,  the  group seeks  to  permanently  improve  its  processes while  solving  a  substantive  problem.  When the  problem  is  resolved,  the  group  will  also be more knowledgeable and skilled at solving future problems. The developmental facilitator is like a staff developer who leads the group in learning  how  to  monitor,  repair,  and  redesign its own car so it can use the vehicle to reach any destination  it  seeks.  Facilitation  and  agenda development are shared, and the group periodically reflects to learn from its experience.\n\n## Appendix G Contracting for Facilitation Services\n\nEnter and develop the Relationship Goals:\n\n- \u00b7 Establish trust.\n- \u00b7 How will you know if you and the client are successful?\n- \u00b7 Develop a relationship.\n- \u00b7 Establish  mutual  learning  and  empowerment as goals.\n- \u00b7 Determine mutual expectations.\n- Questions:\n- \u00b7 Are the people here who need to be here?\n- \u00b7 Whose voices are we not hearing?\n- \u00b7 Who  are  the  contact  and  intermediate clients?\n- \u00b7 Who is the primary client?\n- \u00b7 Who is the ultimate client?\n- \u00b7 How  does  the  person  I'm  talking  to  fit within the system?\n- \u00b7 What are the client's expectations?\n- \u00b7 What should be the nature of the consulting services?\n\nElicit and process Information Goals:\n\n- \u00b7 Distinguish  between  the  presenting  problem and the underlying problem.\n- \u00b7 Collaboratively determine the desired state.\n- \u00b7 Determine specific facilitator goals, plans,  working  procedures,  and  assessment design.\n- \u00b7 Understand the systems in which facilitation is to occur.\n\nQuestions:\n\n- \u00b7 Who  will  be  involved  in  defining  the problem?\n- \u00b7 Who will be involved in determining the desired state?\n- \u00b7 What  lenses  are  represented  by  the  primary client and the systems in which the client works?\n- \u00b7 What data is relevant?\n- \u00b7 What data-gathering and reporting mechanisms will be used?\n- \u00b7 What values and principles will guide decision making?\n- \u00b7 What feedback loops should be established?\n- \u00b7 Who  will  assume  which  responsibilities for this endeavor?\n\nExecute and monitor Plan Goals:\n\n- \u00b7 Appropriate interventions provided by the facilitator.\n- \u00b7 Consultant and primary client action.\n- \u00b7 Learning from doing.\n- \u00b7 Desired state achievement.\n- \u00b7 Client empowerment.\n\nQuestions:\n\n- \u00b7 What will you do to keep the relationship a priority?\n- \u00b7 How will you keep your communications descriptive and nonjudgmental?\n- \u00b7 What  will  you  do  to  maintain  personal authenticity?\n- \u00b7 How will you keep your eye on the ball in a chaotic situation?\n- \u00b7 How will you know that the interventions are working and that the client is learning?\n- \u00b7 How  will  you  know  if  revising  goals  or strategies is called for?\n\n- \u00b7 How will you know that you are finished?\n- Exit and complete the Relationship Goals:\n- \u00b7 A decision to extend the facilitation relationship,  recycle  with  a  new  problem,  or end the relationship.\n- \u00b7 Client clarity and commitment to personal next steps.\n- \u00b7 Client empowerment to act independently.\n- \u00b7 Client  feedback  to  the  facilitator  on  the facilitator's services.\n\nQuestions:\n\n- \u00b7 How  will  we  know  if  the  relationship should be extended, recycled, or ended?\n- \u00b7 How do I know if the client  has  the  resources  to  successfully  pursue  the  next steps?\n- \u00b7 How  can  I  clarify  and  transfer  my  own learning from this relationship?\n\nIn  the  contracting  phase,  the  primary  client  and  the  facilitator  are  jointly  responsible for  identifying  a  presenting  problem,  a  way to get started, and  mutual  responsibilities.

They are unavoidable and unsolvable, they have two or more right answers that are interdependent, and they must be managed with both-and thinking.\n\nExamples of polarities are the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Individual rubrics and schoolwide rubrics\n- \u00b7 Tight and loose structures\n- \u00b7 Autonomy and collaboration\n- \u00b7 Team and individual\n- \u00b7 Home and work\n\nPolarity  Management\u2122  is  a  model  that  involves a set of principles and tools for dealing with all polarities in life.\n\nBetty  Achinstein  (2002),  writing  about conflict among school teachers, notes that collaboration and consensus-critical elements in building  community-actually  generate  conflict. She found that by airing diverse perspectives  in  a  collective  setting  and  encouraging teachers to debate what and how to do schooling,  schools  generate  new  conflicts  because of  their  commitment  to  creating  collaborative communities.\n\nIn  what  ways  might  conflict  represent  a polarity?\n\nConflict  is  a  manifestation  of  interdependence,  and  tensions  between  independence and  interdependence  are  ever  present.  This inherent tension can be a source of productive energy for groups, or it can lead to unproductive  interactions  and  create  an  energy  drain. Groups  that  use  tension  productively  distinguish between affective and cognitive conflict.\n\nAffective  conflict  is  personalized  conflict  and is detrimental to group energy and productivity. Cognitive conflict is conflict over ideas and approaches, and it is a hallmark of high-performing  groups.  Groups  that  engage  in  cognitive conflict critically examine ideas to sort out the best  practices  for  student  learning.  Thus  conflict becomes a resource (Amason, Thompson, Hochwarter, &amp; Harrison, 1995).\n\nAchinstein  (2002)  quotes  John  Gardner's explanation of conflict, diversity, and community.  Gardner  states  that  diversity  is  not  good simply because it implies breadth of tolerance and  sympathy.  A  community  of  diverse  elements has a greater capacity to adapt and renew itself  in  a  swiftly  changing  world.  To  keep a  balance  between  diversity  and  wholeness, com- munities must apply structures to reduce polarization,  to  foster  communication  among diverse  groups,  and  to  create  mechanisms  for conflict mediation.\n\nBarry Johnson (1996) offers a set of principles, tools, and structures for identifying and utilizing  the  natural  tensions  that  are  created as individuals and organizations attempt to engage in cognitive conflict. These tensions often manifest as polarities: ongoing, chronic issues that  are  unavoidable  and  unsolvable.  Johnson asserts  that  when  groups  can  distinguish  between a problem to solve and a polarity to manage and can effectively deal with both, they are able to celebrate and capitalize on diversity and convert resistance to change to a resource for sustainable strength and adaptivity.\n\nLeaders,  teams,  and  organizations  must ask  this  fundamental  question  when  they  are faced  with  a  challenge:  Is  this  a  problem  to\n\nsolve, or is it an ongoing polarity that we must manage well? Problems to solve are those that have one right answer or two or more right answers that are independent. For example: 'How do you spell?' or 'What should we include in our parent survey?'\n\nIn  contrast,  polarities  to  be  managed  are sets  of  opposites  that  can't  function  well  independently;  they  require  both-and  thinking. Because the two sides of a polarity are interdependent, you cannot choose one as a solution and neglect the other. The objective of managing polarities is to get the best of both opposites while avoiding the limits or downside of each. Johnson  (1996)  uses  breathing  as  a  metaphor for all polarities. You cannot solve the inhaleexhale polarity by choosing to either inhale or exhale. You manage it by getting the benefits of each while appreciating the limits of each. It's not a static situation. It's a process, an ongoing flow of shifting emphasis from one to the other and back again. Managing this polarity requires choosing both inhaling and exhaling.\n\nSome examples of polarities to manage are work and home, individual and team, stability and  change,  independence  and  interdependence, and planning and action.\n\nA central premise of the adaptive school work  is  that  leaders  must  recognize  that schools are living paradoxes (i.e., polarities), operating simultaneously as 'thing' and 'energy'  models-dynamic  systems  of  energy and information.\n\nThe principles and tools of Polarity Management  TM  support  collaborative  communities  in  accessing  the  richness  of  capitalizing on diversity and engaging cognitive conflict to liberate group energy and productivity.\n\n## The Polarity Map\n\nThe  polarity  map  is  a  tool  for  mapping paradoxes  or  dilemmas,  which  we  refer  to  as polarities.  The  map  provides  a  structure  for making  invisible  tensions  visible  and  for  addressing  the  whole  polarity  picture.  Once  the map  is  completed  through  collaborative  con- versation, it provides a focus for dialogue from diverse perspectives.\n\nThe polarity map is a square divided into four  quadrants.  The  right  and  left  halves  are called poles. The upper part of each pole contains  the  positive  results  of  focusing  on  that pole, referred to as its upside. The lower part of  each  pole  contains  the  negative  results  of focusing on that pole to the neglect of the other pole and is called the downside. Creating and discovering the content of all four quadrants is essential for maximum effectiveness in managing a polarity.\n\n## Guidelines for Creating a Polarity Map\n\nDefine the challenge. Identify an ongoing, chronic issue (a) within your sphere of influence (b) that has eluded problem-solving and (c) that has to be addressed in the next 2 months.\n\nIdentify  a  key  polarity. A  polarity  differs from a problem in the following ways: (a) The issue  continues  over  time,  (b)  there  are  two interdependent  alternatives,  (c)  you  need  to have the positive aspects of each of the alternatives, and (d) developing one alternative to the neglect of the other will eventually undermine your  productivity.  Ask  the  following  probing questions:\n\n- 1. In  what  ways  do  you  continue  to  experience this issue over time?\n- 2. In  what  ways  are  there  two  alternatives that  are  interdependent?  This  means  that you can focus on only one pole for so long be- fore you are required to focus on the other pole.\n- 3. What is the necessity of having the upsides of both poles over time?\n- 4. To what extent will focusing on one upside to  the  neglect  of  the  other  eventually  undermine your productivity?\n\nExplore  the  issues,  opportunities,  and  polarities.  Facilitate  a  conversation  that  is  designed to create an objective description of the issues,\n\n## A Polarity Map\n\nopportunities,  and  polarities  that  are  present. The  skills  of  dialogue  (chapter  5)  and  the norms of collaboration (chapter 4) are essential to this goal. Presume that all ideas are respected and  important.  Paraphrasing  (chapter  4)  is  a primary tool in these conversations.\n\nWell-crafted  paraphrases  communicate  I am  trying  to  understand  you,  and  therefore  I value  what  you  have  to  say'  and  establish  a relation- ship between people and ideas.\n\nHere  is  an  example. A  high  school  leadership  team  that  was  conversing  about  staff resistance  to  interdepartmental  collaboration concluded that there were merits to some staff members' advocacy of autonomy. During this conversation the facilitator offered the following paraphrases:\n\n- \u00b7 'Sam,  you  believe  the  complaints  we're getting are data worth examining.'\n- \u00b7 'A  value  that  we  all  hold  is  that  all  departments  working  together  will  produce better results for all students.'\n- \u00b7 'On the one hand, we want teaming, and on the other hand, we see the necessity for individual action.'\n- \u00b7 'It sounds as if we want to honor autonomy in two ways, individuals and departments.'\n\nThe  facilitator provided  a  'abstracting paraphrase'  (chapter  4)  to  paraphrase  the  polarity: 'Let me see if I can sum this up. We're wondering  how  we  might  collaborate  while also honoring individual autonomy.'\n\nIn this example the high school leadership team  decided  to  create  a  collaboration-autonomy  polarity  map.  Later  they  repeated  this mapping process with the staff.\n\nAgree on names for the poles. The names should  be  value-neutral  and  be  agreed  on  by the group.\n\nWrite  the  pole  names  on  the  map.  The polarity map is created on chart paper so that group members can see the map as it unfolds.\n\nBrainstorm the content for each quadrant. Aim to write four to eight entries in each quad-\n\nrant.  Collect  all  ideas  from  the  participants with-  out  judgment,  criticism,  or  questions. Identify both upsides, asking, 'What are some positives  results  or  upsides  of  focusing  on?' Then  identify  both  downsides,  asking,  'What are the negatives of focusing on to the neglect of the other pole?' This order can be modified to meet individual and group needs. For example,  a  group  that  values  stability  over  change might need to brainstorm the upside of stability and the downside of change before being ready to move to mapping the upside of change. Oppositional values and fears should be identified and respected as important.\n\nAgree  on  a  higher  purpose  and  a  deeper fear. Agreeing on a higher purpose and a deeper fear integrates  oppositional  views  and  provides a reason to manage the tension between them. The higher purpose is the major benefit of managing the polarity well, and the deeper fear is the major negative result of not managing the polarity well. Again, use dialogue and the norms of collaboration.\n\nThe 'abstracting paraphrase' is invaluable for integrating seemingly competing values and views,  elevating  conversations  to  a  common higher purpose. For example, a middle school staff dialogue about student discipline became quite emotional, with members giving example after  example  of  student  misbehavior.  Some staff  members  insisted  that  more  suspensions and  rules  were  necessary;  others  challenged this  idea,  stating  that  the  students  would  just become resentful, passive-aggressive, and less willing to behave. They argued that their role was  to  support  students  in  learning  life  skills for controlling themselves.\n\nThe chairman of the committee, who was acting as the facilitator, offered a 'abstracting paraphrase':  'Some  of  us  feel  strongly  about tightening the rules to get order, whereas some believe  that  students  might  need  to  be  taught how to use their freedom to self- regulate. It is apparent that a goal we all hold is how to support the students in exhibiting more productive behavior.'\n\nAfter  additional  conversation,  the  group agreed  to  map  the  structure-freedom  polarity,  coming  to  the  conclusion  that  both  were necessary  to  encourage  students'  productive behavior.\n\nDialogue  about  the  completed  polarity map and explore ways to maximize the upside of  each  pole  and  minimize  the  downside  of each pole.\n\n## Understanding How Polarities Work\n\nA polarity map appears as a static set of ideas in four labeled quadrants: positives and values in the upside of each pole, and negatives  and  concerns  in  the  downside  of  each pole. In fact, there is a predictable movement through  a  polarity  situation,  and  we  can  envision it with the polarity map. As polarities work,  we  can  predict  people's  movement from one pole to the other as they (a) anticipate or experience the downside of one pole, from which they want to move away, and (b) are  attracted  to  the  up-  sides  of  the  opposite pole,  which  they  want  to  move  toward.  The downside of the pole they want to leave often becomes identified as the problem.\n\nThe upside of the opposite pole be- comes identified  as  the  solution.  However,  for  a  polarity  to  be  well  managed,  one  must  remain in the upside of both poles while avoiding the limitations of the downsides of both poles. The natural energy flow of a well-managed polarity is  an  infinity  loop,  with  only  a  slight  dip  into the lower quadrants.\n\n## Facilitating Polarity Mapping\n\nFacilitation  provides  the  focusing,  directing, and organizing features that are necessary for  adult  conversations  to  produce  results  for students.  Facilitators  manage  group  energy through  attention  to  three  areas:  (a)  helping members in active participation, and (c) focusing group attention.\n\nWell-facilitated  conversations  around  polarities  and  other  diverse  viewpoints  produce the cognitive conflict and psychological safety that  is  necessary  for  highly  productive  dialogues that foster shared meanings, values and goals, and collective agreements.\n\nThe  following  are  some  principles  and strategies  that  facilitators  may  use  to  support these conversations:\n\n- \u00b7 Grounding. This is an opening inclusion activity  that  is  used  when  groups  come together  for  important  or  difficult  work. Grounding (a) sets a norm for respectful listening, (b) brings people to the present, (c) brings everyone's voice into the room in  a  nonconfrontational way, (d) encourages people to connect with one another, (e)  allows  for  expression  of  hopes  and apprehensions,  (f)  values  thinking  and feeling, and (g) brings hidden agendas to the surface.\n- \u00b7 Greeting  Circle.  This  is  another  grounding  activity  in  which  each  person  greets and is greeted by another. In this process, everyone  confronts  the  natural  tension about  greeting  others.  When  participants are  asked  how  they  felt  and  what  they learned, productive energy is released into the room.\n- \u00b7 Address One Topic at a Time. There is a limit to what individuals and groups can attend to in the moment. When more than one  topic  is  being  discussed,  the  group lacks focus, and confusion reigns. Natural  tensions  are  present  when  discussing polarities. Keeping the group focused on one topic and/or polarity at a time honors both the  ideas  and  those  who  are  generating them.\n\nGroup processes are vehicles for collective thinking. To brainstorm, to clarify, to analyze, and to evaluate require different mental operations. In order to use one process at a time, the facilitator must make sure that all group mem- bers know what the process is, how it works, and why it is being used.\n\n## Facilitating Conversation About a Completed Polarity Map\n\nOnce  a  group  has  completed  mapping  a polarity on chart paper, a facilitated conversation offers  group  members  the  opportunity  to  view and explore the dilemma as a whole and from multiple  perspectives.  Furthermore,  the  group can  now  generate  strategies  for  staying  in  the upsides of both poles while avoiding the downsides. The norm of putting inquiry first supports the facilitator and the group members' resourcefulness and success in these conversations.\n\nHere are some sample questions:\n\n- \u00b7 As you reflect  on  our  collective  wisdom, what new learning and insights are emerging for you?\n- \u00b7 Given  our  expanded  perspective,  what might be some benefits for managing this polarity well?\n- \u00b7 What might be some higher purposes that will benefit all of our students?\n- \u00b7 What might be some of our deepest fears if we fail to manage this polarity well?\n- \u00b7 As we reflect on phrases in each quadrant, what might be some assumptions, values, or beliefs that are present?\n- \u00b7 Given our desire to stay in the upsides of both poles, what are some strategies?\n- \u00b7 What are some indicators that will tell us we are moving to the downside of a pole? Who will remind us, and how?\n- \u00b7 What  seems  most  important  to  all  of  us here?\n- \u00b7 What might be some impacts of collaboratively mapping a polarity?\n- \u00b7 What are your hunches about other polarities that might exist in this situation?\n- \u00b7 How might we apply this to other areas of our work?\n\n## Tips for Using Polarity Maps\n\n- \u00b7 Remember  that  to  pursue  the  benefits  of one pole, you must also pursue the benefits of the other pole. The solution is not static.\n- \u00b7 One possibility is to identify the indicators for  each  pole,  which  will  let  you  know when you are  experiencing  its  downside.\n- Putting feedback mechanisms in place aids in managing the polarity. (Example: Using conversation maps and tools)\n- \u00b7 Listen deeply and facilitate dialogue, especially with naysayers.\n- \u00b7 Brainstorm  strategies  for  staying  in  the upsides of both poles.\n\n## References\n\nAchinstein, B.
