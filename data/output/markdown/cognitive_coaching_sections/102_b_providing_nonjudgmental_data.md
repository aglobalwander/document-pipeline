## B. Providing Nonjudgmental Data

While a Cognitive Coach may invite the coachee to identify, observe for, and collect his/her own data, the coach may also serve as 'another set of eyes' by collecting the data that the coachee requested and then, during the reflecting conversation, supporting the coachee by providing the data, nonjudgmentally, that the coachee requested in the planning conversation. The coach provides these data with the intent of inviting the coachee to make meaning-drawing comparisons, inferences, and analyses-and then, based on that interpretation, make application to future lessons, adapting instructional strategies, and so forth. Examples include:

- You asked three questions within the first five minutes of your presentation.
- Of the six students you wanted me to observe, Tyrone spoke four times, Sarah spoke two times, Shaun spoke once, and the remaining three not at all.
- Here is the map of the classroom showing where you stood and moved. Each circle represents students with whom you interacted. During the presentation, you stopped and interacted with Eric five times, Paula three times, and Maryann two times.
