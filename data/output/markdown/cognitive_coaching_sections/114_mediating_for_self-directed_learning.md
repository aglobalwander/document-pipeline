## Mediating for Self-Directed Learning

The self is not a thing, but a point of view that unifies the flow of experience into a coherent narrative-a narrative striving to connect with other narratives and become richer.

-Jerome Bruner

T he ultimate goal of Cognitive Coaching is self-directed learning, which means to self-manage, self-monitor, and self-modify. With Cognitive Coaching, the mediator helps to engage and enhance a colleague's cognitive and emotional capacities to develop self-directed learning. Ultimately, mediators work to modify another person's capacity for continuous learning and the person's propensity to become self-coaching.
