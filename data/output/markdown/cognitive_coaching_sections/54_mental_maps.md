## Mental Maps

Cognitive Coaches hold in their head four maps as guides to the conversations with coaches:

- 1.  The Planning Conversation occurs before a colleague conducts or participates in an event or attempts a task. The coach may or may not be present during the event being planned or available for a follow-up conversation.
- 2.  The Reflecting Conversation occurs after a colleague conducts or participates in an event or completes a task. The coach may or may not have been present at or participated in the event.
- 3.  The Problem-Resolving Conversation occurs when a colleague feels stuck, helpless, unclear, or lacking in resourcefulness; experiences a crisis; or requests external assistance from a mediator.
- 4.  The Calibrating Conversation engages teachers in assessing their own performance related to a set of standards or external criteria, so that they share responsibility for self-assessing, and then selfprescribing personal responses to the assessment.
