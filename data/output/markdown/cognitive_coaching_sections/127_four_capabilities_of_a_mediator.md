## FOUR CAPABILITIES OF A MEDIATOR

The term capabilities refer to the mediator's metacognitive processes, particularly the four named later in this section. The settings in which Cognitive Coaching may occur range from informal, spontaneous conversations to more formal, planned conferences. Sometimes opportunities for mediation present themselves spontaneously and informally in day-to-day life, such as during a conversation in the faculty room or in the hall on the way to class. More formal, planned events are also opportunities for mediation, such as a formal classroom observation of teaching and learning or a scheduled department or faculty meeting.

A coach seizes all these opportunities to use specific mediational skills to engage and develop the other person's thinking processes. Mediators need certain skills, attitudes, and capabilities to perform their role well. For example, a mediator uses language with the intent of causing a change in the other person's reality. These linguistic tools include the following: posing questions intended to engage and transform the mind, creating conditions of trust, envisioning a desired state of mind, remaining nonjudgmental, and resisting the tendency to solve the problem for the learner. (A description of these specific tools can be found in chapter 3.) Following are descriptions of four specific capabilities, or metacognitive attributes, of a mediator.
