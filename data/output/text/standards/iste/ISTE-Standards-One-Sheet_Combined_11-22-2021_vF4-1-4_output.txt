The ISTE Standards serve as a framework for innovation and excellence in learning, teaching and leading.
As a body of work, the suite of standards has guided educator practice, school improvement planning,
professional growth and advances in curriculum. The ISTE Standards have been updated as learning have
evolved, and now the ISTE Standards will be considered a single work comprising of four sections: Students,
Educators, Educational Leaders and Coaches. As a compilation, the ISTE Standards provide a holistic and
comprehensive guide to transforming systems in order to transform the lives of our students.

Leaders and educators around the world have the enormous
responsibility of preparing all students for success in a future
where computing power underpins every aspect of the systems
we encounter in our daily lives. Ensuring that every student
understands and is able to harness the power of computing to
improve their success in their personal, academic or professional
lives is an ambitious goal. The ISTE Standards: Computational
Thinking Competencies for Educators is intended to help all
educators contribute to making that goal a reality.
Similarly to how technology is used by educators to deepen content area
learning while building digital learning skills, teachers can integrate CT
practices in their instruction to introduce computational ideas. This will
enhance student content knowledge and build confidence and competence
in CT. By integrating computational thinking into the classroom, educators
can support students to develop problem-solving and critical-thinking skills,
and empower them for success as CS learners and computational thinkers.
This document is not a one-size-fits-all list of expectations, but a
recognition that competencies present different opportunities for growth
and goal-setting for educators. Educators are doing powerful work to
integrate CT across other disciplines to enable students to learn, use and
apply CS concepts and CT practices across different contexts. ISTE seeks to
help educators recognize where this work is already happening, identify
opportunities to make these connections more explicit, and develop new
ways to deepen student learning in CS, using computational thinking to drive that work.
iste.org/standards 5.1.	 Computational Thinking (Learner)
Educators continually improve their practice by developing an
understanding of computational thinking and its application as a
cross-curricular skill. Educators develop a working knowledge of
core components of computational thinking: such as decomposition;
gathering and analyzing data; abstraction; algorithm design; and how computing impacts people and society. Educators:
5.1.a.	 Set professional learning goals to explore and apply teaching
strategies for integrating CT practices into learning activities
in ways that enhance student learning of both the academic discipline and CS concepts.
5.1.b.	 Learn to recognize where and how computation can be used
to enrich data or content to solve discipline-specific problems
and be able to connect these opportunities to foundational CT practices and CS concepts.
5.1.c.	 Leverage CT and CS experts, resources and professional learning
networks to continuously improve practice integrating CT across content areas.
5.1.d.	 Develop resilience and perseverance when approaching CS
and CT learning experiences, build comfort with ambiguity and
open-ended problems, and see failure as an opportunity to learn and innovate.
5.1.e.	 Recognize how computing and society interact to create
opportunities, inequities, responsibilities and threats for individuals and organizations.
5.2.	 Equity Leader (Leader)
All students and educators have the ability to be computational
thinkers and CS learners. Educators proactively counter stereotypes
that exclude students from opportunities to excel in computing and
foster an inclusive and diverse classroom culture that incorporates
and values unique perspectives; builds student self-efficacy and
confidence around computing; addresses varying needs and strengths;
and addresses bias in interactions, design and development methods.
Educators:
5.2.a.	 Nurture a confident, competent and positive identity around computing for every student.
5.2.b.	 Construct and implement culturally relevant learning
activities that address a diverse range of ethical, social and
cultural perspectives on computing and highlight computing achievements from diverse role models and teams.
5.2.c.	 Choose teaching approaches that help to foster an inclusive
computing culture, avoid stereotype threat and equitably engage all students.
5.2.d.	 Assess and manage classroom culture to drive equitable student
participation, address exclusionary dynamics and counter implicit bias.
5.2.e.	 Communicate with students, parents and leaders about the
impacts of computing in our world and across diverse roles
and professional life, and why these skills are essential for all students.

5.3.	 Collaborating Around Computing (Collaborator)
Effective collaboration around computing requires educators to
incorporate diverse perspectives and unique skills when developing
student learning opportunities, and recognize that collaboration skills
must be explicitly taught in order to lead to better outcomes than
individuals working independently. Educators work together to select
tools and design activities and environments that facilitate these collaborations and outcomes. Educators:
5.3.a.	 Model and learn with students how to formulate computational
solutions to problems and how to give and receive actionable feedback.
5.3.b.	 Apply effective teaching strategies to support student
collaboration around computing, including pair programming,
working in varying team roles, equitable workload distribution and project management.
5.3.c.	 Plan collaboratively with other educators to create learning
activities that cross disciplines to strengthen student
understanding of CT and CS concepts and transfer application of knowledge in new contexts.
5.4.	 Creativity & Design (Designer)
Computational thinking skills can empower students to create
computational artifacts that allow for personal expression. Educators
recognize that design and creativity can encourage a growth
mindset and work to create meaningful CS learning experiences and
environments that inspire students to build their skills and confidence
around computing in ways that reflect their interests and experiences.
Educators:
5.4.a.	 Design CT activities where data can be obtained, analyzed and
represented to support problem-solving and learning in other content areas.
5.4.b.	 Design authentic learning activities that ask students to leverage
a design process to solve problems with awareness of technical
and human constraints and defend their design choices.
5.4.c.	 Guide students on the importance of diverse perspectives and
human-centered design in developing computational artifacts with broad accessibility and usability.
5.4.d.	 Create CS and CT learning environments that value and
encourage varied viewpoints, student agency, creativity, engagement, joy and fun.
5.5. Integrating Computational Thinking (Facilitator)
Educators facilitate learning by integrating computational thinking
practices into the classroom. Since computational thinking is a
foundational skill, educators develop every student’s ability to
recognize opportunities to apply computational thinking in their environment. Educators:
5.5.a.	 Evaluate and use CS and CT curricula, resources and tools that
account for learner variability to meet the needs of all students.
5.5.b.	 Empower students to select personally meaningful computational projects.
5.5.c.	 Use a variety of instructional approaches to help students frame
problems in ways that can be represented as computational
steps or algorithms to be performed by a computer.
5.5.d.	 Establish criteria for evaluating CT practices and content
learning that use a variety of formative and alternative
assessments to enable students to demonstrate their
understanding of age-appropriate CS and CT vocabulary, practices and concepts.

The ISTE Standards are research-based and can meet local goals, needs and priorities. Adopting the standards in
a school, district or state/province takes different forms. Leaders may decide to use the standards in a variety of
ways, including:
•	 As part of statewide or district-level expectations.
•	 To guide systemwide planning, including school improvement and technology plans.
•	 To guide professional development plans and/or individual professional growth goals.
•	 To map curriculum.
•	 To ensure that lesson design and plans include purposeful use of technology.
•	 As part of a learning management system or web system.
•	 In teacher preparation across the curriculum.
•	 To embed in job descriptions and hiring decisions.
