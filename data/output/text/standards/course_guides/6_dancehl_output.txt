The IB Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous, academically challenging and
balanced programme of education designed to prepare students aged 16 to 19
for success at university and life beyond. The DP aims to encourage students to be
knowledgeable, inquiring, caring and compassionate, and to develop intercultural
understanding, open-mindedness and the attitudes necessary to respect and evalu ate a range of viewpoints.
To ensure both breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding, students must
choose at least one subject from five groups: 1) their best language, 2) additional lan guage(s), 3) social sciences, 4) experimental sciences, and 5) mathematics. Students
may choose either an arts subject from group 6, or a second subject from groups
1 to 5. At least three and not more than four subjects are taken at higher level (240
recommended teaching hours), while the remaining are taken at standard level (150
recommended teaching hours). In addition, three core elements—the extended es say, theory of knowledge and creativity, action, service—are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.
These IB DP subject briefs illustrate key course components.

I. Course description and aims
The IB DP dance course takes a holistic approach to dance, and embrac es a variety of dance traditions and dance cultures—past, present and
looking towards the future. Performance, creative and analytical skills are
mutually developed and valued whether the students are writing papers
or creating/performing dances. The curriculum provides students with
a liberal arts orientation to dance. This orientation facilitates the devel opment of students who may become choreographers, dance scholars,
performers or those, more broadly, who seek life enrichment through dance.
In addition, the course enables students to:
• understand dance as a set of practices with their own histories and
theories, and to understand that these practices integrate physical, intellectual and emotional knowledge
• experience dance as an individual and collective exploration of the expressive possibilities of bodily movement
• understand and appreciate mastery in various dance styles, tradi tions and cultures familiar and unfamiliar
• recognize and use dance to create dialogue among the various tra ditions and cultures in their school environment, their society and the world at large.
