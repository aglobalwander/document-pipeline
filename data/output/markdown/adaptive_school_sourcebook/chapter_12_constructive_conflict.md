## Chapter 12  Constructive Conflict

C have led us to this point. Getting the right work done and learning to fight onflict and collaboration are two faces of community. Previous chapters gracefully about important things require the capabilities, skills, and tools described earlier in this sourcebook. This chapter offers frames, approaches, and additional tools for seeing and using conflict as a resource for group and personal development. We describe the workings of conflict in complex nonlinear systems such as schools, and present ways to increase your conflict quotient (CQ) and learn to see and avoid energy traps.

As the current generation of teachers and administrators struggles with the cultural shift from working in isolation with norms of autonomy and independence to working in more collaborative  ways,  conflicts  are  inevitable. The most important of these are values conflicts,  engagement  in  hearing  views  different from  one's  own,  exploring  what  a  cocreated future  might  look  like,  and  facing  difficult truths  about  current  situations.  Obstacles  for such  work  include  conviviality  and  surface harmony  that  mask  underlying  tensions  and differences about the purposes and processes of  learning  and  teaching.  Amplifying  these differences  are  accountability  pressures,  sophisticated  data  management  systems,  and rewards  for  student  performance  (Newman, King, and Rigdon, 1997).

Individuals approach conflict informed by personal history, and the culture in which they work.  Four  orientations  are  common:  being passive, aggressive, passive-aggressive, or assertive.  Only  the  last  is  healthy  and  effective for individuals,  families,  and  organizations. The passive individual avoids conflict. It is not surprising  that  fear  and  resentment  might  be a  part  of  this  person's  internal  world.  Passive persons accommodate others, placing their own interests  last.  In  aggressive  approaches,  however personal desires are placed above those of others.  Persons  acting  aggressively  often  express and stimulate intense emotion in others: sometimes striking out, blaming, belittling, or boisterously demanding their own way.

Of  the  four  approaches,  the  passive-aggressive  is  the  most  destructive.  This  person throws a rock through your window, then hides the hand that threw it, as if to say, 'Who me?' This  person  uses  negative  presuppositions, 'Even  a  department  head  should  know  that,' leaving the other wounded while not being sure what produced the injury.

Finally, the assertive person is clear about personal  outcomes,  personal  boundaries,  and the right to protect his or her values and self. This  person  engages  others  with  a  nondefensive attitude, verbally confident responses, and is open to collaboration. Clinical-experimental psychologist  Manuel  Smith's  (1975)  seminal book  on  assertiveness  included  theory  and learnable phrases for a range of situations and is  still  a  valuable  resource  today.  The  seven norms  of  collaboration  provide  assertive  language patterns.

What  are  your own  tendencies?  Are you  most  likely  to  be  passive,  aggressive,

passive-aggressive,  or  assertive?  In  a  study of  workplace  culture,  Ames  and  Wazlawek (2015) found that we might not perceive ourselves as others do. Test your own perceptions by  gathering  anonymous  assessments  from peers and colleagues.

Conflict  within  groups  is  made  messy because  often  each  of  the  four  orientations is  simultaneously  present.  Additionally,  how groups work with and learn from their conflicts is related to their work culture and says much about who they are and who they wish to be. Betty Achinstein (2002) notes the following:

Communities that can productively engage in conflict have a greater potential for continual growth  and  renewal.  Conflict  is  a  critical factor  in  understanding  what  distinguishes  a generic  professional  community  of  teacher colleagues  from  a  learning  community  engaged in ongoing inquiry and change. (p. 11)

Four types of information are needed to be at  your  most  effective  in  situations  with  conflict: (a) understanding self; (b) understanding of trust; (c) understanding conflict, its dynamics,  its  dangers,  and  its  opportunities;  and  (d) knowledge  of  a  variety  of  conflict  tools  and ways to use them skillfully.

The sequence in which you will want this information  depends  on  your  learning  style (abstract or concrete), urgency (are you thinking about conflict in general, or are you in the middle  of  one),  and  personal  history.  If  you have an immediate need for learning new tools, move  ahead  to  the  section  '10  Energy  Traps and the related tools.' If you aren't hurting at the moment, begin here searching for personal descriptions and read on.

## Understanding Self

'The  challenging  internal  work  of  facilitation'  (and  we  would  add  being  an  adaptive educator)  Roger  Schwarz  (2002)  reminds  us, 'is to identity and explore the core values and assumptions that guide your actions, to rigorously reflect on how they increase or decrease your effectiveness and to develop a new set of values and assumptions that you can use to increase your effectiveness and that of the groups you work with' (p. 66).

In  the  spirit  of  reflection,  you  might  ask what  is  your  pattern  of  explaining  things  to yourself?  Seligman  (2006)  notes  that  people have  explanatory  styles  that  can  lead  them  to pessimism or optimism and that with awareness and attention they can change these orientations. What  are  your  own  patterns?  In  general,  we create what we perceive, which, in turn mirrors back to us what we see. Disaster is occasionally in  the  eye  of  the  beholder.  School  yourself  to positively  presume  the  intentions  of  others. Remember that in doing so, you don't need to know why the  other  person is choosing certain behaviors, just be willing to believe that in some way this person is taking care of themselves.

The  seventh  norm,  presuming  positive intentions,  is  a  matter  of  respect  for  others. Its Latin  origin, respecere , means  to  look again, highlighting the active nature of respect. 'Where once we saw one aspect of a person,' explains  William  Isaacs,  'we  look  again  and realize  how  much  of  them  we  had  missed' (1999, p. 111).

What do you anticipate from others? Expectations of others often become a self-fulfilling prophecy. One's perceptions, assumptions, and expectations have a lot to do with the presence or absence of affective conflict.

## Be the Best You

The  best  of  who  you  are  comes  from overcoming  your  biology  and  taking  action based  on  self-examination.  Adaptive  leaders are 'open to their own growth and learning that eventually infuse larger change efforts' (Senge, Hamilton, and Kania, 2015, p. 29). The human brain is guided by an overarching survival principle. So, its job is to classify the world around us  into  two  categories:  those  that  hurt  you  or help you to stay alive (Rock, 2009).

Given  the  self-protective  drive  for  survival, without conscious awareness, our brains

- What might be some of the assumptions you tend to hold about people in general?
- In what ways are the conclusions that you reach with regard to people in general based on the accurate processing of as much observable data as possible?
- What beliefs do you hold about the goodness of people?
- What are your beliefs about positive intentions; in even those situations that struggle to understand? you
- What are your beliefs about the proposition that any person is acting in a way that is guided by some degree of positive intent, from that individuals of view? point

automatically  process  all  new  input  for  both physical  and  emotional  risk.  The  brain's  reticular  activating  system  (RAS)  automatically controls whether the cerebral cortex (thinking) or the limbic system (feeling) acts on the new input. As perceived risk or threat rises, the RAS routes input to the limbic system, the home of our freeze, flee, fight, or befriend responses. On the  other  hand,  when  risk  and  threat  are  low and new input offers challenge, the RAS activates the prefrontal cortex, where our resourcefulness as data analyzers and decision makers is at its maximum. During the Pleistocene era, frequent  and  dramatic  environmental  changes occurred, requiring humans to be adaptive and wary  within  their  environment.  Our  inherited brain  has  a  hard-wired  defensive  orientation, which  first  presumes  negative  intentions.  The best of who you are overcomes this biological tendency  in  order  to  manage  disputes  with common sense.

Feeling  is  first.  When  emotional  needs are not addressed in problem solving, tensions persist  at  a  subterranean  level,  affecting  everything else. People have emotional needs for influence, approval, inclusion, justice, self-esteem,  autonomy,  and  affirmation  of  personal values. Rock (2009) calls these social needs of the brain: status, certainty, autonomy, respect, and  fairness.  Studies  of  the  brain,  according to  Rock,  are  revealing  that  much  of  human motivation  in  social  intercourse  is  driven  by the  principle  of  minimizing threat and maximizing reward.

Adaptive  educators  are  agile,  seeking  to be  effective,  not  comfortable.  To  be  effective each needs to challenge one's own tendencies. Each of us can modify what we discover to be unproductive within ourselves. Adaptive leaders, in fact, are committed to their own learning and growth.

Finally, what is your risk quotient? To what degree do you feel secure in your present environment? What is your assessment of personal risk in speaking out as a member of a group or disagreeing with an authority figure? Run a punishment-reward assessment. If you find you can live with the realistic extremes of either, you've given  yourself  permission  to  speak  up.  Additionally,  to  what  degree  have  you  automated the norms of collaboration, especially the paraphrase,  the  pause,  paying  attention  to  self  and others, and presumption of positive intentions? We regard the paraphrase as verbal aikido, moving with rather than blocking the other person's energy. A paraphrase is probably the most effec-

tive tool in conflict. It embodies the admonition of St. Francis Assisi, 'Seek first to understand, then  to  be  understood.'  To  this  we  would  add harvesting the emotional resources to lead with inquiry when you most disagree.

## Trust Matters

Trust is essential. Trust has a direct impact on productive conflict resolution (TschannenMoran, 2004); standardized test scores (Bryk and Schneider, 2002; Tschannen-Moran, 2004);  teacher  collaboration  (Meier,  2002); participation  in  decision  making  (Hoy  and Sweetland,  2000);  and  collective  teacher  efficacy  (Goddard,  Hoy,  and  Woolfolk-Hoy, 2004;  Tschannen-Moran,  2004).  Bryk  and Schneider's (2002) longitudinal study of four hundred Chicago Elementary schools stunned the  educational  community  when  they  documented the direct role relational trust had on mathematics  and  reading  gains.  They  concluded  that  an  interrelated  set  of  mutual  dependencies  are  embedded  within  the  social exchanges  in  any  school  community  among teachers,  parents,  students,  and  principals. These create a feeling of vulnerability as each party relies on the others to fulfill their responsibilities  (Bryk  and  Schneider,  2003).  They used the term 'criteria for the discernment of trust'  to  describe  the  dynamics  of  the  social interactions that occur in the school environment.  Relational  trust,  they  determined,  was composed  of  four  factors:  respect,  personal regard, competence, and integrity. In a school, teachers, parents, students, and principals are mutually dependent on each other to achieve their goals. This mutual dependence creates a feeling of vulnerability as each party relies on the others to fulfill their responsibilities. Satisfaction results when the parties have a shared understanding of their roles and believe each other to be acting with good intentions (Bryk and Schneider, 2002).

## Understanding Conflict

The definition of conflict varies, and each variation  illuminates  a  different  and  useful understanding  that  provides  a  framework  for constructive conflict. Here are five definitions of conflict:

- 1. Conflict is the condition in which people's concerns appear to be incompatible.
- 2. Conflict is energy in the system-nothing more, nothing less. People bring meaning to  conflict.  The  ways  they  do  so  is  influenced by personal history, cultural norms, family  patterns,  and  the  practices  of  the group within which they work.
- 3. Conflict  is  a  situation  that  presents  both danger and opportunity. The Chinese character  for crisis combines  these  symbols and, like conflict, draws attention to each dimension.  Danger  emerges  with  the  violation  of  personal  needs.  Opportunity emerges  when  clarifying  the  issues  and generating workable solutions.
- 4. Conflict stems from a perceived competition for limited resources: budget, power, status, respect, time or more universallyair, water, land, or food.
- 5. Conflict has different meanings to different individuals;  therefore,  multiple  meanings exist within a conflicted group.

The  truth  about  conflict  lies  somewhere in  the  vortex  of  these  definitions.  Becoming smart  about  conflict  and  having  it  work  for you requires an understanding of conflict from all these perspectives as well as understanding yourself  and  schools  as  complex  nonlinear systems. It also requires being clear about your personal goals and values.

Groups need cognitive conflict-task conflict-to produce good work. The absence of  any  conflict  often  leads  to  apathy,  with decisions  defaulting  to  leaders  or  those  with

Trust as a Three-Legged Stool

<!-- image -->

Steve Barone offers a snapshot view congruent with the Bryk and Schneider' s research. Steve is a former New York administrator and international school consultant who uses the metaphor of a three-legged stool to describe three trust essentials: sincerity, competence; and reliability .

The origin for the word sincere is Greek. It means without wax. Earlier in history; the Italians would sometimes melt paraffin into the cracks of marble; let it and polish it. Since top dollar went to perfect marble, this became common for stone damaged in the ground or in the removal process. The Greeks; savvy to this, demanded sincere marble from their suppliers. Sincere means to tell the truth all the time, about what you think and how you feel. Barone describes his 5-year-old daughter sent to her room for telling a lie and told to stay there until she reasoned why truth is preferable . "When you tell the truth you only have to remember half as much; she concluded. dry ,

Competence means you can deliver on promises. You have the capacity to perform what you offer. Competence, of course, requires prerequisite skills. One of the author' s grandsons needed his appendix out during a trip to Mexico. While his grandfather might have been happy to remove it, he had no competence: Thankfully found a capable surgeon. Being competent applies to keeping confidences; on time, honestly assessing one's instruction when examining student work, and working collaboratively with others. they being

Reliability means all the time. If the brakes on your car fail, do you trust them anymore? How many hamburgers have to kill someone for McDonald s to be out of business? How often can a principal fail to keep his word and maintain trust?   Being human of course, we make mistakes . When so, ask for forgiveness . Requesting forgiveness involves three steps: admit you screwed up, apologize for the hurt it caused, and resolve to not do it again.

the  loudest  voices.  Yet,  cognitive  conflict  is a slippery slope. What starts as disagreement about ideas will sometimes slip into affective conflict-relationship  conflict-when  people lack  the  skills  for  distinguishing  and  managing  productive  disagreements  (Rafferty, 2012).  Affective  conflict  is  'disagreements, either  person-to-person  or  group-to-group, that involve  antagonism.  Such  interactions sap energy, derail tasks, and block much group work' (Ensley, et al., 2002, p. 369). One major goal of group development is to amplify cognitive conflict and minimize affective conflict. Accomplish this with the seven norms of collaboration and the many strategies referenced in this book that provide psychologically safe

## Centering is First: What, Why, How

What: To be the most effective you can  be  during  conflict,  use  the  ancient Aikido  visualization  art  of  centering. Centering  brings  you  into  the  here  and now,  takes  power  away  from  concerns and negative thoughts, and helps you remain stable and grounded. Aikido Master  Thomas  Crum  brought  this  to  our attention  recently  when  he  wondered  if centering  might  not  be  taught  in Adaptive  Schools  seminars  (2015).  'Center' refers  to  a  relaxed  yet  focused  state  of mind and is a productive way of being in conflict or not.

Why: The concept of 'ki' holds that all physical  and  mental  power  comes from  the  flow  of  energy  around  your body. Energy is lost when you are tense.

How:  In  a  delightful  story  about how harried businessman Angus breaks negative habits leading to anger, exhaustion, and poor performance, Crum (2009) describes three profoundly effective and learnable steps. First, focus on breathing in the present moment with balance and energy; next, breathe in the 'me I want to be'  with  power  and  purpose;  and finally,  let  go  of  judgment,  breathing  in the mystery.

structures with which to address hard-to-talk about topics (see appendix A).

## Learning from Social Psychology

Social  psychologists  study  efforts  to  resolve  human  conflict.  Advice  found  in  the popular press often has its origins in social psychology.  In  our  explorations  of  conflict  from the perspective of this field, we have identified the following three principles to be of value to educators who work with any form of conflict:

- 1. Define fairness.
- 2. Identify and label the social norms for preventing  conflict,  regulating  conflict,  and finding solutions to conflict.
- 3. Address the sources of conflict.

## Defining Fairness

Agreement  is  more  likely  and  can  be reached more quickly when a single standard of  fairness  applies  than  when  a  group  uses multiple standards or no standards. It is best to  negotiate  the  fairness  criteria  early  in  the process.  Groups  usually  select  from  three definitions. Test the working definition of each with 'what if' scenarios.

## Equality

Everybody benefits or contributes equally. Three variations of this criterion have been observed: (a)  equal  outcomes, (b)  equal  concessions (i.e., all parties make the same degree of movement toward the middle), and (c) outside precedent (e.g., What are other districts paying their teachers?).

## Equity

Benefit is proportional to contributions or work  done.  Merit-pay  systems  operate  with this principle. Ideally, such systems should be based on student learning data and on a teacher's  contribution  to  the  greater  good  through skillful collaborative engagement.

## Needs

Benefit  should  be  proportional  to  need. Federal funding formulas for grants to schools with high populations of low-income children represent  this  line  of  thinking.  It  is  striking to  us  that  most  local  and  state  governments have left it to the federal system to apply this definition and have chosen not to do so with local funding.

## Identifying and Labeling Social Norms

People will often attack the process when they are not happy with a resolution. Prevent this by identifying and labeling ahead of time the norms that the involved parties will agree to use.

## Norms for Preventing Conflict

The  norms  for  preventing  conflict  are either  productive  or  destructive.  Destructive patterns  include  being  excessively  polite, avoiding issues, using humor as a distraction, and  emphasizing  congeniality  (i.e.,  making nice) over professional collegiality. Overregulating  the  process  for  resolving  issues  with an avalanche of policies, forms, and detailed chains of command is a counterproductive approach used by some large organizations. We know of a school overseas in which conflict is  'managed' by banning all employee organizations. Such approaches drive expressions of  conflict  underground,  affect  relationships, and ultimately destroy personal and collective efficacy and morale.

Productive patterns for preventing conflict include assigning resources and responsibilities on the basis of some agreed-upon definition of fairness (e.g.,  all  teachers  rotate  yard-duty  responsibilities except Mrs. Lopez, who runs an after-school tutorial clinic). Interactive patterns for conflict prevention include the seven norms of collaboration and an agreement to trace rumors back to their sources.

## Norms for Regulating Conflict

To  talk  first  with  one's  adversary  before going to a third party is an example of a norm for regulating  conflict.  Groups  define  what constitutes fair fighting. Agreements to address issues, not personalities, speak about the future, not  the  past  are  examples  of  ways  in  which groups might define fair fighting. Agreements to discuss the undiscussable, personal feelings, values,  or  student  achievement  in  the  math department  constitute  norms  for  regulating conflict.  Groups  make  regulatory  agreements about  language.  Instead  of  saying,  'You're wrong,'  they  agree  to  say,  'I  see  it  another way.'  (See  the  strategy  'Disagreement  Grid' in appendix A.)

## Norms for Finding Solutions

Agree  first  about  solution  criteria  and solution processes (Who will decide?). Identify and explore the assumptions that underlie the different positions. Raise questions like the following to help groups confront conflict:

- · What  is  the  worst  possible  outcome  of addressing this?
- · What is the best possible outcome of addressing this?
- · What are the worst and best possible outcomes of not addressing this?
- · What outcome do you imagine  that  your adversary has?
- · Would  it be OK  if your adversaries achieved their outcomes?

## The Context in Which Conflict Occurs

The traditional working culture of schools challenges  the  effectiveness  of  much  of  the established knowledge about conflict. Adaptive leaders know that schools are living paradoxes, operating simultaneously as thing models and energy  models.  In  the  spirit  of  'thingness,' schools  have  been  organized  for  more  than  a century  as  machines,  a  collection  of  smaller units  making  a  part-to-whole  universe:  objectives  to  lessons  and  units  to  curriculum,  a racecourse  of  relatively  standardized  ground that students must cover in their journey to the finish line (Tyler, 1949; Wiggins and McTighe, 2005; Zais, 1976).

In  this  model,  principles  of  cause-andeffect prevail, values are formalized into contracts,  event-level  thinking  is  the  norm,  and tacit rules govern daily behavior. Transactions tend  toward  formality  and  politeness  (Sergiovanni,  1994).  A  teacher  once  told  us  that each year students were coming to her without

requisite skills, but that she would be hesitant to bring up the problem with the students' prior teachers for fear of offending them.

Schools are also quantum systems-'bundles of energy in motion,' more like communities  than  businesses. Drawing from the science of  chaos  and  complexity  theory,  we  get  a  different picture of the organizing energies of the planet (Gleick, 1987). Using sophisticated mathematical  modeling,  scientists  who  study  complex systems provide us with images of different and  often  nonlinear  patterns  of  organization. Such  systems  are  best  understood  by  studying the behavior of the complex whole rather than the behavior of the parts (Gharajedaghi, 2006).

Complex systems organize around 'strange attractors.' For schools, some of these strange attractors are the core values, vision, and mission of the school or district that draw people together  like  magical  magnets  in  a  common purpose.  In  these  schools,  the  staffs  energetically  work  to  provide  children  and  young adults with more than a sense of artificial belonging; the principles, passions, and conflicting energies of living systems apply.

Our central premise is that schools are enterprises of both things and energy, yet 'thing' mental  models  dominate  most  approaches  to conflict.  When  educators  learn  to  see  their schools  as  dynamic  systems  of  energy  and information,  they  are  liberated  to  practice more effective ways of working with conflict. To understand how behavior operates in these systems,  we  have  identified  ten  energy  traps that serve as lenses for analyzing and responding to conflicts.

## Energy Traps

Certain  ways  of  perceiving  conflict  limit possibilities  and  constrain  energy  in  increasingly destructive loops. Energy traps establish counterproductive, recursive patterns throughout  a  system.  Microphone  feedback  is  an example: The closer the microphone is to the speaker, the louder the squeal as the signal cycles repeatedly through the sound system, grat-

## Contention

Contention  occurs  when  disagreement is  poorly  dealt  with.  Four  conditions create contention. (1) The natural desire  to  explain  one's  own  side  first. Instead,  paraphrase  first.  This,  keeps one from being defensive, causes one to consider more carefully what the other person  is  attempting  to  communicate. (2) The first condition relates to the second,  our  general  ineffectiveness  as  listeners. Listening requires attention and energy. Thought takes place at about the same rate as visual recognition but hearing takes place about four times as fast. (3) Fear that we will not get our way is the  third  condition  leading  to  contention. Finally, (4) is the assumption that one of us has to lose.

ing on the nerves of the listeners. The summer sun beating down on Death Valley, California, produces  waves  of  energy  that  heat  the  rock walls of the valley, trapping energy that builds up throughout the day. A similar phenomenon occurs  over  cities  on  warm  days  and  nights with  cloud  cover;  heat  is  trapped  beneath  the clouds,  making  the  air  sticky  and  uncomfortable.  One  person  who  is  being  grumpy  sets up  an  energy  trap  if  other  people  respond  by matching the grumpiness. A teacher who talks above the volume of the class to get attention simply  leads  to  the  students  increasing  their volume so they can hear one another.

Recognizing  traps  in  order  to  release  energy  is  the  first  step  in  problem  resolution. When they  detect  energy  traps,  skilled  group leaders can open emotional and cognitive space by establishing new frames for viewing situations for themselves and for other group members. 'Frames are mental structures that shape the  way  we  see  the  world.  As  a  result,  they shape the goals we seek, the plans we make, the way we act, and what counts as a good or bad outcome of our actions' (Lakoff, 2004, p. xv).

These  frames,  or  mental  maps,  have  two critical features that apply directly to working with  conflicts  (Kelly,  2006):  (1)  Faulty  maps lead us to faulty actions, and (2) it takes purposeful effort to modify or change a map once it has been established.

Ten common traps, which can be reframed to  provide  fresh  perspectives  and  additional solution options, are as follows:

- 1.  Operating  metaphors,  like  the  'war  on drugs.'
- 2.  Time orientations that confuse past, present, and future.
- 3. Time horizons that are too short or too long.
- 4.  Nominalizations: naming  processes as things.
- 5.  The illusion of human separateness.
- 6.  A focus on production to the detriment of production capacity.
- 7.  Fixing what shows, not what is broken.
- 8.  The myth that problems require solutions.
- 9.  Personalization of conflict.
- 10.  Being emotions rather than having emotions.

We were once asked to consult at what we will call the Unhappy Elementary School. The school's  difficulties  had  reached  such  proportions  that  the  school  board  had  threatened  to remove the principal unless she could 'turn the school around' before the end of the year. We were contacted in March.

The  previous  principal  had  been  at  the school  for  eighteen  years  and  was  a  laissez-faire leader. The current principal had been there  for  eighteen  months,  bringing  a  strong background in curriculum and instruction and a more directive leadership style to the role. We decided to conduct information interviews with each staff member in preparation for a full-day staff meeting.

Our  private  interviews  revealed  that  the teachers were not only complaining about the principal,  they  were  also  complaining  about each  other.  We  learned  that  many  individuals made disparaging remarks about fellow teachers  to  colleagues,  certified  staff,  and  parents. Privately,  a  stream  of  vicious  communication existed.  'We're  shooting  at  our  wingman  instead  of  working  together,'  one  teacher  confided.  Publicly,  the  staff  wore  polite  faces  to one another and discharged their negative feelings on a common irritant, the principal. Some staff members had pipelines to board members and regularly reported their versions of events at the school.

Several  classical  features  of  conflict  are present  in  this  example.  First,  conflict  was perpetuating  itself,  ricocheting  around  in  the energy  traps  of  time  orientations,  nominalizations,  fixing  what  shows,  and  personalizing  conflict  amid  a  labyrinth  of  underground communications.  Second,  conflict  is  always contextual. In this case, the school's history, a hands-off  principal,  and  a  building  organized into  pods  contributed  to  separate  and  disconnected units of teachers, with each unit unique in identity, norms, and team leaders. Third, the teachers  were  bright,  highly  verbal,  and  passionately committed to action. The mix worked reasonably  well  with  a  laissez-faire  principal who left each pod free to do its own thing, but it became an obstacle when the school was faced with a common crisis.

To  release  trapped  energy,  first  you  must identify the trap. Understand it as a conceptual shape that holds energy within certain configurations. One way to identify the frames through which you are viewing a conflict-whether you are directly involved or simply on the periphery  as  an  observer-is  to  free-write  for  a  set amount  of  time  about  the  conflict.  Resist  the temptation to analyze as you write; keep your pen  moving  until  the  time  is  up.  Then  read through the descriptions of the ten traps below to see which ones might be operating in your situation. Consider ways to release the energy by  changing  the  frame  and  opening  the  trap, allowing the possibility of new resolutions into the situation.

Strategies  and  tools  in  the  'What  to  Do' column below can be found in appendix A.

## The Trap

## Ten Energy Traps

## What To Do

## 1. Operating Metaphors

The human conceptual system is primarily metaphorical in nature. Concepts structure what people perceive. Language labels concepts and directs perception. A group's metaphorical language provides containers for thinking that hold unconscious assumptions, beliefs, goals, and values.

The "reading wars" or the "war on drugs" are examples. Listen to groups or leaders in groups. Those thinking in war metaphors will use words like fight, position, shoot down, bomb, attack, and defend.

Sports metaphors drive group into "winning" against an adversary. Others, like golf, challenge each person to do his or her individual best.

But what if we never had a war on drugs, and instead had a rally for health? Changing language puts energy in new containers and opens fresh possibilities for resolution.

You can either extend concepts within a metaphor or change the metaphor. All metaphors illuminate some portions of reality and hide others.  Search for unstated images within a prevailing metaphor to reframe group thinking. F or example, if a committee is intent on "battling illiteracy," focus attention on "training the soldiers" rather than "gathering weapons." Or change the metaphor. Why not a ship instead of a war, a journey instead of an attack, a garden rather than a field or battle?

What people name a thing determines their perception of it and hence their choices and behaviors.

- · Listen to the language that group members and group leaders use.
- · Illuminate and extend unstated images within a metaphor-war ... supply lines  ... training the troops.

"If we're a team, what sport are we playing? Who is the quarterback? Who is the coach? What kind of coach do we have?"

"If the faculty is a family, who is the mommy, the daddy, the little brother, or the eccentric uncle?"

"If parents are our customers, what are we selling?"

## · Change the metaphor.

"A rally for health instead of a war on drugs."

- "Conducting an orchestra instead of giving orders to the troops."
- · Surface and label assumptions, values, and goals within the metaphors the group is using.

"Y  ou frequently use the term autonomy, what are some of your assumptions about the ways that this value influence choices and behaviors in this organization?"

## The Trap

## 2. Time Orientation (past, Present, Future)

"We've always done it that way" identifies a speaker who is focusing on the past. Energy gets stuck when groups focus exclusively on either past,  present, or future or when conversations jump randomly across all three time dimensions. Free energy by addressing one temporal zone at a time. In general, we find that in problem-solving conversations energy is most freed when it is directed towards the future. Help groups to describe the desired state. Then back up to the present or the very near future to determine what must be done to achieve the envisioned future.

Some groups get stuck in the past. Free them by providing a vehicle to tell their stories. Our friend and colleague,  Suzanne Bailey, teaches a timeline strategy to help groups get themselves unstuck.  The group designates "eras" in history:  the year the new superintendent came,  the years of declining or increasing enrollment, the period of a major reorganization. Chart paper is hung on walls in the form of a time  line and icons used to illustrate different eras and the significant events that occurred. Groups of people complete the timeline with words, icons, and their memories delivered to one another as verbal histories. As a result, people hear about the same event from different perspectives, forming a more complex history with greater understanding of conflicting perceptions. What is expressed and understood is released.

Time confusions occasionally cause meeting energy carom off the walls like the rubber ball in a racquetball court. In such cases, a skilled facilitator directs the conversations to one time zone at a time.

## What To Do

- · Focus group members on one temporal zone at a time.

In meetings say, "First, we will address what outcomes we want and then we will explore strategies that might help us to achieve those outcomes."

- · Adhere to the meeting standards of one content and one process at a time.
- · Use facilitator interventions to maintain energy focus in the group.

By focusing and directing energy, the facilitator maintains one content and one process at a time.

- · Introduce the Existing State-Desired State Map.

This tool brings the future into the room and links it to present actions.

- · Teach and apply Outcome Mapping to the situation.

This tool links the present to the future.

- · Teach and apply The Futures Wheel to the situation.

This tool provides images of possible future effects of issues and innovations.

- · Teach and apply a Histomap with groups that are stuck in the past.

This tool honors the past and brings it forward to the present.

## The Trap

## 3. Time Horizons

The unit of time within which parties plan to resolve a conflict limits solutions options. Negotiations literature advises that everything is negotiable, including deadlines. Our friend and colleague Laura Lipton intuitively knows this and frequently moves to extend deadlines on pro jects. In return, she gets release from deadline stress, more time for reflection, fmer detail in her work, and better products.

Many time horizons are taken for granted because of past practices. Take, for example, the practice of assigning teachers to students for a single year. The moment a teacher decides to follow a class from second to third grade or from fifth to sixth grade, everything changes. Perceptions of student development burst from a 9-month window of growth to 2 years; diagnostic and relationship-building time at the beginning of the second year is practically eliminated; social norms of the class are understood and can be more effectively utilized; and parents' relationships with the teacher carry on into the second year.

Either lengthening or shortening time horizons modifies energy. A group of parents in a Colorado school wanted a principal removed. Stretching out the time period for seeking resolution to this controversy would have stirred up more problems as more people became involved and rumors multiplied. Keeping the processing time tight, kept attention focused on facts and issues and not on hearsay.

Extending time horizons also provides benefits. Plotting a multiyear curriculum revision allows full communication with all parties, reliable baseline data, and  judiciously set expectations.

## What To Do

- · Assess the consequences of a longer or shorter time line.
- · Lengthen time lines when deeper dialogue will allow group members to work through options, emotions, and obstacles to change.

Provide a year for a faculty to dialogue about block scheduling instead of a month before making a decision.

## · Shorten time lines when issues are of lower order importance.

For the question, "What color should we paint the staff room?" take exactly one meeting with the principal making the decision based on what she has heard if group members cannot come to agreement.

## · Teach and apply Outcome Mapping to the situation.

Carefully calculate time requirements for implementing the strategies required for goal achievement.

## · Teach and apply The Futures Wheel to the situation.

This tool offers images of possible futures related to the issue or innovation under consideration.

## The Trap

## 4. Nominalizations

Speakers nominalize when they talk about a process as a thing or an event.  Teachers at one school said that the principal didn't "respect" them. Respect is a noun and is static, or unchanging; respecting is a process that is active in time with observable manifestations. Verbs are process words and imply active participation by persons or elements. As such, they imply choice and point to behaviors.

Some groups tell us that "trust" is missing in their organization. Groups cannot improve trust, they can only increase trusting behaviors.  We've learned to ask what people will be doing and saying when they are trusting.

"Conflict" is another nominalization. With conflict-as with love, anger, happiness, fear, or any emotion we tend to nominalize-there is a starting point, varying levels of intensity, a cooling off, and transition into another emotional state.  In each case, the language that labels these processes as things freezes these dynamic flowing activities into static conceptual abstractions. When groups act on the abstraction instead of the real issue, they experience failure and frustration.

Conversely, the more groups use the language of logic,  emotion, and process, the greater their awareness and ability to direct and control conflicting energies.

## What To Do

- · Notice nominalizations in oral and written language.
- · Trust
- · Team
- · Department
- · Conflict
- · Relationship
- · Attitudes
- · Friendship

Ask group members to freewrite about the issue to surface potential nominalizations.

## · Denominalize the language.

"What would they be doing when they are respecting you?"

"What might you see and hear when they are showing you respect?"

"How will you know when they are trusting you?"

"What is it about the way that they are relating that is troubling you?"

- · Create See and Hear T  -Charts to publicly denominalize critical terms.

## The Trap

## 5. The Illusion of Separateness

During intense periods of Middle Eastern shuttle diplomacy, then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger used to say that he would remind himself of three things. First, he would remember to forget his culture; second, he would remember to forget his agenda; and third, he would remember his humanness. From such perspectives, conflicts remind people that they are irretrievably connected and that any sense of separateness is illusion.

Randy Swigert, an astronaut in the Apollo program, tells this story about one mission. For several days, they orbited the Earth until conditions were right for reentry. With relative leisure, he now had time to gaze from the spaceship to the Earth below. Hurtling over the Pacific Ocean, the West Coast of the United States suddenly appeared below them. He was aware of a visceral reaction, a sense of  joyful belonging as he recognized his "home." Then a little later, Cape Canaveral appeared, and he had another gut reaction of connection as he viewed the place from which the spaceship had been launched. Soon, he noticed, that he began to anticipate the view of the West coast and the launching site, and his sense of connection grew.

Around and around the globe he orbited, each time anticipating the  joy of recognition a little earlier, until finally he realized that he was connecting with the entire planet. He came to realize that all the lines that separate us on Earth are artificial.

## What To Do

- · Use inclusion activities to help group members learn the ways that they are connected, such as:
- · First  job
- · Ajob  I might have taken ifI had not become an educator
- · Cross interviews among group members to discover "some things you might not know about \_\_ "
- · Use fishbowl conversations­
- administrators in the center, teachers outside listening. The inner group describes desired outcomes, the outer group listens. Then, the groups switch positions and tasks.
- · Share stories such as the examples in the left hand column.
- · Share information about another group, such as single parents who are just making ends meet, have two jobs, and are intimidated about coming to school to deal with issues there.
- · Use In and Out of the Frame to surface and label the frames of reference through which group members are viewing an issue. Then surface and label frames of reference through which others might be viewing the situation.
- · Parent
- · College graduates
- · Veteran staff member
- · Administrator
- · Male / female
- · Local tax payer
- · Newcomer to town
- · Elected official

## 6. Focusing on Production to the Detriment of Production Capacity

Schools operate in demanding environments. Faculties sometimes press so hard for achievement that they forget to take care of themselves. A school in California was recently in crisis.  Overnight the school population had doubled.  Flooded with new students and staff, conflicting program demands,  and inadequate facilities, the faculty worked hard to address these issues.  They ran communication skills courses after school for two semesters in which 90% of the staff participated.  The skills that were learned there helped the group to manage tough conflicts with the board, the teachers' union, themselves, and a few years later, a district wide strike.  This staff recovered faster and better from the trauma of the strike than any other unit in the district.

Groups avoid this trap when they honor and protect time for reflection.  Since adults do not learn from experience, any group too busy to reflect about its work is too busy to improve. Knowing this, some groups set task/process rations.  For every 60 minutes of meeting time, for example, 10 minutes is spent on reflecting about meeting processes.

Some school boards and at least one state (Missouri), have policies establishing that a certain percentage of funding go to staff development efforts.  Offer schools use the first 5-10 minutes of faculty meetings for journal reflections.

## What To Do

- · Teach, apply, monitor, and reflect upon two ways of talking.
- · Introduce, inventory. and develop the seven norms of collaboration.
- · Introduce, adopt, and self monitor five meeting standards.
- · Train and rotate facilitator and recorder roles within meetings.
- · Institutionalize processes and programs that support self-directed learning­ Cognitive Coaching, mentoring, peer coaching, data-driven dialogue, lesson study, action research.
- · Develop a process toolkit.
- · Design meeting agendas with both topic and process outcomes. Protect time for reflection on both types of outcomes.

## 7. Fixing What Shows, Not What is Broken

One common energy trap is a tendency to fix what shows rather than what is broken.  Ours is a quick fix culture.  Television mysteries are solved in 30 to 60 minutes, minus time for commercials. Daily newspapers headline new solutions for school improvement, poverty, and crime. Legislative bodies adopt simple fixes for complex problems,  and in many cases the answers have nothing to do with the problem.

Teacher evaluation systems are another case in point. As a profession, we've spent millions of dollars and as many hours learning and applying teacher evaluations systems, yet there is no clear evidence that such efforts improve instruction.

When groups fix what shows, it often leads to new problems.  Fixing the new conflict that then shows merely leads to another.  Since work is being done only at the level of appearances, the underlying tensions are left unattended and will erupt again at the next fissure.

The airlines' decision to monitor and report on­ time schedules resulted in air carriers padding their flight times between cities to produce higher percentages of on-time arrivals. Air traffic efficiencies,  group crew tum around procedures, baggage handling, and the like could then be ignored. What showed was the on-time arrival data.

Fixing what is broken requires a deep understanding of the interacting energies that are creating the undesirable conditions. Experienced problem solvers spend the bulk of their time on problem finding not on solution generation.

## What To Do

- · Paraphrase to understand and clarify how others in the group are framing an issue.
- · Teach and apply the Assumptions Wall process.
- · Create an Issues Agenda
- · Develop Causal Loop Diagrams
- · Craft a Desired State Map
- · Create a Fishbone Diagram
- · Structure conversations about data
- · Assess group Energy Sources

## 8. Accepting the Myth That Problems Require Solutions

After a century of movie watching, most of the world uncritically assumes that most problems have solutions. However, many situations exist in which no clear resolution is possible. In these cases, the wise person seeks the counsel of St. Francis's prayer, "God, grand me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference."

Turf issues in departmentalized settings are examples of problems that never go away.  They are a deeply rooted manifestation of territoriality, self-interest,  and survival.  The most useful question to ask is, "How can we work together compatibly, holding service to students as our first priority while recognizing and honoring the needs of individual departments?"

Conflict within and between groups will always be a problem. We cannot wish it away, avoid it away, or pretend that there is some ideal organization that experiences no conflict.

And, there will never be enough time or resources to do all of the things schools are asked or want to do.

All of these problems have no permanent solutions.  They are conditions of life in organizations, the problem to solve is how to live with them with grace and dignity.

## What To Do

- · Structure dialogues to explore, "What do we need to do to get the best of the upside of this situation and least of the downside?"
- · Teach and apply a Futures Wheel to forecast the ripple effects of actions or inactions the group might take.
- · Recite the St. Francis Prayer (facing column).
- · Develop and explore a Polarity Map.
- · Teach and apply a Fishbone diagram.

## 9. Personalizing the Conflict

A wise person once said that you will never grow up until you stop thinking that your parents' life was about you.  To ruminate on childhood memories, pretending that we were the central character in the play, is natural but is only one version of the story.

Conflicts are hardly ever about you.  They most often arise from some surface interference with another person's needs or desire.  To release yourself for the personalization trap, step onto a mental balcony and regard the conflicting interactions as part of a system.  What might possibly be going on for that other person that could open up a feeling of threat, uncertainty,  or anger? Ask yourself what is the most generous interpretation of the outcome. Would it be OK with you if the person were to achieve that outcome?

## What To Do

- · Allow your self-regard to be stronger than your critical self-voice.
- · Adopt a body posture of calm and centered  ness. Remember to breathe.
- · Go to the balcony. Look at the interaction as a system. What needs does the other person have? What is the other person feeling?
- · Paraphrase to diffuse the emotional tension for yourself and others.
- · Ask yourself what is the most generous interpretation of the other person's or group's behavior.
- · Ask yourself it would be OK with you if the other person or group achieved their outcomes.

## 10. Being Emotions, Not Having Emotions

Recall a recent experience of intense feeling. Were you happy, or feeling happiness? Were you angry, or feeling anger? Were you upset, or feeling upset? Language can decoy us into the energy trap of being at the cause of another person's behaviors. All emotions spring from choice. "The board makes me angry" is an inaccurate perception of reality. You get angry all by yourself  The board has better things to do than to irritate you.

When you shift language from I am to I am having or I am feeling, you notice that you are not your feelings,  you are not your thoughts,  and you are not your point of view. Rather,  you have feelings,  thoughts,  and points of view. It is freeing to discover that whatever you are conscious of, you can direct and control with consciousness, we can become more resourceful and draw on a range of coping strategies.

We are wired from birth to respond with primary emotions to certain features in our environment such as sounds, types of motion, and physical pain. These  physical factors trigger automatic emotional reactions in the limbic systems of our brains which release chemicals that alter cognition in response to the stimulus.

Our brains and bodies also respond to the content of our thoughts, triggering secondary emotions. Both primary and secondary emotions create surges of electrochemical response throughout the body. Each type of emotional response uses the same neural pathways. In other words, perception is reality.

## What To Do

- · Recognize and label your feelings as you are having them.
- · Listen for "makes me" language in yourself and others. Replace "makes me" with "I am choosing,"  or "I have."

Instead of "he made me angry," say, "When he does that, I feel anger."

Instead of "They upset me," say, "I feel upset when they do that."

- · Take two deep breaths to restore oxygen to your brain.
- · Adopt a body posture of calm and centeredness.
- · Walk or vigorously exercise to burn off excess adrenaline.
- · Learn about your body's responses. Respect its physiological functions. Walk away from the conflict when you are too tired, too hungry, or too provoked to be flexible and resourceful.

## How to Double Your CQ

When  you  are  presented  with  conflict, you bring your entire personal history to the stage. You  also  bring  consciousness,  the  human  capacity  to  overcome  conditioning  and to  work  effectively  with  your  physiological responses  to  fear,  anger,  disagreement,  discomfort,  and  discord.  When  you  notice  that your response to conflict and your strategies for dealing with it change according to whom you are in conflict with, it is a reminder that conflict begins inside you.

We've  experienced  tremendous  value  by freeing  ourselves  from  energy  traps.  Groups can easily learn to apply these ideas in order to learn from discord. By honoring deeper principles they will double their capacity to live and work more gracefully with conflict.

Principles  are  important  because  maximum success in any enterprise is guaranteed by clear outcomes and by applying principles-not rules-to achieve them. Rules are principles in chains. Rules restrict; they are useful some of the time, but disastrous at other times. To start and end meetings on time is a rule. To honor a group's time and energy is a principle. Sometimes you must break the rule to maintain the principle. At a community meeting in a western state,  for  instance,  a  parent  raised  an  important  concern,  about  the  district's  effort  to  set student learning standards, ten minutes before the  announced  closing  time  for  the  meeting. The  superintendent  wisely  asked  the  group's permission  to  stay  and  engage  this  topic  for the  next  forty-five  minutes.  By  doing  so,  she averted  three  months  of  potential  community upset and untold hours of communication and conflict-resolution efforts.

Both  the  literature  and  our  own  experiences provide several important principles for using  conflict  as  a  resource  within  groups. Betty Achinstein (2002), building on the work of Louis and Kruse (1995), reminds us of the importance for leaders to do the following:

- 1. Develop  forums  for  teachers  to  explore their differences.
- 2. Reinforce  community  values  to  set  the frame  for  what  to  talk  about  and  how  to talk about issues and differences.
- 3. Demonstrate  a  willingness  to  live  with ambiguity  and  reinforce  the  idea  that  all problems don't have neat solutions.
- 4. Model  critical  self-exploration  and  vulnerability.
- 5. Foster openness to different perspectives.
- 6. Don't become the final authority; support teachers in resolving conflicts themselves.
- 7. Provide structures, resources, professional development, and practice in the skills of inquiry and shared decision making.

The ultimate principle for seeing and using conflict as a resource is to listen well to yourself and others. By calming down and calming others, we develop empathy for both ourselves and them. Then we can maintain our own resourcefulness and develop shared capacities for graceful fighting about the important issues that are at the heart of true community in schools.
