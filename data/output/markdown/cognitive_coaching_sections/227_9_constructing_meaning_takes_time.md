## 9. Constructing Meaning Takes Time

Constructivists invite colleagues to seek relationships and create metaphors. When sufficient time is given to activities, learners go beyond initial relationships to create novel relationships, find patterns, and generate theories for themselves. This also means that teachers allow wait time after posing questions.

Failures are never dismissed as mistakes. Rather, time is taken to reflect on their learning, to compare intended with actual outcomes, to analyze and draw causal relationships, to synthesize meanings, and to apply their learnings to new and novel situations.

Unlike many other 'quick-fix' educational innovations and experiments, constructivist educators remain focused on the longer view. They realize that assisting others to habituate self-directed learning takes years, well-defined instruction with qualified teachers, and carefully constructed curriculum before a significant and enduring change is observed.

We know that the amount of time on task affects learning. As selfdirected learning becomes a goal of education, greater value is placed on allocating time for learning activities intended to stimulate thinking and to practice the construction or personal meaning.
