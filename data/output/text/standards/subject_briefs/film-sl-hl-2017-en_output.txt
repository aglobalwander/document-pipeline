The IB Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous, academically challenging and balanced programme of education
designed to prepare students aged 16 to 19 for success at university and life beyond. The DP aims to encourage
students to be knowledgeable, inquiring, caring and compassionate, and to develop
intercultural understanding, open-mindedness and the attitudes necessary to re­
spect and evaluate a range of viewpoints. Approaches to teaching and learning (ATL)
are deliberate strategies, skills and attitudes that permeate the teaching and learning
environment. In the DP students develop skills from five ATL categories: thinking,
research, social, self-management and communication.
To ensure both breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding, students must
choose at least one subject from five groups: 1) their best language, 2) additional
language(s), 3) social sciences, 4) sciences, and 5) mathematics. Students may choose
either an arts subject from group 6, or a second subject from groups 1 to 5. At least
three and not more than four subjects are taken at higher level (240 recommended
teaching hours), while the remaining are taken at standard level (150 recommended
teaching hours). In addition, three core elements—the extended essay, theory of knowledge and creativity, activity, service—
are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.

I. Course description and aims
The DP film course aims to develop students as proficient interpreters
and makers of film texts. Through the study and analysis of film texts, and
practical exercises in film production, students develop critical abilities
and appreciation of artistic, cultural, historical and global perspectives
in film. They examine concepts, theories, practices and ideas from mul­
tiple perspectives, challenging their own views to understand and value
those of others. Students are challenged to acquire and develop critical
thinking, reflective analysis and the imaginative synthesis through prac­
tical engagement in the art, craft and study of film.
Students experiment with film and multimedia technology, acquiring
the skills and creative competencies required to successfully commu­
nicate through the language of the medium. They develop an artistic
voice and learn how to express personal perspectives through film. The
course emphasizes the importance of working collaboratively, interna­
tional and intercultural dynamics, and an appreciation of the develop­ ment of film across time and culture.

The film syllabus allows for greater breadth and depth in teaching and
learning at HL through an additional assessment task, requiring HL stu­
dents to reflect on the core syllabus areas to formulate their own inten­
tions for a completed film. They work collaboratively as a core produc­
tion team in order to effectively communicate on screen.
The aims of the Film course are to enable students to:
• explore the various contexts of film and make links to, and be­
tween, films, filmmakers and filmmaking techniques (inquiry)
• acquire and apply skills as discerning interpreters of film and as
creators of film, working both individually and collaboratively (action)
• develop evaluative and critical perspectives on their own film work and the work of others (reflection).
