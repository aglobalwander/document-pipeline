# Foundations: Why We Coach

## Introduction and Strategic Context

#### Why Us, Why Now?

Shanghai American School (SAS) has a long-standing tradition of innovation in teaching and learning, with coaching as a key pillar in this journey. As education evolves to meet contemporary challenges—through approaches like Universal Design for Learning (UDL), Culturally Responsive Pedagogy (CRP), and the thoughtful integration of Generative AI—the need for systematic, job-embedded coaching has become increasingly important. Research consistently shows that educators who engage in sustained coaching partnerships are more likely to implement and refine high-impact practices that lead to measurable improvements in student learning.

This moment presents a unique opportunity to enhance our coaching program by embedding it more fully within our comprehensive professional learning system. By strengthening our coaching culture, we create conditions where individual educator growth, division-level priorities, and school-wide initiatives naturally align with our One School philosophy. This alignment fosters collective efficacy—our shared belief in our ability to positively impact student learning—while building sustainable practices that support continuous improvement in teaching and learning.

Through this strategic enhancement of our coaching program, we position SAS to lead in educational excellence while building lasting capacity for innovation and growth. Our investment in coaching reflects our commitment to creating an environment where educators are empowered to grow, collaborate, and implement practices that ensure every student achieves meaningful, personalized success.

* Program Integrity: Details our approach to trust, ethics, and complex situations
* Impact and Evaluation: Describes how we measure and enhance coaching effectiveness

Supporting resources, including detailed protocols, templates, and implementation guides, are provided in the appendices to assist stakeholders in applying the framework effectively.

Through this framework, we ensure coaching at SAS remains purposeful, ethical, and aligned with our commitment to educational excellence and our One School philosophy. By establishing clear principles and practices while maintaining flexibility, the Framework serves as both a guide and a guardian of coaching quality across our community.

Framework Organization and Supporting Materials

This framework document establishes the foundational principles, structures, and systems that guide SAS's Coaching Program. It intentionally focuses on "what" and "why" rather than detailed "how" aspects of implementation. Throughout the framework, readers will find references to supporting materials available in:

* Appendices: Containing detailed protocols, templates, and reference guides that support consistent implementation
* Coach Toolkit: Housing practical resources, scripts, worksheets, and implementation guides that coaches use in daily practice

At the end of many sections, an "Implementation Resources" paragraph directs readers to specific supplementary materials relevant to that topic. This approach allows the framework to remain focused on enduring principles while ensuring practitioners have access to detailed guidance for implementation.

## SAS Coaching Program: Core Beliefs & Values

Introduction

At Shanghai American School (SAS), we believe that the most meaningful professional growth emerges when educators and coaches engage in purposeful, trusting relationships centered on reflective dialogue. Our shared values guide every coaching interaction—whether the support takes the form of a collaborative design session, targeted consultation, group facilitation, or a deeper reflective coaching cycle. Each of these support functions works in harmony to ensure that SAS educators continually elevate their practice in service of our students’ success.

#### **Definition of Coaching**

At Shanghai American School, we define coaching as a transformative process that amplifies educators’ capacity—individually and collectively—to deepen student learning and refine student-centered pedagogical practices through purposeful dialogue and reflection.

This non-evaluative process cultivates self-directed educators who reflect on their thinking, set purposeful goals, and engage in iterative cycles of growth. By activating educators’ knowledge, experiences, and strengths, coaching enhances educator efficacy and growth, leading to meaningful and equitable student success.

#### Why a Coaching Program?

At Shanghai American School (SAS), we believe **transformative student learning** depends on educators who possess the skillfulness and capacity to grow individually and collectively. The Coaching Program is an important **component** of our Professional Learning System because it cultivates the **synergy** where individual educator goals, division priorities, and whole-school initiatives intersect—bringing our Core Commitments and One School philosophy to life.

By investing in a **dedicated coaching team**, we ensure professional growth remains **intentional, coherent, and impactful**. Rather than relying on isolated professional development events, we embrace **sustained, job-embedded** learning experiences that foster ongoing inquiry, collaboration, and reflection. This commitment to building **collective capacity** while honoring **educator agency** drives meaningful innovations that serve every student.

#### Beliefs About Coaching

At Shanghai American School (SAS), our coaching practice is grounded in eight core beliefs:

1. Trust & Psychological Safety

We believe coaching flourishes in an environment of honesty, vulnerability, and confidentiality. By creating a non-evaluative, growth-oriented relationship, educators feel empowered to take instructional risks, share concerns, and explore new ideas.

2. Transformational Partnership

We believe effective coaching arises from a reciprocal dynamic that honors teacher autonomy and leverages shared expertise. Coaches and educators co-create solutions, drawing on one another’s strengths to drive meaningful, lasting improvement.

3. Reflective Practice

We believe purposeful reflection is the engine of professional growth. Through structured inquiry and thoughtful dialogue, educators examine their practice, challenge assumptions, and derive new insights that shape continuous improvement.

4. Evidence-Informed Dialogue

We believe conversations rooted in concrete data—such as student work, observations, and assessments—keep coaching objective, actionable, and focused on student learning. By grounding decisions in tangible evidence, educators increase the impact of instructional changes.

5. Adaptive Expertise

We believe in balancing structured approaches with flexibility. While coaching cycles offer a framework for sustained growth, real-time responsiveness—ranging from quick consultations to extended partnerships—ensures educators receive the right support at the right moment.

6. Equity & Belonging

We believe coaching should foster inclusive environments where every educator is valued and supported. Recognizing diverse teaching contexts and ensuring equitable access to growth opportunities builds belonging and ultimately benefits all students.

7. Continuous Growth

We believe professional learning flourishes through iterative cycles of planning, action, reflection, and refinement. Rather than isolated events, coaching interactions accumulate to create sustained momentum for individual and collective development.

8. Professional Agency & Innovation

We believe coaching strengthens educators’ professional agency and fuels innovation. By respecting teacher expertise and encouraging experimentation, coaching catalyzes meaningful transformation in classroom practice and throughout the broader school community.

## Strategic Alignment & Theory of Change

Why a Theory of Change?

A Theory of Change helps us see how our Coaching Program’s core beliefs and practices lead to meaningful, sustainable improvements in teaching and learning at SAS. By mapping the connections from teacher support to student outcomes—and ultimately to SAS’s broader strategic goals—we reinforce why coaching is not just a set of activities, but a driving force behind our continuous growth as “One School.”

Statement of Change

If Shanghai American School (SAS) cultivates a coaching culture anchored in:

    1.    Transformative Change (deep individual and systemic impact),

    2.    Strategic Integration (alignment with organizational priorities),

    3.    Collective Capacity (shared ownership of professional learning),

    4.    Systemic Support (leadership backing, time, and resources), and

    5.    Student Success (improved engagement, achievement, and equity),

then educators will refine their instructional practice through reflective dialogue, real-time collaboration, and targeted expertise. This will lead to improved student outcomes, a more inclusive and collaborative culture, and ongoing innovation—ultimately advancing SAS’s mission to empower our community members to shape a better world.

Underlying Assumptions

1. Educator Engagement and Coachability
   1. Teachers demonstrate coachability—being approachable, receptive, curious, and humble—making them willing to reflect on and adjust their practice when offered meaningful coaching.
2. Collaborative Culture
   1. A school-wide ethos of trust, inquiry, and continuous improvement encourages deeper engagement with coaching.
3. Strategic Alignment
   1. Educators connect coaching goals to SAS’s core initiatives (e.g., CRP, UDL, wellbeing, generative AI), keeping growth cohesive and focused.
4. Leadership Advocacy
   1. School leaders reinforce coaching as essential to professional learning, providing the structures and time needed for success.
5. Adequate Resources
   1. SAS ensures access to necessary tools, technology, and professional learning opportunities, enabling coaches and teachers to implement new practices effectively.
6. Data-Driven Inquiry
   1. Teams use evidence—such as student work, assessments, and observations—to inform decisions and measure impact.
7. Community Support
   1. Parents and other stakeholders understand and value the role of coaching in fostering student-centered learning and overall school improvement.

How It All Fits Together

By embedding our coaching beliefs within the broader professional learning system, SAS ensures each coaching conversation contributes to a culture where teachers, students, and leaders continually grow. When we systematically address factors like educator engagement, leadership advocacy, and resource allocation, coaching becomes a transformative lever that unites personal development and school-wide progress. This integrated approach drives innovation, strengthens equity, and keeps student success at the heart of everything we do.

# Systems and Structures

## Coaching Program Structure and Functions

At Shanghai American School (SAS), our Coaching Program is designed as a cohesive system of professional learning support. At the core of this system are four distinct support functions—coaching, consulting, collaborating, and facilitating—which provide clarity, intentionality, and flexibility in how we serve teachers, leaders, and teams. While each function has its own purpose and value, together they form a unified framework that aligns with our school-wide goals, fosters strong relationships, and creates meaningful opportunities for growth and improvement.

Why a Shared Language of Support Functions?

* Clarifies Intent and Purpose

Naming the functions explicitly ensures that educators understand the goal of each interaction—whether it’s reflective dialogue (coaching), targeted advice (consulting), joint problem-solving (collaborating), or structured group facilitation (facilitating). This alignment helps individuals see how the support connects to their personal goals, division priorities, and broader school initiatives.

* Creates a Consistent Frame of Reference

A common vocabulary strengthens coherence and fosters a school-wide culture of continuous growth. By naming the support function in real time, everyone gains a clearer sense of purpose and can better track progress toward shared outcomes.

* Guides Reflective Practice and Ownership

Transparency around the support functions encourages educators to reflect on which type of assistance has been most helpful and why. Over time, this deeper level of awareness fosters professional autonomy, trust, and greater ownership of one’s growth.

.

## The Four Support Functions

Our Core Belief: Coaching as the Most Transformative Function

We believe that the coaching function—anchored in reflective dialogue, inquiry, and goal-setting—is the most transformative avenue for educator growth and student success. By cultivating a culture of inquiry, collaboration, and collective efficacy, coaching empowers educators to refine their practice over time, leading to sustainable, meaningful changes that directly enhance student learning experiences.

The Value of All Four Functions

While coaching is a particularly powerful lever for improvement, the other three support functions—consulting, collaborating, and facilitating—are equally essential to a robust professional learning ecosystem. When aligned with the school’s Core Commitments, strategic initiatives and division priorities, these functions work in concert to build a responsive and effective learning community:

* Consulting provides targeted expertise and resources to help educators navigate new strategies or complex challenges.
* Collaborating brings educators together to co-develop solutions, share practices, and amplify collective capacity.
* Facilitating guides groups through structured processes and protocols to foster shared understanding, equitable participation, and cohesive action.

By strategically blending these four functions, coaches can tailor support to specific contexts, professional learning cycles, and strategic initiatives—ensuring every educator receives the type of support that propels both individual and collective growth.

Coaching: Amplifying Educator Capacity Through Reflection

Coaching: Amplifying Educator Capacity Through Reflection

At Shanghai American School, we define coaching as a transformative process that amplifies educators’ capacity—individually and collectively—to deepen student learning and refine student-centered pedagogical practices through purposeful dialogue and reflection. This non-evaluative approach cultivates self-directed educators who analyze their thinking, set purposeful goals, and engage in iterative cycles of growth. By activating educators’ knowledge, experiences, and strengths, coaching enhances teacher efficacy, resulting in meaningful and equitable student success.

Key Principles of Coaching

* Cognitive Mediation: Employing intentional questioning to help educators surface and examine their thinking, beliefs, and decision-making processes.
* Student-Centered Focus: Supporting practices that directly impact student engagement, learning, and well-being.
* Reflective Cycles: Guiding educators through continual reflection, action, and refinement, ensuring growth is sustained over time.
* Goal Alignment: Connecting individual educator goals with broader school priorities, while honoring educator agency and expertise.

Through coaching, educators develop a habit of ongoing reflection and purposeful action that benefits all learners and fosters a dynamic culture of professional excellence.

#### Coaching Cycles: A Flexible Yet Cyclical Foundation

At Shanghai American School (SAS), we recognize that effective coaching can take many forms and does not depend on a single, fixed model. However, our experience shows that cyclical structures—characterized by clear goals, reflective inquiry, evidence-based adjustments, and conclusive reflection—consistently yield deeper teacher growth and positive student impact.

To maintain clarity and focus, SAS highlights the Plan–Implement–Reflect model as a foundational framework. This approach ensures that every coaching interaction remains student-centered, data-informed, and purposeful.

The SAS Coaching Cycle: Plan, Implement, Reflect

1. Plan

Setting Clear Purpose

* Initial Goals Discussion: Center the conversation on targeted student learning outcomes and/or teacher goals.
* Baseline Data & Current Practice: Gather and analyze relevant evidence of teaching and learning to establish starting points.
* Success Metrics & Evidence Collection: Define how impact will be measured, determining which data and observations will be tracked.
* Timeline & Check-in Points: Agree on a realistic timeframe and schedule for regular progress reviews.

2. Implement

Taking Purposeful Action

* Experiment with New Strategies: Collaborate on instructional techniques aligned with the identified goals.
* Collect Evidence of Impact: Gather student work, observation notes, and other data to assess progress.
* Adapt in Real Time: Use emerging insights to refine strategies as needed.
* Regular Check-ins: Maintain ongoing communication to support mid-course corrections and celebrate small wins.

3. Reflect

Ongoing Reflection

* Metacognitive Prompts: Encourage teachers to think about what is working, what challenges arise, and why.
* Data Review & Analysis: Examine collected evidence to determine the effectiveness of new approaches.
* Strategy Adjustment: Make evidence-based decisions about which strategies to continue, refine, or retire.

Cycle Synthesis

* Impact Analysis & Evidence Review: Revisit goals to assess overall progress toward improving student outcomes.
* Celebrate Growth: Recognize and honor both teacher and student successes.
* Identify Transferable Practices: Determine which successful strategies can be applied to broader contexts or future cycles.
* Plan Next Steps: Decide on new objectives or transitions into the next coaching cycle.

Why Cycles Matter

Promotes Iterative Growth

* Teachers build and refine skills over time, moving beyond isolated workshops toward consistent improvement.

Adapts to Readiness

* Coaches can select conversation formats (e.g., cognitive, teacher-centered, or student-centered) that best fit individual teacher needs and contexts.

Fosters Ownership

* Regular planning and reflection put teachers in the driver’s seat of their own professional learning journey.

By remaining flexible in which specific cycle or model is used—yet consistent in our commitment to the Plan–Implement–Reflect foundation—SAS ensures every coaching interaction remains focused on meaningful improvements in both teaching practice and student outcomes.

Examples of Cyclical Frameworks

* Cognitive Coaching Maps: (Planning, Reflecting, Problem-Resolving, Calibration)
* Teacher-Centered or Student-Centered Cycles: (focusing on iterative design and feedback, as outlined by Sweeney, Knight, etc.)

No matter the chosen framework, key elements include:

* Clear Purpose (initial goal-setting)
* Ongoing Reflection (metacognitive prompts and data review)
* Real-Time Adaptation (refining strategies during implementation)
* Closing Synthesis (celebrating progress and determining next steps)

By anchoring our coaching process in a Plan–Implement–Reflect cycle—while allowing for the nuances of different coaching models—SAS ensures sustainable professional growth and, most importantly, positive and measurable impact on student learning.

Collaborating: Shared Ownership and Innovation

Collaborating: Shared Ownership and Innovation

Collaboration is a partnership built on shared ownership, mutual accountability, and joint problem-solving. Here, coaches and educators work side by side to generate ideas, design solutions, and refine practices. Recognizing that both the coach and educator bring valuable expertise, collaboration thrives on equal partnership, building trust and strengthening professional relationships.

Key Elements of Collaborating

* Co-Creation: Generating new strategies together, merging diverse expertise to address shared goals.
* Mutual Accountability: Investing equally in the process and its outcomes.
* Dynamic Innovation: Encouraging iterative problem-solving that sparks creativity and continuous improvement.

By co-planning lessons, reviewing student work, or brainstorming fresh approaches, collaboration cultivates a sense of collective efficacy that drives innovative, impactful teaching.

Facilitating: Guiding Groups Toward Shared Goals

Facilitating: Guiding Groups Toward Shared Goals

Facilitation involves creating a structured environment where group processes lead to shared objectives, inclusive decision-making, and productive collaboration. Acting as a facilitator, the coach orchestrates discussions, activities, and protocols so that all participants engage meaningfully and strive for actionable outcomes. This function is particularly powerful in team settings, where multiple perspectives need to be synthesized into a clear plan.

Key Components of Facilitating

* Process Leadership: Designing and guiding agendas, ensuring focus, productivity, and alignment with the group’s goals.
* Equity of Voice: Encouraging active participation from every member, valuing all perspectives, and fostering inclusive collaboration.
* Shared Accountability: Helping groups take collective ownership of agreed-upon decisions and follow-through.

By facilitating a Professional Learning Community (PLC) session or a team-based data review, a coach ensures that group dialogues remain purposeful, equitable, and results-oriented. Effective facilitation strengthens team cohesion, trust, and collective leadership across the school.

Consulting: Providing Expertise and Guidance

Consulting: Providing Expertise and Guidance

Consulting is the most directive of the four functions, centering on the transfer of specific knowledge or expertise from the coach to the educator. It addresses pressing needs—such as learning a new technology tool or applying research-based instructional techniques—and ensures educators have swift, targeted support to navigate immediate challenges.

Key Aspects of Consulting

* Sharing Expertise: Offering solutions, strategies, or resources tailored to educators’ needs.
* Focused Problem-Solving: Providing clarity and actionable next steps that address urgent issues.
* Building Capacity: Empowering educators to adapt and apply new knowledge in their unique contexts, avoiding dependency on external input.

While consulting can be highly effective, it must be balanced with other support functions to foster deeper professional growth and ownership.

Through the intentional use of coaching, consulting, collaborating, and facilitating, SAS coaches adapt their support to the evolving needs of educators and teams, always with the goal of improving student learning experiences. Each function offers a unique pathway to professional growth, yet when used interdependently, they form a comprehensive system that propels both individual and institutional development forward.

Mentoring: A Distinct but Related Practice

At Shanghai American School, mentoring and coaching are often interconnected, yet they serve distinct purposes within our professional learning ecosystem. While the SAS Coaching Program is structured around four core support functions—coaching, consulting, collaborating, and facilitating—mentoring exists outside of this framework as a separate developmental relationship that may occasionally emerge in specific contexts.

Defining Mentoring

Drawing from Wellman and Lipton's work, mentoring is a long-term, developmental relationship in which a more experienced educator provides guidance, perspective, and professional wisdom to a less familiar colleague. Unlike coaching, which is grounded in reflective dialogue and self-directed growth, mentoring often involves modeling professional identity, offering career insights, and helping an individual navigate a new environment.

At SAS, in general we do not have teachers who are new to the profession, but we do have educators who are new to the school. In these cases, a coach may adopt a mentoring stance to help teachers acclimate to SAS's systems, culture, and expectations. However, this is not an explicit support function of the coaching framework; rather, it is an occasional role coaches may take on, based on situational needs.

How Mentoring Differs from SAS's Support Functions

While mentoring shares some similarities with the coaching role, it is distinct in key ways. Mentoring tends to be more directive, with the mentor sharing personal experiences and offering specific advice based on institutional knowledge. This contrasts with coaching, which emphasizes drawing out the teacher's own insights through reflective questioning. Additionally, mentoring relationships often develop organically and may extend beyond strictly professional boundaries, whereas coaching interactions are more intentionally structured and focused primarily on instructional practice and student outcomes. The mentor serves as a guide to school culture and systems, while the coach functions as a catalyst for instructional growth and professional reflection.

When a Coach Might Take on a Mentoring Role

While mentoring is not one of the four core support functions, there are instances when a coach may take on a mentoring stance, particularly when supporting a teacher new to SAS. For example:

* Helping a new teacher understand SAS's instructional expectations and professional culture.
* Providing insight into how to navigate schoolwide initiatives, policies, and systems.
* Offering collegial guidance on balancing professional responsibilities at SAS

However, this mentoring role is situational and informal—not a designated coaching responsibility. Once an educator becomes acclimated, the coaching relationship transitions fully into the four support functions, focusing on instructional growth, reflective practice, and student-centered learning.

By recognizing when mentoring may be useful—while keeping it distinct from the structured support functions of coaching, consulting, collaborating, and facilitating—SAS ensures that all educators receive the right type of support at the right time, without diluting the clarity and intent of our coaching framework.

## Balancing Roles and Priorities in Coaching

At Shanghai American School (SAS), the four support functions—Coaching, Consulting, Collaborating, and Facilitating—form the foundation of our coaching practice. Inspired by the research of Killion and Harrison, we recognize that coaches may take on diverse roles (e.g., curriculum specialist, data coach, catalyst for change), but never all at once. Instead, coaches and school leaders collaboratively prioritize where a coach’s specific expertise is most needed, preventing role overload and preserving high-quality support.

Roles and Areas of Focus

Although SAS embraces a One School approach, we know that effective coaching must respond to different contexts and strategic needs. Typically, coaches’ emphasis arises from three interconnected domains, ensuring every interaction aligns with our overarching mission while honoring local and individual perspectives:

1. Schoolwide Strategic Priorities

* Guided by SAS’s Core Commitments and mission-aligned initiatives (e.g., UDL, CRP, generative AI, well-being), coaches help operationalize these priorities across all levels of the school.
* This alignment ensures each coaching conversation contributes to shared, schoolwide goals rooted in excellence, equity, and innovation.

2. Local Context & Application

* While unified by the One School vision, coaches tailor their support to grade-level or department-specific contexts—recognizing that local nuances can shape how strategic priorities are enacted.
* By weaving SAS’s big-picture focus into each unique setting, coaches maintain coherence while preserving relevance for educators on the ground.

3. Individual Educator Growth

* Coaches partner with teachers to set personalized, meaningful goals that ultimately support schoolwide initiatives.
* This approach honors teacher agency, fosters reflective practice, and yields collective improvement in both teaching quality and student learning outcomes.

By integrating these domains with the four support functions (Coaching, Consulting, Collaborating, and Facilitating), SAS ensures each educator receives tailored, purposeful support. This flexibility allows the coaching team—and the broader coaching system—to respond to emerging needs while preserving the coherence and impact necessary for sustained growth in teaching and learning.

#### Adapting Coaching Roles to Meet Needs

A skilled coach at SAS does not remain confined to one function throughout an interaction. Rather, they fluidly shift among coaching, consulting, collaborating, and facilitating, sometimes even within a single conversation. This adaptability is guided by three key elements:

1. Human-Centered Awareness

Coaches look for verbal and nonverbal cues—body language, emotional tone, readiness for change—and compare these to current initiatives and strategic priorities. By doing so, they can sense whether to probe for deeper reflection, offer timely expertise, or facilitate a group process.

2. Contextual Responsiveness

Each conversation is shaped by student learning data, curricular goals, instructional strategies, and broader school initiatives (e.g., CRP, UDL, technology integration). Coaches choose the appropriate support function to move the conversation forward, maintaining alignment with SAS’s One School vision while meeting local or individual needs.

3. Real-Time, Evidence-Informed Decisions

Coaching often requires on-the-spot pivots: shifting from reflective inquiry to resource-sharing, or from targeted consulting to facilitating team discussions. This nimble approach keeps support meaningful, impactful, and tightly linked to actual classroom practice.

Through adaptive use of these support functions and roles—always framed by SAS’s One School philosophy—coaches ensure that professional learning remains dynamic and responsive to evolving demands. In turn, the Coaching Program contributes to a culture of continuous improvement, where educators and students alike benefit from innovative, equitable, and future-focused teaching and learning.

#### Supporting Learning Through Technology

Instructional Technology Coach Role at SAS:

At Shanghai American School (SAS), Instructional Technology Coaches bring specialized expertise in leveraging digital tools to enhance student learning, while remaining firmly grounded in our coaching philosophy of purposeful dialogue and reflection. Although all SAS coaches recognize technology as an integral part of modern pedagogy, Instructional Technology Coaches leverage their in-depth knowledge of digital tools to transform teaching and learning. Through trusting, non-evaluative partnerships, these specialists help educators explore and realize the full learning potential of technology.

**Core Identity**

As members of SAS’s coaching team, Instructional Technology Coaches facilitate transformative growth with an emphasis on technology integration—yet they remain coaches first. They engage educators in reflective dialogue about how digital tools might deepen student learning and refine pedagogical practices. Their expertise centers on:

* Pedagogical Technology Integration
  + Fostering innovation that advances student learning outcomes
  + Designing and implementing technology-enhanced learning experiences
  + Aligning digital tools with learning goals

While they bring this specialized knowledge, their primary role remains activating educators’ knowledge and vision for meaningful technology use in their specific contexts.

**Strategic Balance**

Instructional Technology Coaches maintain a deliberate balance between supporting educator growth and ensuring technology optimally serves teaching and learning across the school. Their foremost responsibility is to cultivate sustained, reflective partnerships that enhance technology integration at the classroom level. At the same time, they provide critical guidance and coordination for broader technology needs, including:

* **Collaborating** with IT and other stakeholders to ensure a learning-centered infrastructure (e.g., reliable networks, accessible devices) that supports educational goals and removes barriers to learning
* **Consulting** on emerging technologies from a pedagogical perspective to validate alignment with instructional outcomes
* **Facilitating** implementation decisions that advance teaching and learning objectives
* Providing targeted operational support (e.g., troubleshooting, device setup) to address educators’ immediate technology needs

These operational aspects, though essential, **serve to facilitate rather than define the coach’s work**. In some cases, this may include coordination and resourcing responsibilities—such as managing a Makerspace, leading device deployment, or overseeing digital platforms. While these tasks are often necessary to keep technology initiatives running smoothly, **we recognize they can draw significantly on a coach’s time.**

As SAS continues to implement and refine the Coaching Program, leadership teams will make intentional decisions about the scope of these operational functions. Our guiding principle remains ensuring that coaches have the capacity to engage fully in meaningful, reflective partnerships that drive instructional growth and student learning.

**Amplifying Innovation**

In this balanced approach, coaches guide educators in exploring emerging tools—such as AI and advanced digital platforms—by anchoring conversations in pedagogy while offering technological insight. By maintaining a focus on coaching as the primary pathway for professional growth, they foster innovation that amplifies effective teaching practices that leads to student success. Through this specialized lens on technology integration, Instructional Technology Coaches contribute to SAS’s broader vision of transformative professional learning—one trusting partnership at a time.

Additional implementation details, protocols, and strategies—including guidance on operational responsibilities—are available in the appendix.

## Navigating Coaching Grey Areas

While our four support functions provide a clear framework for most coaching interactions, some situations require additional consideration. Just as Instructional Technology Coaches balance instructional coaching with systems support, all coaches occasionally face requests that don’t align neatly with standard support functions. These “grey areas” often emerge when:

* Teachers seek help that seems unrelated to instruction and collaboration
  + If a teacher requests help organizing their digital files: While this isn't directly instructional, a coach might accept this request if it can be reframed as an opportunity to build the teacher's capacity for creating accessible learning resources aligned with UDL principles.
* Administrators request support for tasks tangentially tied to coaching goals
  + If an administrator requests a coach to independently compile and analyze assessment data for an upcoming board presentation: While data analysis is part of coaching work, the coach might suggest a collaborative approach that involves working with the department leaders to build their capacity for data-informed decision-making, rather than doing the analysis in isolation

In these situations, coaches use principled reflection and collaborative dialogue to maintain program integrity while honoring legitimate needs.

Acknowledging Positional Authority

In any school setting, a principal or leader naturally holds positional authority, which can influence a coach’s decision-making. Although requests might be made in good faith, coaches can sometimes feel pressure to comply—even if a task falls outside the coaching scope or risks blurring non-evaluative boundaries.

Rather than viewing these moments as conflict, SAS encourages open, respectful conversations in which coaches and Academic Leadership Team and/or Educational Programs co-design the impactful approaches. This ensures teacher-centered growth remains the priority, without undermining the broader structure of the coaching framework.

Collective Responsibility for Program Integrity

It’s not solely the coach’s role to safeguard coaching norms; all stakeholders—coaches, Academic Leadership Team, Educational Programs, teachers—share responsibility for maintaining a robust, principles-driven model:

* Educational Programs and Academic Leadership Team recognize the need to honor coaching boundaries and resist assigning the coach tasks better suited to other roles.
* Coaches communicate transparently when requests appear beyond the coaching purview.
* Teachers maintain a stance of voluntary engagement, seeking coaching for professional growth rather than seeing the coach as a general problem-solver.

## Communication and Coordination: A One School Approach

At Shanghai American School (SAS), we embrace a **One School** mindset that fosters alignment and shared understanding across all divisions and leadership teams. Coaches often work with multiple leaders—such as **Divisional Principals**, **Educational Programs**, and the **Director of Technology**—to support various initiatives. While we continually strive for coherence in our priorities, it is important to recognize that responsibilities can sometimes overlap or evolve.

To maintain clarity and unity in these efforts, we emphasize:

1. **Role Clarity**

2. **Coordinated Communication**
   * When a coach takes on a new task or shifts focus to a different project, leaders are encouraged to keep relevant stakeholders informed. This approach supports ongoing dialogue around how best to align teaching goals, coaching objectives, and division-wide or system-wide priorities.
   * In practice, the level of communication may vary depending on the scope and impact of a given task, allowing for flexibility while maintaining overall alignment.
3. **Shared Accountability**
   * Leaders at all levels—whether divisional principals, educational programs, directors—share the responsibility for **setting clear expectations**, **monitoring coach workloads**, and ensuring that coaching remains integrated with SAS’s vision. This collective approach nurtures **transparency** and **collaboration**, reinforcing the idea that coaches are part of a supportive network rather than working in separate silos.

#### Balancing Local and System-Wide Needs

SAS actively harmonizes divisional autonomy with whole-school coherence, recognizing that each perspective enriches our collective impact. When coaches receive guidance from multiple leaders, flexibility and **regular communication** help maintain consistency with the **One School** philosophy. By adapting and sharing information proactively, we preserve a cohesive environment where coaches can stay focused on their primary role—enhancing teaching and learning.

## Collective Responsibility for Coaching Program Success

The success of the Coaching Program at SAS is a shared responsibility that spans all levels of the educational community—from coaches and divisional principals to members of the Academic Leadership Team (ALT), Educational Programs, and every educator. When these stakeholders work together in purposeful partnership, coaching becomes the synergy point where individual educator goals, division priorities, and whole-school initiatives intersect. Through this collective commitment and integrated approach, coaching serves as a catalytic thread woven throughout our organizational structures, professional learning systems, and strategic initiatives. This interconnected framework ensures that every coaching interaction—from individual classrooms to cross-campus initiatives—advances our vision of shaping a better world through empowering each learner.

# Embedding Coaching Across the School

## Coaching as a Core Professional Learning Practice

All coaches, divisional leaders, and educational administrators share the responsibility for realizing the goals of the Coaching Program Strategic Plan. This collective responsibility fosters a collaborative ecosystem in which each group contributes to the success of the program. Coaches actively collaborate with divisional leadership to ensure that coaching is integrated into the larger strategic initiatives of the school, and they play a crucial role in shaping professional learning across all divisions.

By working together as a unified team, coaches help facilitate a continuous cycle of improvement, where teaching practices evolve to meet the needs of students and align with SAS's core commitments. This collaboration ensures that the coaching program is not just a collection of isolated efforts, but a cohesive, system-wide initiative that is instrumental in achieving SAS's mission of transformative education.

At Shanghai American School (SAS), our Coaching Program functions as an integral thread woven through our comprehensive Professional Learning System. Coaching serves as one of the key practices—alongside communities of practice, data-informed reflection, classroom integration, and personalized pathways—that together create a dynamic ecosystem for educator growth.

While professional development introduces educators to new ideas and skills, coaching provides the sustained, job-embedded support essential for translating these concepts into daily practice. Through reflective dialogue, collaborative planning, and focused feedback, coaches help educators deepen their understanding, refine their approaches, and measure their impact on student learning.

This integration ensures that coaching conversations—whether in a single classroom or spanning multiple campuses—directly support the continuous improvement cycles that characterize effective professional learning at SAS while advancing our collective commitment to excellence in teaching and learning.

## Strategic Initiative Alignment

By design, the Coaching Program acts as a linchpin connecting strategic priorities, Professional Learning (PL) initiatives, divisional context, and the broader strategies that define our One School vision. Through the purposeful embedding of coaching into each division's focal areas—ranging from literacy enhancements and Culturally Responsive Pedagogy (CRP) to technology integration and generative AI exploration—educator growth remains continuously aligned with SAS's larger mission.

This comprehensive engagement also ensures that coaching stays context-aware and meaningfully integrated into the unique culture of every division. Throughout the year, cross-river collaboration days, principal engagements, and Academic Leadership Team (ALT) discussions serve as checkpoints. These gatherings enable us to monitor progress, reflect on outcomes, and refine strategies so that the coaching program can adapt to emerging priorities and evolving educational landscapes.

## Professional Growth and Evaluation Framework Alignment

Although the Coaching Program maintains a non-evaluative stance, it complements SAS's broader professional growth framework while preserving important boundaries. The relationship between coaching and formal evaluation processes is characterized by educator choice rather than systemic requirement:

* **Educator-Initiated Support**: Educators may voluntarily choose to work with coaches on goals connected to their PGPE process, but this is always at the educator's discretion—never a mandated part of evaluation.
* **Flexible Goal Alignment**: Coaches support educators with goals at various levels of granularity and timeframes—from brief, targeted objectives to long-term professional aspirations. Some may align with PGPE goals while others may address immediate classroom needs or exploratory interests.
* **Confidential Partnership**: When an educator does choose to work with a coach on PGPE-related goals, the content of coaching conversations remains confidential, maintaining the psychological safety essential for genuine reflection and risk-taking.

This approach creates a balanced system where coaching empowers educators to meet performance standards through authentic, ongoing improvement rather than episodic evaluation. The reflective skills developed through coaching enhance educators' ability to self-assess and set meaningful professional goals in all contexts—whether related to formal evaluation or independent professional inquiry.

Together, these integration points establish the foundation for a responsive and impactful Coaching Program—one that aligns with SAS's collective aspirations while honoring educator agency and the distinct qualities that make coaching uniquely valuable within our professional learning ecosystem.

## Coach Program Partnership Principles

At Shanghai American School (SAS), the success of our coaching program rests on a foundation of dynamic partnerships. These collaborative relationships create the conditions for coaching to thrive, ensuring that professional learning remains responsive to local contexts while advancing our One School vision.  Coaches partner with principals, educational programs, ALT, teacher leaders, collaborative teams, and individual educators to align coaching with strategic priorities and institutional goals. Through intentional partnership structures, we bridge individual growth with institutional priorities, fostering a culture of continuous improvement across all levels of the organization.

Partnership Principles

1. **Mutual Engagement**
   * Shared ownership of outcomes
   * Reciprocal learning relationships
   * Active participation from all partners
2. **Strategic Alignment**
   * Connection to theory of change
   * Support for strategic priorities
   * Program coherence
3. **Continuous Growth**
   * Ongoing partnership development
   * Responsive to emerging needs
   * Regular reflection and refinement

Through these partnerships, the coaching program creates a web of support that complements formal leadership structures while fostering the relationships necessary for transformative change.

## Integration With Other Professional Learning Structures

The Coaching Program strategically aligns with other key professional learning structures at SAS, creating a comprehensive support network for educators at all career stages:

#### New Teacher Integration

Newly hired educators at SAS benefit from structured coaching supports as they acclimate to the school's culture, curriculum, and expectations. While mentoring, as described in the "Mentoring: A Distinct but Related Practice" section, is an informal, occasional role adopted by coaches to guide educators new to SAS, formal coaching interactions include:

* **Introductory Support**: Scheduling early "meet-and-greet" sessions to familiarize new teachers with SAS's Core Commitments and introduce available coaching supports.
* **Structured Check-Ins**: Offering short-term, higher-frequency coaching cycles during initial months to provide timely feedback and resources.
* **Orientation Sessions**: Partnering with Educational Programs, HR, or leadership teams to deliver New Teacher Orientation sessions, emphasizing how coaching aligns with and supports school-wide initiatives (e.g., UDL, CRP, generative AI).

#### Collaboration With Teacher Leaders & Collaborative Teams

Coaches work closely with teacher leaders and collaborative teams to ensure a coherent professional learning environment. This includes:

This collaborative approach ensures that coaching complements and enhances other professional learning structures at SAS, creating a cohesive system where individual coaching, team-based learning, and organizational priorities mutually reinforce one another.

## Investing in Our Coaches: Structures for Ongoing Professional Learning

At SAS, we recognize that coaching expertise develops through intentional practice, reflection, and collaboration. Coaches move along their own growth continuum—from Developing to Implementing to Extending to Refining—across various coaching competencies. To support this developmental journey, SAS provides comprehensive structures and resources that foster continuous improvement in coaching practice.

#### Professional Learning Investments

In addition to the professional learning funds available to all faculty, coaches within the program annually engage in targeted professional learning that specifically addresses coaching competencies. These opportunities are carefully aligned to the Coaching Program Strategic Plan and the Coach Competency Map, ensuring that each coach's growth directly supports the broader vision and impact of the Coaching Program.

#### Dual-Purpose Collaborative Structures

SAS utilizes key meeting structures that serve both program implementation and coach professional growth. These forums intentionally balance advancing strategic initiatives with deepening coaching expertise:

1. **Monthly Campus Gatherings** • While addressing operational needs and strategic priorities, these meetings also dedicate time for coach professional learning • Create space for sharing coaching successes, challenges, and emerging strategies • Balance program coordination with opportunities for coaches to reflect on their practice
2. **Cross-River Retreats** • Serve dual purposes of program alignment and coach skill development • Unite coaches from both campuses to advance strategic initiatives while also engaging in professional learning • Reinforce a unified coaching vision aligned with SAS's One School philosophy, while providing opportunities for coaches to refine their skills
3. **Inter-Campus Collaboration** • Combine program coordination with professional growth opportunities • Encourage regular communication about both strategic priorities and coaching practices • Promote the exchange of ideas that enhance both program coherence and individual coaching skills
4. **Strategic Professional Learning Opportunities** • Connect coaches with broader SAS initiatives (e.g., CRP, UDL, data-driven instruction) while developing their ability to support these priorities • Keep coaches current on research-based practices and equipped to model innovative strategies • Ensure coaches can effectively support school-wide priorities while growing their own expertise

#### Peer Learning and Coaching Community

Beyond formal meeting structures, coaches engage in professional learning specifically focused on developing coaching expertise:

1. **Peer Observation & Coaching** • Coach "Shadowing": Periodic opportunities for coaches to observe their peers in coaching sessions (with educator consent) to learn different techniques • Reciprocal Coaching: Formal or informal structures where coaches coach one another on identified growth areas • Video Analysis: Reviewing and discussing recorded coaching sessions (with permission) to refine questioning techniques
2. **Mentorship and Collaborative Problem-Solving** • Mentorship Pairings: Pairing coaches at different stages of the continuum for sustained support • Collaborative Problem-Solving: Regular case discussions where coaches workshop specific coaching dilemmas • Learning Walks: Structured observations of teaching practices to deepen coaches' understanding across divisions

#### Coaching-Specific Capacity Building

Each year, SAS provides intentional professional learning opportunities designed specifically for the coaching team to collectively deepen their coaching skills:

* Annual structured professional learning allows the entire coaching team to engage in focused practice and reflection
* Coaches document their growth using evidence from their practice, peer feedback, and self-assessment
* Individual learning plans help coaches translate larger goals into the "tiny habits" or micro-actions that lead to sustained improvement

By strategically investing in coach-specific professional learning—while also using collaborative structures to advance program initiatives—SAS ensures that coaching development remains purposeful, reflective, and aligned with both individual growth goals and program priorities. This balanced approach empowers coaches to enhance their expertise while collectively advancing the coaching program's strategic vision.

Our approach to documentation embodies our commitment to non-evaluative coaching relationships and program integrity, going beyond simply tracking progress. By thoughtfully considering what we document, how we share information, and which principles guide these decisions, we ensure that every aspect of our documentation practice reinforces the trust and psychological safety essential to effective coaching.

Core Documentation Practices

* Maintain minimal yet meaningful records that capture essential information without creating burdensome paperwork
* Ensure all documentation reflects a non-evaluative tone that supports growth and learning
* Compile aggregate data to inform program development while protecting individual confidentiality

Individual Coach Documentation Essentials

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| What to Document | Details Required | Storage | Purpose |
| Coaching Conversations and Coaching Cycles | * Number of Coaching Conversations * Number of Coaching Cycles * Progress markers * Completion status   Consider  Focus area/topic   * Start/end dates * Goals * Key takeaways * Next steps | Coaching logs | Monitor cycle effectiveness  Track individual progress |
| Program Data | * Number of active cycles * Number of Coaching Conversations * Support Function Trends * Common themes * General trends | Program documentation | Support program evaluation |

Note: Coaches, as professionals, determine their preferred documentation methods and tools that best serve their practice while maintaining these essential elements.

Information Sharing by Stakeholder

* Default to teacher agency in sharing individual information
* Maintain clear distinction between coaching and evaluation
* All documentation should use growth-oriented, non-evaluative language
* Focus on patterns and trends for program-level reporting

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Audience | Appropriate Detail Level | Examples of What Might be Shared |
| Educator (Coaching Counterpart) | Detailed & Specific | * Individual goals * Action steps * Resources |
| Coach to Coach and Coaching Team | Professional Practice Focus | * General coaching strategies and approaches * Anonymous case studies for learning * Resources and tools * Problem-solving coaching dilemmas * Patterns and trends * Professional growth insights |
| ALT | Aggregate | * Number of active cycles * Number of Coaching Conversations * Support Function Trends * General themes * Resource needs   Specific details are shared collaboratively, respecting teacher consent, and intended to support growth rather than cautionary restrictions.   * Teacher has given explicit consent * Teacher initiates or leads the sharing * Information serves a clear developmental purpose |
| Ed Programs | System-wide Trends | * All of the above * Total engagement rates * Impact patterns * Program needs |

Note on Multiple Coach Interactions: While coaches may work in the same division or with the same teachers, they should not share details about their coaching interactions with other coaches without teacher consent. This isn't about limiting teacher access to coaching support, but rather about:

* Maintaining the integrity of each coaching relationship
* Ensuring teachers feel safe to engage authentically with any coach
* Preventing unintended comparison or competition
* Respecting teacher agency in their coaching journey

If a teacher is working with multiple coaches:

* Let the teacher guide what information is shared
* Focus discussions on supporting teacher goals rather than sharing session details
* Consider team coaching approaches if the teacher initiates this request
* Maintain separate documentation for each coaching relationship

This preserves confidentiality while still allowing teachers to benefit from multiple coaching relationships. The focus remains on teacher growth rather than which coach they choose to work with.

Documentation Principles

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Principle | What This Means | Why It Matters |
| Non-evaluative | Focus on growth and learning, not judgment | Maintains trust |
| Confidential | Protect individual privacy | Ensures psychological safety |
| Purpose-driven | Document what serves program goals | Prevents unnecessary paperwork |
| Data-informed | Track patterns and impact | Supports program improvement |

Program Impact

By weaving these documentation practices into daily operations, Shanghai American School (SAS) maximizes the impact of its coaching program. Such consistency, balanced with flexible adaptation to individual teacher needs, reinforces the program's coherence and aligns it seamlessly with the school's One School vision.

By approaching financial planning with both short-term agility and long-term vision, the coaching program maintains fiscal responsibility while preserving the quality and integrity of services provided to educators. This balanced approach ensures that coaching remains a sustainable, valued investment in SAS's educational excellence.

Communication & Marketing the Coaching Program

Effective communication ensures that the coaching program remains visible, accessible, and valued by all stakeholders at SAS. Beyond simply informing faculty about available services, a thoughtful communication strategy helps cultivate a shared understanding of coaching’s benefits, reinforces SAS’s “One School” philosophy, and celebrates the collective growth that coaching inspires.

Visibility & Awareness

• Purposeful Launches: At the start of each school year or semester, coaches partner with Educational Programs and divisional leaders to introduce new initiatives and revisit core coaching objectives. Faculty meetings, newsletters, and SharePoint serve as prime venues to highlight coaching success stories and clarify how faculty can engage with coaches.

• Digital Presence: A dedicated, easy-to-navigate area on SharePoint features coach bios, specializations, success stories, and scheduling options. Quick links and inviting graphics help faculty request coaching support with minimal hassle.

Two-Way Communication

• Ongoing Updates: Regular, concise communications—such as short email digests or announcements in faculty bulletins—keep everyone informed about upcoming workshops, new resources, and any special coaching events (e.g., cross-river retreats or campus gatherings).

• Faculty Input: Coaches actively solicit feedback and success stories from faculty to surface immediate needs, celebrate wins, and uncover areas where more targeted support might be necessary. Faculty testimonials or brief case studies help personalize the impact of coaching for colleagues who may be hesitant to engage.

Celebrating Impact

• Success Narratives: Anonymized examples of faculty growth, shifts in instructional practice, and improved student outcomes demonstrate coaching’s positive effects without compromising confidentiality. These “stories of change” can be shared at faculty meetings, in newsletters, or through short videos on SharePoint.

• Small Wins & Milestones: Coaches and principals recognize key achievements (e.g., completion of a successful coaching cycle or a newly tested strategy) to create momentum and encourage further participation.Alignment with School Initiatives

• Strategic Showcases: As new school-wide initiatives (CRP, UDL, generative AI, etc.) roll out, coaches highlight how coaching supports each initiative, emphasizing practical benefits. Providing a “coaching menu” or resource list that pairs each initiative with relevant coaching strategies can help faculty see the synergy.

• One School Emphasis: Consistent messaging about how coaching unites both campuses underscores the “One School” spirit, emphasizing that Pudong and Puxi educators have access to aligned coaching philosophies and shared resources.

Feedback Loops

• Mid-Year & End-of-Year Surveys: Gathering feedback on the clarity and frequency of coaching-related communications helps refine messaging. Surveys can include open-response prompts to gather deeper insights and improvement ideas.

• Interactive Forums: Periodic open forums, either virtual or in person, invite faculty to share experiences, request new approaches, and highlight emerging trends they want coaches to explore.

**Implementation Resources**

This communication framework establishes key principles and approaches, with detailed implementation resources available in the Coach Toolkit and appendices. These supplementary materials include specific protocols for program rollout (such as Joellen Killion's "14 Things to Do to Launch Coaching Effectively"), templates for regular communications, sample success stories that maintain confidentiality, schedules for communication touchpoints throughout the year, and customizable presentations for faculty meetings. Coaches and leaders are encouraged to reference these detailed resources when planning communication strategies while adapting them to their specific divisional contexts as needed.

# Program Integrity

## Foundations of Trust

Trust is fundamental to effective coaching at Shanghai American School (SAS). Effective coaching thrives when educators willingly engage in reflective dialogue, embrace vulnerability, and feel confident to explore new practices without fear of judgment or negative consequences. This trust emerges from demonstrated trustworthiness—the consistent and authentic behaviors of reliability, integrity, care, and competence exhibited by coaches and educators alike.

At SAS, we intentionally foster a climate of psychological safety, defined by researcher Amy Edmondson as a shared belief within teams that it is safe to speak openly, take interpersonal risks, and acknowledge mistakes without fear of repercussions. This supportive environment allows genuine conversations about instructional practice, experimentation with innovative ideas, and collaborative problem-solving to flourish.

#### Core Principles of Trust and Psychological Safety

Trustworthiness

* Reliability: Coaches consistently follow through on commitments and maintain predictable behaviors, building confidence in their dependability.
* Integrity: Coaches model alignment between their stated intentions and actions, reinforcing authenticity and honesty.
* Care: Coaches demonstrate genuine empathy, concern, and commitment to educators' professional growth and well-being.
* Competence: Coaches provide credible, skilled support grounded in educational best practices, fostering confidence in their expertise.

Psychological Safety

* Open Inquiry: Educators feel comfortable asking questions and openly examining instructional practices, fostering transparent and productive dialogue.
* Authorized Dialogue: Coaches and educators freely discuss potential concerns, new ideas, and alignment with school-wide goals without fear of negative outcomes, promoting candid conversations and mutual understanding.

Collaborative Problem-Solving

* Shared Reflection: Coaches, educators, and the Academic Leadership Team (ALT) jointly navigate ambiguous or complex situations through reflective dialogue, promoting collective learning and growth.
* Collective Ownership: Every voice is encouraged, heard, and valued, ensuring mutual respect, shared accountability, and collaborative decision-making.

Through this intentional cultivation of trustworthiness and psychological safety, SAS coaches and educators collaboratively build an environment conducive to ongoing professional learning, meaningful growth, and sustained innovation.

Essential Coaching Relationship Elements

Coaching relationships at SAS are built upon and reinforced through five essential elements:

1. **Mutual Vulnerability:** Educators and coaches openly share uncertainties, creating authentic, growth-oriented dialogue without fear of judgment.
2. **Reflective Inquiry:** Coaches consistently model curiosity and active listening, prompting educators to deepen their reflection and continuously refine instructional practices.
3. **Shared Accountability:** Coaches and educators collaboratively set meaningful goals, track progress, and jointly reflect on outcomes, fostering collective commitment and responsibility.
4. **Reciprocal Learning:** Coaching conversations leverage mutual expertise, combining research-based insights with practical classroom experience to enrich professional understanding.
5. **Iterative Growth:** Each coaching interaction builds intentionally on previous discussions, ensuring sustained progress and impactful improvements in instructional practice.

#### Impact on Program Success

The intentional cultivation of trust, psychological safety, and structured support yields clear benefits:

* **Coherence and Synergy:** Educators confidently innovate and experiment with new practices, fostering alignment and coherence across divisions.
* **Sustained Innovation:** Iterative coaching cycles promote ongoing refinement of instructional strategies, ensuring continuous improvement.
* **Collective Growth & Alignment:** Open dialogue transforms challenges into opportunities for deeper understanding and collective action.

By deliberately embedding trust, reflective inquiry, and strategic alignment into every coaching relationship and practice, Shanghai American School (SAS) creates a supportive, innovative professional learning environment. This intentional focus ensures sustained educator growth, strengthened instructional practices, and improved student outcomes—ultimately reinforcing our commitment to excellence as a unified One School community

## Ethics and Professional Standards

Confidentiality vs. Secrecy: A Collaborative Approach

Confidentiality is a component of the SAS Coaching Program. It creates a trusted and safe space where teachers can openly share candid insights, reflect honestly on their practice, and experiment with new strategies without fear of unintended consequences. However, confidentiality is distinct from secrecy—confidentiality fosters openness and growth, whereas secrecy implies withholding information in ways that could limit transparency or collaboration essential to school-wide improvement.

* Confidentiality: Protects a teacher’s privacy while promoting authentic, growth-centered dialogue between coach and educator.
* Secrecy: Implies withholding critical information that might affect broader school improvement efforts or student well-being.

To strike this balance, SAS coaches do not operate in isolation. While the details of individual teacher conversations remain confidential, the topic, trends and aggregate data (e.g., “a growing number of teachers are exploring inquiry-based learning”) are shared with leadership teams to inform school-wide strategic planning. This allows SAS to align resources, professional learning, and strategic decisions with actual teacher needs—without compromising trust.

Teacher-Initiated Collaboration

Teachers may invite principals, ALT, or other faculty into their coaching conversations if they believe additional input or resources will enhance their practice. This collaboration remains teacher-led, preserving the psychological safety of the coaching environment while also ensuring that school-wide priorities stay visible and supported.

## Core Ethical Principles and Boundaries

Professional Boundaries in Coaching

The SAS Coaching Program is anchored in the principle that coaching is primarily about instructional growth. Coaches are trained to facilitate reflective dialogue and strategic planning focused on teaching practices and student outcomes—not to provide counseling or address personal issues. While personal challenges may sometimes impact a teacher’s professional context, coaches maintain clear professional boundaries that keep the focus on pedagogical development.

Ethical Collaboration and Institutional Alignment

Coaches operate within the context of SAS’s broader One School philosophy. While teacher autonomy is paramount, coaches also share non-identifying trends (e.g., “several teachers are experimenting with blended learning approaches”) with leadership to guide institutional decision-making. This big-picture view helps ensure that coaching contributes to SAS’s mission and strategic goals without breaching teacher confidentiality.

Teacher-Led Disclosure

Teacher-led disclosure ensures that each educator remains in control of what details are shared beyond the coaching relationship. For instance, a teacher may decide to share highlights of their coaching progress with their principal to secure additional resources or align with division initiatives. By respecting teacher autonomy, SAS maintains a voluntary coaching culture that encourages open participation and fosters a sense of ownership in professional growth.

Clarity of Purpose

Intent of Confidentiality

Confidentiality in the SAS Coaching Program exists to protect the teacher’s reflective space. Teachers should feel free to explore new ideas, challenge assumptions, and take instructional risks without fear of judgment or repercussions. By maintaining this safe environment, coaches help educators deepen their practice and elevate student learning experiences.

Ensuring Organizational Coherence

Maintaining individual privacy does not undermine the school’s broader needs. Coaches regularly share aggregated information on professional learning trends—such as popular instructional strategies or emerging common challenges—to keep leadership informed about how best to support teaching and learning. These school-wide insights do not identify individual teachers but do enable strategic resource allocation, targeted PL offerings, and school-wide innovation.

This dual focus—protecting individual teacher confidentiality while contributing to SAS’s overarching objectives—ensures that the coaching process remains both personally transformative and institutionally aligned.

## Legal, Safety, and Policy Concerns

Balancing Confidentiality with Obligations

While confidentiality is central to building trust, coaches at SAS must remain vigilant about legal, safety, or policy issues that may emerge during coaching conversations. If information arises indicating a potentially serious risk to student or staff well-being, or if there’s a compliance or legal concern, coaches are obligated to follow SAS’s established protocols.

Protocol for Escalation

Coaches should immediately consult with a supervisor if they suspect legal or safety breaches—e.g., concerns related to student protection, mandatory reporting, or workplace safety. Coaches must handle these cases professionally and in line with school policies, ensuring that prompt action is taken while preserving as much non-evaluative practice as possible.

Maintaining the Coaching Environment

Even in these exceptional situations, the underlying principle of non-evaluation remains vital. Coaches approach discussions about potential legal or safety issues with a clear escalation protocol, ensuring that teacher trust is preserved wherever possible, but also that urgent matters are dealt with responsibly. This policy-driven approach lets coaches focus on pedagogical support, knowing they have a clear path for handling more serious concerns.

Conclusion

Ethical standards and confidentiality practices form the backbone of a trustworthy, growth-oriented coaching environment at Shanghai American School (SAS). By distinguishing confidentiality from secrecy, honoring core ethical principles, and establishing clear boundaries, SAS ensures that coaching remains a non-evaluative, reflective endeavor. At the same time, the institution can leverage aggregated data and collaborative insights to advance school-wide strategic goals and protect the safety and well-being of the community. Through this careful balance, the Coaching Program delivers robust, meaningful support for teachers while upholding the values of One School and ensuring student success.

# Evaluation and Professional Growth

## Evaluation of Coaches

At Shanghai American School (SAS), coaches fulfill a transformative role by helping educators deepen student learning and refine student-centered pedagogical practices. As vital members of our professional learning community, coaches are evaluated within the Professional Growth and Professional Evaluation (PGPE) framework, ensuring consistency, alignment, and fairness alongside SAS's Core Commitments and One School philosophy.

#### Integrated Evaluation Framework

* **Shared Process**: Coaches follow the same structured PGPE process as all SAS educators, illustrating our belief that every educator—whether working directly with students or supporting colleagues—contributes to our collective mission of educational excellence.
* **SAS Coach Competency Map**: This map details the specific competencies and performance indicators that define impactful coaching at SAS, anchoring what "effective" looks like in practice while providing a developmental pathway for ongoing growth.

#### Co-Supervision Evaluation Process

In alignment with SAS's co-supervision model, coaches receive a balanced, comprehensive evaluation through the annual PGPE cycle:

* **Annual Goal-Setting**: Coaches collaborate with two supervisors to establish measurable goals that reflect the SAS Coach Competency Map, individual growth needs, and division- or school-wide priorities.
* **Mid-Year Check-Ins**: Co-supervisors provide complementary formative feedback, ensuring coaches receive insights from both local (divisional) and broader (program-wide) perspectives.
* **Summative Evaluation**: Co-supervisors jointly assess each coach's progress at year-end, identifying strengths, areas for growth, and next steps. This summative feedback confirms alignment with SAS's established PGPE process and informs future professional development.

#### Addressing Performance Concerns

All coaches are expected to demonstrate practice at least at the "Investing" level across competency areas. Should performance challenges arise, coaches follow the school-wide Targeted Employee Support System (TESS) or, if warranted, a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). These structured supports ensure:

* Clear performance expectations and targets
* Targeted resources and interventions
* Ongoing feedback and monitored progress
* Growth-oriented accountability within a fair framework

#### Key Benefits of Our Evaluation Approach

* **Balanced Perspective**: The co-supervision model offers multiple viewpoints, enhancing the depth and relevance of feedback.
* **Holistic Development**: Summative evaluations incorporate input from various stakeholders, encouraging comprehensive professional growth aligned with program goals.
* **System Coherence**: Utilizing the established PGPE framework underscores SAS's One School approach, unifying professionals under shared standards while acknowledging the unique context of coaching.

While the evaluation process offers formal accountability and reflection, the following section details the ongoing professional growth pathways available to coaches as they progress along the four-level continuum—Investing, Implementing, Deepening, and Generative.

## Professional Growth of Coaches

At SAS, we recognize that coaching is a deeply reflective and ever-evolving practice. Rather than assigning static labels, we offer a developmental framework that helps coaches identify their own learning pathways. This approach honors adult learning principles, cognitive coaching tenets, and personalized competency-based growth. In doing so, it empowers coaches to continuously expand their impact—both for their own professional fulfillment and in support of SAS's strategic priorities.

#### A Growth Journey: Engage, Plan, Learn, Demonstrate

The SAS Coach Competency Map serves as the foundation for a personalized growth journey that typically follows four phases, though coaches may engage with these phases in different sequences based on their unique needs:

#### ENGAGE (Starting Your Journey)

* Review the competency areas to identify your current strengths and growth opportunities
* Determine which competency domains would most benefit your practice and align with SAS priorities
* Self-assess your position on the Investing-Generative continuum for each competency
* Select 1-2 focus areas that support both your individual growth and school-wide initiatives

#### PLAN (Mapping Your Path)

* Use the competency indicators to create a personalized growth pathway
* Identify the specific shifts in practice needed to move along the continuum in your chosen areas
* Break down larger goals into micro-actions and tiny habits that build momentum
* Align your learning goals with division priorities and the SAS coaching program framework

#### LEARN (Building Your Expertise)

* Access resources specific to each competency domain
* Choose between self-directed learning pathways or more structured professional development
* Engage in peer observations, coaching rounds, and collaborative learning
* Make adjustments based on ongoing feedback and emerging insights

#### DEMONSTRATE (Sharing Your Growth)

* Choose personalized approaches to showcase your professional journey
* Create meaningful documentation that authentically captures your development
* Share your learning in ways that align with your professional style and goals
* Contribute to the coaching community in ways that reflect your strengths and interests

This flexible framework honors coach agency while providing structure and coherence to professional growth, connecting individual development to our shared mission.

## Coaching Growth Continuum

While we reference four stages—Investing, Implementing, Deepening, and Generative—they are not labels to be "applied" to an individual. Instead, they serve as guideposts that offer clarity about what coaching growth can look like in practice. Coaches move fluidly across these stages based on their current skills, experiences, and context.

1. **Investing**
   * Building foundational knowledge through theory-based learning and exploration
   * Demonstrating an intentional commitment to developing coaching principles
   * Actively seeking guidance and feedback to strengthen basic coaching practices
2. **Implementing**
   * Putting foundational knowledge into action, often through structured approaches (e.g., coaching routines, protocols)
   * Building confidence with key coaching skills and beginning to use data for reflective practice
   * Applying coaching strategies with increasing consistency across familiar contexts
3. **Deepening**
   * Using evidence to refine and adapt coaching methods more strategically
   * Engaging in sophisticated analysis of coaching effectiveness across varied contexts
   * Synthesizing multiple approaches to address complex coaching scenarios
   * Collaborating with peers to share insights and continuously improve practice
4. **Generative**
   * Creating innovative frameworks and approaches that foster educator self-direction
   * Establishing conditions where educators increasingly manage, monitor, and modify their own practice
   * Influencing systemic practices and professional norms beyond immediate coaching contexts
   * Mentoring colleagues, leading change, and contributing to the broader SAS coaching community

**Key Principle**: Coaches may be "Investing" in one competency (e.g., data analysis) while "Generative" in another (e.g., relationship-building). The continuum is a flexible framework, not a rigid hierarchy. This domain-specific development is normal and expected, reflecting the complex nature of coaching expertise.

#### Evidence-Informed Reflection and Growth

Coaches use a variety of evidence sources to guide their professional learning, always grounded in personal reflection and adult learning theory:

* **Self-Assessment**: Through regular reflection against the SAS Coach Competency Map and this continuum, coaches identify where they feel most confident and where they wish to grow.
* **Peer Collaboration & Feedback**: Structured observations, coaching rounds, and dialogue provide mutual learning opportunities, supporting coaches in refining their skills.
* **Teacher Impact Data**: Anonymized feedback and other data from the teachers they support help coaches evaluate the effectiveness of their strategies.
* **Supervisor Input**: Formative feedback from supervisors helps coaches align their professional goals with both personal aspirations and school-wide priorities.
* **Artifacts & Documentation**: Simple yet purposeful documentation such as coaching cycle records, resource samples, and implementation data offer tangible evidence of growth over time. The goal is meaningful documentation that supports reflection, not burdensome paperwork.

#### Multiple Pathways for Demonstrating Growth

At SAS, we value coach agency in how professional growth is demonstrated. Coaches are encouraged to choose methods that align with their professional styles, growth goals, and strengths:

* **Personalized Portfolios**: Create collections of evidence showcasing your journey along the competency continuum
* **Impact Documentation**: Gather data that demonstrates how your coaching has influenced teacher practice and student learning
* **Peer Sharing**: Present insights and learnings through faculty meetings, professional learning communities, or coaching team gatherings
* **Collaborative Inquiry**: Engage in action research or study groups focused on specific coaching competencies
* **Resource Development**: Create tools, protocols, or guidance documents that support other coaches and educators
* **Mentorship**: Support colleagues through formal or informal coaching relationships that build capacity
* **Leadership Contributions**: Influence school-wide practices, policies, or culture through committee work or initiative leadership

The emphasis is on authentic demonstration that serves both individual reflection and collective growth rather than standardized reporting requirements.

#### From Goals to Habits: Harnessing Small Steps for Big Impact

Because growth in coaching involves changing both mindset and practice, SAS encourages coaches to break down larger professional goals into tiny habits or micro-actions—the small yet meaningful steps that over time result in significant improvement. Inspired by approaches such as Atomic Habits and Tiny Habits, we believe that:

* **Incremental Changes Compound**: Rather than overhauling practice overnight, coaches focus on one or two small, daily (or weekly) behaviors that support their goals and movement along the competency continuum.
* **Simplicity Fuels Consistency**: Clear, manageable steps build momentum. When changes are too complex, they often remain aspirational rather than actionable.
* **Reflection Reinforces Growth**: Ongoing self-assessment and feedback loops help coaches see progress, adjust habits where needed, and celebrate incremental successes.

By making small, strategic adjustments to daily routines—such as adding a brief reflection at the end of each coaching session or dedicating five minutes each morning to data review—coaches can sustain motivation and continually refine their practice.

#### Personalized Growth Cycle

The professional growth cycle aligns with SAS's school-wide PGPE calendar but is driven by each coach's self-reflection, goals, and our organizational needs. Incorporating small habits throughout this cycle ensures that changes become deeply embedded in a coach's practice:

1. **Beginning of Year**
   * Coaches reflect on the SAS Coach Competency Map and identify where they align on the continuum
   * They establish personalized growth goals in consultation with supervisors, ensuring alignment with SAS's strategic vision
   * **Micro-Action Planning**: Coaches identify small, consistent behaviors that will help them progress toward these goals
2. **Mid-Year Check-In**
   * Progress is reviewed and feedback gathered
   * Goals and approaches are refined or adjusted based on new insights, data, and shifting priorities
   * **Habit Analysis**: Coaches examine which micro-actions are working well, which may need revision, and how they can maintain momentum
3. **Continuous Feedback**
   * Ongoing dialogue with peers and supervisors provides timely support and "just-in-time" learning opportunities
   * **Tiny Adjustments**: Coaches use feedback to make iterative changes to their habits, sustaining growth over time
4. **End-of-Year Reflection**
   * Coaches synthesize their learning, reassess their position on the continuum, and document outcomes
   * Insights from this reflection inform next steps and future goals
   * **Celebrating Small Wins**: Recognizing the cumulative impact of tiny habits reinforces a growth mindset and prepares coaches for continued improvement
5. **Individualized Growth Plans**
   * Supervisors and coaches collaborate to design next year's professional learning pathways, leveraging evidence collected throughout the year
   * **Scaling Effective Habits**: Successful micro-actions from the previous cycle can be expanded or adapted for new contexts and goals

#### Aligning Individual Growth with Organizational Priorities

While the framework centers each coach's personal learning journey, it also ensures alignment with SAS's strategic priorities:

* **Strategic Focus**: Coaches may select a particular competency (e.g., data-driven instructional support) if it advances a division-wide initiative.
* **Shared Goals**: By linking coaching goals to overarching school or division goals, coaches create a synergy that benefits both their own development and the broader SAS community.
* **Adaptive Capacity**: Because growth is a continuous cycle, coaches can readily pivot if organizational priorities or individual needs change mid-year.

#### Flexibility and Fluidity

* **Self-Direction**: Each coach, in partnership with their supervisor, decides which competencies or areas of the continuum to prioritize at any given time.
* **Non-Linear Progression**: Growth rarely follows a straight line. A coach may accelerate quickly in certain areas, remain steady in others, or revisit earlier stages to strengthen foundational skills.
* **Respect for Experience**: Coaches with varied backgrounds, tenures, and strengths can find meaningful entry points throughout the continuum.

#### In Summary

This framework emphasizes growth over labeling, integrating adult learning theory, cognitive coaching principles, and the power of tiny habits to drive sustained improvement. Coaches identify their unique pathway on the continuum, break down bigger goals into small, actionable steps, and remain agile in response to shifting organizational or personal needs. By focusing on consistent, incremental adjustments, SAS coaches not only enhance their own professional practice but also contribute meaningfully to our shared commitment to excellence and innovation.

## Maintaining Coaching Integrity in TESS/PIP

At Shanghai American School (SAS), our Professional Growth and Professional Evaluation (PGPE) framework provides ongoing opportunities for reflective practice, goal-setting, and meaningful feedback. While most professional learning interactions are supportive and growth-oriented, there are occasions when educators require more targeted or formalized support, leading to processes such as Phase One: ESP or Phase Two: Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). Though Phase One: ESP is a structured process, it does not inherently carry the high stakes associated with Phase Two: PIP, which directly addresses significant performance concerns.

Clearly differentiating coaching from evaluation is essential at SAS. Evaluations measure performance against established criteria and can influence critical employment decisions. Coaching, however, is expressly non-evaluative, growth-focused, and teacher-driven. Maintaining this separation ensures psychological safety and encourages genuine professional growth rather than compliance driven by fear of negative consequences. By preserving this distinction, SAS safeguards coaching as a trusted, voluntary support mechanism, empowering educators to openly reflect, take risks, and continually improve without the fear associated with evaluation outcomes.

Core Principles

Thoughtful Introduction of Coaching Support

• Administrators’ Role:

* Introduce coaching as one of several support options within the TESS/PIP process.

• Teacher Agency:

* Teachers retain discretion in deciding whether to engage with coaching support.
* Ensures coaching is voluntary rather than mandated.

• Teacher-Led Disclosure:

* If teachers choose to participate, they determine which aspects of their improvement goals to share with the coach.
* Preserves relevance to the teacher’s personal growth objectives and fosters ownership.

Distinct Yet Complementary Roles

• Administrator’s Role:

* Manage the formal TESS/PIP process, setting performance objectives in collaboration with the teacher.
* Maintain transparent communication regarding expectations, timelines, and criteria for success.

• Teacher’s Role:

* Collaborate with the administrator to define goals that address areas of concern in TESS/PIP.
* Decide if or how coaching fits into their improvement plan based on personal growth objectives.

• Coach’s Role:

* When engaged, focus on reflective dialogue and instructional enhancement, helping teachers explore and refine their practice.
* Does not set or revise official TESS/PIP goals; rather, the coach supports the teacher’s chosen priorities within those established objectives.

• Boundary Clarity:

* While administrators evaluate progress toward TESS/PIP milestones, coaches maintain a non-evaluative stance.
* Both roles contribute to teacher growth while respecting the clear boundary between formal evaluation and coaching.

Communication Guidelines

• Teacher-Led Communication:

* Teachers decide what information from coaching conversations, if any, is shared with administrators.
* Reinforces confidentiality and a sense of safety in coaching.

• With Teacher Consent:

* If a teacher agrees, coaches may share broad patterns of engagement (e.g., “Teacher is exploring student-centered strategies”) with administrators. (See section)
* Specific details remain private unless explicitly requested by the teacher.

• Non-Evaluative Stance:

* In all cases, coaching remains distinct from formal performance assessments.
* The goal is to foster growth, not to evaluate performance or recommend employment actions.

Program Integrity

• Balanced Coach Assignments:

* SAS strives to ensure that coaches do not work exclusively with teachers in TESS or PIP, which could unintentionally brand coaching as purely “remedial.”
* A balanced approach reinforces coaching as a universal growth-oriented resource for all educators.

• Intentional Engagement:

* Leadership and coaches thoughtfully determine whether coaching participation in a PIP context is suitable for each teacher’s needs.
* Helps preserve the teacher-driven nature of coaching and mitigates any perception of compulsion.

• Shared Accountability:

* Both administrators and coaches maintain clear, purposeful communication around roles, boundaries, and expectations.
* Coaches clarify boundary concerns if asked to perform tasks that appear evaluative, thus safeguarding the non-evaluative coaching stance.

Documentation and Communication Protocols

For further clarity on the roles, responsibilities, and protocols for documentation and communication, please refer to:

* Appendix: PIP/TESS Coaching Procedures
  + Step-by-step guidelines for introducing coaching in TESS/PIP contexts
  + Communication templates that reinforce the non-evaluative stance
  + Approaches to document teacher engagement without infringing on confidentiality

By adhering to these principles and protocols, SAS ensures that both TESS and PIP remain focused on professional support and accountability, while coaching continues to function as a trusted, teacher-centered avenue for growth—free from unintended perceptions or evaluative entanglements.

# Program Impact and Program Evaluation

Effective coaching programs require robust, ongoing assessment to ensure they achieve desired outcomes and continuously improve. At Shanghai American School (SAS), we have developed a comprehensive approach to measuring and evaluating our coaching program's impact—one that aligns with our coaching philosophy while providing meaningful insights for program refinement. Informed by research-based evaluation approaches, including Joellen Killion's work on assessing professional learning impact, our framework balances rigor with practicality, focusing on meaningful outcomes rather than merely measuring activities.

## Impact and Evaluation Design

Our impact measurement system is designed to capture both the direct effects of coaching on teaching practice and the broader influence on student learning outcomes. By examining multiple levels of impact—from individual teacher growth to school-wide instructional improvement—we create a holistic picture of the coaching program's value.

#### System Design and Components

The SAS Coaching Impact Framework measures effectiveness across five interconnected domains:

* **Teacher Growth & Practice**: Changes in teacher knowledge, skills, beliefs, and instructional practices
* **Student Learning Experience**: Effects on student engagement, learning behaviors, and achievement outcomes
* **Coaching Implementation**: Quality, fidelity, and reach of coaching activities and processes
* **School Culture & Community**: Shifts in collaborative practices, reflective inquiry, and collective efficacy
* **Program Value**: The benefits created in relation to resources invested

Each domain includes specific indicators tied to our coaching program's theory of change, ensuring that we measure what truly matters rather than what is merely convenient to assess.

#### Data Collection Framework

Our framework employs multiple data sources to create a robust, triangulated understanding of coaching impact:

* **Direct Measures**: Observation data, student work samples, assessment results
* **Perceptual Data**: Teacher surveys, focus groups, reflective dialogues
* **Process Documentation**: Coaching logs, goal achievement records, implementation metrics
* **Contextual Indicators**: School climate measures, collaborative practice assessments

For each data source, we have established clear collection protocols, timelines, and responsibilities, ensuring consistent implementation while minimizing disruption to teaching and coaching activities.

#### Analysis Protocols

Rigorous yet practical analysis procedures transform raw data into meaningful insights:

* **Data Review Teams**: Cross-functional teams (including coaches, teachers, and administrators) examine evidence through multiple lenses
* **Mixed-Methods Approach**: Integration of quantitative metrics with qualitative insights to understand both what is happening and why
* **Comparative Analysis**: Examination of patterns across divisions, initiatives, and time periods to identify significant trends and variations
* **Contribution Analysis**: Focus on establishing plausible connections between coaching activities and observed outcomes, acknowledging multiple influencing factors

These protocols help us move beyond simplistic cause-effect assumptions to develop nuanced understanding of how coaching contributes to our educational ecosystem.

#### Reporting Structure

Our reporting approach balances transparency with appropriate confidentiality:

* **Annual Impact Report**: Comprehensive overview of program outcomes, challenges, and successes
* **Stakeholder-Specific Briefs**: Tailored summaries for various audiences (ALT, faculty, board) highlighting relevant insights
* **Implementation Updates**: Regular sharing of key metrics and emerging trends
* **Teacher-Focused Resources**: Practical insights and findings relevant to classroom implementation

All reporting follows our documentation principles regarding confidentiality and non-evaluative language, ensuring consistency with our coaching philosophy.

#### Program Assessment Model

Our program assessment model examines both implementation quality and outcome achievement, recognizing that both are essential for understanding coaching effectiveness.

#### Success Metrics and Indicators

Our metrics balance quantitative measures with qualitative indicators across several dimensions:

* **Reach Metrics**: Percentage of educators engaged, distribution across divisions, intensity of engagement
* **Implementation Indicators**: Quality of coaching interactions, fidelity to core functions, alignment with strategic priorities
* **Teacher Changes**: Evidence of shifts in instructional practice, professional capacity, and collaborative engagement
* **Student Outcomes**: Changes in learning experiences, engagement, and achievement
* **Systemic Impact**: Evidence of broader influence on school culture and practice

These metrics are regularly reviewed to ensure they remain aligned with SAS's evolving strategic priorities and coaching program goals.

#### Evaluation Frameworks

Our evaluation approach incorporates multiple perspectives to create a comprehensive assessment:

* **Developmental Evaluation**: Ongoing refinement of the program during implementation
* **Goal-Based Assessment**: Measurement of progress toward specific, predetermined objectives
* **Process Evaluation**: Examination of implementation quality and fidelity
* **Outcome Evaluation**: Measurement of resultant changes in teaching and learning
* **Organizational Impact**: Assessment of how coaching influences school culture and systems

This multi-faceted approach acknowledges that simple input-output evaluation models are insufficient for complex educational initiatives like coaching.

#### Impact Measurement Tools

We employ a carefully selected toolkit of validated instruments and custom protocols:

* **Coaching Quality Tools**: Instruments to assess coaching interactions against established quality criteria
* **Teaching Practice Measures**: Protocols for documenting changes in instructional approaches
* **Student Experience Assessments**: Age-appropriate tools for capturing shifts in student learning experiences
* **School Culture Instruments**: Validated measures of collaborative practice and collective efficacy

Each tool is selected or designed based on alignment with our coaching philosophy, practicality for regular use, and ability to yield meaningful insights rather than merely interesting data.

#### Data Collection Systems

Efficient, user-friendly systems support consistent implementation:

* **Digital Platforms**: Secure online tools for survey administration and data aggregation
* **Documentation Templates**: Standardized formats for recording coaching activities and outcomes
* **Sampling Approaches**: Strategic selection methods that balance comprehensiveness with practicality
* **Integration with Existing Systems**: Alignment with SAS's broader data management infrastructure

These systems are designed to minimize administrative burden while maximizing the value of collected information.

#### Continuous Improvement

Evaluation is not merely for documentation—it directly drives ongoing program refinement through structured improvement processes.

#### Review Cycles

Regular, purposeful examination of program data follows a consistent calendar:

* **Quick-Response Reviews**: Monthly check-ins to address immediate implementation challenges
* **Quarterly Deep Dives**: Thorough examination of patterns and trends emerging across a longer timeframe
* **Annual Comprehensive Analysis**: Full-scale review of program impact, implementation, and alignment with strategic priorities
* **Three-Year Strategic Assessment**: Major evaluation of program direction, design, and outcomes

Each review cycle has distinct protocols, participants, and expected outcomes, creating a layered approach to program improvement.

#### Adjustment Protocols

Clear processes guide how evaluation insights translate into program refinements:

* **Rapid-Cycle Improvements**: Streamlined procedures for implementing immediate, targeted adjustments
* **Strategic Refinements**: Structured approach for substantial program modifications based on cumulative evidence
* **Implementation Planning**: Systematic processes for translating improvement decisions into operational changes
* **Innovation Protocols**: Frameworks for testing and evaluating new coaching approaches or tools

These protocols balance responsiveness with stability, ensuring the program evolves thoughtfully rather than reacting to isolated data points.

#### Stakeholder Feedback Systems

Multiple channels capture diverse perspectives on program effectiveness:

* **Teacher Voice Mechanisms**: Structured opportunities for educators to share experiences and suggestions
* **Coach Reflection Forums**: Dedicated spaces for coaches to analyze their practice and propose refinements
* **Leadership Input Channels**: Systematic collection of insights from ALT and other school leaders
* **Student Perspective Gathering**: Age-appropriate methods for understanding how coaching ultimately affects learners

These feedback systems ensure that improvement efforts are informed by the experiences of all stakeholders, not just evaluation metrics.

#### Progress Monitoring

Systematic tracking ensures that improvement efforts themselves are effective:

* **Implementation Tracking**: Documentation of how planned refinements are put into practice
* **Impact Assessment**: Measurement of whether changes produce intended improvements
* **Adaptation Documentation**: Record of how initial improvement plans evolve based on emerging insights
* **Evaluation Refinement**: Regular assessment of the evaluation process itself to ensure it remains valuable and efficient

This monitoring closes the loop between evaluation and improvement, creating a true cycle of continuous enhancement.

#### Evaluation Leadership

We have established clear structures for overseeing the evaluation process:

#### Evaluation Oversight

* **Evaluation Leadership Team**: A cross-functional group including Educational Programs, divisional leadership, coaches, and teacher representatives who guide evaluation efforts
