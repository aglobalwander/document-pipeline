Mediative questioning is intentionally designed to engage and transform the other person's thinking and perspective. These kinds of questions meet at least four criteria:

- They are invitational in intonation and form.
- They engage specific complex cognitive operations.
- They are intentional.
- They address content that is either external or internal to the other person.
