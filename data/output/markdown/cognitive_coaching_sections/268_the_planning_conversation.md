## THE PLANNING CONVERSATION

Before a colleague participates in an event or attempts a task, the Cognitive Coach 'mediates' by illuminating and facilitating the refinement of the colleague's cognitive processes of planning. Holding the planning map in mind, the coach engages the colleague's cognitive processes that will maximize the significance, success, and meaning of the event. A map of the planning conversation is displayed in figure 11.1 This planning map displays the territory of a planning conversation, the regions within it, and the possible routes to reach a destination. The coach and the colleague visit each of the regions of the map with specific intentions. Within the territory of planning, there are five dominant regions, which the coach mediates by having the planner do the following:

- Clarify goals . In the region of 'clarify goals,' the intent is to decide what purposes or outcomes the person being coached wants for the event that is being planned.
- Specify success indicators and a plan for collecting evidence . In 'specify success indicators,' the intent is to envision and specify those observable indicators of success: What would participants (e.g., students) in the event be doing or saying that would indicate that the approach is achieving its purposes? Also in this region, the coach and the colleague devise a plan for monitoring (recording and/or collecting evidence) for specific success indicators.

- Anticipate approaches, strategies, decisions, and how to monitor them . Within the 'anticipate approaches' region, the intent is to describe those strategies or activities that are intended to achieve the outcomes.
- Establish personal learning focuses and processes for selfassessment . Because Cognitive Coaches consider each event as an opportunity for meaning making, the intent of the 'establish personal learnings' region is for the partner to establish a basis for selfdirected learning. Inviting the teacher to establish a personal learning focus is unique to Cognitive Coaching and is founded in the values related to supporting self-directed learning.
- Reflect on the coaching process and explore refinements . Finally, the coach may invite the partner to reflect on the entire coaching conversation, to explore its effects on thinking and decision making, and to recommend modifications that could enhance future planning conversations.

When we've asked teachers what information they would like observers to have about their class prior to an observation, we have gotten an extensive list of requests. These are situational, of course, and depend on many environmental and personal factors. However, teachers often want

coaches to know the following:

- Where this lesson fits into the teacher's overall, long-range plan for the students and what has happened previously on this topic
- Information about the social dynamics of the class
- Behavioral information about specific students
- Aspects of the lesson about which the teacher is unclear
- Concerns about student behavior
- Concerns related to trying a new teaching technique
- Why this lesson concept is important to students
- Events beyond the classroom experience affecting students

Although the teacher or the coach might introduce any of the above topics into a planning conversation, the planning conversation items presented earlier represent the five cornerstones of any and all Cognitive Coaching planning conversations.

The regions of a planning conversation exist in the coach's mind in the above, logical order. However, the regions may be visited in any sequence, depending on the interests and thinking processes of the colleague. At any time during a planning conversation, either the coach or the colleague may decide to revisit a region for more specificity or to examine its influence on other regions.
