## THE UNEXPECTED EFFECT OF PRAISE

In a series of experiments on 400 New York fifth-graders, Carole Dweck (2006) had researchers administer a one-on-one nonverbal IQ test-puzzles easy enough that all the children would do fairly well. On completion, each child was given his score and a single line of praise. Randomly divided into groups, some were praised for their intelligence . They were told, 'You must be smart at this.' Other students were praised for their effort : 'You must have worked really hard.'

Then the students were given a choice of test for the second round. One choice was a test that would be more difficult than the first, but the researchers told the kids that they'd learn a

lot from attempting the puzzles. The other choice, Dweck's team explained, was an easy test, just like the first. Of those praised for their effort, 90 percent chose the harder set of puzzles. Of those praised for their intelligence, a majority chose the easy test. The 'smart' kids took the cop-out.

Praise communicates a value judgment about another person or the person's performance. It infers an unconscious entitlement to evaluate another. At some level, we often feel uncomfortable about receiving praise. Even on occasions when it might feel good to hear 'You did a great job,' the praise removes any need for one to apply one's own criteria to self-assessment.

When we ask supervisors why they use praise, they often report two reasons. One is to reinforce behavior. As we can see above, this can promote nongrowth. A second is to communicate positive regard. Robert Kegan and Lisa Lahey (2001) implore us to move from the language of prizes and praising to the language of ongoing regard. One attribute of this language is to replace 'you' statements with 'I' statements. 'Abdulla, I appreciate the way you took time to bring me up to date. It made a real difference to me.' Kegan and Lahey (2001, 100) say, 'Characterizing our own experience, positive or negative, leaves the other informed (not formed) by our words.'

Coaches signal personal regard by the following behaviors:

- Spending time with the other person in activities not related to the coaching task.
- Making inquiries or statements related to the other person's personal interests or experiences.
- Practicing all the fundamental behaviors of courtesy and respect revealed in the research on trust building: proximity, touch, courteous language, and personal compliments ('I like that tie'). Sometimes the workplace gets so busy and task oriented that these little personal connections are abandoned, and the day-to-day workplace becomes an emotional wasteland.

Excessive reliance on personal trust without regard to the goals of the organization can lead to paternalism and parochialism. Andy Hargreaves (1994) notes that trust in expertise and in a process that helps to solve problems on a continuing basis maximizes the organization's collective expertise.
