## C. Inferences, Causality, and Interpretations

The coach may make his/her own interpretations of the lesson or state a causal relationship

- Your explanation helped the students understand their task. (Inference)
- The criteria you developed guided their capacity to self-evaluate. (Causality)
- The concept you were working on became clearer with each example you gave. (Interpretation)

Notice that all the statements above are from the coach's point of view. When the coach makes these statements, it usurps the self-directedness of the coachee and is, therefore, counterproductive and should be avoided. A higher degree of self-directedness is achieved when the coach invites the coachee to make such causal relationships, inferences, and interpretations.
