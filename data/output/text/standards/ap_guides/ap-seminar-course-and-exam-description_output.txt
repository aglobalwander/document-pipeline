About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students to
pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to
earn college credit, advanced placement, or both—while
still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects,
each culminating in a challenging exam, students learn
to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see
many sides of an issue—skills that prepare them for
college and beyond. Taking AP courses demonstrates
to college admission officers that students have sought
the most challenging curriculum available to them, and
research indicates that students who score a 3 or higher
on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic
success in college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s
syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some
of the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and AP
Exams are developed and scored by college faculty and
experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges and
universities in the United States grant credit, advanced
placement, or both on the basis of successful AP Exam
scores; more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and
exams emphasize challenging, research-based curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources. This
course and exam description presents the content and
skills that are assessed in the AP Seminar course.
Enrolling Students: Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically
challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to equitable preparation and
access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses: The AP
Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that
will enable students to develop the understandings and skills described in the course framework.
The AP Program has a short list of curricular and
resource requirements that must be fulfilled before a
school can label a course “Advanced Placement” or “AP.”
Schools wishing to offer AP courses must participate
in the AP Course Audit, a process through which AP
teachers’ course materials are reviewed by college
faculty. The AP Course Audit was created to provide
teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on
curricular and resource requirements for AP courses
and to help colleges and universities validate courses
marked “AP” on students’ transcripts. This process
ensures that AP teachers’ courses meet or exceed the
curricular and resource expectations that college and
secondary school faculty have established for college level courses.
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the AP teacher
and the school principal (or designated administrator) to
confirm awareness and understanding of the curricular
and resource requirements. A syllabus or course outline,
detailing how course requirements are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.

How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The AP
Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor; all
AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision, piloting,
and analysis to ensure that questions are accurate, fair,
and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development, College
Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher education
institutions. This feedback is carefully considered to
ensure that AP courses and exams are able to provide
students with a college-level learning experience and
the opportunity to demonstrate their qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
Please note: The information below is a general overview of how AP Exams are scored. For course specific information, please visit apcentral.
collegeboard.org/courses.
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam development process, relies on the expertise of both AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course
performance assessments, as applicable, are scored by
thousands of college faculty and expert AP teachers.
Most are scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small
portion is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly
trained, and their work is monitored throughout the
Reading for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves
as Chief Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP
Readers in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy
of the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a
curve. Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which
means that every student who meets the criteria for
an AP score of 2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no
matter how many students that is. The criteria for the number of points students must earn on the AP
Exam to receive scores of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that
research consistently validates for credit and placement
purposes—include:
§§ The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
§§ The number of points researchers have found to
be predictive that an AP student will succeed when
placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
§§ Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP
scores as follows:
AP
Score
Credit
Recommendation
College Grade
Equivalent 5
Extremely well qualified
A 4
Well qualified
A–, B+, B 3
Qualified
B–, C+, C 2
Possibly qualified n/a 1
No recommendation n/a 2

While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and
universities. To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/ placement policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/creditpolicies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college
faculty members from around the world gather for seven
days in multiple locations to evaluate and score the
free-response sections of the AP Exams. Ninety-eight
percent of surveyed educators who took part in the AP
Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an AP
Reader, including opportunities to:
§§ Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning AP
Readers—both high school and college educators— make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the AP Reading.
§§ Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP
scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure to the
quality and depth of the responses from the entire
pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
§§ Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
§§ Score from home: AP Readers have online distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects. Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
§§ Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs): AP
Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.

AP Classroom,
Digital Activation, and AP Digital Portfolio
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students throughout
their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and students.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with questions to use in their classrooms.
Teachers can create customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice throughout the year.
REQUIRED ONLINE SCORING TRAINING
Each year, AP Capstone teachers must take and pass certification tests in order to submit scores for
the presentation components of the performance tasks. This annual training is found in the Professional
Learning section of AP Classroom. Optional training modules are also available for other components of the assessment.
Digital Activation
AP teachers, students and coordinators must complete the digital activation process at the start of
the school year, which provides access to all AP resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and AP Coordinators to
complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following additional benefits:
§§ Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically designed to
support instruction throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
§§ Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will receive a set
of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student pack. The AP ID connects
a student’s exam materials with the registration information they provided during digital activation,
eliminating the need for preadministration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
§§ Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning Reports (IPRs)
that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.
Note: New AP Capstone teachers must attend required summer professional development and have their
AP Course Audit form approved in order to start the digital activation process and gain access to AP
Classroom and the AP Digital Portfolio.

About the AP Capstone™
Program
AP Capstone™ is an innovative diploma program from College Board that equips students with the independent
research, collaborative teamwork, and communication skills that are increasingly valued by colleges. AP Capstone
is built on the foundation of two AP® courses—AP Seminar and AP Research—and is designed to complement and
enhance the in-depth, discipline-specific study experienced in other AP courses.
In AP Seminar, students investigate real-world issues from multiple perspectives, gathering and analyzing information
from various sources in order to develop credible and valid evidence-based arguments. AP Seminar is a prerequisite
for AP Research. Completing AP Seminar and all its required assessment components is necessary for students
to develop the skills to be successful in AP Research. In AP Research, students cultivate the skills and discipline
necessary to conduct independent research and inquiry in order to produce and defend their scholarly work.
The AP Capstone program aims to empower students by:
§§ engaging them with rigorous college-level curricula focused on the skills necessary for successful college completion;
§§ extending their abilities to synthesize information from multiple perspectives and apply skills in new situations and cross-curricular contexts;
§§ enabling them to collect and analyze information with accuracy and precision;
§§ cultivating their abilities to craft, communicate, and defend evidence-based arguments; and
§§ providing opportunities for them to practice disciplined and scholarly research skills while exploring relevant
topics that appeal to their interests and curiosity.
Research Base
The big ideas and learning objectives in the AP Capstone program reflect the core academic skills needed for college,
career, and life readiness identified by leading educational organizations and College Board membership, including
the following:

AP Capstone Pedagogical
Framework
Overview of the Pedagogical Framework
Throughout the program, students consider and evaluate multiple points of view to develop their own perspectives
on complex issues and topics through inquiry and investigation. The AP Capstone program provides students with
a framework that allows them to develop, practice, and hone their critical and creative thinking skills as they make
connections between various issues and their own lives. Teachers should help students understand that this process
is recursive, not linear. The recursive nature of this process allows students to go back and forth between the different
stages of inquiry as they encounter new information.

AP Capstone Reasoning Processes
The AP Capstone program allows students to develop and practice reasoning processes that help them to make
intentional, strategic decisions. It is important for teachers to understand these reasoning processes, which are embedded within the learning objectives:
§§ Situating — being aware of the context of one’s own as well as others’ perspectives, realizing that individual bias can lead to assumptions;
§§ Choosing — making intentional and purposeful choices, realizing that choices have both intended and unintended consequences;
§§ Defending — being able to explain and justify personal choices, logic, line of reasoning, and conclusions; and
§§ Connecting — seeing intersections within and/or across concepts, disciplines, and cultures.
AP Seminar Course Transferable Skills and Proficiencies
The AP Capstone reasoning processes are also embedded in the AP Seminar course transferable skills and
proficiencies. The transferable skills and proficiencies are high-level descriptions of the understanding, knowledge,
and skills that students should be able to apply in novel situations long after completing the AP Seminar course.

AP Seminar Course Description
AP Seminar is a foundational course that engages students in cross-curricular conversations that explore the
complexities of academic and real-world topics and issues by analyzing divergent perspectives. Using an inquiry
framework, students practice reading and analyzing articles, research studies, and foundational, literary, and
philosophical texts; listening to and viewing speeches, broadcasts, and personal accounts; and experiencing
artistic works and performances. Students learn to synthesize information from multiple sources, develop their own
perspectives in written essays, and design and deliver oral and visual presentations, both individually and as part of a
team. Ultimately, the course aims to equip students with the power to analyze and evaluate information with accuracy
and precision in order to craft and communicate evidence-based arguments.

AP Seminar Curricular
Requirements
The curricular requirements are the core elements of an AP course. The curriculum framework and supporting
documents provided during professional development serve as resources to assist teachers in determining the
appropriate level of evidence to include within their syllabi to meet or exceed the requirements. (All AP Seminar
teachers must attend College Board AP Seminar intensive training prior to their first year of teaching the AP
Seminar course.)
Evidence of the following curricular requirements should be included in the course syllabus developed by the teacher
and submitted to College Board for review and approval.
§§ Students explore the complexities of one or more themes by making connections within, between, and/or
among multiple cross-curricular areas and by exploring multiple perspectives and lenses (e.g., cultural and
social, artistic and philosophical, political and historical, environmental, economic, scientific, futuristic, ethical) related to those themes.
§§ Students develop and apply discrete skills identified in the learning objectives of the enduring understandings within the following five big ideas:
› ›
Question and Explore › ›
Understand and Analyze › ›
Evaluate Multiple Perspectives › ›
Synthesize Ideas › ›
Team, Transform, and Transmit
§§ Students gain a rich appreciation and understanding of issues through the following activities:
› › reading articles and research studies;
› ›
reading foundational, literary, and philosophical texts;
› ›
viewing and listening to speeches, broadcasts, and/or personal accounts;
› › and experiencing artistic works and performances.
§§ Students develop an understanding of ethical research practices and the AP Capstone™ Policy on Plagiarism and Falsification or Fabrication of Information.
§§ Students work collaboratively with a team to identify, investigate, analyze, and evaluate a real-world or academic
problem or issue; consider and evaluate alternatives or options; propose one or more solutions or resolutions; and
present and defend the argument for their solutions through a multimedia presentation.
§§ Students work independently to identify a research question based on provided stimulus material; research the
issue; analyze, evaluate, and select evidence to develop an argument; present and defend a conclusion; and
produce a multimedia presentation to be delivered to their peers.

AP Seminar Curriculum
Framework
Overview of the Curriculum Framework
Based on the Understanding by Design (Wiggins and McTighe) model, this curriculum framework is intended
to provide a clear and detailed description of the course requirements necessary for student success. This
conceptualization will guide the development and organization of learning outcomes from general to specific,
resulting in focused statements about content knowledge and skills needed for success in the course. The curriculum
framework contains the following structural components:
§§ The course is organized around five big ideas. Tied to each big idea are several essential questions. These
are open-ended questions that encourage students to think deeply about a topic, ask additional questions and
investigate solutions, and develop the deeper conceptual understanding that the course seeks to foster.
§§ Within each big idea are several enduring understandings. These are the long-term takeaways related to the
big ideas that a student should have after exploring the content and skills. These understandings are expressed
as generalizations that specify what students will come to understand about the key concepts in the course.
Enduring understandings are numbered to correspond to each big idea.
§§ Linked to each enduring understanding are the corresponding learning objectives. The learning objectives
articulate what students need to be able to do in order to develop the enduring understandings. The learning
objectives will become targets of assessment for the course. Learning objectives are numbered to correspond
with the appropriate big ideas and enduring understandings.
§§ For each of the learning objectives, essential knowledge statements describe the facts and basic concepts that
a student should know and be able to recall in order to demonstrate mastery of the learning objective. Essential
knowledge components are numbered to correspond with the appropriate big ideas, enduring understandings, and learning objectives.

Big Idea 1: Question and Explore
Inquiry and investigation begin when students encounter information about ideas, complex issues and problems that
stimulates their intellectual curiosity. They then continue the research process by developing a critical question about
one or more of those complex issues or ideas. Seeking answers to such questions requires exploration of numerous,
often competing perspectives; the context surrounding those perspectives; and the reliability and credibility of the
perspectives. Through this exploration, students begin to develop their own perspectives, rather than simply accept
those of others. They consider the purpose of their research — what is supposed to be achieved and why. Ideally, they
also develop additional questions that lead to further inquiry. The intrinsic value of asking and answering questions
cannot be overstated. Giving students the opportunity to dig deeper and feed their curiosity makes for meaningful discoveries and discussions.
ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS
§§ How does the context of a problem or issue affect how it is interpreted or presented?
§§ How might others see the problem or issue differently?
§§ What questions have yet to be asked?
§§ What voices or perspectives are missing from my research?
§§ What do I want to know, learn, or understand?
§§ How does my research question shape how I go about trying to answer it?
§§ What information do I need to answer my question?
§§ What keywords should I use to search for information about this topic?

Big Idea 2: Understand and Analyze
Developing understanding starts with comprehension of the concepts and perspectives under examination. Being
able to summarize by identifying and explaining the salient ideas in a text is foundational. When students summarize
and explain an author’s perspective to others, they are building understanding. Students must comprehend a
perspective or argument in order to be able to analyze it. That analysis — including consideration of the author’s point
of view and purpose, the reasoning and details the author selects, develops, and conveys, and the way the author
chooses to situate those details — in turn leads to greater understanding of the topic or concept being explored.
Students evaluate the validity of an argument by examining the strength of the line of reasoning and the quality of the
evidence the author uses. This level of understanding allows students to recognize the implications and predict the consequences of an argument.
ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS
§§ What strategies will help me comprehend a text?
§§ What is the argument’s main idea and what reasoning does the author use to develop it?
§§ Why might the author view the issue this way?
§§ What biases may the author have that influence his or her perspective?
§§ Does this argument acknowledge other perspectives?
§§ How do I know if a source is trustworthy?
§§ What are the implications of these arguments?
§§ How does this conclusion impact me and my community? Or my research?

Big Idea 3: Evaluate Multiple Perspectives
Understanding the complexity of an issue, idea, or problem requires students to compare and contrast different
perspectives. These multiple perspectives, which may support, oppose, compete with, or otherwise vary from one
another, come together to create the conversation on the issue. Students must consider the biases and assumptions
behind those perspectives in order to evaluate their relevance and importance in the conversation. Evaluating
multiple perspectives and arguments allows students to better understand the complexities of an issue or topic.
ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS
§§ What patterns or trends can be identified among the arguments about this issue?
§§ What are the implications and/or consequences of accepting or rejecting a particular argument?
§§ How can I connect the multiple perspectives? What other issues, questions, or topics do they relate to?
§§ How can I explain contradictions within or between arguments?
§§ From whose perspective is this information being presented, and how does that affect my evaluation?

Big Idea 4: Synthesize Ideas
Once enough information is gathered and evaluated, students synthesize their accumulated knowledge, emerging
ideas, and perspectives to form conclusions of their own. In order to situate their perspectives within the larger
conversation, students must consider other perspectives and points of view. Strong arguments have a clear purpose
and are grounded in a logical line of reasoning supported by carefully chosen and relevant evidence. Effective
arguments analyze the material and develop a perspective on it. Information from other sources should not stand
in for students’ own thinking. The goal is for students to think critically about the information and then add to, not
simply repeat, the ideas of others. Building arguments on the ideas of others recognizes and acknowledges their
perspectives while also establishing one’s unique voice in the conversation.
ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS
§§ How do I connect and analyze the evidence in order to develop an argument and support a conclusion?
§§ What line of reasoning and evidence would best support my argument? Is my reasoning logical?
§§ Are there other conclusions I should consider?
§§ What am I taking for granted? How do I acknowledge and account for my own biases and assumptions?
§§ What is the best way to acknowledge and attribute the work of others that was used to support my argument?
§§ How can I avoid committing plagiarism?

Big Idea 5: Team, Transform, and Transmit
Collaboration, communication, and reflection are skills that provide opportunities for students to develop their
learning. When collaborating, students draw upon their own strengths and the strengths of teammates to achieve a common goal.
An argument is effectively communicated when its purpose is clear, it is tailored to a specific audience and context,
and it is conveyed through a medium appropriate and appealing to the intended audience. Adhering to standard
language conventions and engaging delivery techniques establishes a writer’s or speaker’s credibility with his or her audience.
Whether working alone or in a group, students reflect on their work and learning processes, which can lead to
personal growth as well as even more effective inquiry, learning, and collaboration.

AP Seminar Instructional
Approaches
Organizing the Course
INQUIRY AND THE ACADEMIC CONVERSATION
While the AP Seminar course develops core skills for academic success, it also challenges students to learn to think
critically about complex issues and form their own perspectives about them. For this reason, the course is organized
around topics, themes, or issues chosen at the local level. Helping students move from reviewing literature to building
an argument through inquiry is a key goal of the AP Seminar course.
Critical inquiry focuses on the creation of new ideas, perspectives, and arguments. Teachers must help students
understand that the research process is not simply about collecting evidence or facts and then piecing them
together. Instead, the research process is about inquiry — asking questions and coming to solutions and conclusions
through serious thinking and reflection. The researcher seeks relevant information in articles, books, and other
sources and develops an informed perspective built upon, but not merely derivative of, the ideas in the examined
material. As a result, the research process is recursive, meaning that the researcher regularly revisits ideas, seeks new
information when necessary, and reconsiders and refines the research questions, topic, and/or approach.
Facilitating students’ entrance into academic or real-world conversations about complex issues is another key goal
of the AP Seminar course. AP Seminar provides the forum for students to examine multiple, diverse perspectives on
issues in order to better understand and appreciate their complexity. Students’ cultural backgrounds and experiences
provide a rich foundation from which to begin. By considering and evaluating the multiple perspectives of others,
students develop their own individual perspectives and add their personal voices to the larger conversation.
All in all, the AP Seminar course aims to build independent, critical thinkers by empowering students to develop the
skills and traits necessary for future academic study.

Multiple Perspectives and Interdisciplinary Connections
Exploring different points of view and making connections across disciplines are fundamental components of the
AP Seminar experience. Students consider each topic through a variety of lenses and from multiple perspectives,
many of which are divergent or competing. Analyzing topics through multiple lenses aids in interdisciplinary
understanding and helps students gain a rich appreciation for the complexity of important issues. Teachers should
encourage students to explore a topic through several of the following lenses:
§§ Cultural and social §§ Artistic and philosophical §§ Political and historical §§ Environmental §§ Economic §§ Scientific §§ Futuristic §§ Ethical
As the AP Program engages students in college-level work, the AP Seminar course may include perspectives that
could be considered controversial, including references to ethnicity, nationality, religion, politics, race, dialect,
sexuality, gender, or class. AP Seminar requires students to have the level of maturity and skill to thoughtfully
consider and analyze diverse perspectives. The inclusion of topics, readings, texts, and other source material is not
intended as an endorsement by College Board of the content, ideas, or values expressed in the material.

Texts
Because people share their perspectives through many different types of media, teachers and students are
encouraged to draw upon a wide variety of texts. These texts can include printed and online articles, speeches,
interviews, and personal narratives, artistic works and performances, or other kinds of texts — anything that conveys a perspective and can be examined.
When selecting texts for study, teachers should challenge students to engage with and analyze complex and
scholarly sources. Helping students with the identification of scholarly materials requires a discussion of peer
review, which differentiates scholarly from nonscholarly sources in an academic, research community. Students
should be invited to find and contribute texts for study, providing them opportunities to make connections of their own.
Access to a variety of print and online style guides, writing and argumentation handbooks, databases, and
other reference materials is essential to equip students and teachers with the tools necessary for research and
communication. The AP Capstone program does not require or specify a specific style guide. However, students
should maintain the conventions of a single style guide in an individual project.
ORGANIZATIONAL MODELS
AP Seminar can be organized in a variety of ways to best address student interests, state and/or country and
district goals and requirements, and local school traditions and culture. The following table illustrates some possible organizational models.
AP Seminar Model
Description
Example Courses
Thematic Survey
Themes are selected based on teacher and student interest.
The themes may be linked with overarching focus or they may be more loosely connected.
Interdisciplinary connections are made within each theme and issues are examined through multiple lenses and perspectives.
Civic Engagement
Themes are selected by the teacher to support
the school’s service learning initiative. The units use essential questions to engage students with community issues and challenges:
›
› Democracy: Does my civic engagement make a difference?
›
› Sustainability: What impact do I have?
›
› Traditions: Do local traditions encourage or hinder community progress?
›
› Health: How do my choices affect our future?
Student Interest
Students are given a list of 10 possible themes by the teacher and asked to rate them. The four highest-rated themes are used for the course:
› › Social networks and individual privacy › › Stereotypes in media › › Food supply and demand › › The youth revolution 29

AP Seminar Model
Description
Example Courses
Disciplinary Focus
The course content is grounded in a specific discipline. Interdisciplinary connections are made to the topics of study.
Science
This course is offered as an elective in science. The
interdisciplinary units connect scientific study with real-world sustainability issues:
› › Marine debris › › Renewable energy › › Food scarcity › › Greenhouse gas emissions › › LEED certification
Arts
This course is offered to students who have an
interest or area of emphasis in the arts. The selected themes allow students to examine common issues
that intersect the various arts disciplines through
multiple lenses:
› › Aesthetics and Interpretation: What is beauty and who decides?
› › Culture and Context: How does culture and context influence art’s creation?
› › Transformation and Innovation: How do new forms of art come about?
›
› Myth and Pattern: How does one work of art influence another? Are works of art universal?
Thematic Survey Linked to AP Anchor Course
AP Seminar students are concurrently enrolled in another common AP course, allowing for team teaching and interdisciplinary units.
AP Seminar: American Studies
Students are concurrently enrolled in AP U.S. History, allowing for cross-curricular connections between
the two courses:
› › Place and Frontiers: Relationships between humans and their environment ›
› Belief and Values: Perspectives on faith and religion › › Revolution and Freedom: Historical ideas of protest and solidarity ›
› Identity and Expansion: Diverse views about U.S.
expansion, citizenship, and the American dream › › Wealth and Poverty: Social and cultural topics and perspectives about current issues 30

AP Seminar Model
Description
Example Courses
Interdisciplinary
Courses
All course topics are connected and cross disciplinary boundaries.
The two example courses listed here are modeled
on courses offered as part of the Thinking Matters program at Stanford University.
AP Seminar: Sustainability and Collapse
Students explore how people have lived with
nature over time and how different ways of life have
come under pressure. Using fictional and historical
texts, students consider definitions of nature from
different historical, literary, cultural, and scientific perspectives and examine how these conceptions of
nature impact the way we think of what it means to live sustainably.
AP Seminar: Networks
Students examine and consider how ecological,
revolutionary, digital, and social networks are used to
understand the natural world, historical change, and
social lives. Students will consider networks from the
perspectives of a biologist, a computer scientist, a historian and a social scientist.
DISCUSSION TECHNIQUES
Discussion is an essential instructional method in the AP Seminar course because it helps students identify and
understand multiple perspectives and deepen their own understanding of the topics being studied. Effective discussion
goes beyond summary and comprehension in that it requires students to actively grapple with others’ ideas as they
formulate their own perspectives on an issue. Some discussion strategies are listed in the following table.
Strategy
Purpose
Definition
Socratic Seminar
To help students arrive at a new understanding by asking questions that clarify; challenge assumptions; probe perspective and point of view; question facts, reasons, and evidence; or examine implications and outcomes.
A focused discussion in which students engage
with open-ended questions tied to a specific topic or text. The discussion continues with student responses and, when needed, additional open ended questions that allow students to express their ideas and engage in complex thinking.
Debate
To provide students with an opportunity to collect and orally present evidence supporting the affirmative and negative arguments of a proposition or issue.
The presentation of an informal or formal argumentation that defends a claim with reasons,
while others defend different claims about the same
topic or issue. The goal is to debate ideas without attacking the people who defend those ideas.
Jigsaw
To have students summarize and present information to others in a way that facilitates an understanding of a text (or multiple texts) or issue without having each student read the text in its entirety;
by teaching others, they become experts.
Each student in a group reads a different text or
different passage from a single text, taking on the role of “expert” on what was read. Students share
the information from that reading with students from
other groups and then return to their original groups to share their new knowledge.

Strategy
Purpose
Definition
Fishbowl
To provide students with an opportunity to engage in a formal discussion and to experience the roles of both participant and active listener; students also have the responsibility of supporting their opinions and responses using specific evidence.
Some students form an inner circle and model appropriate discussion techniques while an outer
circle of students listens, responds, and evaluates.
Shared Inquiry
To allow a teacher to lead a deep discussion of a text and encourage a diversity of ideas to emerge as students think deeply and share interpretations.
Students read a provocative text and are asked
interpretative questions (questions for which there are no predetermined “right” answers). Students offer different answers and debate one another, supporting their positions with specific evidence from the text.
Discussion Group
To allow students to gain new understanding of or insight into a text or issue by listening to multiple perspectives.
Students engage in an interactive, small-group discussion, often with an assigned role (e.g.,
questioner, summarizer, facilitator, evidence keeper) to consider a topic, text, question, etc.
Debriefing
To solidify and deepen student understanding.
A facilitating discussion that leads to consensus understanding or helps students identify the key conclusions or takeaways.
Teaching the Skills
The focus of AP Seminar is on skill development: students practice, refine, and master the skills critical for academic
success. The curriculum framework identifies the learning objectives and essential knowledge that address the
core skills listed below in more detail. As teachers create instructional units, they should carefully plan so that skills
are developmentally sequenced and appropriate scaffolding is provided. The table below illustrates representative
instructional strategies that may be used to help students develop these core skills.

Instructional Strategies
Critical Reading
The strategic process of discovering ideas and information in a text.
Critical reading strategies include:
› › contextualizing › › questioning assumptions › › identifying bias and implications › › making inferences › › making connections
Close reading: Carefully reading, rereading, marking, and annotating a passage — word by word, line by line, and sentence by sentence.
Marking the text: Selecting text by highlighting, underlining, and/or annotating for specific components, such as main idea, assumptions, evidence, etc.
Summarizing, paraphrasing, retelling:
Restating, in the student’s own words, essential information expressed in a text.
Using metacognitive markers: Responding to a text with a system of cueing marks such as a question mark for questions, an exclamation point for reactions, an asterisk for comments about the text, and underlining to signal key ideas.
Previewing: Examining a text’s structure, features, layout, etc. prior to reading.
Questioning the text: Developing questions about a text while reading it.
Using a Think-aloud: Talking through a difficult text or task by using a form of metacognition whereby the student expresses how he or she has made sense of the text or task.
Chunking the text: Breaking a text into smaller, more manageable units of sense (e.g., words, sentences, paragraphs) by numbering, separating phrases, drawing boxes, etc.
Inquiry and Research
The process of discovering new understandings or ideas.
Inquiry and research strategies include:
› › identifying a problem or issue › › determining the best strategy to address the problem or issue › › gathering evidence › › drawing and supporting a conclusion
I-Search paper: A personal research paper about a topic that is important to the student.
Usually less formal than a traditional research paper, an I-Search paper tells the story of the writer’s personal search for information, as well as what the writer learned about the topic.
Service learning: Linking classroom-based contexts with field-based “experiential learning” within the community. Students gain direct experience of issues they are studying in the curriculum and ongoing efforts to analyze and address problems in the community. Students are given an opportunity to apply what they are learning in real-world settings and to reflect in a classroom setting on their service experiences.

WebQuest: An inquiry-oriented lesson format in which most or all of the information that learners work with comes from the Web.
Source mining: Reviewing the bibliographies of research studies or articles on a topic to see which names or works are referenced repeatedly to get an overview of key scholars or sources in the field.
Annotated bibliography: A bibliography that includes a brief summary of each source and a commentary about its usefulness to the inquiry along with the source’s citation.
Question formulation technique: The teacher provides a stimulus from which students openly brainstorm questions; students then categorize the questions as either open ended or closed-ended, work on improving them, prioritize them, use them, and reflect on their use.
Argumentation
The process of making a claim and developing a line of reasoning supported by evidence.
Critical components of argumentation
include:
› › thesis or question development › › developing a line of reasoning › › making claims › › selecting evidence and attributing its use › › providing commentary › › considering other perspectives › › drawing a conclusion › › attention to grammar, usage, and mechanics

Communicating
The process of conveying a clear message in a way that engages and appeals to a specific audience.
Techniques that may be used to emphasize ideas and engage an audience
include:
› › eye contact › › vocal variety (tempo, inflection) › › emphatic gestures › › movement › › appropriate visuals
Peer review: Students provide structured review of each other’s presentations according to a set of established criteria or guidelines (e.g., comments must not be personal; comments must be constructive with suggestions for improvement).
Videotaping for self-evaluation and
reflection: Individual students review recordings of their own presentations with guided reflection questions focusing on specific techniques.
Practice modeling: The teacher models for the class presentation techniques for emphasizing ideas and engaging an audience (eye contact, gestures, use of voice, etc.). Students then practice using those techniques and gain feedback from their peers.
Collaboration
The process of working with others to accomplish a shared task or goal or solve a problem.
Strategies for collaboration include:
› › individual role and contribution › › consensus building › › conflict resolution
Teambuilding activities: Warm-up activities in which group members work together to solve a small puzzle or problem, building or strengthening relationships and rapport before engaging in the main task.
Collective determination of group norms:
Students discuss in small groups what they think should be the group norms (the rules that define acceptable and unacceptable behavior within groups). They then engage in an all-class discussion on the various rules proposed and come to a consensus as to the final set of rules to be implemented for all groups. This process allows students to have an active role in designing course policies as well as establish a safe space for collaboration and communication, which may help to increase buy-in.
Assigning roles: Assigning roles (e.g., facilitator, timekeeper, recorder, presenter) to individual group members for a particular topic or investigation and then switching the roles so that students get to experience as many as possible.

AP Capstone™ Policy on Plagiarism and Falsification or Fabrication of Information
Participating teachers shall inform students of the consequences of plagiarism and instruct students to ethically
use and acknowledge the ideas and work of others throughout their course work. The student’s individual voice
should be clearly evident, and the ideas of others must be acknowledged, attributed, and/or cited.
A student who fails to acknowledge the source or author of any and all information or evidence taken from the work
of someone else through citation, attribution or reference in the body of the work, or through a bibliographic entry,
will receive a score of 0 on that particular component of the AP Seminar and/or AP Research Performance Task.
In AP Seminar, a team of students that fails to properly acknowledge sources or authors on the Team Multimedia
Presentation will receive a group score of 0 for that component of the Team Project and Presentation.
A student who incorporates falsified or fabricated information (e.g. evidence, data, sources, and/or authors) will
receive a score of 0 on that particular component of the AP Seminar and/or AP Research Performance Task.
In AP Seminar, a team of students that incorporates falsified or fabricated information in the Team Multimedia
Presentation will receive a group score of 0 for that component of the Team Project and Presentation.
Bridging from the AP Seminar Course to the AP Research Course
To prepare AP Seminar students to enter AP Research, the next course in the AP Capstone program, teachers
should provide students with a preview of the skills, goals, and timelines of the AP Research course and how it builds
upon yet differs from AP Seminar. In AP Research, students further the skills they acquired in AP Seminar by learning
research methodology, employing ethical research practices, and generating, analyzing, and synthesizing evidence to come to a new understanding.
Upon completion of the AP Seminar End-of-Course Exam, students who will continue on to the AP Research course may also be given the opportunity to:
§§ Consider potential topics and questions to spark their interest in engaging in an individual research project
§§ Research potential expert advisers to guide them in the planning and development of their project
§§ Engage in summer experiences that provide exposure to their research interests
In schools that permit students to begin the AP Research course in the summer, the AP Seminar and AP Research
course instructors should provide AP Research students with additional instruction, assignments, and avenues for
continued communication to guide them through the research planning process during the summer months.

TASK GUIDELINES
In this project, three to five students collaborate as a team to identify a problem or issue (e.g., local, national, global,
academic/theoretical/philosophical). Each team develops a team research question and conducts preliminary
research. They identify approaches, perspectives, or lenses and divide responsibilities among themselves for
individual research that will address the team’s research question.
The Individual Research Report
Individually, students investigate their assigned approach, perspectives, or lens on the issue or topic of the team
research question. Each student presents his or her findings and analysis to the group in a well-written individual
report that:
§§ identifies the area of investigation and its relationship to the overall problem or issue;
§§ summarizes, explains, analyzes, and evaluates the main ideas and reasoning in the chosen sources;
§§ identifies, compares, and interprets a range of perspectives about the problem or issue; and
§§ cites all sources used and includes a list of works cited or bibliography.
Students must avoid plagiarism by acknowledging, attributing, and/or citing sources throughout the paper and
including a bibliography or works cited (see the AP Capstone Policy on Plagiarism and Falsification or Fabrication of Information).
Note: Students and teachers should check work for plagiarism prior to final submission.
The Team Multimedia Presentation
Working collaboratively, the team considers all of the research and analyses from individual team members for the
purpose of proposing one or more solutions or resolutions. The team:
§§ collaboratively synthesizes and evaluates individual findings and perspectives to create a collective
understanding of different approaches to the problem or issue;
§§ considers potential solutions or resolutions and conducts additional research in order to evaluate different solutions within the context of the problem; and
§§ proposes one or more solutions or resolutions and prepares an argument to support their proposal.
The team develops an 8–10 minute presentation that presents a convincing argument for their proposed solutions
or resolutions. The team should ensure the claims made are supported by evidence which should be attributed
or cited (orally or visually). They should ensure they have considered different perspectives and the limitations
and implications of their proposed solutions or resolutions. The presentation and the media used to enhance the
presentation should consider audience, context, and purpose.
The exact size and composition of the audience for the presentation can be determined by teachers locally;
usually this is an audience of students’ peers. Students should design their presentations to be appropriate for an educated, non-expert audience.
Note: Teachers should collect presentation media from all teams in the school’s AP Seminar course(s) before any
team actually delivers the oral presentation. Teachers must also arrange to video record the presentations/oral
defenses and store the recordings for one academic year.
Following the presentation, the team will defend its argument, with each student responding to a question posed by the teacher.

The Oral Defense
Following the presentation, teachers should ask one question of each individual student. The questions are designed
to prompt student reflection on their experiences with group collaboration. Each team member should be prepared
to answer questions about any part of the presentation. It is important that teachers ask students questions that
allow them to provide specific evidence of their collaboration (for example, asking one student about another team
member’s research). Teachers may select questions from the following list or formulate more specific questions
appropriate to a team’s presentation, as long as the questions posed address this criterion. Teachers may also ask
follow-up clarifying questions to allow students the opportunity to fully explain their answers.
Here are some examples of the types of questions you should ask each individual student. These are examples only;
you may ask different questions.
1.	Student A, how did the group decide to include Student B’s perspective/lens/conclusions into the overall presentation?
2.	Student A, give one specific way that your thinking changed as a result of learning about Student B’s findings.
3.	Reflecting on your colleagues’ work, which one had the greatest impact on your overall understanding of the problem your group identified?
4.	What is an example of a compelling argument from one of your peer’s individual reports that you decided to exclude from your team presentation and why?
5.	What is a way in which your team’s resolution makes you think differently about your own individual research?
6.	Describe an argument from one of your peer’s individual reports that made you think differently about your team’s solution or conclusion?
7.	If you had another team member, what other perspectives or limitations could they have researched that would have made a useful contribution to the project?

Role of the Teacher in Performance Tasks
Performance Tasks in the AP Capstone courses are summative assessments and contribute to the AP score.
Submissions must be entirely the student’s own work.
Teachers (and other staff) must adhere to the following rules when students are working on these tasks. Teachers
of the AP Capstone courses manage the assessment components and all related processes. Teachers should be
transparent with students about the role of the teacher, other staff, and/or expert advisers in these courses and
what individuals providing guidance to students should and should not do.
AP Seminar: Role of the Teacher
DO
DO NOT
Make sure students are aware of the timeline, assessment task components, and scoring criteria/rubrics.
Assign, provide, distribute, or generate research questions for students.
Hold work-in-progress meetings with students to ask
questions, monitor, discuss, and provide guidance on progress.
Direct the students to the areas of the rubrics where their work may need improvement.
Write, revise, amend, or correct anything that is part of, or
contributes to, the final work submitted for assessment.
Engage in whole class teaching of skills pertinent to
the performance tasks as students are working on their research and/or presentations.
Provide specific, directive feedback to individuals or
groups (teachers must not tell students what to do).
Suggest possible resources that can help students further
their research (e.g., additional data bases, local expert
advisers, library assistance) – so that students are not disadvantaged in their exploration.
Conduct research or provide specific sources, articles or evidence for students.
Provide effective guidelines for peer-to-peer review and feedback.
Co-ordinate opportunities for students to engage in peer review.
Proofread or copyedit work for students.

AP Seminar Performance Task 2: Individual Research-Based
Essay and Presentation
Note: Detailed instructions for students are provided as a handout at the end of this CED (see the section
"Reproducibles for Students") and will be published along with the stimulus materials each year.
Weight: 35% of the AP Seminar score
Recommended Completion Date: April 15
Submission Deadline: April 30, 11:59 PM ET
Note: Students must be given at least 30 school days (state testing, spring breaks, holidays, etc. would not count
toward those days) to complete their research, compose their essays, and develop their presentations. The actual
presentations must take place outside the 30-day window. The task is complex and rigorous, so students must
be given sufficient time to complete it. Teachers would disadvantage students by giving them less time. Giving
more time could also disadvantage students by reducing the time available for completing the Team Project and
Presentation. Teachers should collect written work and presentation media from every student in the school’s
AP Seminar course(s) before any student actually delivers the oral presentation. Teachers must carefully plan a
calendar that provides time for all the tasks to be completed, scored, and uploaded by April 30 at 11:59 PM ET.
For Performance Task 2, by April 30, 11:59 PM ET, teachers must:
§§ ensure each student has submitted their Individual Written Argument (IWA) as final in the AP Digital Portfolio
§§ submit scores for the Individual Multimedia Presentation (IMP) and Oral Defense (OD) in the AP Digital Portfolio
TASK OVERVIEW
College Board’s AP Program will annually release cross-curricular stimulus material (texts) representing a range of
perspectives focused on a single theme. Students read and analyze these stimulus materials to identify thematic
connections among them and possible areas for inquiry. Their inquiry must be based on a thematic connection
between at least two of the stimulus materials. Students then compose a research question of their own; conduct
research; analyze, evaluate, and select evidence to develop an argument; and present and defend their conclusions.
The final paper must integrate at least one of the provided stimulus materials as part of the response.
CRITERIA FOR STIMULUS MATERIAL
In early January each year, College Board will release academic, cross-curricular stimulus material (texts) focused
on a theme representing a range of perspectives from each of the following domains:
§§ Natural Sciences, Technology, Mathematics, Environment
§§ Social Sciences, Politics, Economics, Psychology §§ Arts (Visual Arts, Music, Dance, Theater) §§ Culture, Languages, Linguistics §§ History
§§ Literature, Philosophy, Critical Theory/Criticism
The following will be represented in the texts:
§§ Multimedia text (e.g., photographs, artwork, video, music) §§ Quantitative data
Note: The inclusion of sources in this assessment is not intended as an endorsement by College Board or ETS of
the content, ideas, or values expressed by the authors.

Oral Defense (OD) (two questions from the teacher)
Teacher scored 10% of 35%
TASK GUIDELINES
Cross-curricular stimulus materials supplied by College Board are released to teachers in early January each year
through the AP Digital Portfolio. Teachers decide when to release these materials to students. Students must be
given at least 30 school days to complete their research, compose their essays, and develop their presentations.
Student presentations must be scheduled after the 30-day window.
Teachers should engage students with in-class activities to explore issues and discuss topics and
perspectives emerging from the stimulus materials. Students must address the current year’s stimulus material in their responses.
The Individual Written Argument
Students read and analyze the provided stimulus materials to identify thematic connections among them and
possible areas for inquiry. Their inquiry must be based on a thematic connection between at least two of the
stimulus materials. Students then compose a research question prompted by their analysis of the stimulus
materials; gather additional information through research; analyze, evaluate, and select evidence; and develop a
logical, well-reasoned argument of 2,000 words. The final paper must integrate at least one of the stimulus materials as part of the response.
Students must avoid plagiarism by acknowledging, attributing, and/or citing sources throughout the paper and
including a bibliography or works cited (see the AP Capstone Policy on Plagiarism and Falsification or Fabrication of Information).
Note: Students and teachers should check work for plagiarism prior to final submission.
The Individual Multimedia Presentation
Each student develops a 6- to 8-minute presentation to convey their perspective and present their conclusions
from their individual written argument. Students should use and attribute, either orally or visually, evidence to
support their claims and situate their perspective in a larger context, rather than merely summarizing their research.
The presentation and the media used to enhance the presentation should consider audience, context, and purpose.
The exact size and composition of the audience for the presentation can be determined by teachers locally;
usually this is an audience of students’ peers. Students should design their presentations to be appropriate for an educated, non-expert audience.
Note: Teachers should collect presentation media from all students in the school’s AP Seminar course(s) before
any individual student actually delivers the oral presentation. Teachers should also arrange to video record the
presentations/oral defenses and store the recordings for one academic year.
Finally, students defend their research process, use of evidence, and conclusion through oral responses to two questions asked by the teacher.

Following the presentation, teachers should ask two questions of the student. This component is designed to
assess the student’s response to and understanding of the two criteria below, and a question must be asked to
address each of them. Teachers may select questions from the list or formulate more specific questions appropriate
to a student’s presentation, as long as the questions posed address the two criteria below. Teachers may also ask
follow-up clarifying questions to allow students the opportunity to fully explain their answers.

Role of the Teacher in Performance Tasks
Performance Tasks in the AP Capstone courses are summative assessments and contribute to the AP score.
Submissions must be entirely the student’s own work.
Teachers (and other staff) must adhere to the following rules when students are working on these tasks. Teachers
of the AP Capstone courses manage the assessment components and all related processes. Teachers should be
transparent with students about the role of the teacher, other staff, and/or expert advisers in these courses and
what individuals providing guidance to students should and should not do.

DO NOT
Make sure students are aware of the timeline, assessment task components, and scoring criteria/rubrics.
Assign, provide, distribute, or generate research questions for students.
Hold work-in-progress meetings with students to ask
questions, monitor, discuss, and provide guidance on progress.
Direct the students to the areas of the rubrics where their work may need improvement.
Write, revise, amend, or correct anything that is part of, or
contributes to, the final work submitted for assessment.
Engage in whole class teaching of skills pertinent to
the performance tasks as students are working on their research and/or presentations.
Provide specific, directive feedback to individuals or
groups (teachers must not tell students what to do).
Suggest possible resources that can help students further
their research (e.g., additional data bases, local expert
advisers, library assistance) – so that students are not disadvantaged in their exploration.

AP Seminar End-of-Course Exam
Weight: 45% of the AP Seminar score (College Board scored)
Date: May (in the AP Exam administration window)
Note: The end-of-course exam will be administered by the AP Coordinator following the same procedures and guidelines as all other Advanced Placement Exams.
TASK OVERVIEW
During the AP Exam administration window, students will take the AP Seminar End-of-Course Exam. The
exam consists of four items (three short-answer and one essay question). The three short-answer questions
assess analysis of an argument in a single source or document. The essay question assesses students’ skills in
synthesizing and creating an evidence-based argument.
DESCRIPTION OF END-OF-COURSE EXAM
Five sources will be included with each end-of-course exam. Sources on the end-of-course exam will represent a
range of disciplines and perspectives. The four prompts listed in the table below will remain the same on the end-of course exam from year to year.
COMPONENTS
The following components are formally assessed:
Component
Scoring Method
Weight
Part A
Suggested time: 30 minutes
One source provided
Students are asked to analyze an argument using evidence.
1.	 Identify the author’s argument, main idea, or thesis.
2.	 Explain the author’s line of reasoning by identifying the claims used to
build the argument and the connections between them.
3.	 Evaluate the effectiveness of the evidence the author uses to support the claims made in the argument.
College Board scored 30% of 45%
Part B
Suggested time: 90 minutes
Four sources provided
Students are asked to build their own arguments using at least two of the
four provided sources. Each of the four sources will explore a common
theme through a different perspective, allowing multiple entry points for students to approach the topic.
Directions: Read the four sources carefully, focusing on a theme
or issue that connects them and the different perspective each
represents. Then, write a logically organized, well-reasoned, and well written argument that presents your own perspective on the theme or
issue you identified. You must incorporate at least two of the sources
provided and link the claims in your argument to supporting evidence.
You may also use the other provided sources or draw upon your
own knowledge. In your response, refer to the provided sources as
Source A, Source B, Source C, or Source D, or by the authors’ names.

THE COMPASSION OF KHOJ ÖZEERI
ONE MORNING in early fall Andrei
Mongush and his parents began preparations for supper, selecting a black and rolling it onto its back on a tarp
Mongush family’s home is on the
Siberian taiga, at the edge of the endless steppes, just over the horizon from Kyzyl, the capital of the Republic of Tuva, in the geographic center of Asia, but linguistically and personally, the family inhabits a borderland, the frontier between progress and tradition. Tuvans are historically nomadic herders, moving their aal—an encampment of yurts—and their sheep and cows and reindeer from pasture to pasture as the seasons in the city, speak both Tuvan and Russian. Andrei and his wife also speak

Andrei is a master of the most characteristic Tuvan music form: throat singing, or khöömei.
When I ask university students in Kyzyl what Tuvan words are untranslatable into English or Russian, they suggest khöömei, because the singing is so connected with the Tuvan environment that only a native can understand it, and also khoj özeeri, the Tuvan method of killing a sheep. If slaughtering livestock can be seen as part of humans’ closeness to animals, khoj özeeri represents an unusually intimate version. Reaching through an incision in the sheep’s hide, the slaughterer severs a vital artery to quickly slip away without alarm, so peacefully that one must check its eyes to see if it is dead. In the language of the Tuvan people, khoj özeeri means not only slaughter but also kindness, humaneness, a ceremony by which a family can kill, skin, and butcher a sheep, salting its hide and preparing its meat and making sausage with the saved blood and cleansed entrails so neatly that the whole thing can be accomplished in two hours (as the Mongushes did this morning) in one’s good clothes without spilling a drop of blood. Khoj özeeri implies a relationship to animals that is also a measure of a people’s character. As one of the students explained, “If a Tuvan killed an animal the way they do in other places”—by means of a gun or knife— “they’d be arrested for brutality.”
Tuvan is one of the many small languages of seven billion people speaks roughly 7,000 languages, a statistic that would healthy one million speakers, if things were equitable. In language, as in life, things aren’t. Seventy-eight percent 57 © 2020 College Board

Today any language with a television station and a currency is in a position to obliterate those without, and so residents of Tuva must speak Russian and Chinese if they hope to engage with the surrounding

Are there aspects of cultures that won’t survive if they are translated into a dominant language? What unexpected insights are being lost to the world with the collapse of its linguistic variety?
Fortunately, Tuvan is not among the world’s endangered languages, but it could have been. Since the breakup of the
Soviet Union, the language has stabilized.
It now has a well-equipped army—not a television station, yet, or a currency, but a newspaper and a respectable 264,000 total speakers (including some in Mongolia and China). Yet Tofa, a neighboring Siberian language, is down to some 30 speakers. Tuvan’s importance to our understanding of disappearing languages lies in another question linguists are struggling to answer: What makes one language succeed while another dwindles or dies?

THE RESPECT OF MUCROW

I WITNESSED the heartrending cost of broken languages among the Aka people in Palizi, a tiny, rustic hamlet perched on a mountainside in Arunachal Pradesh,
India’s rugged northeasternmost state. It palm and hardwood jungles on single track mountain roads. Its one main street is lined with unpainted board-faced houses set on stilts and roofed with thatch or metal. Villagers grow their own rice, yams, spinach, oranges, and ginger;

Speaking Aka—or any language—means immersing oneself in its character and concepts. “I’m seeing the world through the looking glass of this language,” said Father Vijay D’Souza, who was running the Jesuit school in Palizi at the established the school in part because it was concerned about the fragility of the Aka language and culture and wanted to support them (though classes are taught in English). D’Souza is from southern India, and his native language is
Konkani. When he came to Palizi in 1999 and began speaking Aka, the language transformed him.
“It alters your thinking, your worldview,” he told me one day in his headmaster’s through the corridor outside. One small
example: mucrow. A similar word in D’Souza’s native language would be an insult, meaning “old man.” In Aka “mucrow” means something more. It is a term of respect, deference, endearment.

Arunachal Pradesh has long been border region. Even other Indians are not allowed to cross into the region without federal permission, and so its fragile microcultures have been spared the intrusion of immigrant labor, modernization—and linguists.
It has been described as a black hole of linguistics because its incredible language variety remains so little explored.
Much of public life in Palizi is regulated through the repetition of mythological stories used as forceful fables to prescribe draw a recitation about a spirit whose daughters are eaten by a crocodile, one by one, as they cross the river to bring him and a priest promises to bring the last daughter back to life but overcharges so egregiously that the spirit seeks revenge by becoming a piece of ginger that gets stuck in the greedy priest’s throat.
Such stories were traditionally told by the elders in a highly formal version of Aka that the young did not yet understand and according to certain rules, among
them this: Once an elder begins telling a story, he cannot stop until the story disruption is disaster. Yet Aka’s young people no longer follow their elders in learning the formal version of the language and the stories that have governed daily life. Even in this remote region, young people are seduced away from their mother tongue by Hindi on the television and English in the schools.
Today Aka’s speakers number fewer than 2,000, few enough to put it on the endangered list.

of human experience, revealing as mutable aspects of life that we tend to think of as settled and universal, such as our experience of time, number, or color.
In Tuva, for example, the past is always spoken of as ahead of one, and the future is behind one’s back. “We could never say,
I’m looking forward to doing something,” a Tuvan told me. Indeed, he might say, “I’m looking forward to the day before yesterday.” It makes total sense if you think of it in a Tuvan sort of way: If the future were ahead of you, wouldn’t it be in plain view?

If Aka, or any language, is supplanted by a new one that’s bigger and more universally useful, its death shakes the foundations of the tribe. “Aka is our identity,” a villager told me one day as we walked from Palizi down the path that the river. “Without it, we are the general public.” But should the rest of the world an easy one to frame in Aka, which seems to lack a single term for world.

The Secret Life of Plants
From New Scientist, March 26, 2011
By Ferris Jabr
EVERY autumn swarms of dusty grey moths engulf the mountainside birch forests of northern
Scandinavia, laying their eggs on twigs so that, come springtime, the newly hatched larvae can feast
upon budding leaves. It looks like a battle that the trees, with no natural defences, are doomed to lose, but
some have a secret weapon. They form an alliance with a neighbouring plant, a kind of rhododendron,
borrowing wafts of its volatile insecticides as a sort of olfactory camouflage. “This kind of interaction has
never been observed in the field before,” says Jarmo Holopainen at the University of Eastern Finland
in Kuopio, who made the discovery (New Phytologist, vol 186, p 722). His study is one of the latest to
demonstrate the unexpectedly complex relationships between plants.
We’ve known for some time that plants respond to one another, but only now are we realising how subtle
and sophisticated their interactions can be. Plants continually eavesdrop on each other’s chemical chatter
— sometimes sympathetically, sometimes selfishly. Some plants, like the Scandinavian rhododendron,
assist their neighbours by sharing resources. Others recognise close relatives and favour them over
strangers. And at least one parasitic plant homes in on its host’s telltale chemical scent (see “Scent of a victim”, page [59]).
“Plants don’t go out to parties or to watch the movies, but they do have a social network,” says Suzanne
Simard, a forest ecologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. “They support
each other and they fight with each other. The more we look at plant signalling and communication, the more we learn. It’s really incredible.”
Since the development of time-lapse photography, it has been possible to document the dances and
scuffles in densely populated plant communities: saplings on the forest floor compete for space to stretch
their roots and shoots; fallen trees provide young ones with nourishment; vines lash around desperately
searching for a trunk they can climb to reach the light; and wildflowers race each other to open their
blooms in springtime and compete for the attention of pollinators. To truly understand the secret social
life of plants, however, you must look and listen more closely.
A good place to start is underground in the rhizosphere — the ecosystem in and around plant roots.
Beneath the forest floor, each spoonful of dirt contains millions of tiny organisms. These bacteria and
fungi form a symbiotic relationship with plant roots, helping their hosts absorb water and vital elements
like nitrogen in return for a steady supply of nutrients.
Now closer inspection has revealed that fungal threads physically unite the roots of dozens of trees,
often of different species, into a single mycorrhizal network. These webs sprawled beneath our feet
are genuine social networks. By tracing the movement of radioactive carbon isotopes through them,
Simard has found that water and nutrients tend to flow from trees that make excess food to ones that
don’t have enough. One study published in 2009, for example, showed that older Douglas firs transferred
molecules containing carbon and nitrogen to saplings of the same species via their mycorrhizal networks.
The saplings with the greatest access to these networks were the healthiest (Ecology, vol 90, p 2808).
As well as sharing food, mycorrhizal associations may also allow plants to share information. Biologists
have known for a while that plants can respond to airborne defence signals from others that are under
attack. When a caterpillar starts to munch on a tomato plant, for example, the leaves produce noxious
compounds that both repel the attacker and stimulate neighbouring plants to ready their own defences.
Yuan Yuan Song of South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou and colleagues investigated
whether similar chemical alarm calls travel underground. They exposed one group of tomato plants to a
pathogenic fungus and monitored the response in a second group connected to the first via a mycorrhizal
network. The diseased plants were sealed inside airtight plastic bags to prevent any communication
above ground. Nevertheless, the healthy partners began producing defence chemicals, suggesting that
the plants detect each other’s alarm calls via their mycorrhizal networks (PLoS One, vol 5, p e13324).

Another recent discovery, one which may be connected with Song’s finding, is that some plants recognise
members of their own species and apparently work together for the common good. Amanda Broz of
Colorado State University in Fort Collins paired spotted knotweed plants inside a greenhouse either
with other knotweeds or with blue bunchgrass. She then simulated an attack by spraying them with
methyl jasmonate, a chemical many plants release when wounded. The knotweed’s response depended
on its neighbours. When growing near members of its own species, it produced leaf toxins to boost its
defences. But it chose to focus on leaf and stem growth when its neighbours were bunchgrass (BMC
Plant Biology, vol 10, p 115).
Such discrimination makes sense because, in the knotweed’s native environment, dense clusters of
a single plant tend to attract large numbers of insects to an all-you-can-eat buffet. So cooperating with
other knotweed plants helps stave off an attack. However, when knotweed is surrounded by bunchgrass,
a better strategy is to leave defence to its neighbours and concentrate on aggressive growth — which
might also help explain why knotweed is such an effective invasive species.
Broz’s research was published just last year, and it remains unclear how knotweed, or any other plant,
could be recognising members of its own species. However, one instance of a plant with family values has been more thoroughly explored.
In a landmark paper published in 2007, Susan Dudley from McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, reported
the first case of plants recognising and favouring their kin (Biology Letters, vol 3, p 435). Her studies of
American sea rocket, a scraggly weed that grows along the shorelines of the Great Lakes, showed that a
plant potted with an unrelated individual did not hesitate to spread its roots and soak up as much water and
nutrients as it could. However, when Dudley planted sea-rocket siblings in the same pot, they exercised
restraint, taming their eager roots to better share resources. Siblings and strangers that grew near each other
but did not share pots showed no differences in root growth, indicating that sea rocket relies on underground
chemical signalling to identify its kin. They don’t seem to be using mycorrhizal networks, though.
In subsequent research with Meredith Biedrzycki from the University of Delaware in Newark, Dudley
discovered that the signals take the form of “exudates” — a cocktail of soluble compounds including
phenols, flavonoids, sugars, organic acids, amino acids and proteins, secreted by roots into the
rhizosphere. How these indicate relatedness is still a mystery, though (Communicative & Integrative
Biology, vol 3, p 28).
In the past few years, kin recognition has been discovered in other plants, including the botanical “lab
rat” Arabidopsis and a kind of Impatiens called pale jewelweed. This has led some botanists to argue
that plants, like animals, are capable of kin selection — behaviours and strategies that help relatives
reproduce. Kin selection has an evolutionary rationale because it increases the chances that the genes
an individual shares with its relatives will be passed to the next generation, even if altruistic behaviour
comes at a cost to one’s own well-being. “There’s no reason to think plants wouldn’t get the same benefits from kin selection that animals do,” says Dudley.
Recognising siblings and restraining one’s growth in response certainly looks like kin selection, but that
still leaves the question of whether such interactions also improve the survival prospects of related plants.
Research by Richard Karban at the University of California, Davis, goes some way to answering that.
Karban studied a desert shrub called sagebrush, which emits a pungent bouquet of chemicals to deter
insects. When he clipped an individual plant’s leaves to simulate an attack, he found that it mounted a
more robust defence if it was growing next to its own clone than if its neighbour was unrelated. What’s
more, for a period of five months afterwards, the neighbouring clones suffered far less damage from
caterpillars, grasshoppers and deer than did unrelated neighbours (Ecology Letters, vol 12, p 502).
Studying kin selection and other plant interactions doesn’t just improve our knowledge of basic plant
biology and ecology. “There are a lot of people really interested in it, because it’s not just an intellectually
neat puzzle,” says James Cahill at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. “There are many
potential applications, especially for agriculture.”
One obvious area is in companion planting — the strategic positioning of different crops or garden plants
so they benefit one another by deterring pests, attracting pollinators and improving nutrient uptake. This
ancient technique, which traditionally relies on trial and error and close observation, can be highly effective.
For example, beans fix nitrogen that boosts growth in some other plants, and when Europeans arrived
in America in the 15th century, they discovered that Native Americans used corn as a natural trellis for 100 © 2020 College Board

bean plants. Our modern understanding of plant interactions suggests we could find new, more subtle
and potentially beneficial relationships, which could help us overcome a major drawback of modern
monoculture farming. Since a single pathogen can wipe out an entire crop of genetically similar — and
therefore equally vulnerable — plants, farmers make heavy use of pesticides. But instead of picturing
an endless stretch of corn or wheat, imagine something more like a jungle of diverse species that work together above and below ground.
Breeding cooperation
Cahill has another idea. “Fertilisers aren’t always spread evenly,” he says. “Maybe we could breed plants to
cooperate more effectively with their neighbours to share fertiliser.” Meanwhile, Simard thinks the recent
discoveries about mycorrhizal networks have implications for both agriculture and forestry. Hardy old trees
should not be removed from forests so hastily, she says, because saplings depend on the mycorrhizal
associations maintained by these grandparent trees. She also suggests that farmers should go easy on
fertilisation and irrigation because these practices can damage or destroy delicate mycorrhizal networks.
Clearly, we do not yet have all the information we need to start deploying such tactics. “What we want
to do next is develop more advanced techniques to watch roots grow, to really see what they do with
each other and how they interact in space,” Dudley says. She also wants to figure out what genetic
factors control plant interactions and look at how they change survival and reproduction. “The molecular
aspects are perhaps the most challenging,” she adds, “but we have made some big leaps.”
The idea that plants have complex relationships may require a shift in mindset. “For the longest time
people thought that plants were just there,” says Biedrzycki. “But they can defend themselves more than
we thought and they can create the environment around them. It turns out they have some control over
what is going on through this chemical communication.” Passive and silent though plants may seem,
their abilities to interact and communicate should not come as such a shock. “Some incredibly simple
organisms — even one-celled organisms — can recognise and respond to each other,” says Broz. “Why
is it so bizarre to think that plants could have this same kind of ability?”
Scent of a Victim
Many of the social interactions of plants seem to involve a form of sharing or cooperation mediated by
chemical signals. However, some chemical communication is far from benevolent, as research on a parasitic vine called dodder has found.
Dodder contains almost no chlorophyll — the green molecule that allows plants to produce sugars from
sunlight, water and carbon dioxide. Instead, after sprouting as a leafless tendril, it searches for a victim
into which it sinks its nozzles and sucks out the sugary sap. “We knew how it creates nozzles and gets
resources from the host, but nobody knew how dodder found its host,” says Consuelo De Moraes at
Pennsylvania State University at University Park.
Some plants identify neighbours by sensing sunlight refracted off their leaves, but time-lapse video
suggests that dodder uses a different technique. The footage shows that when the tendril searches for a
host it twirls about like a snake tasting the air. Could it be searching for a chemical, wondered De Moraes?
To test this idea, she and her colleagues hid a variety of plants around a corner from a dodder tendril. If
the vine were really using chemical sensing to find its victims, it should be able to home in on its hosts
using the volatile chemicals they naturally produce.
That is exactly what they found. In fact, dodder even showed dietary preferences based on the different
airborne chemicals, almost always choosing succulent tomatoes over twiggy wheat, and favouring
healthy hosts by avoiding the chemicals given off by damaged plants (Science, vol 313, p 1964). “Not
only does dodder use chemical cues to find a host,” says De Moraes, “it can distinguish between hosts
of different qualities. It knows which plants are healthier and goes after them.”

Dear James:
I have begun this letter five times and torn it up five times. I keep seeing your face, which is also the
face of your father and my brother. I have known both of you all your lives and have carried your
daddy in my arms and on my shoulders, kissed him and spanked him and watched him learn to
walk. I don’t know if you have known anybody from that far back, if you have loved anybody that
long, first as an infant, then as a child, then as a man. You gain a strange perspective on time and human pain and effort.
Other people cannot see what I see whenever I look into your father’s face, for behind your father’s
face as it is today are all those other faces which were his. Let him laugh and I see a cellar your
father does not remember and a house he does not remember and I hear in his present laughter his
laughter as a child. Let him curse and I remember his falling down the cellar steps and howling
and I remember with pain his tears which my hand or your grandmother’s hand so easily wiped
away, but no one’s hand can wipe away those tears he sheds invisibly today which one hears in his laughter and in his speech and in his songs.
I know what the world has done to my brother and how narrowly he has survived it and I know,
which is much worse, and this is the crime of which I accuse my country and my countrymen and
for which neither I nor time nor history will ever forgive them, that they have destroyed and are
destroying hundreds of thousands of lives and do not know it and do not want to know it. One can
be--indeed, one must strive to become--tough and philosophical concerning destruction and death,
for this is what most of mankind has been best at since we have heard of war; remember, I said most
of mankind, but it is not permissible that the authors of devastation should also be innocent. It is the innocence which constitutes the crime.
Now, my dear namesake, these innocent and well meaning people, your countrymen, have caused
you to be born under conditions not far removed from those described for us by Charles Dickens in
the London of more than a hundred years ago. I hear the chorus of the innocents screaming, “No,
this is not true. How bitter you are,” but I am writing this letter to you to try to tell you something
about how to handle them, for most of them do not yet really know that you exist. I know the
conditions under which you were born for I was there. Your countrymen were not there and haven’t
made it yet. Your grandmother was also there and no one has ever accused her of being bitter. I
suggest that the innocent check with her. She isn’t hard to find. Your countrymen don’t know that
she exists either, though she has been working for them all their lives.
Well, you were born; here you came, something like fifteen years ago, and though your father and
mother and grandmother, looking about the streets through which they were carrying you, staring
at the walls into which they brought you, had every reason to be heavy-hearted, yet they were not,
for here you were, big James, named for me. You were a big baby. I was not. Here you were to be
loved. To be loved, baby, hard at once and forever to strengthen you against the loveless world.
Remember that. I know how black it looks today for you. It looked black that day too. Yes, we were
trembling. We have not stopped trembling yet, but if we had not loved each other, none of us would
have survived, and now you must survive because we love you and for the sake of your children and your children’s children.
***
This innocent country set you down in a ghetto in which, in fact, it intended that you should perish.
Let me spell out precisely what I mean by that for the heart of the matter is here and the crux of my
dispute with my country. You were born where you were born and faced the future that you faced
because you were black and for no other reason. The limits to your ambition were thus expected to
be settled. You were born into a society which spelled out with brutal clarity and in as many ways as
possible that you were a worthless human being. You were not expected to aspire to excellence. You 103 © 2020 College Board

were expected to make peace with mediocrity. Wherever you have turned, James, in your short time
on this earth, you have been told where you could go and what you could do and how you could do
it, where you could live and whom you could marry.
I know your countrymen do not agree with me here and I hear them saying, “You exaggerate.” They
do not know Harlem and I do. So do you. Take no one’s word for anything, including mine, but trust
your experience. Know whence you came. If you know whence you came, there is really no limit to
where you can go. The details and symbols of your life have been deliberately constructed to make
you believe what white people say about you. Please try to remember that what they believe, as well
as what they do and cause you to endure, does not testify to your inferiority, but to their inhumanity and fear.
Please try to be clear, dear James, through the storm which rages about your youthful head today,
about the reality which lies behind the words “acceptance” and “integration.” There is no reason for
you to try to become like white men and there is no basis whatever for their impertinent assumption
that they must accept you. The really terrible thing, old buddy, is that you must accept them, and
I mean that very seriously. You must accept them and accept them with love, for these innocent
people have no other hope. They are in effect still trapped in a history which they do not understand
and until they understand it, they cannot be released from it. They have had to believe for many
years, and for innumerable reasons, that black men are inferior to white men.
Many of them indeed know better, but as you will discover, people find it very difficult to act on
what they know. To act is to be committed and to be committed is to be in danger. In this case the
danger in the minds and hearts of most white Americans is the loss of their identity. Try to imagine
how you would feel if you woke up one morning to find the sun shivering and all the stars aflame.
You would be frightened because it is out of the order of nature. Any upheaval in the universe is
terrifying because it so profoundly attacks one’s sense of one’s own reality. Well, the black man has
functioned in the white man’s world as a fixed star, as an immovable pillar, and as he moves out of
his place, heaven and earth are shaken to their foundations.
You don’t be afraid. I said it was intended that you should perish, in the ghetto, perish by never
being allowed to go beyond and behind the white man’s definition, by never being allowed to spell
your proper name. You have, and many of us have, defeated this intention and by a terrible law, a
terrible paradox, those innocents who believed that your imprisonment made them safe are losing
their grasp of reality. But these men are your brothers, your lost younger brothers, and if the word
“integration” means anything, this is what it means, that we with love shall force our brothers to see
themselves as they are, to cease fleeing from reality and begin to change it, for this is your home,
my friend. Do not be driven from it. Great men have done great things here and will again and we can make America what America must become.
It will be hard, James, but you come from sturdy peasant stock, men who picked cotton, dammed
rivers, built railroads, and in the teeth of the most terrifying odds, achieved an unassailable and
monumental dignity. You come from a long line of great poets, some of the greatest poets since
Homer. One of them said, “The very time I thought I was lost, my dungeon shook and my chains fell off.”
You know and I know that the country is celebrating one hundred years of freedom one hundred
years too early. We cannot be free until they are free. God bless you, James, and Godspeed.
Your uncle,
JAMES 104 © 2020 College Board

The Struggle to Govern the Commons
Thomas Dietz,1 Elinor Ostrom,2 Paul C. Stern3*
Human institutions—ways of organizing activities—affect the resilience of the environ ment. Locally evolved institutional arrangements governed by stable communities and
buffered from outside forces have sustained resources successfully for centuries, al though they often fail when rapid change occurs. Ideal conditions for governance are
increasingly rare. Critical problems, such as transboundary pollution, tropical deforesta tion, and climate change, are at larger scales and involve nonlocal inﬂuences. Promising
strategies for addressing these problems include dialogue among interested parties,
ofﬁcials, and scientists; complex, redundant, and layered institutions; a mix of institu tional types; and designs that facilitate experimentation, learning, and change.
In 1968, Hardin (1) drew attention to two human factors that drive environmental change. The first factor is the increasing de mand for natural resources and environmen tal services, stemming from growth in human population and per capita resource consump tion. The second factor is the way in which humans organize themselves to extract re sources from the environment and eject efflu ents into it—what social scientists refer to as institutional arrangements. Hardin’s work has been highly influential (2) but has long been aptly criticized as oversimplified (3–6).
Hardin’s oversimplification was twofold:
He claimed that only two state-established in stitutional arrangements—centralized govern ment and private property—could sustain com mons over the long run, and he presumed that resource users were trapped in a commons di lemma, unable to create solutions (7–9). He missed the point that many social groups, in cluding the herders on the commons that pro vided the metaphor for his analysis, have strug gled successfully against threats of resource degradation by developing and maintaining self-governing institutions (3, 10–13). Although these institutions have not always succeeded, neither have Hardin’s preferred alternatives of private or state ownership.
In the absence of effective governance institutions at the appropriate scale, natural resources and the environment are in peril from increasing human population, consump tion, and deployment of advanced technolo gies for resource use, all of which have reached unprecedented levels. For example, it is estimated that “the global ocean has lost more than 90% of large predatory fishes” with an 80% decline typically occurring “within 15 years of industrialized exploita tion” (14). The threat of massive ecosystem degradation results from an interplay among ocean ecologies, fishing technologies, and inadequate governance.
Inshore fisheries are similarly degraded where they are open access or governed by top-down national regimes, leaving local and regional officials and users with insufficient autonomy and understanding to design effec tive institutions (15, 16). For example, the degraded inshore ground fishery in Maine is governed by top-down rules based on models that were not credible among users. As a result, compliance has been relatively low and there has been strong resistance to strengthening existing restrictions. This is in marked contrast to the Maine lobster fishery, which has been governed by formal and in formal user institutions that have strongly influenced state-level rules that restrict fish ing. The result has been credible rules with very high levels of compliance (17–19). A comparison of the landings of ground fish and lobster since 1980 is shown in Fig. 1. The rules and high levels of compli ance related to lobster appear to have prevented the destruction of this fishery but probably are not responsible for the sharp rise in abundance and landings after 1986.
Resources at larger scales have also been successfully pro tected through appropriate inter national governance regimes such as the Montreal Protocol on stratospheric ozone and the Inter national Commission for the Pro tection of the Rhine Agreements (20–24). Figure 2 compares the trajectory of atmospheric concen trations of ozone-depleting sub stances (ODS) with that of carbon dioxide since 1982. The Montreal
Protocol, the centerpiece of the international agreements on ozone depletion, was signed in 1987. Before then, ODS concen trations were increasing faster than those of CO2;
the increases slowed by the early 1990s and the
concentration appears to have stabilized in recent years. The international treaty regime to reduce the anthropogenic impact on stratospheric ozone is widely considered an example of a successful
effort to protect the global commons. In contrast, international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations have not yet had an impact.
Knowledge from an emerging science of human-environment interactions, sometimes called human ecology or the “second envi ronmental science” (25, 26), is clarifying the
characteristics of institutions that facilitate or undermine sustainable use of environmental resources under particular conditions (6, 27).
The knowledge base is strongest with small scale ecologies and institutions, where long time series exist on many successes and fail ures. It is now developing for larger-scale systems. In this review, we address what science has learned about governing the com mons and why it is always a struggle (28).
Why a Struggle?
Devising ways to sustain the earth’s ability to support diverse life, including a reasonable quality of life for humans, involves making tough decisions under uncertainty, complex ity, and substantial biophysical constraints as well as conflicting human values and inter ests. Devising effective governance systems is akin to a coevolutionary race. A set of rules crafted to fit one set of socioecological con ditions can erode as social, economic, and 1Environmental Science and Policy Program and De partments of Sociology and Crop and Soil Sciences,

AP Capstone Program technological developments increase the po tential for human damage to ecosystems and even to the biosphere itself. Furthermore, hu mans devise ways of evading governance rules. Thus, successful commons governance requires that rules evolve.
Effective commons governance is easier to achieve when (i) the resources and use of the resources by humans can be monitored, and the information can be verified and understood at relatively low cost (e.g., trees are easier to monitor than fish, and lakes are easier to mon itor than rivers) (29); (ii) rates of change in resources, resource-user populations, technolo gy, and economic and social conditions are moderate (30–32); (iii) communities maintain frequent face-to-face communication and dense social networks—sometimes called social cap ital—that increase the potential for trust, allow people to express and see emotional reactions to distrust, and lower the cost of monitoring be havior and inducing rule compliance (33–36); (iv) outsiders can be excluded at relatively low cost from using the resource (new entrants add to the har vesting pressure and typically lack un derstanding of the rules); and (v) users support effective monitoring and rule enforcement (37–39). Few settings in the world are characterized by all of these conditions. The challenge is to devise institutional arrangements that help to establish such conditions or, as we dis cuss below, meet the main challenges of governance in the absence of ideal con ditions (6, 40, 41).
Selective Pressures
The characteristics of resources and so cial interaction in many subsistence so cieties present favorable conditions for the evolution of effective self-governing resource institutions (13). Hundreds of docu mented examples exist of long-term sustainable resource use in such communities as well as in more economically advanced communities with effective, local, self-governing rights, but there are also many failures (6, 11, 42–44). As human communities have expanded, the selec tive pressures on environmental governance in stitutions increasingly have come from broad influences. Commerce has become regional, national, and global, and institutions at all of these levels have been created to enable and regulate trade, transportation, competition, and conflict (45, 46). These institutions shape envi ronmental impact, even if they are not designed with that intent. They also provide mechanisms for environmental governance (e.g., national laws) and part of the social context for local efforts at environmental governance. Larger scale governance may authorize local control, help it, hinder it, or override it (47–52). Now, every local place is strongly influenced by glob al dynamics (48, 53–57).
The most important contemporary envi ronmental challenges involve systems that are intrinsically global (e.g., climate change) or are tightly linked to global pres sures (e.g., timber production for the world market) and that require governance at lev els from the global all the way down to the local (48, 58, 59). These situations often feature environmental outcomes spatially displaced from their causes and hard-to monitor, larger scale economic incentives that may not be closely aligned with the condition of local ecosystems. Also, differ entials in power within user groups or across scales allow some to ignore rules of commons use or to reshape the rules in their own interest, such as when global markets reshape demand for local resources (e.g., forests) in ways that swamp the ability of locally evolved institutions to regulate their use (60–62).
The store of governance tools and ways to modify and combine them is far greater than often is recognized (6, 63–65). Global and national environmental policy frequently ig nores community-based governance and tra ditional tools, such as informal communica tion and sanctioning, but these tools can have significant impact (63, 66). Further, no single broad type of ownership—government, pri vate, or community—uniformly succeeds or fails to halt major resource deterioration, as shown for forests in multiple countries (sup porting online material text, figs. S1 to S5, and table S1).
Requirements of Adaptive Governance in Complex Systems
Providing information. Environmental gover nance depends on good, trustworthy informa tion about stocks, flows, and processes within the resource systems being governed, as well as about the human-environment interactions af fecting those systems. This information must be congruent in scale with environmental events and decisions (48, 67). Highly aggregated in formation may ignore or average out local in formation that is important in identifying future problems and developing solutions.
For example, in 2002, a moratorium on all fishing for northern cod was declared by the
Canadian government after a collapse of this valuable fishery. An earlier near-collapse had led Canada to declare a 200-mile zone of ex clusive fisheries jurisdiction in 1977 (68, 69).
Considerable optimism existed during the 1980s that the stocks, as estimated by fishery scientists, were rebuilding. Consequently, gen erous total catch limits were established for northern cod and other ground fish, the number of licensed fishers was allowed to increase con siderably, and substantial government subsidies were allocated for new vessels (70). What went wrong? There were a variety of information related problems including: (i) treating all northern cod as a single stock instead of recognizing distinct populations with different characteristics, (ii) ignoring the variability of year classes of northern cod, (iii) focusing on offshore-fishery landing data rather than inshore data to “tune” the stock assessment, and (iv) ignoring inshore fishers who were catch ing ever-smaller fish and doubted the validity of stock assessments (70–72).
This experience illustrates the need to collect and model both local and aggre gated information about resource condi tions and to use it in making policy at the appropriate scales.
Information also must be congruent with decision makers’ needs in terms of timing, content, and form of presen tation (73–75). Informational systems that simultaneously meet high scientif ic standards and serve ongoing needs of decision makers and users are particularly useful. Information must not overload the capacity of users to assimilate it. Systems that adequately characterize environmental condi tions or human activities with summary indi cators such as prices for products or emission permits, or certification of good environmen tal performance can provide valuable signals as long as they are attentive to local as well as aggregate conditions (76–78).
Effective governance requires not only fac tual information about the state of the environ ment and human actions but also information about uncertainty and values. Scientific under standing of coupled human-biophysical sys tems will always be uncertain because of inher ent unpredictability in the systems and because the science is never complete (79). Decision makers need information that characterizes the types and magnitudes of this uncertainty, as well as the nature and extent of scientific igno rance and disagreement (80). Also, because ev ery environmental decision requires tradeoffs,

AP Capstone Program knowledge is needed about individual and so cial values and about the effects of decisions on various valued outcomes. For many environ mental systems, local and easily captured val ues (e.g., the market value of lumber) have to be balanced against global, diffuse, and hard to-capture values (e.g., biodiversity and the ca pability of humans and ecosystems to adapt to unexpected events). Finding ways to measure and monitor the outcomes for such varied val ues in the face of globalization is a major informational challenge for governance.
Dealing with conflict. Sharp differences in power and in values across interested parties make conflict inherent in environmental choices. Indeed, conflict resolution may be as important a motivation for designing resource institutions as is concern with the resources themselves (81). People bring varying per spectives, interests, and fundamental philos ophies to problems of environmental gover nance (74, 82–84), and their conflicts, if they do not escalate to the point of dysfunction, can spark learning and change (85, 86).
For example, a broadly participatory pro cess was used to examine alternative strategies
for regulating the Mississippi River and its trib utaries (87). A dynamic model was constructed with continuous input by the Corps of Engi neers, the Fish and Wildlife Service, local land owners, environmental groups, and academics from multiple disciplines. After extensive mod el development and testing against past histor ical data, most stakeholders had high confi dence in the explanatory power of the model.
Consensus was reached over alternative man agement options, and the resulting policies gen erated far less conflict than had existed at the outset (88).
Delegating authority to environmental ministries does not always resolve conflicts satisfactorily, so governments are experi menting with various governance approaches to complement managerial ones. They range from ballots and polls, where engagement is passive and participants interact minimally, to adversarial processes that allow parties to redress grievances through formal legal proce dures, to various experiments with intense in teraction and deliberation aimed at negotiating decisions or allowing parties in potential con flict to provide structured input to them through participatory processes (89–93).
Inducing rule compliance. Effective gov ernance requires that the rules of resource use are generally followed, with reasonable stan dards for tolerating modest violations. It is generally most effective to impose modest sanctions on first offenders, and gradually increase the severity of sanctions for those who do not learn from their first or second encounter (39, 94). Community-based insti tutions often use informal strategies for achieving compliance that rely on partici pants’ commitment to rules and subtle social sanctions. Whether enforcement mechanisms are formal or informal, those who impose them must be seen as effective and legitimate by resource users or resistance and eva sion will overwhelm the commons gover nance strategy.
Much environmental regulation in com plex societies has been “command and con trol.” Governments require or prohibit specif ic actions or technologies, with fines or jail terms possible for punishing rule breakers. If sufficient resources are made available for monitoring and enforcement, such approach es are effective. But when governments lack the will or resources to protect “protected areas” (95–97), when major environmental damage comes from hard-to-detect “nonpoint sources,” and when the need is to encourage innovation in behaviors or technologies rath er than to require or prohibit familiar ones, command and control approaches are less effective. They are also economically ineffi cient in many circumstances (98–100).
Financial instruments can provide incen tives to achieve compliance with environ mental rules. In recent years, market-based systems of tradable environmental allowanc es (TEAs) that define a limit to environmen tal withdrawals or emissions and permit free trade of allocated allowances under those limits have become popular (76, 101, 102).
TEAs are one of the bases for the Kyoto agreement on climate change.
Economic theory and experience in some settings suggest that these mechanisms have substantial advantages over command and control (103–106). TEAs have exhibited good environmental performance and eco nomic efficiency in the U.S. Sulfur Dioxide
Allowance Market intended to reduce the prevalence of acid rain (107, 108) and the
Lead Phasedown Program aimed at reducing the level of lead emissions (109). Crucial vari ables that differentiate these highly successful programs from less successful ones, such as chlorofluorocarbon production quota trading and the early EPA emission trading programs,
include: (i) the level of predictability of the stocks and flows, (ii) the number of users or producers who are regulated, (iii) the heteroge neity of the regulated users, and (iv) clearly defined and fully exchangeable permits (110).
TEAs, like all institutional arrangements, have notable limitations. TEA regimes tend to leave unprotected those resources not spe cifically covered by trading rules (e.g., by catch of noncovered fish species) (111) and to suffer when monitoring is difficult (e.g., under the Kyoto protocol, the question of whether geologically sequestered carbon will remain sequestered). Problems can also occur with the initial allocation of allowances, es pecially when historic users, who may be called on to change their behavior most, have disproportionate power over allocation deci sions (76, 101). TEAs and community-based systems appear to have opposite strengths and weaknesses (101), suggesting that insti tutions that combine aspects of both systems may work better than either approach alone.
For example, the fisheries tradable permit system in New Zealand has added comanage ment institutions to complement the market institutions (102, 112).
Voluntary approaches and those based on information disclosure have only begun to receive careful scientific attention as supple ments to other tools (63, 77, 113–115). Suc cess appears to depend on the existence of incentives that benefit leaders in volunteering over laggards and on the simultaneous use of other strategies, particularly ones that create incentives for compliance (77, 116–118).
Difficulties of sanctioning pose major prob lems for international agreements (119–121).
Providing infrastructure. The importance of physical and technological infrastructure is often ignored. Infrastructure, including tech nology, determines the degree to which a commons can be exploited (e.g., water works and fishing technology), the extent to which waste can be reduced in resource use, and the degree to which resource conditions and the behavior of humans users can be effectively monitored. Indeed, the ability to choose in stitutional arrangements depends in part on infrastructure. In the absence of barbed-wire fences, for example, enforcing private prop erty rights on grazing lands is expensive, but with barbed wire fences, it is relatively cheap (122). Effective communication and trans portation technologies are also of immense importance. Fishers who observe an unautho rized boat or harvesting technology can use a radio or cellular phone to alert others to illegal actions (123). Infrastructure also af fects the links between local commons and regional and global systems. Good roads can provide food in bad times but can also open local resources to global markets, creating demand for resources that cannot be used locally (124). Institutional infrastructure is also important, including research, social capital, and multilevel rules, to coordinate between local and larger levels of governance (48, 125, 126).
Be prepared for change. Institutions must be designed to allow for adaptation because some current understanding is likely to be wrong, the required scale of organization can shift, and biophysical and social systems change. Fixed rules are likely to fail because they place too much confidence in the current state of knowledge, whereas systems that guard against the low probability, high con sequence possibilities and allow for change may be suboptimal in the short run but prove wiser in the long run. This is a principal lesson of adaptive management research (31, 127).

Strategies for Meeting the Requirements of Adaptive Governance
The general principles for robust governance institu tions for localized resources (Fig. 3) are well established as a result of multiple em pirical studies (13, 39, 128– 137). Many of these also ap pear to be applicable to re gional and global resources (138), although they are less well tested at those scales.
Three of them seem to be par ticularly relevant for prob lems at larger scales.
Analytic deliberation.
Well-structured dialogue involving scientists, re source users, and interest ed publics, and informed by analysis of key infor mation about environ mental and human-envi ronment systems, appears critical. Such analytic de liberation (74, 139, 140) provides improved infor mation and the trust in it that is essential for information to be used effectively, builds social capital, and can allow for change and deal with inevitable conflicts well enough to produce consensus on governance rules.
The negotiated 1994 U.S. regulation on disinfectant by-products in water that reached an interim consensus, including a decision to collect new information and reconsider the rule on that basis (74), is an excellent example of this approach.
Nesting. Institutional arrangements must be complex, redundant, and nested in many layers (32, 141, 142). Simple strategies for governing the world’s resources that rely exclusively on imposed markets or one-level, centralized com mand and control and that eliminate apparent redundancies in the name of efficiency have been tried and have failed. Catastrophic failures often have resulted when central governments have exerted sole authority over resources. Ex amples include the massive environmental deg radation and impoverishment of local people in Indonesian Borneo (95), the increased rate of loss and fragmentation of high-quality habitat that occurred after creating the Wolong Nature
Reserve in China (143), and the closing of the northern cod fishery along the eastern coast of Canada partly attributable to the excessive quo tas granted by the Canadian government (70).
Institutional variety. Governance should employ mixtures of institutional types (e.g., hierarchies, markets, and community self governance) that employ a variety of decision rules to change incentives, increase informa tion, monitor use, and induce compliance (6, 63, 117). Innovative rule evaders can have more trouble with a multiplicity of rules than with a single type of rule.
Conclusion
Is it possible to govern such critical commons as the oceans and the climate? We remain guardedly optimistic. Thirty-five years ago it seemed that the “tragedy of the commons” was inevitable everywhere not owned pri vately or by a government. Systematic mul tidisciplinary research has, however, shown that a wide diversity of adaptive governance systems have been effective stewards of many resources. Sustained research coupled to an explicit view of national and interna tional policies as experiments can yield the scientific knowledge necessary to design ap propriate adaptive institutions.
Sound science is necessary for commons governance, but not sufficient. Too many strategies for governance of local commons are designed in capital cities or by donor agencies in ignorance of the state of the science and local conditions. The results are often tragic, but at least these tragedies are local. As the human footprint on the Earth enlarges (144), humanity is challenged to develop and deploy understanding of large scale commons governance quickly enough to avoid the large-scale tragedies that will otherwise ensue.

Library
Common-Pool Resources da tabase (147) revealed that, before Hardin’s paper, only 19 articles had been written in English-language academic literature with a speciﬁc ref erence to “commons,” “com mon-pool resources,” or “common property” in the ti tle. Since then, attention to the commons has grown rap idly. Since 1968, a total of over 2300 articles in that da tabase contain a speciﬁc ref erence to one of these three terms in the title.

who differ in values, interests, perspectives, power,
and the kinds of information they bring to situations (139, 148–151). Effective environmental gover nance requires an understanding of both environ mental systems and human-environment interac tions (26, 82, 152, 153).

AP SEMINAR
PART A
SUGGESTED TIME – 30 MINUTES
Directions: Read the passage below and then respond to the following three questions.
1.	 Identify the author’s argument, main idea, or thesis.
2.	 Explain the author’s line of reasoning by identifying the claims used to build the argument and the connections between them.
3.	 Evaluate the effectiveness of the evidence the author uses to support the claims made in the argument.
From “The Uncertainty of Science” in The Meaning of It All: Thoughts of a Citizen Scientist by Richard P. Feynman (1998, 2005)
Scientists . . . are used to dealing with doubt and uncertainty. All scientific knowledge is uncertain. This experience with doubt and uncertainty is important. I believe that it is of very great value, and one that extends beyond the sciences. I believe that to solve any problem that has never been solved before, you have to leave the door to the unknown ajar. You have to permit the possibility that you do not have it exactly right. Otherwise, if you have made up your mind already, you might not solve it.
When the scientist tells you he does not know the answer, he is an ignorant man. When he tells you he has a hunch about how it is going to work, he is uncertain about it. When he is pretty
sure of how it is going to work, and he tells you,
“This is the way it’s going to work, I’ll bet,” he still is in some doubt. And it is of paramount importance, in order to make progress, that we recognize this ignorance and this doubt.
Because we have the doubt, we then propose looking in new directions for new ideas. The rate of the development of science is not the rate at which you make observations alone but, much more important, the rate at which you create new things to test.
If we were not able or did not desire to look in any new direction, if we did not have a doubt or recognize ignorance, we would not get any new ideas. There would be nothing worth checking, because we would know what is true. So what we call scientific knowledge today is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty.
Some of them are most unsure; some of them are nearly sure; but none is absolutely certain.
Scientists are used to this. We know that it is consistent to be able to live and not know.
Some people say, “How can you live without knowing?” I do not know what they mean. I always live without knowing. That is easy. How you get to know is what I want to know.

This freedom to doubt is an important matter
in the sciences and, I believe, in other fields. It was born of a struggle. It was a struggle to be permitted to doubt, to be unsure. And I do not want us to forget the importance of the struggle
and, by default, to let the thing fall away. I feel a responsibility as a scientist who knows the great value of a satisfactory philosophy of ignorance, and the progress made possible by such a philosophy, progress which is the fruit of freedom of thought. I feel a responsibility to proclaim the value of this freedom and to teach that doubt is not to be feared, but that it is, to be welcomed as the possibility of a new potential for human beings. If you know that you are not sure, you have a chance to improve the situation. I want to demand this freedom for future generations.
Doubt is clearly a value in the sciences.
Whether it is in other fields is an open question and an uncertain matter. I expect in the next lectures to discuss that very point and to try to demonstrate that it is important to doubt and that doubt is not a fearful thing, but a thing of very great value.

PART B, QUESTION 4
SUGGESTED TIME – 90 MINUTES
Directions: Read the four sources carefully, focusing on a theme or issue that connects them
and the different perspective each represents. Then, write a logically organized, well-reasoned,
and well-written argument that presents your own perspective on the theme or issue you
identified. You must incorporate at least two of the sources provided and link the claims in your
argument to supporting evidence. You may also use the other provided sources or draw upon
your own knowledge. In your response, refer to the provided sources as Source A, Source B,
Source C, or Source D, or by the authors’ names.
Source A
From “Why Great Revolutions Will Become More Rare” in Democracy in America by Alexis de
Tocqueville (1840)
Among a people whose ranks are nearly equal, no ostensible bond connects men together or
keeps them settled in their station. None of them have either a permanent right or power to
command, none are forced by their condition to obey; but every man, finding himself possessed
of some education and some resources, may choose his own path and proceed apart from all his
fellow men. The same causes that make the members of the community independent of each
other continually impel them to new and restless desires and constantly spur them onwards. It
therefore seems natural that in a democratic community men, things, and opinions should be
forever changing their form and place, and that democratic ages should be times of rapid and incessant transformation.
But is this really the case? Does the equality of social conditions habitually and permanently lead
men to revolution? Does that state of society contain some perturbing principle which prevents
the community from ever subsiding into calm and disposes the citizens to alter incessantly their
laws, their principles, and their manners? I do not believe it; and as the subject is important, I beg for the reader’s close attention.
Almost all the revolutions that have changed the aspect of nations have been made to consolidate
or to destroy social inequality. Remove the secondary causes that have produced the great
convulsions of the world and you will almost always find the principle of inequality at the bottom.
Either the poor have attempted to plunder the rich, or the rich to enslave the poor. If, then, a state
of society can ever be founded in which every man shall have something to keep and little to take
from others, much will have been done for the peace of the world.

Source B “A Sane Revolution” by D. H. Lawrence (1929)
If you make a revolution, make it for fun, don’t make it in ghastly seriousness, don’t do it in deadly earnest, do it for fun.
Don’t do it because you hate people, do it just to spit in their eye.
Don’t do it for the money, do it and be damned to the money.
Don’t do it for equality, do it because we’ve got too much equality and it would be fun to upset the apple-cart and see which way the apples would go a-rolling.
Don’t do it for the working classes.
Do it so that we can all of us be little aristocracies on our own and kick our heels like jolly escaped asses.
Don’t do it, anyhow, for international Labour.
Labour is the one thing a man has had too much of.
Let’s abolish labour, let’s have done with labouring!
Work can be fun, and men can enjoy it; then it’s not labour.
Let’s have it so! Let’s make a revolution for fun!

From “Civil Disobedience” by Henry David Thoreau (1849)
I HEARTILY ACCEPT the motto, — “That government is best which governs least”; and I should
like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this,
which also I believe, — “That government is best which governs not at all”; and when men are
prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have. Government is at best but
an expedient; but most governments are usually, and all governments are sometimes, inexpedient.
The objections which have been brought against a standing army, and they are many and weighty,
and deserve to prevail, may also at last be brought against a standing government. The standing
army is only an arm of the standing government. The government itself, which is only the mode
which the people have chosen to execute their will, is equally liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it.
. . . Governments show thus how successfully men can be imposed on, even impose on
themselves, for their own advantage. It is excellent, we must all allow. Yet this government never
of itself furthered any enterprise, but by the alacrity with which it got out of its way. It does not
keep the country free. It does not settle the West. It does not educate. The character inherent in
the American people has done all that has been accomplished; and it would have done somewhat
more, if the government had not sometimes got in its way. For government is an expedient by
which men would fain succeed in letting one another alone; and, as has been said, when it is most
expedient, the governed are most let alone by it. . . .
But, to speak practically and as a citizen, unlike those who call themselves no-government men, I
ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government. Let every man make known
what kind of government would command his respect, and that will be one step toward obtaining it.
. . . All men recognize the right of revolution; that is, the right to refuse allegiance to, and to resist,
the government, when its tyranny or its inefficiency are great and unendurable. But almost all say
that such is not the case now. But such was the case, they think, in the Revolution of ’75. If one
were to tell me that this was a bad government because it taxed certain foreign commodities
brought to its ports, it is most probable that I should not make an ado about it, for I can do without
them. All machines have their friction; and possibly this does enough good to counterbalance
the evil. At any rate, it is a great evil to make a stir about it. But when the friction comes to have
its machine, and oppression and robbery are organized, I say, let us not have such a machine any
longer. In other words, when a sixth of the population of a nation which has undertaken to be the
refuge of liberty are slaves, and a whole country is unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign
army, and subjected to military law, I think that it is not too soon for honest men to rebel and
revolutionize. What makes this duty the more urgent is the fact that the country so overrun is not our own, but ours is the invading army.

From “Death of Rosa Parks - Senate Floor Statement”
Statement of Senator Obama (October 25, 2005)
Mr. President, today the nation mourns a genuine American hero. Rosa Parks died yesterday in her
home in Detroit. Through her courage and by her example, Rosa Parks helped lay the foundation
for a country that could begin to live up to its creed.
Her life, and her brave actions, reminded each and every one of us of our personal responsibilities
to stand up for what is right and the central truth of the American experience that our greatness as
a nation derives from seemingly ordinary people doing extraordinary things.
Rosa Parks’ life was a lesson in perseverance. As a child, she grew up listening to the Ku Klux
Klan ride by her house and lying in bed at night fearing that her house would be burnt down. In
her small hometown in Alabama, she attended a one-room school for African American children
that only went through the sixth grade. When she moved to Montgomery, Alabama, to continue
her schooling, she was forced to clean classrooms after school to pay her tuition. Although she
attended Alabama State Teachers College, Rosa Parks would later make her living as a seamstress and housekeeper.
. . .
Of course, her name became permanently etched in American history on December 1, 1955,
when she was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery
bus. It wasn’t the first time Rosa Parks refused to acquiesce to the Jim Crow system. The same
bus driver who had her arrested had thrown her off a bus the year before for refusing to give up her seat.
Some schoolchildren are taught that Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat because her feet were
tired. Our nation’s schoolbooks are only getting it half right. She once said: “The only tired I was, was tired of giving in.”
This solitary act of civil disobedience became a call to action. Her arrest led a then relatively
unknown pastor, Martin Luther King, Jr., to organize a boycott of the Montgomery bus system.
That boycott lasted 381 days and culminated in a landmark Supreme Court decision finding that
the city’s segregation policy was unconstitutional.
This solitary act of civil disobedience was also the spark that ignited the beginning of the end
for segregation and inspired millions around the country and ultimately around the world to get involved in the fight for racial equality.
