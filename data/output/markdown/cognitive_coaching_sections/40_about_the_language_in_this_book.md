## ABOUT THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BOOK

To the extent possible, we have worked to eliminate gender bias in this text. For example, we alternate use of 'he' and 'she' in our examples, or we eliminate any need for gender reference by writing sentences with plural nouns (using a construction with 'coaches/their' instead of 'coach/he' or 'coach/she'). Occasionally we use the form of his/her. However, some gender bias is unavoidable, as with the word 'craftsmanship.' We searched for years for another word that would capture so precisely the attributes of this state of mind, but we could find no better alternative. 'Craftspersonship' seems artificial and awkward, so we resigned ourselves to 'craftsmanship.' We hope readers will understand the dilemmas produced by the current limitations of the English language.

Also, we believe it is important to recognize the value of Cognitive Coaching in a variety of professions, positions, life roles, and careers. However, for the purposes of this book, we have chosen to cast the coaching process in educational settings. Thus, most of our vignettes, descriptions, samples, and examples illustrate educational settings (especially with teachers and coaches). This is despite the fact that we know of research being conducted with police officers, churches, business groups, and others. We hope readers will read beyond this narrow focus to apply the mediative process to contexts beyond education: home, community, workplace, and church.

We hope that this book supports the reader in mediating self-directed learning in others-and in themselves-as they integrate principles and values of Cognitive Coaching throughout school programs and practice. Together, we invite you to join us in this journey, the study of what it means to grow cognitively and to build schools that invest in the mind, body, and spirit.
