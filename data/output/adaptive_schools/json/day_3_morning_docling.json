  "content": "Today is about meetings-Can plan meeting so others look forward to attending.\n\nWho has been in meeting since last time?\n\nDid that meeting run well?\n\nDid you run that meeting?\n\nWho has been in meeting not so productive?\n\nDid you run THAT meeting? :)\n\nRemember 3 focus areas: Facilitating groups, developing groups, becoming more skillful group member\n\n- \u00b7 Facilitators develop when pay attention to micro-skills (frozen gesture, visual paragraph, attention first, etc.)\n- \u00b7 Groups develop when group leaders see them as they could be, not as are.\n- \u00b7 Skillful members develop high consciousness for interacting-using norms, skills, capabilities\n\n## WELCOME AND AUDIENCE CONNECT\n\nTHE TRAINERS NOTES ARE IN REGULAR TYPE. SUGGESTED LANGUAGE THE TRAINER MAY SAY TO THE GROUP IS PROVIDED IN ITALICS.\n\nTRAINERS NOTE:\n\nTHE IMAGES USED IN THESE POWERPOINTS HAVE BEEN PURCHASED BY THINKING COLLABORATIVE TO PROVIDE AUTHORIZED TRAINERS THE RIGHT TO USE THESE IMAGES ROYALTY FREE. IF TRAINERS WISH TO USE THESE IMAGES FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES, TRAINERS WILL NEED TO PURCHASE THE IMAGES PERSONALLY TO PROVIDE THE TRAINERS' RIGHT TO USE THEM OUTSIDE THINKING COLLABORATIVE.\n\n## WHAT?\n\nAudience Connect allows the presenter to develop rapport and relationship, as well as establishing credibility.\n\n## WHY?\n\nThe trainer needs to make a connection to the world of the audience and share a purpose for the work.\n\n## HOW?\n\nOur work today is largely about meetings. We think that you can plan a meeting so that others will look forward to attending. We know that groups develop when the group leaders see them as they could be, not as they are. Today we are going to focus on meetings in which the maximum amount of work is accomplished, in the minimum amount of time, with maximum group member satisfaction.\n\n## TRAINERS NOTE:\n\nEstablish the above points about meetings by using a Visual Paragraph.\n\nbringing everyone present acknowledge challenges, joys, aspirations\n\n## Examples:\n\nWhat\u2026\n\nGave you joy?\n\nFunniest event?\n\nBest student comment?\n\nChallenged your thinking?\n\nWas a good idea?\n\nWas a real world application?\n\nQuestion you still have?\n\nOne thing you learned?\n\nPushed your comfort zone?\n\nApplied what you learned?\n\nBravest thing?\n\nBest that could happen?\n\nWhat are you great at?\n\nWhat did you accomplish?\n\nWhat are you grateful for?\n\nDay 1-adaptivity, dialogue and discussion. Elements of professional community Day 2-2 norms, identity, Dilts levels of influence in learning\n\nToday-successful meetings\n\nSkills/tools to work at high focus-&gt;get work done-&gt;impact learning for kids\n\nToday YOU WILL gain tools to facilitate productive, satisfying meetings Four Day Overview:\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nDay 1 - Entering the Territory-Research base on effective professional communities learning; focus areas of the Adaptive Schools work\n\nDay 2 - Developing Identity and Capacity-The how-to, nuts and bolts of building effective collaborative groups\n\nDay 3 - Transforming Meetings-The best practices of meetings\n\nDay 4 -Sustaining Community-Continuing the work with effective meetings with a focus on engaging cognitive conflict, then planning to transfer learning from the workshop to the workplace\n\nWhy are we here?\n\n## Reminder of goal that ties work together\n\na call to become a productive group, will need to examine identity Not focusing only on traditional, linear challenges AS approach focuses on complex, non-linear, human challenges, and invites organizations to clarify identities as collaborators, inquirers, leaders while changing form to congruently align with that identity.\n\n## WHAT?\n\nReconnect with the goal\n\nWHY?\n\nIt has been some time since participants have seen the goal.\n\n## HOW?\n\nPut slide up and have participants share with a partner how they have been internalizing the goal.\n\n## 1-collaborative learning space\n\nOutcome for dialogue-&gt;understanding / about perspective swapping\n\nOutcome for discussion-&gt;decisions that stay made\n\n2-How adults talk and how that talk influences kids' learning / kids lives\n\nTrust enough to talk in deep ways\n\n3-reminder to teach, use, assess, etc.\n\n4-3rd norm, essential as inquirers\n\n## OUTCOMES\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nPlease read these outcomes as they appear on the screen. Then share with a partner and share which outcome has the most significance for you today.\n\nPublic agenda-shared\n\nProvides visual mental memory, even when meeting 20 minutes.\n\nFocused, connections between ideas, sequence, organized-&gt;Advanced organizer\n\n2-adult AND classroom purposes:  better meeting-more done, shortest time, greatest satisfaction.\n\n- 1-task (what)\n- 2-process (how)\n- 3-growing adult group and skills-every time meet, need to be better off as group members\n\n5-principles that guide those practices underpinnings-&gt;how make choices\n\n## CHARTED AGENDA\n\nDescribe agenda and purposes of items and how they relate.\n\nAfter explaining agenda,\n\nSo as you think about the outcomes and agenda, please turn to an elbow partner and share what you're most looking forward to today.\n\nWHAT? review patterns experienced in openings 1st 2 days of AS\n\nWHY?  pay attention to beginnings- sensitive dependence on initial condition way starts determines trajectory is FRACTAL of meeting! Connect strategies / moves any meeting\n\nHOW?  review list with partner\n\nselect 1 to try\n\nREVIEW OF OPENINGS\n\nWHAT?\n\nA brief review of the patterns experienced in the openings of the first three days of the Adaptive Schools Foundation Seminar.\n\n## WHY?\n\nReview\n\nConnect these opening strategies and moves to opening any meeting.\n\n## HOW?\n\nUse the outline list on the slide to briefly review opening patterns, then invite elbow partners to select one to concentrate on for their next meeting.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nReview this list of opening strategies and thinking about upcoming meetings in which you will be involved, select one area to focus your attention. Share that selection and what you plan to do with an elbow partner.\n\nSculptor -also created 'make way for ducklings' statue in Boston Public Garden Pronounced 'Shoon' SELECT A NORM FOR TODAY'S FOCUS WHAT? Set a Norm focus\n\n## WHY?\n\nAn opportunity to select one of the Seven Norms of Collaboration as a personal focus for today's work.\n\n## HOW?\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nThe background of this slide is a sculpture that's entitled, 'Dialogue.'\n\nUse Norms to do deepest work\n\n'Given agenda for next 30 minutes, which norm support us in getting most work done?'\n\nClassrooms:  chart outcomes-&gt; 'Given these outcomes, which norms will support you today in getting most work done?'  Develop life-long skills, civility, human-ness!!\n\nStudied 2 last time.  Will go in depth with remaining.\n\nUsing the list of Norms on the banner (or in your Learning Guide), select one as your personal focus for today's work.\n\nUse this slide as reference for participants.\n\n## What\n\nA strategy for grouping\n\n## Why\n\nGive participants an opportunity to connect with others in the room\n\nCreate energy through movement Like to buy space in own condos. Keep same perspective.\n\nBy moving from one side of room to other, gives new vision, new thinking.\n\nTrying to learning something new, buddy can hold you back. Trying on new behaviors and ways of being, harder with old friends Easier with new learning partners\n\nSET UP LEARNING PARTNERS\n\nLG, p. 14 (also p. 129)\n\nWHAT?\n\nA new set of learning partners - clock partners - a strategy for grouping.\n\n## WHY?\n\nGive participants an opportunity to connect with others in the room and create energy through movement\n\n## HOW?\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nIn just a moment, you will stand and make appointments with 4 people, not currently at your table. When you write their name at one of the times (12, 3, 6, 9) be sure they write your name at the same time on the clock.\n\nAfter most have their partners, visit each time on the screen with the large group and check to be sure each person has a partner. If anyone does not have a partner, remind about the 'land of the temporarily disconnected' (area near agenda chart, for example) and choosing a pair to become a trio.\n\nIn a moment you will be packing and stacking to work with one your clock partners. When you sit with him/her, share your Norms Goal and rationale for choosing it.\n\nSpeak aloud norm you chose-declaration to community are trying on new behavior. Expect it and support you.\n\nPlease move to a table with your 12 o'clock partner and share your goal.\n\n## Are you lonely?\n\nDo you work on your own, or hate making decisions?\n\n## Hold a meeting!!\n\nYou can see people, draw flow charts, feel important, and impress your colleagues... all on your organization's time!\n\n## Meetings\u2026\n\nthe practical alternative to work!!\n\n\u00a92025 Adaptive Schools Seminars\n\n## TEE UP PRODUCTIVE MEETINGS\n\nHOW?\n\nUse 'Hold a Meeting' Slide, or cartoon, or story, etc., to begin.\n\nChallenges to meeting success!\n\n## Introduce PRODUCTIVE MEETINGS-&gt;SORT CARDS\n\nopportunity to practice Putting Ideas on Table\n\nPut aside!\n\nWill come back\n\nHOW?\n\nUse slide for brainstorm.\n\n## What\n\nPrinciples / practices -&gt; correlate highly with productive meetings\n\n## Why- are principles (not rules)\n\n- \u00b7 Principles more powerful and flexible than rules\n- \u00b7 Principles help understand why things work way they do and how to improve them\n- \u00b7 Principles increase effectiveness of work groups\n- \u00b7 Principles include strategies and moves that can use when running meeting AND when group member\n\nReminder-group members more influential in keeping meetings on track, on topic, and focused than skillful facilitator.\n\nExamples of principles:\n\nDevelop a growth mindset\n\nWork to understand others' culture, interests, needs and perspectives.\n\nCreate a base of rigorous learning opportunities for ALL students.\n\nUnderstand that students have varied points\n\nAccept that human differences are not only normal, but also desirable\n\n## PRODUCTIVE MEETINGS SORT CARDS\n\nReframe from negative view of meetings to viewing meetings as productive learning experiences.\n\nWHAT?\n\nSort Card strategy\n\nWHY?\n\nPrinciples (not rules).\n\nMore powerful and flexible than rules.\n\nHelp understand why meetings work the way they do and how to improve them.\n\nIncrease effectiveness of work groups.\n\nHave strategies and moves that can be used both as a facilitator AND as a group member.\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nProductive groups conduct the day-to-day work of effective school systems\n\nThey use certain practices that less effective groups do not. This strategy is designed to identify as many of these good practices as possible within a short period of time.\n\n## PRODUCTIVE MEETINGS SORT CARDS\n\nWHAT?\n\nstrategy designed to identify good practices in short time\n\n## WHY?\n\n- \u00b7 expertise / human resource in room.\n- \u00b7 sharing ideas / experiences.\n- \u00b7 strategy to use with your groups.\n- \u00b7 practice putting ideas on table\n\n## HOW?\n\nproceed in stages-individually-&gt;table group-&gt;entire room-&gt;table groups.\n\n## 4 post-it notes.\n\n## HOW?\n\nDescribe the Sort Card strategy.\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nSort Cards will proceed in stages.  Here are your first directions.\n\nUse the slides to present Sort Cards and Museum Tour directions incrementally.\n\nDocent-doesn't go\n\nHelp others understand your exhibit / thinking\n\nFickle finger of fate to determine docent\n\nStrategically assign group members to go around to other exhibits and harvest ideas\n\nMuseum Tour WHAT? Visual display of group work products\n\nWHY?\n\nShare small group work with the larger group\n\nHOW?\n\nOffer directions on slide.\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nThe Docent remains to help others understand the exhibit/thinking of the group.\n\nAs you visit the museum exhibits, consider what is similar to the one your group created, and what might be unique.\n\nRead directions on slide.\n\nNot be mad at them-&gt; instead be proactive so they stay productive. Plan for moments when people aren't productive\n\nBe prepared for things that might happen.\n\nI anticipate/predict that _______ could happen in meeting, I will use __________ as a strategy.\n\nCompare unproductive behaviors to what you generated Match up unproductive behaviors with strategies.\n\nIf time-Share one unproductive behavior and how you might address it\n\n## SORT CARDS REFLECTION ON CONTENT:\n\nHOW?\n\nHave individuals return to original brainstorms of unproductive meeting experiences.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nThe pattern for our debriefs is reflection on content-what are we learning? - and on process-how did the strategy help us to learn?\n\nContent first: Considering your list of unproductive experiences in meetings, please review it and indicate which might be resolved by using some of the strategies you generated?\n\nIntention: be meeting investor instead of meeting bystander\n\n1-what can I give to make sure the meeting is success?\n\n2-what do I need from meeting to support our work?\n\n## Debrief:\n\nMeetings are facilitated\n\nGood meetings require skillful group members\n\nMost powerful influence in meeting is group member\n\nDon't have them? Develop them every meeting\n\nPrinciples of complex systems\n\nTiny events-major disturbances\n\nEverything influences everything else\n\nDon't have to touch everyone to make difference\n\n## Develop good facilitators\n\nrotate facilitation. Need opportunity to learn to lead\n\nDesign meetings-don't start with behaviors and expect to change practices Start with principle. Principle becomes practice.\n\nAs leader, develop identity as collaborator, inquirer, leader, then add strategies.\n\nUsing strategies with wrong identity -&gt; can be torture for participants\n\n## SORT CARDS REFLECTION ON PROCESS:\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nSo you are the facilitator and you are designing a meeting, what might be some reasons you would utilize this strategy? Why this strategy? Why this time?\n\n## TRAINERS NOTE\n\nYou may need to elaborate on what we mean by design principles by adding the words, 'reasons or why these strategies were effective.' If these points are not offered by participants in the debrief, add:\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nEveryone involved\n\nCollaboration\n\nMovement\n\nHonoring expertise in the room\n\nThe Sort Card and Museum Tour strategies serve several purposes - your ideas and experiences are available to others and you get new ideas. Collectively you level the playing\n\nfield of information in the room, you start to identify human resources within the room and you learn a strategy to use with your groups. Finally, as trainers, we get to learn what you\n\n## need LG, writing utensil\n\nCLOCK PARTNERS LG, p. 14 WHAT? New Clock Partner\n\nWHY?\n\nOffer fresh perspective and mark transition to new material.\n\nHOW?\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nFind your partner, and...share your responses to this question: What are some of the purposes of meetings?\n\n## THREE MEETING PURPOSES\n\nLG, p. 38\n\nWHAT?\n\nStation Naming on the Agenda Chart\n\n## WHY?\n\nStation Naming re-acclimates participants to agenda for the day. (Like a train conductor naming the next stop, a trainer uses the agenda chart to update participants on where we are and where are going next in the training.)\n\nProvides a model of how to utilize a public agenda\n\n## HOW?\n\nMove to agenda and reference current topic placement\n\nwithout outcomes becomes fuzzy -start making it up\n\nCreate a compelling purpose\n\n## What you want to be different or what you want to create because this group met?\n\n## WHAT?\n\nThree meeting purposes:  Task, process, group development. Tee up 3 Meeting Purposes by introducing the metaphor of the spinning plates\n\nAll ongoing groups need to balance three simultaneous agendas: Task, Process, and Group Development.\n\n## WHY?\n\nThis strategy transitions from the Card Sort and frames the facilitator's work on Successful Meeting Structures.\n\nIn selecting processes or strategies facilitators may choose to give more support to one of three 'plates': task, process or group development.\n\n## HOW?\n\n- 1.  Tee up using spinning plates slide.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nLeading a meeting can often feel overwhelming because we are paying attention to so many things at once. Wellman and Lipton (2004) offer a metaphor of a street entertainer spinning plates. As in a vaudevillian act, all plates require constant attention. The facilitator notices which one is wobbling and gives that one a little more spin.\n\n- 2.  Before introducing 3 purposes/agendas emphasize the importance of outcomes, by telling group:\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nBefore we talk about meeting purposes, I'm going to share with you the three most important things about a meeting:\n\n#1 Outcomes\n\n#2 Outcomes\n\n## #3 Outcomes\n\n## Metaphor\n\n- \u00b7 variety show / street show vaudeville style\n- \u00b7 facilitating meeting feels like trying to keep plates spinning!\n\n## What\n\n3 Plates are purposes for meetings and offers Focus\n\n## Why\n\nframes facilitator's work-&gt;successful meeting structures All plates require constant attention Facilitator notices which one is wobbling-&gt; gives more spin May need more support to 'plate'\n\n## How\n\n- 1-'WHAT' gets done (TASK)\n- -novice focuses here\n- -work worth doing\n- -learn something new / challenge\n- 2-'HOW' it gets done-both efficiently AND effectively (PROCESS) STRATEGIES\n- 3-'WHO'-&gt; participants + their development over time\n- -Growing as group and skills-&gt; to be better off as group members\n\n-often forgotten\n\nGroup Member Capability #4, Day 2-To Know and Support the Group's Purposes, Topics, Processes, and Development\n\n- 3. Reference Group Member Capability #4 in the LG, from Day 2, 'To Know and Support the Group's Purposes, Topics, Processes and Development. Use the slide images to accompany trainer input.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nNovice groups may pay attention almost exclusively to the first agenda, Task Focus. This is the 'what' of the meeting, the checklist of items to be covered. As groups mature, attention is also paid to the second agenda, Process. This is the 'how' of the meeting, the strategies that ensure effectiveness along with efficiency as tasks are accomplished. The third agenda, Group Development, focuses on the 'who' of the meeting, the group members, and their development of collective identity and capacity as collaborators, inquirers, and leaders. 4.

Principles are more powerful and flexible than rules.\n\n## HOW?\n\nUse slide and LG page to introduce the principles by verbally highlighting key ideas of the Organizing Principles.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nThe intention of this next piece is to provide you with a set of principles to increase the effectiveness of work groups when they meet.\n\nUse slides and Learning Guide and have pairs Read &amp; Respond to the first two Principles one at a time. Stop after each to make comments and answer questions, as appropriate.\n\n## Suggested Language after Read &amp; Respond to 1 st Principle:\n\nA recent discovery is that group members are more influential in keeping meetings on track, on topic, and focused than a skillful facilitator.\n\n## HUGE principle\n\nCAN predict quality of instruction / learning by quality of adult relationships-directly effects learning\n\n\u2022Vulnerable to learn from each other\n\nSuggested Language after Read &amp; Respond to 2 nd Principle:\n\nProductive groups are made, not born. There is an implication of shared objectives, mutual trust and respect, and a disciplined skill set rooted in listening. Researchers Bryk and Schneider in their work in successful Chicago schools observed that the behavioral manifestation of respect was the ability to listen to another person, particularly when you disagree.\n\nCross stitch to Intention, Attention, Action from Day 2 and norms of Presuming Positive Intentions and Paying Attention to Self and Others.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nWe come to this demanding work in a whole state. Set aside old hurts, slights, and personality conflicts. 'See the way she was looking at me?' Stop projecting old hurts onto new situations. Heal yourself. Your first relationship is with yourself.\n\n## Organizing Principles, p. 64\n\nPairs: With your organization in mind, pick one question. Respond to the question.\n\nPick a second question if time.\n\n- \u00b7 What might be some of the things about which people are feeling very successful?\n- \u00b7 What are your hunches about your organization's issues to which people are paying close attention?\n- \u00b7 Given your knowledge of staff, whose perspectives/points of view are particularly helpful?\n- \u00b7 As you consider your organization's mission, what skills do people seem to be continuously trying to improve in themselves?\n- \u00a92025 Adaptive Schools Seminars \u00b7 Who might be some of the collaborators in the work being done in your organization?\n\n## Debrief\n\nWhat are some words you might use to describe conversation just had with your partner? Get examples of words.\n\nFIVE ENERGY SOURCES\n\nLG, p. 64-65\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nYou are going to experience principle #3 in a different way. Using the prompts on the screen, select 2 or 3 to talk to your partner about your organization. Your partner will do the same. What questions might you have about these directions? Here are your options\u2026\n\nReveal 5 prompts one at a time and read aloud.\n\n## Debrief\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nWhat might be some one-or two-word descriptors about the conversation you just had?\n\n## WHAT?\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nThe 3 rd organizing principle for conducting successful meetings is that effective groups draw upon five energy sources:\n\nGroup efficacy\n\nGroup flexibility\n\nGroup craftsmanship\n\nGroup consciousness\n\nGroup interdependence\n\n## WHY?\n\nIn adaptive, complex, non-linear systems, paying attention to the flow and interchange of energy as much as to things is the key to successful school leadership. It is necessary to look below surface behaviors to analyze the sources of successes and challenges.\n\n## WHAT?\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nThe 3 rd organizing principle for conducting successful meetings is that effective groups draw upon five energy sources:\n\nGroup efficacy\n\nGroup flexibility\n\nGroup craftsmanship\n\nGroup consciousness\n\nGroup interdependence\n\n## WHY?\n\nIn adaptive, complex, non-linear systems, paying attention to the flow and interchange of energy as much as to things is the key to successful school leadership. It is necessary to look below surface behaviors to analyze the sources of successes and challenges.\n\n## HOW?\n\nOffer the directions on the slide.\n\n## Resource for trainer:\n\n- \u00b7Efficacy-believes in capacity to produce results; stamina / energy\n- \u2022Consciousness-awareness of self and group; impact of actions\n- \u2022Flexibility-multiple perspectives, creative with uncertainty / ambiguity\n- \u2022Craftsmanship-clarity in values, goals, standards; refines communication\n- \u2022Interdependence-values relationships; conflict as opportunities to improve / learn\n\n## HOW?\n\nAfter the paired reading, offer the prompts with the Energy Sources labeled.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nOnce again, here are the prompts from your earlier conversation. Notice how each prompt connects to one of the five Energy Sources. Recall the one-word descriptors you offered about the positive energy in the conversation that you had.\n\nAfter lunch, you will have the opportunity to use these Energy Sources to intervene with struggling groups.\n\nWHAT:  Synthesis -- 3 organizing principles\n\nWHY:  closure -- big ideas about successful meetings\n\n## HOW:\n\nWHAT?\n\nSynthesis of the 3 organizing principles\n\nWHY?\n\nBring closure to the big ideas about successful meetings\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nAs we get ready for lunch, take a moment\u2026 (pairs, pairs square, table groups) to have this dialogue.\n\n## HOW?\n\nComplete the sentence stem.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nWe've been focusing on 3 big ideas about successful meetings, before moving to specific strategies, which we will look at this afternoon. Take a few minutes at your table to complete this sentence with the colleagues at your table.\n\n## TRAINERS NOTE:\n\nTrainer discretion for the processing of the closing dialogue: pairs, pair square, table groups.\n\nThe following is language to describe each of the Energy Sources: Efficacy-believes in capacity to produce results; stamina/energy Consciousness-awareness of self and group; impact of actions Flexibility-multiple perspectives, creative with uncertainty/ambiguity Craftsmanship-clarity in values, goals, standards; refines communication Interdependence-values relationships; conflict as opportunities to improve/learn\n\n## WHAT?  norm--posing questions\n\nWHAT?\n\nSuggested Language:\n\n'Promoting a Spirit of Inquiry' is the large conceptual frame for this work, distinguishing a culture of inquiry from one of advocacy. The operational 'how to' of\n\npromoting this spirit lives in the Seven Norms of Collaboration. Pausing and Paraphrasing gives us 'permission' to Pose Questions.\n\n## WHY?\n\nWe pose questions to explore assumptions, to invite others to inquire into their own thinking, to first seek understanding of others' ideas prior to advocating for our own.\n\nPOSING QUESTIONS LG p. 56-57 WHAT?
