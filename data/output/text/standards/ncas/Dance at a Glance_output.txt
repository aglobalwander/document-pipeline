Reflect on and analyze the variables that contributed to changes in one’s personal growth. | Synthesize | b. Observe a dance work. Identify and imitate a movement from the dance, and ask a question about the dance. | b. Observe a work of visual art.
Describe and then express through movement something of interest about the artwork, and ask questions for discussion concerning the artwork. | b. Observe illustrations from a story. Discuss observations and identify ideas for dance movement and demonstrate the big ideas of the story. | b. Respond to a dance work using an inquiry-based set of questions (for example, See, Think,
Wonder). Create movement using ideas from responses and explain how certain movements express a specific idea. | b. Ask and research a question about a key aspect of a dance that communicates a perspective about an issue or event.
Explore the key aspect through movement. Share movements and describe how the movements help to remember or discover new qualities in these key aspects.
Communicate the new learning in oral, written, or movement form. | b. Develop and research a question relating to a topic of study in school using multiple sources of references. Select key aspects about the topic and choreograph movements that communicate the information. Discuss what was learned from creating the dance and describe how the topic might be communicated using another form of expression. | b. Choose a topic, concept, or content from another discipline of study and research how other art forms have expressed the topic. Create a dance study that expresses the idea.
Explain how the dance study expressed the idea and discuss how this learning process is similar to, or different from, other learning situations. | b. Conduct research using a variety of resources to find information about a social issue of great interest. Use the information to create a dance study that expresses a specific point of view on the topic.
Discuss whether the experience of creating and sharing the dance reinforces personal views or offers new knowledge and perspectives. | b. Research the historical development of a dance genre or style. Use knowledge gained from the research to create a dance study that evokes the essence of the style or genre.
Share the study with peers as part of a lecture demonstration that tells the story of the historical journey of the chosen genre or style. Document the process of research and application. | b. Investigate two contrasting topics using a variety of research methods.
Identify and organize ideas to create representative movement phrases.
Create a dance study exploring the contrasting ideas.
Discuss how the research informed the choreographic process and deepens understanding of the topics. | b. Collaboratively identify a dance related question or problem. Conduct research through interview, research database, text, media, or movement. Analyze and apply information gathered by creating a group dance that answers the question posed.
Discuss how the dance communicates new perspectives or realizations. Compare orally and in writing the process used in choreography to that of other creative, academic, or scientific procedures. | b. Use established research methods and techniques to investigate a topic.
Collaborate with others to identify questions and solve movement problems that pertain to the topic. Create and perform a piece of choreography. Discuss orally or in writing the insights relating to knowledge gained through the research process, the synergy of collaboration, and the transfer of learning from this project to other learning situations. | b. Investigate various dance related careers through a variety of research methods and techniques. Select those careers of most interest.
Develop and implement a Capstone Project that reflects a possible career choice. |
