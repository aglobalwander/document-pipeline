I. Course description and aims
Language acquisition consists of two modern language courses—
language ab initio and language B—designed to provide students
with the necessary skills and intercultural understanding to enable
them to communicate successfully in an environment where the language studied is spoken.
Language B is a language acquisition course designed for students
with some previous experience of the target language. Students
further develop their ability to communicate through the study
of language, themes and texts. There are five prescribed themes:
identities, experiences, human ingenuity, social organization and sharing the planet.
Both language B SL and HL students learn to communicate in the target
language in familiar and unfamiliar contexts. The distinction between
language B SL and HL can be seen in the level of competency the
student is expected to develop in receptive, productive and interactive skills.
At HL the study of two literary works originally written in the target
language is required and students are expected to extend the range
and complexity of the language they use and understand in order
to communicate. Students continue to develop their knowledge of
vocabulary and grammar, as well as their conceptual understanding
of how language works, in order to construct, analyse and evaluate
arguments on a variety of topics relating to course content and the target language culture(s).
The following language acquisition aims are common to both language ab initio and language B.
•	 Develop international-mindedness through the study of
languages, cultures, and ideas and issues of global significance.
•	 Enable students to communicate in the language they have
studied in a range of contexts and for a variety of purposes.
•	 Encourage, through the study of texts and through social
interaction, an awareness and appreciation of a variety of perspectives of people from diverse cultures.
•	 Develop students’ understanding of the relationship between
the languages and cultures with which they are familiar.
•	 Develop students’ awareness of the importance of language in relation to other areas of knowledge.
•	 Provide students, through language learning and the process of
inquiry, with opportunities for intellectual engagement and the
development of critical- and creative-thinking skills.

The Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19
age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and
inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students
to develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them
to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core. Students study
two modern languages (or a modern language and a classical language), a humanities
or social science subject, an experimental science, mathematics and one of the creative
arts. Instead of an arts subject, students can choose two subjects from another area.
It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma Programme a
demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university
entrance. In each of the academic areas students have flexibility in making their
choices, which means they can choose subjects that particularly interest them and
that they may wish to study further at university.
Normally, three subjects (and not more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and
the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends 240 teaching hours for
HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than at SL.
In addition, three core elements—the extended essay, theory of knowledge and creativity, activity,
service—are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.
This IB DP subject brief has four key components:

=== Page 2 ===
•	 Provide students with a basis for further study, work and leisure through the use of an additional language.
•	 Foster curiosity, creativity and a lifelong enjoyment of language learning.
II. Curriculum model overview
The curriculum is organized around five prescribed themes with which
the students engage though written, audio, visual and audio-visual texts.
Students develop into successful, effective communicators by considering
the conceptual understandings of context, audience, purpose, meaning and variation.
Communication is evidenced through receptive, productive and interactive skills.
III. Assessment model
The language acquisition assessment objectives are common to both language ab initio and language B.
•	 Communicate clearly and effectively in a range of contexts and for a variety of purposes.
•	 Understand and use language appropriate to a range of interper­
sonal and/or intercultural contexts and audiences.
•	 Understand and use language to express and respond to a range of ideas with fluency and accuracy.
•	 Identify, organize and present ideas on a range of topics.
•	 Understand, analyse and reflect upon a range of written, audio, visual and audio-visual texts.

The assessment outlines for language B SL and HL are identical; it is the
nature of the assessment that differs and this is what distinguishes SL assessments from those of HL.
For language B HL paper 1, the tasks set will require more complex
language and structures and demand higher-order thinking skills.
Additionally for HL, a higher word range has been provided in order to accommodate the more complex responses required.
For the individual oral internal assessment, the stimulus at language B SL
is a visual image that is clearly relevant to one (or more) of the themes of
the course. The stimulus at language B HL is an excerpt from one of the two literary works studied.
