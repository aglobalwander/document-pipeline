AP Equity and Access Policy
College Board strongly encourages educators to make equitable access a guiding
principle for their AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared
students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination
of barriers that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and
socioeconomic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented. Schools
should make every effort to ensure their AP classes reflect the diversity of their
student population. College Board also believes that all students should have
access to academically challenging course work before they enroll in AP classes,
which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to
equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.

About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills
that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking AP
courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and AP
Exams are developed and scored by college faculty and
experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges and
universities in the United States grant credit, advanced placement, or both on the basis of successful AP
Exam scores—more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
assessments—Personal Progress Checks—that
teachers can assign throughout the year to measure
student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students:
Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been traditionally underserved. College Board also believes that all students should have access to academically challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for
AP success. It is only through a commitment to equitable
preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses:
The AP Course Audit
AP Course Development
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP
courses must participate in the AP Course Audit, a
process through which AP teachers’ course materials
are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the content
and skills that are the focus of the corresponding
college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also
organizes the content and skills into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many AP teachers have
told us they follow in order to focus their instruction.
The intention of this publication is to respect teachers’
time and expertise by providing a roadmap that they
can modify and adapt to their local priorities and
preferences. Moreover, by organizing the AP course
content and skills into units, the AP Program is able
to provide teachers and students with free formative 1

Bullet The number of points researchers have found to be predictive that an AP student will succeed when placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
Bullet Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP scores as follows:
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the AP teacher and the school principal (or designated
administrator) to confirm awareness and understanding
of the curricular and resource requirements. A syllabus
or course outline, detailing how course requirements
are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
free-response questions and through-course
performance assessments, as applicable, are scored by
thousands of college faculty and expert AP teachers.
Most are scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small
portion is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly
trained, and their work is monitored throughout the
Reading for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves
as Chief Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP
Readers in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy
of the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a curve.
Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which means that
every student who meets the criteria for an AP score of
2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no matter how many
students that is. The criteria for the number of points
students must earn on the AP Exam to receive scores
of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently
validates for credit and placement purposes—include:
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The AP
Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor; all
AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision, piloting,
and analysis to ensure that questions are accurate, fair,
and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development, College
Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher education
institutions. This feedback is carefully considered to
ensure that AP courses and exams are able to provide
students with a college-level learning experience and
the opportunity to demonstrate their qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam development process, relies on the expertise of
both AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple choice questions are scored by machine, the

While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and
universities. To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/ placement policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/creditpolicies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for
seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score
the free-response sections of the AP Exams. Ninety eight percent of surveyed educators who took part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an AP
Reader, including opportunities to:
Bullet Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
Bullet Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP
scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure to the quality and depth of the responses from the
entire pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
Bullet Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
Bullet Score from home: AP Readers have online distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects. Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
Bullet Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs): AP
Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide suggests a
sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds skill instruction across units, organizes content
into readings, and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed in a variety of ways including by skills
and author, create customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable
students to practice and get feedback on each question.﻿

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
Bullet Teachers and students sign in to, or create, their College Board accounts.
Bullet Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
Bullet Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
Bullet Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP coordinator.
Bullet Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and
AP coordinators to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following
additional benefits:
Bullet Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
Bullet Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
Bullet Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student pack.
The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
Bullet Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

About the AP
Latin Course
The AP Latin course focuses on the in-depth study of selections from two of the greatest
works in Latin literature: Vergil’s Aeneid and Caesar’s Gallic War. The course requires students
to prepare and translate the readings and place these texts in a meaningful context, which
helps develop critical, historical, and literary sensitivities. Throughout the course, students
consider themes in the context of ancient literature and bring these works to life through
classroom discussions, debates, and presentations. Additional English readings from both of
these works help place the Latin readings in a significant context.
College Course Equivalent
AP Latin is approximately equivalent to an upper-intermediate (typically fourth- or
fifth- semester) college or university Latin course.
Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites; however, students are typically in their fourth year of high-school-level study 7

Introduction
AP Latin is designed to provide advanced high school students with a rich
and rigorous Latin course. Students who successfully complete the course
are able to read, understand, translate, and analyze Latin poetry and prose.
Throughout the course, students develop their language skills through
various activities: precise, literal translation of prepared poetry and prose;
reading with comprehension of sight passages, both poetry and prose; and
written analyses that demonstrate the results of critical reading in clear and coherent arguments supported by textual examples.
The Latin language is also the best route to learning
about the history, literature, and culture of the ancient
Romans. To this end, students read carefully chosen
texts. Vergil’s Aeneid, arguably the most influential
work of Latin literature, is both a model of Latin poetic style and a profound meditation on the meaning
of Roman history and civilization. Caesar’s Gallic
War, for generations a standard school text, is still
rightly admired both for its pure and straightforward
Latinity and for its historical interest, as it engages
with controversial issues of war and peace, empire,
ethnicity, leadership, and the roles and purposes of historiography.
skills for reading, translating, and analyzing Latin
texts. Students in AP Latin also learn to demonstrate contextual knowledge and to make connections to other disciplines as well as comparisons between
Latin and English usages. Using Vergil and Caesar as a base, the course helps students reach beyond
translation to read with critical, historical, and literary
sensitivity. This is an ambitious goal, but it is hoped that when exposed to the characteristic method
of classical philology, with its rigorous attention to
linguistic detail coupled with critical interpretation and
analysis, students will be able to apply the skills they
acquire in this course to many areas of learning and professional pursuits.
The AP Latin course is clearly consistent with the
goal areas of the Standards for Classical Language
Learning, paying explicit attention to developing 11

Unit 7: Caesar, Gallic War, Book 5 Part II, Book 6, and Book 7
Unit 8: Vergil, Aeneid, Books 6, 8, and 12
The preceding skills are developed throughout the
course as students read through the required syllabus passages and sight-reading passages chosen by the teacher. The degree to which student performance
meets learning objectives in each skill category is
articulated in the Achievement Level Descriptions,
which define how well students at each level perform.
See the section entitled “AP Latin Achievement Level
Descriptions” on p. 109.
Course Content
The framework specifies what students must know, be able to do, and understand, with a focus on
The organization of the Unit Guides gives students and
teachers the opportunity to alternate between Vergil and
Caesar in order to develop an ease in switching between
authors and genres. Other approaches such as starting
with Caesar or doing all of one author at once are also viable; examples of these other approaches can be
found in the Course Planning and Pacing Guides at AP
Central. Choosing the integrated approach of the Unit
Guides, however, ensures that students will have solid
experience with both authors throughout the course, regardless of the trajectory of the school year.
seven themes:
Theme 1: Literary Style and Genre (LIT)
Theme 2: Roman Values (RMV)
Theme 3: War and Empire (WAE)
Theme 4: Leadership (LDR)
Theme 5: Views of Non-Romans (VNR)
Theme 6: History and Memory (HIS)
Theme 7: Human Beings and the Gods (HBG)
Pacing recommendations at the unit level and in the
Course at a Glance provide suggestions for how you
can teach the required course content and administer the Personal Progress Checks. The suggested class
periods are based on a schedule in which the class
meets five days a week for 45 minutes each day. While
these recommendations have been made to aid in your
planning, you are free to adjust the pacing based on the
needs of your students, alternate schedules (e.g., block scheduling), or your school’s academic calendar.
These themes are neither prescriptive nor required but are rather meant to promote an integration of language, course content, and culture and provide connections that enrich student understanding.
Revisiting the themes in a variety of contexts and content allows students to develop deeper conceptual and cultural knowledge of Roman
civilization. The course also encourages instruction that prepares students for intermediate and
advanced study of classical literature at the college
level and ensures that students are exposed to both poetry and prose authors.
READINGS
Each unit is broken down into teachable segments
called readings. Visit the readings pages (starting
on page 30) to see the suggested lines, books, and
chapters for each reading and provided suggestions for instructional focus.
UNITS
The course content is organized into eight units that
align with the required syllabus readings for the Aeneid
and the Gallic War. The units are arranged so that students are exposed to each author several times
throughout the year. The content includes the required
Latin syllabus. In addition, selected books of the works should be read in English.
NOTE: The required readings for this course and its exam sometimes present difficult human issues and
situations that may be challenging for some students.
Teachers should prepare, guide, and support their students as they engage with these texts.

Introduction
This course takes the required readings by Vergil and Caesar and
organizes them into eight units. Each unit is connected to recommended
themes, which creates an interesting, meaningful context in which to
explore a variety of language and cultural concepts.
The unit guides offer teachers helpful guidance in building students’ skills
and knowledge through reading, translating, and analyzing Latin poetry and prose.
This unit structure respects new AP teachers’ time by providing one
possible sequence they can adopt or modify rather than having to build
from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units enable the AP
Program to provide interested teachers with formative assessments—the
Personal Progress Checks—that they can assign their students at the end
of each unit to gauge progress toward success on the AP exam. However,
experienced AP teachers who are satisfied with their current course
organization and exam results should feel no pressure to adopt these units,
which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

QUESTIONS § What makes the Aeneid an epic?
§ What expectations should we have of the narrative given that the story is an epic?
§ What are we to think of epic characters, especially heroes, from the way they are introduced?
§ How might it affect
Aeneas to talk to someone he suspects is a goddess only to realize too late that it is his own mother?
§ What do we learn about
Roman expectations of women from meeting
Dido?
Developing Understanding
Unit 1 sets the stage of the Aeneid as it introduces Vergil’s portrayal of leadership and of
the role of the gods and other peoples in the trials of the Trojans. The passages come from
Book 1, which opens with the invocation of the Muse and the revelation of Juno‘s anger over
and interference in Aeneas’s journey. We see the honor paid to Juno by gods and mortals and
view the interactions of other gods through a scene with Neptune and the winds of Aeolus.
The lines in this book focus on the emotion-filled actions of Aeneas in a time of crisis; we also
see Aeneas’s wonderment as he arrives at the young city of Carthage. Finally, we consider
the kindly strength of Dido’s reception of the strangers in her land. By reading all of Book 1 in
English, teachers can help students explore how the past is remembered and how the gods in
epic poetry are presented as influencing mortal thoughts, emotions, and lives.
Building Course Skills
Students will focus on reviewing and building on the vocabulary they have brought from previous years of Latin study, on reviewing and solidifying their knowledge of syntax in the service of accurately comprehending
Latin texts, and on reviewing and practicing the terminology used to identify grammatical forms and syntactic structures. One means of achieving these goals is frequent literal translation of syllabus passages from the beginning of the year.
Students will also begin to explore the contextualization, analytical, and argumentative skills necessary for success in the course. Potential topics for contextual discussion in Unit 1 include the relation of Roman cultural products to perspectives of Roman culture and how knowledge of mythology and legends aids in understanding Latin texts.
Preparing for the AP Exam
To prepare for the multiple-choice section of the exam, students will need to focus on expanding their ability to read Latin texts by going beyond merely recognizing high frequency words and isolated phrases; they will need to develop skills in comprehending texts via contextual clues. Practicing the literal translation required for Question 1 will aid them in transferring knowledge of morphology and syntax to other parts of the exam. Students should also work on scansion and the application of literary terminology. That practice, together with practice in contextualization, analysis of content, and formation of arguments, will help them prepare for Question 3.

TEACHER TALK
Lines 1–49 of Book 1 introduce students to epic poetry, thereby creating the ideal
opportunity to establish some general contextual characteristics of this literary
genre and writing conventions, such as Vergil’s invocation of the Muse and his use of
dactylic hexameter, as well as how the author uses allusions to Homer’s epics in order
to enhance the beginning of his story. These lines also provide students with some
sample questions about the content so that they can begin to work on writing a thesis
statement and select claims from the text to use as evidence to support their thesis.
This work helps prepare students from the beginning for the essay task. Encouraging
students to read aloud starting with this first unit helps them build confidence with this
skill throughout the year. Finally, focusing on literal translation of the text’s initial lines
ensures that students use essential vocabulary to support both contextualization and literary analysis.

TEACHER TALK
Now that students have had some time to start refamiliarizing themselves with
important Latin vocabulary and have begun to articulate the meaning of that vocabulary
in context, it is a good idea to add in a review of morphology, emphasizing its importance
in literal translations. Among the many elements of discussion to include for lines 50–91
are the way Juno’s “historical” sources of anger are revealed through a clever scene
between a patron and her client in her visit to Aeolus. How do these power dynamics
within the divine sphere affect the mortals in the story, and how does a scene of Roman
politics work in a world of sea gods and nymphs? There are many complex images within
Vergil’s description of the storm, and students will likely need help stepping back from
the Latin, both here and in the next reading, in order to see the scene clearly.

TEACHER TALK
Lines 92–156 present a nice chance to begin working more closely with students to help
them demonstrate knowledge of Latin grammar and syntax as they translate. These
efforts will not only help students hone the accuracy of their textual understanding
but also aid them in preparation for multiple-choice and short-answer questions on
the AP Exam. With the first appearance of Aeneas, the description of the storm, and
the intervention of Neptune, there are many opportunities in this section to work on
Vergil’s use of stylistic features. Think too about how to start the conversation about
portrayals of leadership in the epic: for example, both Aeneas’s emotional reaction and
Neptune’s suppressed anger offer opportunities for contrasts with how leadership is
often defined today. Ask students to consider Aeolus’s reaction to the message from
Neptune that his returning winds carry for him. Where is Juno now?

TEACHER TALK
The lines in this reading provide more opportunities to discuss Vergil’s portrayal of
nature. Students should know why these descriptions would touch a Roman reader;
some students may not understand the importance of the natural world to Vergil and his
contemporaries. This discussion could extend to how the ancients would build a fire or
make bread and to the fact that Vergil is presenting a rugged scene even within those
ancient procedural expectations. The elements of sailing and hunting present another
important opportunity to work with students on Latin vocabulary. The uniqueness of
the scenes described, and the likelihood of modern students being unfamiliar with
many of the skills displayed, make it especially important to help them clarify the
differences between Latin and English usage as they translate. Can they step back from
the passage and articulate overall understanding of what they have read? Finally, ask
them to consider how Aeneas’s suppression of his emotions in his pep talk to his men develops our view of him as a leader.

TEACHER TALK
Because students also read Book 1 in translation during this unit, teachers have an
opportunity to bring up the longing for lost friends Vergil portrays in the dining scene
with Aeneas and his men. Have the students lost contact with old friends? Have their
parents or relatives reminisced about the “olden days” in a similar fashion? What are
we to make of Venus’s efforts on behalf of her son? While her focus on the fame of her
family might strengthen the distance between gods and mortals, what of the other
mothers encountered in Roman history? Perhaps an ancient Roman would see her
manipulations as a manifestation of genuine caring. Students should also consider how
Jupiter’s prophecy works to reassure Vergil’s readers that troubling times are part of a
greater plan. As students return to the Latin with lines 418–440, they should explore the
city-building and temple’s depictions as “historical” rather than mythological scenes
for those viewing them, because history appears in many layers within Vergil’s writing.
The grammatical complexity of the bee simile can be alleviated by working with
students to provide specific terminology for the grammatical and syntactical structures in the passage.

TEACHER TALK
The short section of English between lines 440 and 494 of the Latin help students
see Aeneas’s sense of relief that his people have not been forgotten—even as he
completely misses the hostility toward his people in the portrayal. Lines 494–578
turn, with the introduction of Dido, to another simile for which the students may
need scaffolding. How does her portrayal conform to and challenge women’s roles
in antiquity? What do her historical references lend to the tale? Can students see the
elements of proper hospitality and good leadership in Ilioneus’s speech and Dido’s
response? Though Aeneas appears after the Latin passage concludes, a teacher could
use the next section as a chance to model sight reading for students. Teachers can
work again with students on dactylic hexameter, leaving time to work on the next step in
essay writing and perhaps using the passages read in English to help students support
their argument with relevant evidence before practicing the same skill in Latin. The
English readings show gods meddling in the lives of mortals and promise a long look at
history and memory with Dido’s desire to hear Aeneas’s story.

Bullet How in Book 1 does
Caesar justify the war to the Roman people? To the Roman Senate?
Bullet Why would Caesar include stories about other cultures in Book 6, and how do you think he learned what he is saying?
Developing Understanding
Unit 2 helps set the stage of the Gallic War as it introduces Caesar’s subtle portrayal of non-
Romans in contrast to his native representation of Roman values. The Latin text is taken from
Books 1 and 6 of Caesar’s commentaries, as he classified his account of the war. Book 1
describes the geographical situation of the Gauls; the machinations, betrayal, and death
of Orgetorix; and both the request of the Helvetii and Caesar’s reaction to their request.
The chapters from Book 6 include an ethnographic look at the social orders consisting of
Druids and knights, a syncretistic view of the Gallic pantheon, a peek at Gallic marriage, and
a meaningful glance at the Gauls’ rules about gossip concerning the state. By reading all of
Book 1 in English, students can explore how Caesar portrays his own leadership and that of
others as well as the full scope of the campaign against the Helvetii in 58 BC.

Building Course Skills
Students will continue building on the skills from the previous unit, this time with an emphasis on students’ ability to demonstrate knowledge of Latin vocabulary, explain the meaning of Latin words and phrases in context, and demonstrate knowledge of Latin morphology when translating Latin texts into English. Again, frequent literal translation of syllabus passages is a key practice for students to employ, but students should also be given practice articulating a defensible claim of a thesis. Potential topics for contextual discussion in Unit 2 include how knowledge of influential people and key historical events aids in understanding texts and how, in turn, knowledge of Roman political ideas furthers understanding of Roman culture in Latin texts.
Preparing for the AP Exam
To prepare for the sight-reading questions in the multiple-choice section, students should focus on expanding their ability to distinguish between easily confused words and on choosing contextually appropriate meanings for Latin vocabulary. Students work on literal translation helps them demonstrate understanding of individual grammatical constructions within sentences and helps them use the appropriate English constructions and idioms to reflect the
Latin. This translation practice will help prepare them for Question 2 on the exam. To prepare students for Question 3, teachers can work with students to appropriately apply contextual knowledge, improve their overall understanding of Latin passages, and strengthen their analysis of texts.

TEACHER TALK
As in the start of Unit 1, the focus should be on vocabulary as students begin their
efforts to translate Caesar literally. As students begin to work on Book 1, Chapters
1–3, the Dickinson College Commentaries video of 1.1 is a must-see (see Selecting
and Using Course Materials on page 127), as it shows the importance of reading these
texts aloud and also how geographical understanding can enhance their reading.
Students should first consider how Caesar handles his choice of genre and how he
uses these first few chapters to justify his actions to the people and to other leaders
back in Rome. Students should consider how Caesar portrays the Gauls. They may
need help understanding what knowledge of people and events they need, where to
find the information, and how to retain and apply that information going forward. What
else would your students like to know, and what circumstances have made knowing it
impossible? It is important to reinforce students’ ability to articulate a defensible claim
with this new author and the new “reality” of what they are reading.

TEACHER TALK
While students continue to work on Latin vocabulary, these chapters also offer a chance
to build knowledge of grammar and syntax in the translation of a prose author. Students
will also need to demonstrate an understanding of the differences between English and
Latin usages. As an extension of their work toward strong essay writing, students should
begin to practice supporting their claims with accurate, specific, and relevant references
to the Latin texts. In these chapters, teachers can help students see the ways in which
Caesar portrays leadership through his own actions and that of others. His tactics of
delay and careful preparation and his perceptive understanding of his adversaries and
their relation to Roman history should emphasize for readers his subtle tailoring of the
story even within “simple” commentarii. In reading about the campaigns against the
Helvetii and Ariovistus in English, teachers are encouraged to look for passages to use
in class as sight-reading practice to match their students’ current abilities.

TEACHER TALK
In skipping ahead to Book 6, Chapters 13–15, teachers have a chance to show
another side of Caesar to their students. His ethnographic account not only should be
interesting to students but also gives many opportunities to show how the Romans
view non-Romans. The Latin selections from Book 6 likewise provide a way to frame
discussions of how the Romans viewed, or wanted to view, themselves. What might
students see in their own educational lives through Caesar’s portrayal of the way the
Druids were educated? The passages raise questions about how Caesar learned
what he told his readers and what information readers might have liked to have seen
included. In exploring the structure of Gallic class differences and religious leadership,
students get another chance to focus on morphology while translating the Latin texts.
Emphasizing the vocabulary both helps students translate and shows them the cultural
significance of Caesar’s word choice, leading to a fuller understanding of the section.

TEACHER TALK
The relatively simple structure of Book 6, Chapters 16–18, offers a good chance for
teachers to raise their expectations about student accuracy in the use of specific
terminology to identify forms and structures. These chapters also provide one of the
very few overt opportunities to discuss mythology in Caesar; again, what is Caesar
leaving out and what areas might students explore further? To help develop their essay writing skills, students should analyze these chapters in terms of their knowledge of the
products, practices, and perspectives of Roman culture. Making these connections,
either in class discussion or written work, will help them hone their analytical and
argumentative skills. Chapter 18 in particular gives students an opportunity to think
about how any group of people portray their ancestry and themselves, opening up
particularly fruitful comparison with Vergil and his epic. For example, what does it mean
for the Romans to be descended from Venus and Aeneas?

TEACHER TALK
These chapters give students another chance to explore the role of women in antiquity
as well as the economic and legal systems of the Romans as compared to those of
the Gauls. Moreover, teachers can focus on qualities of civic duty and leadership
as Caesar, in his account of Gallic views on gossip, asks Romans to consider where
they may fall short in these areas. How does Roman government work in this era, and
how does Caesar seem to think it should work? Chapter 20 will be particularly useful
when students later read Vergil’s description of Rumor in the Aeneid, Book 4. These
comparisons allow students to step back and reflect on their overall understanding
of a passage as well as providing an opportunity to strengthen their skills in choosing
relevant evidence in support of oral or written arguments. Grammar, vocabulary, and
literal translation remain important skills to emphasize even as these comparisons are
being made. If students seem to especially enjoy the selections from Book 6, teachers
could choose sight-reading passages from the material about the Germans, making sure to provide careful vocabulary support.

Vergil, Aeneid,
BOOK 2
Developing Understanding
Unit 3 returns to Vergil with Aeneas’s account of the fall of Troy. Students explore the author’s
portrayal of the seen and unseen forces in the characters’ lives and deaths. The Latin comes
from Book 2, beginning with Laocoön’s reaction to the Trojan Horse and his subsequent death
at the hands of the gods. As the Greek attack begins, Hector warns Aeneas to leave the city,
but, spurred on by a desire to protect his city and family, Aeneas remains behind to witness
firsthand the horrors of the destruction of Troy. Aeneas is on the verge of killing Helen to
avenge the inhabitants of Troy when his mother, Venus, instead persuades him to leave his
doomed city. By reading all of Book 2 in English, teachers can help students explore more fully
how Vergil weaves together history and memory in this tale of war and the fall of an empire, as
men plot and mortals serve as chess pieces in the games of the gods.

Building Course Skills
Students will continue to build and deepen skills set out in the previous units, this time with an emphasis on students’ ability to use specific terminology to identify grammatical forms and syntactic structures, to scan dactylic hexameter in Latin poetry, and to demonstrate knowledge of Latin vocabulary when translating Latin texts into English.
Students should practice reading and comprehending sight passages in poetry as well as articulating and supporting an argument using relevant evidence from
Latin texts and readings in English. Potential topics for contextual discussion in Unit 3 include the relation of the products and practices described in the Latin texts to our understanding of Roman culture in general and how knowledge of mythology and legends aids in understanding of Latin texts.
Preparing for the AP Exam
At this point in the course, students should be moving beyond responding to factual questions about a passage to considering more interpretive questions, which appear both in the multiple-choice and short answer questions. Students’ continuing work on literal translation will help them learn to distinguish among easily confused vocabulary words and ambiguous forms, which will help them do well on the sight reading questions. Students continue to improve their knowledge of mythology, history, and culture as well as their ability to scan a line of poetry. To further help students prepare for Question 3, have them work to supply accurate Latin paraphrases and complete conclusions in support of their analytical ideas.

A Note About Sight Reading Poetry
At this point in the course, it might be good to consider setting aside a day to work on sight
reading (as opposed to a few lines of a unit here and there through the course). It is important
to consider what resources will work best for a given set of students. Dickinson College has
gathered links to old textbooks that can be used for working on passages (Dickinson College
Commentaries).

The National Latin Exam makes available past exams online and offers other
resources as well. Although Level 5 exams are useful closer to May, there is no reason not to
choose a lower level passage earlier in the year to help students develop their sight-reading
skills. Ovid, Martial, Tibullus, and Catullus all might be good sources for passages to choose
from. Sight reading in front of students can be a scary but worthwhile exercise. In watching a
teacher go through the process, students learn that no reader is perfect. Teachers might need
to look up a word or two, verbalize their thoughts about chunking, and step back to model
overtly the skills they want their students to employ. It can be a good boost for students to
realize that all readers hone their skills each day, even if some are further along the proficiency scale than others.

TEACHER TALK
Because Book 2 is one of the books read in English, the small section of Latin lines that
begin Unit 3 present no difficulty in continuity. Teachers can either read up to them in
English with the class or, if students are reading more rapidly, they can read the Latin
for extra practice (prepared or at sight). Switching back to Vergil is an ideal opportunity
to work again on the vocabulary particular to this author. During this encounter with
Vergil, it is important to focus on developing students’ ability to explain the meaning
of those words and phrases in context. This is also a good time to work with students
on analyzing the stylistic features they find in Vergil—the effects of his language
usage—as they develop the skills of essay writing. You might also try connecting Vergil
to the wider artistic world with the famous statue of Laocoön from the Vatican Museum.
What images of fathers and sons, what pains of war will students see throughout the
unit? If there is time, students could also read Bernard Knox’s article, “The Serpent and the Flame.”

TEACHER TALK
Teachers can read lines 250–267 with students (in English or Latin as time permits)
to make sure they fully comprehend the deception of Sinon and the entrance of the
Greeks into a city whose populace had recently been so joyful over the end of the war.
Teachers can continue to have students review morphology to help them hone their
ability to translate literally. They can also point out for students Vergil’s use of Hector’s
dream to spur Aeneas to action; Vergil clearly drew from Homeric precedent in this
scene. Because the gods usually send this type of dream in epic poetry, it can be an
easy path into a discussion of the way Vergil uses gods in his own writing. Scansion and
reading aloud also need a place in this unit, and there are many fast-paced and exciting
scenes to contrast with somber tragic passages in Book 2. In reading the English up to
the next section of Latin lines, students should see how Aeneas’s pietas develops as he
fights in vain to save his city and witnesses further carnage. Do students’ impressions
change as they proceed to the end of the book? Students should be given time to think
through the issues of history and memory as they continue with this account of the
Trojan War.

Vergil, Aeneid, BOOK 2
TEACHER TALK
In picking up with the Helen episode, teachers have a nice opportunity to talk about
textual editions and the transmission of manuscripts. The scene lends itself to a useful
contrast between remembering Aeneas’s family and his rage at Helen. Students can
share their thoughts about the fact that it is Venus who appears to enlighten Aeneas
about the fate of Troy and his own destiny. This can lead to discussions about Roman
families and, certainly, about the role of the gods in epic poetry. While reading this
section of the Latin, students can work on their understanding of syntax and how it
supports and solidifies comprehension of a text. As teachers take time to finish the
reading of Book 2 in English, they can ask questions: What do students remember
about Roman religion and values—their products and practices—as they see Aeneas
taking the Penates, his father, and his son safely from the city? What must Dido be
thinking in the last scenes as Aeneas recalls searching for the lost Creusa? Whose
voice do they hear, Aeneas’s as narrator or Vergil’s as author? In working with them
on essay writing, teachers should encourage students to include specific, relevant
references to a Latin text as they support their claims.

Bullet Why do scenes of bravery by a common soldier make us think that Caesar is a good leader?
Bullet How might tales of far-off lands and daring battles inspire Roman youth to follow Caesar into the military or simply to follow him?
Developing Understanding
Unit 4 returns to Caesar and the Romans’ first invasion of Britain, giving students a chance
to explore themes of leadership and of war and empire. The Latin comes from Book 4 of the
Gallic War and begins with a difficult landing, strategic leadership, and Roman heroics. Once
landfall is made and an uncomfortable peace is established, bad weather sets the Romans
up for further difficulties as the Britons renew their hostilities. Insisting that the betrayal
was no surprise to him, Caesar immediately works to get back on an even footing, ordering
that his remaining ships be repaired. Although their style of chariot fighting initially gives
the Britons the upper hand, the Romans recover, sustaining the attack until they can return
to the continent. The readings serve as a further opportunity for students to explore the
theme of leadership in a time of war while learning about a region that would later become a part of the Roman empire.
Building Course Skills
In this unit, the emphasis is on students’ increasingly sophisticated ability to demonstrate knowledge of Latin syntax to read and comprehend Latin texts. As they read Latin prose aloud, they work to pay attention to linguistic and artistic qualities; they also work to identify stylistic features in Latin prose. Students continue to demonstrate an understanding of differences between Latin and English usage when translating Latin texts into English.
Students should begin to practice reading and comprehending sight passages in prose as well as using accurate, specific, and relevant references to the Latin texts to support an articulated argument. Potential topics for contextual discussion in Unit 4 include the relation of Roman cultural products in the Latin texts to perspectives of Roman culture and how knowledge of authors or literary conventions aids in understanding of Latin texts.
Preparing for the AP Exam
For Question 2 on the exam, students should practice using appropriate English constructions and idioms to reflect the
Latin they are translating. Their efforts at literal translation will aid them in identifying and understanding complex grammatical constructions, which will benefit their performance across all components of the exam. Students should continue to improve in the application of contextual knowledge and in their ability to identify a variety of grammatical, syntactic, and literary structures. This work will help them prepare for Question 5 and the multiple choice questions. Finally, students should practice providing analytical arguments and inferences for a full passage with accurate citation and context.

A Note About Sight Reading Prose
At this point in the course, it might be good to consider setting aside a day for working on sight
reading prose passages. As with any other work on Latin text, sight passages should be read
aloud to help students work on their phrasing and structure. As students work on vocabulary
for a sight-reading passage, teachers can help them to work carefully when using derivatives—
false etymologies can occlude the meanings of words they should and do know. Students
should look for contextual clues based on their knowledge of mythology, culture, or history;
they should also keep the basics of morphology and syntax in mind as they approach the
passage. Just as teachers would not likely choose Horace, Juvenal, or Lucan for sight reading
in poetry, they should probably shy away from Tacitus or Sallust for prose passages, especially
earlier in the year. Still, Nepos, Cicero (other than the letters), Livy, Pliny the Younger, and
Seneca the Younger are all useful sources for passages at sight. The Latin Library and other
online resources make finding a passage easy even for schools with limited resources.

TEACHER TALK
Students need to have a picture of the years intervening between Caesar’s account in
Books 1 and 4; teachers can discuss what is happening politically in Rome as well as
in the battle scenes being described. Because Book 4 is not one of those also read in
English, it is important for students to have a good grasp of the events leading up to
the Latin passages. Some students might be well prepared culturally for this foray into
Britain, but for others, a little extra time should be spent on historical background. It is
helpful to focus on vocabulary in switching authors, and Caesar’s syntax also provides
an opportunity for students to review what they know for comprehension and literal
translation. This can be a good time to work on stylistic features and the effects of
Caesar’s language usage. Finally, what do students think of Caesar’s leadership in this
new phase of the war, focusing on British fighting techniques and the difficulties of the landing?

TEACHER TALK
How should students interpret Caesar’s account of the Romans’ struggles with the
British terrain? Does Caesar’s focus on the weather working against them make
students think the commander is trying to avoid responsibility or that he is providing
a genuine account of the setbacks encountered by the Romans? If pacing allows, a
teacher could supply accounts of the weather affecting D-Day, or other accounts of
British weather from the past or present, to see if they enhance students’ impressions
of these Latin passages. Teachers can remind students of the differences between
commentarii and history for a Roman reader; does this account have the feel of “factual”
reporting, warts and all? What were some of the practical and political reasons for
Caesar’s choice of literary genre? It is a good idea to give students extra questions on
grammar and syntax during the work on literal translation for this reading, in order to
build on their growing abilities with prose and with this author in particular.

TEACHER TALK
In reading the Latin in these chapters for literal translation, teachers can help students
bring precision to the way they explain the Latin words and phrases in context. In
working on overall comprehension and culture, the Latin here provides a good chance
to review Roman attitudes about sailing and to study the sorts of ships and materials
they used; these topics help students build their knowledge of Roman cultural products.
Teachers can ask students how Caesar’s focus on the difficulties of the weather and the
cleverness of his opponents heighten his portrayal of his own leadership. Would these
factors make them want to join Caesar’s army or shy away from the hardships? Can the
students try to envision what a young man in Rome might think about his chances for
adventure in far-off lands after hearing these reports? What in his accounts might have
inspired later leaders to complete the invasion of the island?

TEACHER TALK
In working on the Latin in these chapters, students need to demonstrate their
understanding of the differences between Latin and English usage. Caesar in particular
provides many opportunities to work on this skill. Students can then consider how
Caesar highlights the prowess of the Roman fighting force in these chapters. The
British style of chariot fighting was new to the Romans—and terribly effective. How
does Caesar try to help his contemporary readers see the differences between the
British style and the ways Romans would be used to seeing chariots used? Do the
students know enough about gladiatorial fighting to know that Romans were interested
in watching how other nations or tribes fought? How does Caesar’s buildup of the scene
add both to the heroism of the individual fighters and to his own prestige as a leader?
In working on essay-writing skills, teachers can again help students to use relevant
references to the English and Latin in supporting their claims and also show them
how accurate, relevant, and specific references to the Latin in particular will help them develop their overall arguments.

Developing Understanding
Unit 5 returns to Vergil and the love affair of Queen Dido and Aeneas, giving students an
opportunity to explore Roman values through their views of non-Romans. Brought together in
Carthage by Venus and Juno, the pair are happy until Rumor works her evil; Iarbas, a spurned
suitor of Dido, appeals to Jupiter for redress. Mercury is sent to remind Aeneas of his duty to
his fate, and Aeneas orders his men to ready for departure. Though Aeneas has tried to keep
his plans secret, Dido discovers what he is doing and confronts him; his self-defense does
not satisfy the enraged queen. We are left with the scene of her suicide and the small act of
compassion shown by Juno, who sends Iris to hasten Dido’s death. By reading all of Book 4 in
English, teachers can help students explore a fuller picture of Dido and the way the gods and Aeneas’s fate lead to her demise.
Building Course Skills
Preparing for the AP Exam
In this unit, the emphasis is on student ability to read Latin poetry aloud with attention to linguistic and artistic qualities, to identify stylistic features in Latin poetry, and to demonstrate knowledge of Latin grammar and syntax when translating Latin texts into
English. Students should focus on analyzing the effects of language usage and stylistic features in Latin texts as well as using accurate, specific, and relevant references to the Latin to support an articulated argument.
Potential topics for contextual discussion in Unit 5 include the relation of Roman cultural practices in the Latin texts to perspectives of Roman culture and how knowledge of authors or literary conventions aids understanding of Latin texts.
At this point in the course, students should be focusing on more sophisticated interpretive questions about Latin passages and on figurative meanings for vocabulary such as easily confused words.
Their increasingly solid abilities in reading and comprehension will aid them in dealing with Latin constructions that cannot be translated literally and meaningfully into
English. Extra practice in this area will help them be better prepared for the syllabus passage on the exam. Students should increasingly be able to handle more complex lines of scansion, implied contextual references, and particularly complex literary structures. In preparation for the essay on Question 3, students should practice displaying the appropriate application of contextual or linguistic analysis within a coherent, logical structure.

TEACHER TALK
In returning to Vergil, teachers should take care to set the stage: what happened in Book
3 and what is the narrative leading up to the resumption of the Latin lines being studied
in Book 4? A portrayal of a non-Roman, the Carthaginian Dido, should lead naturally
to a discussion of Roman values. What prior knowledge of Roman marriage rites,
portrayals of love, and descriptions of Rumor do students need to remember before
embarking on the next stage of the story? In other words, how will students identify
references to Roman culture, history, and mythology in the Roman texts to enhance their
understanding? Furthermore, how can consideration of the vocabulary of those topics
aid students as they approach the text? Though this passage is read in English, students
need to remember the descriptions of Aeneas and Dido upon leaving for the hunt, and
how hunting fit into Roman culture, so that they understand how quickly those divine
comparisons are subverted and how a nature scene is perverted by the collusion of
Juno and Venus. The use of the storm to represent the elements of a wedding and the
personification of Rumor are both powerful images to explore. The appearance of Iarbas
as a doubly foreign leader (foreign to both Aeneas and Dido), as well as the appearance
of Jupiter in another land, will require cultural scaffolding for the students.

TEACHER TALK
After making sure that students understand the story covered between line 218 and
the current section (both reading the passage in English and, perhaps, using the Latin
lines for sight reading), teachers can turn to the Homeric-type scene in the message
of Mercury. This passage presents another opportunity to discuss the ways gods
appear in epic literature from Homer on. Aeneas’s rhetorical questions might seem
like dithering, and his covert call to his men might seem underhanded to the students,
but both quickly lead to a picture of leadership when Aeneas regains his purpose after
Jupiter’s relayed message. Teachers may present the cliché “discretion is the better part
of valor” and ask the students to debate the situation. What historical factors may make
Dido seem a much more dangerous opponent to Roman readers than she seems to us
from Vergil’s portrayal up to this point? How does understanding Aeneas’s fate play into
students’ reactions to the scene? In reading the Latin, help students continue to develop
their ability to demonstrate an understanding of differences between Latin and English usage when translating Latin poetry into English.

TEACHER TALK
The main focus in the reading is to help students achieve a literal translation of these
lines, but if teachers can find time, there are several important literary predecessors they
should bring in to enhance the students’ experience. A dramatic reading of Medea’s
confrontation of Jason in Euripides’ tragedy or of Ariadne’s lament from Catullus 64
provide powerful examples of ancient portrayals of the ferocity of women’s anger. These
examples provide good opportunities to take discussions of Vergil’s use of literature
beyond the genre of epic. One creative way for students to demonstrate overall
comprehension of the Latin is to stage a mini “trial” of Aeneas, using dialogue based on
the actions or speeches of each character. This is also a good time to review scansion
with students; while some students are likely to be relatively comfortable with the skill at
this point, others may still be coming to terms with the basics of the process.

TEACHER TALK
Quite a bit of Dido’s story needs to be covered in English readings and classroom
discussion before approaching the last of the Latin lines in this unit: Dido’s reply to
Aeneas, her lament, decision to die, and curse on Aeneas’s descendants; Aeneas’s
preparation of his ships; Anna’s efforts on behalf of her sister; and the second
appearance of Mercury to hasten Aeneas’s departure. Students should once again
consider the Roman values displayed, this time via Vergil’s portrayal of a sister’s love
and the renewed determination in the preparations of the hero. In picking up the Latin,
students encounter the description of Dido’s suicide and a final treatment of gossip and
Rumor in the city of Carthage. If students are unsettled by Dido’s actions, remind them
of the cultural differences between the Romans and modern-day people, the literary
precedents of her actions, and the role of the gods in Dido’s end. Do Juno’s compassion
toward Dido and Iris’s appearance exonerate the gods at all in students’ eyes? Ask
students to explore what stylistic features enhance Vergil’s lines here. This is also a
good time to focus on inferences within argumentation based on poetic lines, and to
follow up on the importance of finding good support in the Latin text for one’s claims.

Developing Understanding
Unit 6 returns to Caesar and the first half of the readings from Book 5, giving students a
fitting chance to explore the themes of history and memory as portrayed in Caesar’s literary
style and genre The passages begin with the stationing of the troops in winter quarters,
the introduction of the Gallic leader Tasgetius, and the revolt of Ambiorix and Cativolcus. To
strengthen his claims of innocence, Ambiorix warns of an impending attack by the Gauls and
German mercenaries. Lengthy deliberations and the disagreement of Sabinus and Cotta
precede the Romans’ ruinous departure from their winter quarters. Despite Cotta’s steady
leadership in battle, the Romans are overcome; Sabinus is killed during a parlay with Ambiorix,
and Cotta dies fighting with his men. Only a few Romans escape the slaughter and make their
way to Labienus at his winter quarters. Caesar’s secondhand account of the disaster contains
many subtle comments about leadership as he distances himself from the scene.
Building Course Skills
Students will continue building skills from previous units, recalling especially the techniques they have learned concerning vocabulary, morphology, grammar, and syntax. While continuing their work on literal translation as well as reading and comprehending sight passages, students should also focus on analyzing the effects of language usage and stylistic features, using reasoning to draw conclusions and make inferences based on textual features, and using contextual knowledge and references to support the analysis of their essays. Potential topics for contextual discussion in Unit 6 include how knowledge of influential people and key historical events aids in understanding the texts and how knowledge of Roman political ideas enhances understanding of Roman culture i
Latin texts.
Preparing for the AP Exam
To further hone their skills for Question 2, students would do well to focus on interpretation of complex phrases and syntax and on consistent precision throughout their literal translations. Their increasingly sophisticated abilities in reading and comprehension should help them refine their use of appropriate English constructions and idioms. For the multiple-choice questions, students will need to be able to handle more complex contextual references as well as more complex grammatical and syntactical structures. In their essays, students should strive to develop a nuanced understanding of full passages and the finer details of their overall analysis.

TEACHER TALK
Taking time to outline the end of Book 4 and the start of Book 5 for students will help
them understand where political and military matters stand as they begin reading the
Latin. Learning about the figures and events leading up to this moment is important
for a full understanding of the tensions of the scene. It is always helpful to start with
and to keep reviewing vocabulary, but teachers will need to specifically help students
with the complexities of tense sequence in Caesar. These complexities present a
nice opportunity to review morphological forms once again with the students as they
translate. Units 6 and 7 comprise a long discussion of what happens when Caesar is not
around and directly in charge; there are good leaders at hand, but they cannot prevent
others from leading their men into the enemy’s trap. Keeping the flow of the story in
mind will be important for these two units, and teachers can help students by taking
time now to point out larger patterns they will encounter in Book 5 and determine how they will keep track of the narrative.

TEACHER TALK
The ploy on the part of Ambiorix to deceive the Romans provides an opportunity to
discuss not only Caesar’s view of non-Romans but also, perhaps more importantly,
Caesar’s portrayal of Roman reactions to other peoples, as well as some of the value
systems of other peoples, as relevant to the events described. What do students need
to review about the workings of the Roman army and the structure of winter quarters
in order to understand the scene? What is the expected dynamic between these two
leaders, and where does one or the other try to manipulate the situation to try to get
his way as the narrative advances? The debate between Cotta and Sabinus, begun in
these chapters with Cotta’s opinions about the intention of the Gauls and Ambiorix’s
suggestion, provide excellent opportunities for discussions of military structure as
well as senatorial debate. Students could opt to demonstrate overall comprehension
by acting out the scene. As students continue to work on literal translation, Caesar’s
prose again offers ample practice in explaining the meaning of Latin words and phrases in context.

This is a good time to address whether students have grown in their ability to
demonstrate an understanding of the differences between Latin and English usage
when translating Latin texts into English. If not, what drills or exercises might a teacher
develop to help students gain more confidence as they translate? The Latin provides
a lot of excitement as the story continues, but it is a good idea to pause to focus the
students’ attention on the ways in which Caesar creates that drama. What aspects
of Caesar’s writing make him a good storyteller? Note also that Caesar mentions an
extended debate after Sabinus presents his opinion. What reasons can students give
for why the debate is not recounted in its entirety, and can they connect their reasons
to the theme of memory and history? Ask students to consider what the two leaders
and their supporters might be thinking as Cotta yields. How does Caesar show the
emotional effects of this argument on the soldiers, and how do those emotions affect their preparedness for what lies ahead?

TEACHER TALK
In these chapters, readers see the enemy set up the ambush and Caesar continuing his
characterization of the Roman leaders. Sabinus, unprepared, continues to show poor
judgment; Cotta, on the other hand, again shows good preparation and perceptiveness.
Whose glory do his abilities and heroics really reflect? Teachers can remind students to
treat vocabulary not just as a challenge but as a window into the author’s portrayal of the
scene. What is the deeper meaning of the word? Either to foreshadow the next section
or as consolidation after reading, students should consider other times they have
encountered leaders who exhibit poor planning or impulsive natures in Roman history.
How did those incidents turn out? Teachers can also ask students to make connections
to their other classes by thinking about other examples of good and bad leaders or
battles well or poorly planned. Other cultural connections might include asking the
students to consider what virtues the characters in this section portray (check out the
website Roman Virtues). Or, students could discuss the difference between Ares and Athena—which gods were governing these scenes?

Caesar, Gallic War, BOOK 5 PART I
TEACHER TALK
In thinking about building essay skills with this unit, this is a good time to have students
work specifically on inferences. This last step is the hardest for most students when
they are trying to build a solid argument. Often, they have a decent claim and can
identify context and even Latin passages that support their claim, but they expect their
reader to fill in from there. Adding why what they have cited completes their argument is
the necessary final skill of strong essay writing. These readings offer many worthwhile
opportunities to focus on overall comprehension of the Latin at hand and of the scene
as a whole. Although writing commentarii rather than history, how does Caesar succeed
in including the moral lessons a Roman reader of history might expect? Make sure that
the student summary of the unit includes the material in these chapters, as Cotta is
wounded and Sabinus suggests parley with the enemy. What do the students make of
the scene where Cotta refuses to approach the enemy as Sabinus is drawn into a trap
and slain? Could anything have been done to prevent the death of Cotta or the Roman
soldiers, whose bravery is highlighted even in the face of overwhelming odds?

Bullet How do we read these scenes differently with the perspective of time?
Developing Understanding
Unit 7 focuses on the second half of the readings from Book 5 of the Gallic War, providing
ample opportunity for students to explore the theme of leadership in war. Fresh from his
victory, Ambiorix enlists the Aduatuci and Nervii along with a collection of other tribes to help
attack Cicero’s winter quarters. During the hard-fought defense, students read of the bravery
of Pullo and Veranus and see how they support one another despite their personal animosity.
Also showcased is the loyalty and cleverness of the Nervian Vertico, who finally succeeds in
getting word to Caesar about the attack in progress. Caesar’s nimble organization allows him to bring aid to Cicero’s camp in time.
By reading all of Books 6 and 7 in English, teachers can help students explore the
ethnographic material on the Germans for another view of non-Romans and then consider
the revolt of Vercingetorix, whose final stand at Alesia highlights Roman battle tactics and
abilities at siege warfare as well as Caesar’s leadership in overcoming this enemy.
Building Course Skills
Students are by now demonstrating a fairly high level of overall comprehension of passages and also generally identifying references to Roman culture, history, and mythology in Latin texts with accuracy.
Students should continue to be given frequent practice on literal translation and sight reading as they work to analyze Latin texts based on knowledge of the products, practices, and perspectives of Roman culture. Students should also practice full versions of individual free-response questions to gauge appropriate pacing.
Teachers should begin to review test-taking tips and strategies as well as go over the formal format of the exam and exam day schedule so that students are comfortable with the formal procedures of the AP Exam.
Preparing for the AP Exam
To prepare for Question 2 of the free response section, students practice literal translation, with the same expectations of precision required on the AP Exam. During this practice, students should proofread their work to account for every word in the passages and to double-check the tense, voice, and mood of the verbs as well as the case and number of the nouns. Students are encouraged to take full advantage of glosses and notes provided for a text, which provide valuable information for accurate translation.

TEACHER TALK
Vocabulary remains as important as ever in literal translation, but in this last prose unit,
teachers can also focus on morphology and syntax and start to think about final review
for the AP Exam. As students continue with the narrative, they will see Ambiorix win over
the Nervii and other tribes due to his victories over the Romans so far. Do the students
think that Caesar is making a point in these defections about non-Romans or simply
about the nature of warfare in general? With the scenes of danger in Cicero’s camp
and the fact that messages cannot get through to Caesar, students should again be
asked to look at the geography of the area and the structure and normal operations of a
Roman camp. What do we know of Roman military sites from their literature or material
remains? A student with particular interest in the subject could be pointed to the
remains of Vindolana, near Hadrian’s Wall; though slightly out of the time period, the site provides a wealth of data for students to peruse.

TEACHER TALK
Because Cicero will not take terms from an armed enemy, his camp is besieged. The
students should be asked what messages from Unit 6 Caesar is reinforcing by setting
up these contrasting scenes so clearly. Teachers can also point out the bravery of
the common soldiers, portrayed in this reading as calm despite the seriousness of
the danger. What do these images of “proper” leadership and “good” Roman soldiers
say about the way things should run when Caesar is not at hand? In other words,
what Roman cultural practices are evident in this section, and how do they add to the
students’ perspective of Roman culture? As the exam approaches, teachers can ask
students to articulate the specific terminology to identify grammatical structures
themselves. These reviews can be done through class discussion, used as checks on
homework, or serve as exit slips after a day of translation.

1.G: Identify stylistic features in Latin poetry and prose.
TEACHER TALK
These chapters present the exciting rivalry of Pullo and Vorenus: whether or not these
two really existed, they provide a wonderful set piece within the narrative that should
resonate with students. Students surely can see the lesson that “real” Romans, even if
rivals, should unite for the safety of each other and their camp, just as team members
are supposed to work hard and play hard on behalf of their teammates and school,
setting aside personal tensions once they are engaged on the field of play. What other
“minor” characters lend a fuller picture of camp life and the war as a whole in this unit?
Caesar continues his positive portrayal of a leader in recounting Cicero’s clever way of
getting a message to his commander. Students should work to articulate what stylistic
features Caesar uses in this section to heighten the intensity of the scene. They should
also apply their knowledge about and identification of those stylistic features to better
understand a text and to support arguments they make in their essays.

Having set up the incredible danger of the situation, the desperation of the camp, the
way the leader of a winter camp should behave, and the heroics of the common soldiers
involved, Caesar has a narrative arc primed to showcase his own speed and ingenuity in
getting a message back to Cicero. In looking at Units 6 and 7 in tandem, there are many
ways to round out discussion and focus review on Caesar’s prose style and shape of
the narrative. One important point to emphasize for students is the use of contextual
knowledge—which grows with each new reading—to support their arguments as they
write and revise their essays. Teachers can ask students what references to Roman
culture, history, and mythology they can identify and how those references might help
them to better understand the passages they have read or might encounter in sight
reading. In planning the unit, consider what overall review of vocabulary, syntax, and
other skills students will need as they consolidate the material.

TEACHER TALK
Students now have an opportunity to read Book 6 in English. Because the Latin for
this book was presented previously in Unit 2, this is an excellent time to ask students
to reread the Latin text, perhaps assigning the chapters to individual students or pairs
to take their peers back through the material. This approach gives students a chance
to generate for themselves a list of syntactical structures they still need to review. Not
only can students review information on the Gauls, they now can contrast it with that
of the Germans and discuss both in light of Roman culture itself. Ask why Caesar, in
the midst of the Gallic revolt, takes the time to include this information for his readers.
Book 6 provides one of the few opportunties to discuss mythology in Caesar, and there
are a multitude of ways the combination of Latin, English readings, and previously read
material can be used to help students enhance their skills.

While students are reading Book 7 in English, teachers can also give them a chance
to review the story as a whole. Remind them that, although they have read portions
of the Gallic War over the course of this year, the book itself was seven years in the
making. Depending on what specific assessment or assignment is required for Book
7, in-class time could be devoted to a review of the techniques of reading Latin at
sight. It would also be useful to remind students of the steps in creating claims for an
essay prompt. There are many potential topics for supplementary study, review, and
discussion: What influential people and key historical events will students need to learn
about to demonstrate understanding of the Latin texts? How do scholars fill in the
gaps of Caesar’s account in order to provide a full picture of the story? What images
or descriptions of the archaeological remains at Alesia would assist the students in
envisioning the final siege? How did the Roman people view this war? How deep is
students’ understanding of the realities of the years of war in Gaul, Germany, and Britain for the inhabitants of those countries?

Bullet Was fate or the gods in charge of the narrative?
Developing Understanding
This final unit returns to Vergil and the themes of literary style and genre and of human beings
and the gods. The Latin in this section takes us to the shores of Acheron and explores the
pathos of encountering the unburied dead. We meet Charon, navigate the Styx, and see the
Underworld’s guardian, Cerberus. While on his journey, Aeneas sees Dido and makes his final
attempt at reconciliation with her. His father, Anchises, appears to him and shows him the
future glory of the Romans. Finally, Aeneas and the Sibyl depart the Underworld through the gate of ivory.
By reading Books 6, 8, and 12 in English, teachers can help students explore how Vergil
combines mythology, philosophy, and Roman history; investigate Vergil’s portrayal of the
people inhabiting the future site of Rome as Aeneas struggles to save his men from war;
and consider again the motivations and machinations of the gods. The death of Turnus is
an uncomfortable last image for the epic, but one that is true to Vergil’s portrayal of war’s destructiveness.
Building Course Skills
Students are by now highly proficient in the skills built in previous units. In this unit, the emphasis is on demonstrating overall comprehension of passages and identifying references to Roman culture, history, and mythology in Latin texts. Students should continue to be given frequent practice on literal translation of sight reading as they work to analyze Latin texts based on knowledge of products, practices, and perspectives of Roman culture. Students should also practice full versions of individual free-response questions to gauge appropriate pacing. Teachers should continue to review test taking tips and strategies as well as go over the formal format of the exam and exam day schedule so that students are comfortable with the formal procedures of the AP Exam.
Preparing for the AP Exam
To prepare for Question 4 of the free response section, students should step back from literal translation to express more general comprehension of lines and passages. They should also be able to identify syntax and grammatical constructions as well as contextual connections present in the readings. To prepare for Question 3, students can practice quickly reading Latin passages and outlining an answer to an essay prompt.
Teachers can encourage students to tie their analysis, conclusions, and appropriate contextual references to specific citations and not to rely on single words or depend on impressions of stylistic approaches.

TEACHER TALK
It would be a good idea to review Book 5 with students before getting into the English
readings of Book 6 and leading into the Latin lines here. The Temple at Cumae and the
Sibyl, Aeneas’s reaction to the prophecy and request to enter the Underworld, and the
preparations for that trip, including the scene with the Golden Bough, all provide useful
points of discussion about Vergil’s use of Greek mythological material. In approaching
this last unit, what Vergilian vocabulary do the students need to review or learn in order
to be able to translate the author? Can students apply the skills they have developed,
especially in Units 6 and 7 on Caesar, to use specific terminology to identify grammatical
forms and syntactic structures in Vergil? Turning to discussion of the Latin, teachers can
ask students to contrast the portrayal of the rough, elderly Charon to that of the lovely
Dido or handsome Aeneas they met going to the hunt in Book 4.

TEACHER TALK
Teachers can have students read the English to discover what happened between the
last reading and this one and, perhaps, use lines for sight-reading practice if time allows.
Make sure students know the Homeric precedent for Palinurus and how Vergil improves
on the sacrificial death of that character. In approaching the Latin here, teachers can
point out how many references to previous authors and stories about the Underworld
Vergil is able to pack into these lines. What other pieces of literature and what other
myths are contained in his account? Students can be reminded at this point that the
traditions of ancient literature meant that the references were a respected approach in
antiquity due to the erudition they imply. What items of Latin syntax do students need
to review in order to comprehend these lines, and how do they demonstrate knowledge
of this grammar in their literal translations? The complexity of the appearance of the
Golden Bough can serve as a good test of their readiness with these skills.

TEACHER TALK
The small passage to read in English before the next Latin lines provides another
chance for extra practice, seen or at sight, with Vergil’s Latin. The required lines in Latin,
which include the last appearance of Dido and Aeneas’s final plea for forgiveness,
supply a coda for and a chance to review the events of that book. Does Aeneas’s
apology for those he has hurt on his mission change the hero in the view of the
students? As students approach exam time, teachers can check on how they are doing
in demonstrating differences in Latin and English usages in their translations. How much
work do they need on scansion in order to be ready for the questions on the AP Exam,
and are they familiar with the two formats of those questions (multiple choice and free
response)? This reading also provides a chance to preview some of the many influential
people and historical events that Vergil includes in the passages students will read in English before the next required lines of Latin.

N/A
TEACHER TALK
The readings in English include the Sibyl’s description of Tartarus and the approach
to Elysium, and teachers should help students to see how Vergil’s intricate but purely
mythological portrayal of the Underworld gives way to something even more complex.
By including the parade of heroes and the idea of those souls yet traveling to the world
of the living, Vergil combines Roman history and Greek philosophy in his account. In fact,
after finishing the English readings, some students may be interested in reading Plato’s
Myth of Er, which is approachable and not too long. What, if anything, in Book 6 reflects
Roman religious beliefs? With the last Latin lines, students are introduced to the gates
of horn and ivory. As students step back to show comprehension of these lines, what
knowledge of mythology, culture, and history aid them in their overall understanding?
In thinking about essay writing, teachers can review the basics of creating a claim,
supporting it with specific Latin text, and fully articulating inferences, while also
remembering the importance of contextual knowledge in supporting the analysis.

1.H: Identify references to Roman culture, history, and mythology in Latin texts.
1.H.i: Identify references to Roman culture (e.g., Penates, centurio, virtus, pietas) in Latin texts.
4: Textual Analysis
4.B: Analyze Latin texts based on knowledge of products, practices, and perspectives of Roman culture.
4.B.i: Analyze the Latin texts based on knowledge of Roman
culture (e.g., use of cultural products such as the signa;
cultural practices such as military techniques; cultural
perspectives such as virtus, dignitas, pietas, auctoritas).
TEACHER TALK
Before reading Book 8 in English, teachers will want to recap the events of Book 7 so
that students understand how Aeneas went from such a powerfully positive prophecy at
the end of Book 6 to needing allies for a war in Book 8. Mythology and omens continue
to play an important part in this book with Aeneas’s dream of Tiberinus, the actions of
his mother, Venus, and the artistic genius of her husband, Vulcan, with the presentation
of the shield. Teachers can discuss the rhetorical device ekphrasis and ask students
how it is used to reinforce the importance of history and prophecy as Vergil once again
portrays the fated rise of the Romans. Students can analyze these readings based
on their knowledge of the products, practices, and perspectives of Roman culture as
practice for the same sort of work they will do with Latin texts. How do these three
elements relate to one another? If possible, include sight-reading work and remind
students how knowledge of mythology, culture, and history can aid them in their overall comprehension of sight passages.

3.B.i: Identify Roman political ideas (e.g., libertas, pietas,
virtus) not directly stated in the Latin texts, based on context or outside knowledge.
3.B.ii: Explain Roman political ideas as relevant to the Latin texts.
3.B.iii: Connect information in the required English readings
to information in the Latin texts, as relevant to Roman political ideas.
4: Textual Analysis
4.A: Analyze the effects of language usage and stylistic features in Latin texts.
4.A.i: Analyze the effects of language usage (e.g., word choice, ambiguity, word order).
4.A.ii: Analyze the effects of stylistic features (e.g.,
characterization, rhetorical strategies, poetic devices).
5: Argumentation
5.B: Support the argument using relevant evidence from Latin texts and readings in English.
N/A
TEACHER TALK
Before reading Book 12 in English, students should familiarize themselves with the basic
narrative of Books 9–11. This can be through student presentations, a teacher’s summary,
or simply reading an outline. What knowledge of Roman political ideas might inform the
reading of Book 12? What material do students need to review to help them with sight reading passages or cultural questions on the AP Exam? In reviewing the skills of essay
writing, teachers can remind students to support their claims with firm evidence, asking
them how analysis of the effects of language usage and stylistic features or cultural
material can further support their arguments. In turning to discussion of the plot, how
does this war over a bride circle back to the origins of the ordeals of the Trojans? How do
the scenes with Nisus and Euryalus or Mezentius and Lausus heighten the tragedy of the
war? What about Pallas and Evander or Juturna’s love for her brother? In the end, how
did fate lead Aeneas through his trials, what gods either supported or hindered him, and
what were their motivations? What do the students make of Aeneas after the last scene,
especially in light of ancient portrayals of rage and the madness of war?

Introduction
The Achievement Level Descriptions define how well student
performance meets learning objectives in each skill category.
Due to the interrelated nature of the skills, all the achievement
level descriptions work in concert with one another and should
be considered holistically. While references to levels 1–5
cannot precisely predict a student’s ultimate score on the AP
Exam, AP teachers can use this information to develop better
insight into individual student performance and adjust their curriculum and instruction accordingly.
The AP Latin course and exam target a range of student performance so that all students
can experience success in some or most skills. The Achievement Level Descriptions (ALDs)
provide detailed expectations for performance in each skill at each level so both students
and teachers can understand what typical performance is required for skills at each different
level. Teachers and students can use them to develop strategies for moving to the next level
of performance. It is important to remember that students’ ability to function in each skill
may be different; for example, a student may perform at an ALD skill level of 4 in reading and
comprehension but may be at the 3 level in textual analysis.
Across the spectrum of the course’s skills we have also defined each skill in the range of three skill levels:
§Bullet E: Emerging. Students are generally performing at ALD level 2.
§Bullet P: Proficient. Students are generally performing in the range of ALD levels 3-4.
Bullet A: Advanced. Students are generally performing in the range of ALD levels 4-5.
This graphic shows the progression of ALDs in relation to their E/P/A designation:

Selecting and Using Course Materials
There are several textbooks that focus on the texts for the AP Latin Exam and also include ancillary
materials such as guided questions or practice tasks.
It is also possible to find college-level texts that include the course readings and more. Textbooks should be considered as resources to guide and support instruction.
Following are some additional helpful resources for teachers.
The Dickinson College Commentaries offer vocabulary lists, grammars, the AP syllabus in an interactive format, and selections from many
other authors that can provide additional practice reading Latin.
The Vergil Project has text, commentary, and other
resources for the Aeneid, and there is a series of web essays available in connection with The Landmark
Julius Caesar. Hexameter.co is a nice resource for practicing scansion. Operation Lapis has tiered readings for the AP passages and more.
There are many good Latin dictionaries online, of
which the University of Chicago’s Logeion is one good example. Both Bennett’s and Allen & Greenough’s
Latin grammars are online. Latintutorial introduces and
reviews many aspects of Latin instruction for all levels.
The American Classical League (ACL) offers
scholarships, publications, and training for teachers at all levels.
The Society for Classical Studies (SCS) provides awards, scholarly material, and information about programs and funding opportunities of interest to classicists.
The Classical Association of the Atlantic States,
the Classical Association of the Middle, West, and
South, the Classical Association of New England, and
the Classical Association of the Pacific Northwest
all provide resources, fellowship, and funding to aid
teachers at all levels. In addition, many states and
communities have their own societies to promote both
the classics and classical scholarship and pedagogy.
The American Council on the Teaching of Foreign
Languages (ACTFL) is the largest organization of world
language educators in the USA. ACTFL has worked in
conjunction with the ACL and the SCS to produce the
revised Standards for Classical Language Learning,
a draft of which is currently available on the ACL’s website. ACTFL also offers many current documents that inform instruction and assessment.
Bullet Performance Descriptors for Language Learners:
This document defines and describes the levels of language performance (Novice, Intermediate,
Advanced) in each of the modes of communication
that result from explicit instruction in a classroom setting. It also explains the difference between proficiency and performance.
Bullet ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines 2012: This site defines and describes the levels of proficiency in speaking, writing, listening, and reading that result from language learned within and beyond the classroom.
Bullet NCSSFL-ACTFL Can-do Statements: This document guides language learners to identify and set learning goals and chart their progress
toward language and intercultural proficiency. The statements are organized according to the modes of communication. It helps students and teachers establish and work toward reasonable goals for progress.

Additional Course Elements
Translation
Literal translation is encouraged in every unit to help
students build precision with both their understanding of the Latin passages and the grammatical and
syntactical knowledge that underpins that precision.
Scansion, context, and literary terminology should be
reinforced frequently in order to move students from
a shaky recitation of information to a deeper ability to
infer knowledge from the text at hand. The analytical
essay, a more complex task, is taught incrementally
so that students develop skills over time and through practice before engaging with a full task model.
Each unit provides personal progress checks that
inform students about how they are progressing and let teachers know when additional instruction may be needed.
Readings in English
The required content for the course includes not just
readings in Latin but also readings in English from
Vergil’s Aeneid and Caesar’s Gallic War. The purpose
of the English readings is to put the Latin passages in
context with their significant themes, central characters,
and key ideas. The English readings also help students
relate the passages studied in Latin to the themes and essential questions proposed for the course.
Understanding the broader context helps students to appreciate the meaning and significance of the
passages read in Latin and to see what features are
typical of the author’s style and approach. For example,
students have a richer understanding of the character
of Aeneas when they discover how he acts at the end
of the Aeneid; similarly, they are able to appreciate the
significance of the Aeneid as a whole when they read
how Vergil relates the work to Roman history in Books
6 and 8. When studying the Gallic War, students have a
more complete understanding of how Caesar portrays
the Gauls and the scope of the war itself when they consider the climactic events of Books 6 and 7.
Rather than being merely background information, the
required English readings should be seen as integral to
the discussion and analysis of the Latin readings.
Students should be asked to consider and apply
their knowledge of the works as they read, translate,
discuss, and analyze specific passages read in Latin.
Reading Latin at Sight
Frequent practice in reading Latin at sight under a teacher’s guidance brings many benefits to
students. It builds their working vocabulary, cultivates
their ability to perceive word groups, phrases, and
clauses, and helps them develop the ability to deduce meaning and make revisions in light of further
information. It reduces reliance on dictionaries as
students learn to infer the meaning of one word in a
sentence from others they know. It helps students go
beyond knowing the meanings of words in isolation by
focusing their attention on the relationship between endings and functions of words.
When integrated consistently into classroom instruction, sight reading builds students’ confidence and fluency in reading and enhances
their overall enjoyment of Latin. It also speeds their comprehension and supports their analysis of prepared syllabus passages. By exposing students
to a variety of Latin authors and styles, teachers help them deal confidently with the sight-reading passages in the multiple-choice section of the AP
Exam. In order to develop students’ ability to read
Latin at sight, teachers should choose texts with relatively common vocabulary and straightforward grammar and syntax. Prose authors recommended
for sight-reading work include Nepos, Cicero (but not
Cicero’s letters), Livy, Pliny the Younger, and Seneca the Younger rather than, say, Tacitus or Sallust.
Recommended verse authors include Ovid, Martial,
Tibullus, and Catullus rather than, for example,
Horace, Juvenal, or Lucan. Portions of the works of
Vergil and Caesar that are not included in the required
reading list are also recommended for use in class to
work on reading at sight. The names given here are representative of authors whose works may be used
for sight-reading passages on the AP Exam—the list is neither exclusive nor exhaustive.

Terminology
This section provides terms appropriate for the upper intermediate level of study of Latin language and
literature in a North American context and is intended
to give students a shared vocabulary with which to
describe the grammar, syntax, and literary style of the
required Latin texts. The list attempts to avoid both
highly specialized and very basic terms, and focuses
instead on those that are most important for precise
translation, comprehension, and literary analysis in the
AP course.
This list of terms is neither exclusive nor exhaustive
but rather representative of the level of difficulty of the
required Latin texts. Potential AP Exam questions may require students to demonstrate knowledge of the
terms. The list does not include very basic grammar
terms from first- and second-year Latin study (e.g.,
predicate nominative, direct object, temporal clause),
nor does it include metrical terms already provided in the evidence statements of the Achievement Level
Descriptions for the Reading and Comprehension
section (see page 115). These basic terms, however, may also be tested on the AP Exam.

Knowledge
An opportunity for students to think about what they already know about a concept, place, person, culture, etc. and to share their knowledge with a wider audience.
To prepare students to encounter new concepts, places, persons, and cultures prior to reading a text.
Use an anticipatory set such as guiding questions, perhaps drawn from the themes and essential questions, to activate prior knowledge. This approach is also useful for reviewing contextual information.
Ask the Expert
Students are assigned as “experts” on points they have mastered;
groups rotate through the expert stations to learn about points they have not yet mastered.
To provide opportunities for students to share their knowledge and learn from one another.
When reviewing rules of grammar, assign students as “experts” on specific concepts. Students rotate through stations in groups, working with the station expert to study examples that illustrate the corresponding concept. Students can retain “expert” status for questions during daily work in translation.
Brainstorming
A flexible but deliberate process of articulating multiple ideas in a short period of time.
To generate ideas, concepts, or key words that provide a focus and/ or establish organization as part of the prewriting process.
Generate a list of phrases from a
Latin passage related to an essay prompt. Can also be used to generate a semantic map or mind map related to a thesis statement in response to an essay prompt.
Chalk Talk
An opportunity for students to respond to a question about a text or an excerpt of a text in writing on the board.
To build skills in responding spontaneously and to provide an opportunity for all students to participate in a discussion.
Post a question related to a text and have students write their reactions on the board. Students can respond to the question and to one another’s responses. This can also be a way to refine claims and evidence for an argument.
Instructional Strategies
The AP Latin course framework outlines the concepts and skills students must master in order to be successful
on the AP Exam. In order to address those concepts and skills effectively, teachers should incorporate a variety
of instructional approaches and best practices into their daily lessons and activities. Teachers can help students
develop mastery of the disciplinary practices and reasoning processes by engaging them in learning activities that
allow them to apply their understanding of course concepts. Teachers may consider the following strategies as they plan instruction continued on next page

Have students complete this task with a partner in an effort to look for loose organization, missing evidence, possible places for contextual additions, etc.
Marking the Text
Analyzing text by highlighting, underlining, and/or annotating for specific components.
For an essay, this would include claim, evidence, context, and conclusion.
To encourage focused, reflective thinking about revising drafts. To facilitate reexamination or analysis of a text in English. Also useful for clarifying the structure of Latin sentences or analyzing a passage.
Use different highlighter or pen colors to emphasize different aspects of a text. Highlight descriptive words, delineate clauses, or identify main ideas to aid students in accurately reflecting the Latin forms in their
English translations.
Metacognitive
Markers
A system of cueing marks, where students use ? for questions about the text, ! for reactions related to the text, and * for comments about the text, underlining or highlighting to signal key ideas.
To track responses to texts and use those responses as a point of departure for talking or writing about texts.
Use a system of symbols (?, !, *, underlining/highlighting) to have students engage with a text. This practice is especially useful for readings in English or review of Latin comprehension.

Making guesses about the content of a text by reflecting on prior readings/thinking ahead about ideas that may be presented, based on evidence in the text.
To help students become actively involved, interested, and mentally prepared to understand ideas by extending prior knowledge to future lines of text.
Have students predict what a text will be about by looking at the title and glosses. Students may also gain information from questions provided for a given text.
QHT
Expanding prior knowledge of vocabulary words by marking words with a Q,
H, or T (Q signals words students do not know; H signals words students have heard and might be able to identify; T signals words students know well enough to teach to their peers.
To build on students’ prior knowledge of words, to provide a forum for peer teaching and learning of new words, and to serve as a prereading exercise to aid in comprehension.
To encourage students to employ contextual clues and the proper use of derivatives.
Ask students, when reading, to identify unfamiliar words (Q), words they think they might know (H), and words they own (T). Use the identified words to foster comprehension of the text and vocabulary acquisition.

Questioning the
Text
The practice of developing literal and inferential questions about a text.
To engage more actively with texts, read with greater purpose and focus, and ultimately answer questions to gain greater insight into the text.
Have each student write two literal questions and one inferential question to ask others about a text. This practice is useful for review or readings in English or during debriefing.
Quick Research
A method of researching a topic in groups. The first person does the initial research, writing every detail found. The second refines the research to pick out the most important elements. The third uses the research to organize information or to make a claim. The fourth presents findings to the class.
To help students refine research techniques to get to the heart of what is important and what is needed to understand context or to make supported claims in argumentation.
Use for contextualization or readings in English. Group size can be modified to fit class constraints.
Quick Write
Writing for a short, specific amount of time about a designated topic.
To help generate ideas in a short time.
As preparation for a free response question in which students write an argument, have students write claims and explain evidence that support their claims for various topics. This technique is also useful as a way of Activating Prior Knowledge.
RAFT
A method of generating and/or transforming a text by identifying and/ or manipulating its component parts of (R)ole, (A)udience, (F)ormat, and (T)opic.
To increase students’ understanding of the main elements of the writer’s work.
Apply concepts of literary style and genre to the course syllabus as well as to other readings from classical authors.
Revisiting Prior
Work
The practice of looking through previously completed work to identify successes and challenges that may have been encountered with particular formats, conventions, style, word choice, and so on.
To build on prior experience in preparation for a new piece of writing and/or to revise a previous piece of writing. This is a good strategy for improving essay writing.
Have students review prior argumentative essays as they begin to draft a new one.

Developing the Course Skills
Throughout the AP Latin course, students will develop skills that are fundamental to the discipline of classical
studies. Since these course skills represent those that adept classicists demonstrate, students will benefit from
multiple opportunities to develop them in a scaffolded manner. Teachers and students can also refer to the
Achievement Level Descriptions (see page 109) to determine how well they are performing a given skill and what
students need to demonstrate to improve to the next level.
Skill Category 1: Read and comprehend Latin poetry and prose.
The first goal of learning Latin is to engage with
the ancients in their own language. That is why the
foundation of the AP Latin course is a syllabus drawn
from two Golden Age authors, neither of which should be considered easy for students of Latin. Readers
of Latin at this level must master an extensive range of vocabulary, the various grammatical forms, and
many complex syntactical structures. They also need
acquaintance with literary terminology and genre as
well as the meters of poetry. Finally, students must become familiar with the large body of contextual knowledge that the ancients wove intricately into their works.
Teachers can guide students to build their skills in reading and comprehension by helping them build
vocabulary, teaching them to use contextual clues, and encouraging them to persevere in dealing with unfamiliar or challenging texts.
The table that follows provides some sample strategies
for instruction. See the Instructional Strategies section for more information.

1.A: Demonstrate knowledge of Latin vocabulary.
What is the correct dictionary entry for this item?
Remembering to check declension or conjugation to aid students in identifying vocabulary.
QHT—By using established codes, students get a quick feel for their familiarity with the vocabulary in a passage.
1.B: Explain the meaning of Latin words and phrases in context.
What is the correct meaning of this word in context?
What synonyms/figurative meanings may also be appropriate?
Idioms and easily confused vocabulary words merit frequent review.
Substituting—
Students can review core vocabulary and develop nuance by seeking out synonyms.
1.C: Use specific terminology to identify grammatical forms and syntactic structure.
What is the correct case and usage of this noun? What is the tense and voice of this verb? (etc.)
Reviewing genitive endings for all declensions rather than reviewing the 2nd declension genitive can help solidify important patterns.
I/We/You—Teachers can demystify more difficult grammatical terminology by modeling their own thought processes.

What is the correct association between words, chunks, clauses, etc.?
The ability to match noun/ adjective pairs is an important skill for reading poetry where word order tends to be more fluid.
Ask the Expert—
Students learn by teaching as well as learning strategies from peers at the same or adjacent learning level.
1.E: Scan dactylic hexameter in Latin poetry.
What is the correct application of metrical conventions for the line?
A small amount of time reviewing the skill for each unit is more useful than a large amount of time at one point during the year.
Scanning Latin
Hexameter—By practicing on a site such as hexameter.co, students can track their own progress in the skill.
1.F: Read Latin poetry and prose aloud with attention to linguistic and artistic qualities.
(not assessed)
How does reading aloud help clarify and demonstrate understanding of the text?

Reading aloud can be a check on whether we recognize the case endings and full form of the word.
Oral Reading—
Students gain confidence and activate new aspects of language learning by reading Latin aloud.
1.G: Identify stylistic features in Latin poetry and prose.
How do rhetorical features and stylistic devices enhance the author’s message?
Ask students to bring examples from readings in other classes as a way to reinforce attention to these devices.
Close Reading—By starting with a passage in English, teachers can help students develop their analytical skills in a less stressful setting.
1.H: Identify references to Roman culture, history, and mythology in Latin texts.
What knowledge of the ancient world enriches comprehension of the passage?
Spiraling contextual knowledge is a good technique to aid student recall of the information.
Activating Prior
Knowledge—Students struggling with difficult authors can regain focus and confidence by remembering what they do know.
1.I: Demonstrate overall comprehension of passages in Latin texts.
What is the main idea, sequence of events, setting, etc.? How would one summarize the passage?
Remember to step

back after translating a line to check on overall comprehension and to push students toward answering inferential questions such as why a character might be acting as they are.
Debriefing—Asking “So what does it mean?” or “Why does that matter?” is an important step after any literal translation or analytical effort.

Skill Category 2: Translate Latin texts into English.
Translation is a tool to demonstrate accurate knowledge
of the Latin. In other words, the goal is not to produce
the artistically best translation but rather the most literal
one that is consistent with English usage. Translations
should show that students understand the forms and
functions of the Latin structures and which English
equivalent of a Latin word is appropriate in context.
Wherever possible, students should endeavor to
render a Latin word into an English word with the same grammatical characteristics.
As students build skills in translating, teachers can
scaffold their instruction and review and reinforce
learning of vocabulary, grammatical forms, and syntax.
The table that follows provides some sample strategies
for instruction. See the Instructional Strategies section for more information.

2.A: Demonstrate knowledge of Latin vocabulary when translating Latin texts into English.
What is the appropriate
English meaning among synonyms?
Regional understanding of some vocabulary can vary widely (e.g., are your students familiar with sailing terms or do they need help understanding the English vocabulary?)
Vocabulary
Notebook—Students gain much by finding their own organizational method for vocabulary, but some students will need more help than others in getting started.
2.B: Demonstrate knowledge of Latin morphology when translating Latin texts into English.
How does one render a Latin noun in English to reflect its case and number or a verb to reflect its person, number, etc.?
Hold students accountable for distinctions in singular/ plural or precise tense usages every day so that they are comfortable with accurate morphological distinctions.
Marking the Text—This technique, also useful for editing essays, can help students visualize clauses or noun/ adjective pairs more vividly.
2.C: Demonstrate knowledge of Latin grammar and syntax when translating Latin texts into English.
What structures in English accurately convey the meaning of the Latin structure, the relationships between clauses, etc.?
Discussing the subjunctive and complex clauses in English will help students in AP Latin as well as in their other classes.
Jigsaw—If homework time is tight or plans have been interrupted, this can help a teacher get back on schedule while covering difficult material.
2.D: Demonstrate an understanding of differences between
Latin and English usage when translating Latin texts into English.
How are Latin constructions like conditionals or indirect statement appropriately rendered into English?
Where do Latin and English interface well and where are the idiomatic differences too profound for the languages to match up literally? Where do we have to adapt to one or the other?
Sentence Unpacking—
Having students articulate idioms or the differences between genres can clarify understanding as well as indicate areas that still need work.

Skill Category 3: Relate Latin texts to Roman historical, cultural, and literary contexts.
Context allows students to expand their understanding
of the text they are reading. Knowledge of the peoples,
perspectives, products, practices, and events of the
ancient world are vital for an accurate interpretation
and analysis of Caesar’s or Vergil’s work. Roman history,
mythology, culture, and literary conventions are all
important for success in comprehending Latin. It is a
constantly deepening spiral: to understand the Romans
we need to know their literature, but we need to know
their literature in order to gain an understanding of who
the Romans were. In addition, many ancient authors
wrote in a highly allusive style with an assumption of
a very erudite audience. Subtle messages were often
encoded in these allusions, overt references often cannot be taken at face value, and almost hidden references abound. Students need to build their
knowledge of the Romans as they read and study Latin literature.

Outlines of important dates and events can help students set the stage for their readings.
Double-Entry
Journal—Google docs can be a way to save paper and preserve classroom sets for this practice.
3.B: Use knowledge of Roman political ideas to demonstrate understanding of Roman culture in Latin texts.
What knowledge of Roman political structures and perspectives is needed to understand the passage?
How do Roman ideals compare to those of the
Greeks or the Germans?
How might the Gauls or the
Britons have viewed the
Romans they encountered?
Change of Perspective—Leave time to take these discussions to the
present day: How do we view both the
Romans and those we meet through their literature? How do other primary or secondary sources change our understandings?
3.C: Relate Roman cultural products in Latin texts to perspectives of Roman culture.
What piece of literature, geography, artifact, etc., improves our understanding of a passage?
Help the students understand the difference between a practice and a product; it will help them be on the lookout for both in their readings. Having visuals of these items is important for student understanding.
Sketching—Stick figures or images from the internet mean that all students can take part, regardless of their confidence in their artistic abilities.

What are Roman wedding rituals, burial rites, or military organizations? (etc.)
Do you have time in your curriculum to stage a Roman wedding in second year?
The students will take that deeper understanding with them to AP.
Thinking Aloud—Even if you cannot stage the wedding, have the students brainstorm such a project in the
AP year. It can be a productive day of “rest” in the course of the semester.
3.E: Use knowledge of mythology and legends to demonstrate understanding of Latin texts.
What knowledge of goddesses, heroes, legends, events, etc. lend depth to a passage?
Give students a different version of a myth to help them understand the way ancient authors used and adapted the stories.
Think-Pair-Share—
Walking around during student work time can be used as a quick assessment of a mythology assignment.
3.F: Use knowledge of authors or literary conventions to demonstrate understanding of Latin texts.
What is an epic? How do commentarii differ from history? What conventions apply to different forms of literature? (etc.)
Ask the students if they have read any tragedy or epic in their other classes or for pleasure. If not, outline the relevant plot or genre issues.
Socratic Seminar—
By articulating their questions about genre students strengthen understanding and indicate where more review is needed.

Skill Category 4: Analyze linguistic and literary features of Latin texts.
Analysis of a text comes after comprehension and translation and is a necessary step as one moves
toward argumentation. A text must be considered with
an eye toward literary devices and genre as well as
the proper context of history, mythology, and culture
(e.g., the products, practices, and perspectives of the
Romans).
In order to build their skills in textual analysis, students need to develop their knowledge of Roman culture,
recognize stylistic features in Latin literature, and learn to make inferential connections.

Luther King, to solidify understanding of the terms of literary style.
Rhetorical Précis—
Asking students to find rhetorical devices in modern advertising or song lyrics can help them develop this skill in a more relaxed environment.
4.B: Analyze Latin texts based on knowledge of products, practices, and perspectives of Roman culture.
How does context enhance or contradict the surface meaning conveyed in vocabulary and syntax?
Ask the students what a reference might be saying about the author, his audience, etc. Is the reference positive or negative for those perspectives?
Quick Research—What scholarly resources does your school have available to students online? Students will be grateful to have this knowledge in many settings beyond AP
Latin.

Skill Category 5: Develop an argument that analyzes Latin poetry and/or prose.
The skill of argumentation appears in Free-response question 3, the essay. While writing, including argumentative essays, is taught in many academic
areas, there is a special point of emphasis for AP Latin.
Students should be reminded that this is a task set for
a Latin course: although the essay is written in English,
in order to succeed they must supply adequate Latin
support for a claim, demonstrate proper understanding
of that Latin, and provide accurate citation for the
evidence used. Students must reflect on details of the
passage and then form a coherent argument as to why
those details matter. They need to present an organized
argument, using appropriate contextual references and
making fully articulated conclusions for their claims
based on the evidence of the Latin passage at hand.

5.B: Support the argument using relevant evidence from Latin texts and readings in English.
What evidence supports the claim?
What Latin and contextual knowledge from the passages provided supports the claim?
Chalk Talk—Getting the students up and moving can make the analytical process less daunting.
5C: Uses accurate, specific, and relevant references to Latin texts.
Has the Latin or line number been provided?
Have students accurately cited their source?
Drafting—Students learn a great deal about good writing during the editing process.
5.D: Use reasoning to draw conclusions and make inferences based on textual features.
Why does the evidence support the claim?
In other words, so what?
(Not “because I said so”—do not let them make a leap in logic because you know them as a student.) Have they fully articulated their conclusion or inference?
Generating
Questions—A teacher can provide a checklist or have the students develop one as a part of discussing what it means to write a good essay.
5.E: Use contextual knowledge and references to support the analysis.
What knowledge of the ancient world, this text, this author, etc., supports the overall argument?
If they can think of context that goes against their argument, can they reason a counterargument in response?
Marking the Draft—
Peer editing and discussion can take pressure off the feedback process.
