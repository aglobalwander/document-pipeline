## WHY MEDIATION WORKS

Four theorems guide the Cognitive Coach's beliefs and actions and explain why mediation works:

- 1.  The sum of an individual's constructed meanings resides internally at conscious and unconscious levels and serves as the criterion for perceptions, decisions, and behavior.
- 2.  When these meanings are given form in language, they become accessible to both parties in a verbal transaction.
- 3.  Through verbal transaction (mediation), these meanings and the perceptions, decisions, and behaviors related to them can be refined, enriched, and modified.
- 4.  Through Cognitive Coaching, not only are an individual's meanings, decisions, and behaviors refined and modified, with related results in improved performance, but also refined is the individual's capacity to self-mediate and to become more proactive in continuing selfdirectedness.
