## The Pursuit of Self-Efficacy Is Innate

The main purpose of a brain is survival, and many of the structures in the brain are involved in making certain the individual and the species endure. Although these structures were designed originally to give the person the means to survive attacks from wild beasts or enemies, in contemporary society, efficacious humans quest for competence, continuous lifelong learning, self-empowerment, goal achievement, mastery, and control. For example, as a survival mechanism, endurance running was the main means of stalking prey by outrunning them. Humans today are the only form of life that runs marathons in the heat of the day for which they must endure and persist. We climb to the highest pinnacles, break previous records, and lend ourselves to competitions with ourselves, with each other, and with nature. Each time we experience the satisfaction of goal accomplishment, our brain secretes endorphins-the feel good chemicals (neurotransmitters) that are active in the brain's reward system. In other words, the efficacious brain makes 'feel good' chemicals that are released when certain behaviors increase the probability of survival.
