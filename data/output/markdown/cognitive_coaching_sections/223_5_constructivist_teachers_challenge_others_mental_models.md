## 5. Constructivist Teachers Challenge Others' Mental Models

Humans often develop and refine ideas about phenomena and then tenaciously hold onto these ideas as eternal truths. Much of what we think happens simply by virtue of our agreement that it should, not because our close examination of our bounded assumptions, limited history, and existing mental models. Constructivists realize that cognitive growth occurs when individuals revisit and reformulate a current perspective. Therefore, constructivist teachers might provide data, present realities, and pose questions for the purpose of engendering contradictions to others' initial hypotheses, challenging present conceptions, illuminating another perspective, and breaching crystallized thinking. Constructivists must listen to and understand the other person's present conceptions or points of view to help them understand which notions might be accepted or rejected as contradictory.
