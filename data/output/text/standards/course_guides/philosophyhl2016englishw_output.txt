The IB Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous, academically challenging and
balanced programme of education designed to prepare students aged 16 to 19
for success at university and life beyond. The DP aims to encourage students to be
knowledgeable, inquiring, caring and compassionate, and to develop intercultural
understanding, open-mindedness and the attitudes necessary to respect and evalu ate a range of viewpoints. Approaches to teaching and learning (ATL) within the DP
are deliberate strategies, skills and attitudes that permeate the teaching and learning
environment. In the DP students develop skills from five ATL categories: thinking,
research, social, self-management and communication.
To ensure both breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding, students must
choose at least one subject from five groups: 1) their best language, 2) additional lan guage(s), 3) social sciences, 4) experimental sciences, and 5) mathematics. Students
may choose either an arts subject from group 6, or a second subject from groups
1 to 5. At least three and not more than four subjects are taken at higher level (240
recommended teaching hours), while the remaining are taken at standard level (150
recommended teaching hours). In addition, three core elements—the extended
essay, theory of knowledge and creativity, action, service—
are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.
These IB DP subject briefs illustrate four key course components.

I. Course description and aims
The philosophy course provides an opportunity for students to engage
with some of the world’s most interesting and influential thinkers. It
also develops highly transferable skills such as the ability to formulate
arguments clearly, to make reasoned judgments and to evaluate highly
complex and multifaceted issues. The emphasis of the DP philosophy
course is on “doing philosophy”, that is, on actively engaging students
in philosophical activity. The course is focused on stimulating students’
intellectual curiosity and encouraging them to examine both their own perspectives and those of others.
Students are challenged to develop their own philosophical voice and
to grow into independent thinkers. They develop their skills through
the study of philosophical themes and the close reading of a philo sophical text. They also learn to apply their philosophical knowledge
and skills to real-life situations and to explore how non-philosophical
material can be treated in a philosophical way. HL students also engage
in a deeper exploration of the nature of philosophy itself. Teachers
explicitly teach thinking and research skills such as comprehension, text analysis, transfer, and use of primary sources.
The aim of the philosophy course is to engage students in philosophi cal activity, enabling them to:
1.	 develop an inquiring and intellectually curious way of thinking
2.	 formulate arguments in a sound and purposeful way
3.	 examine critically their own experiences and their ideological and cultural perspectives
4.	 appreciate the diversity of approaches within philosophical thinking
5.	 apply their philosophical knowledge and skills to the world around them.
