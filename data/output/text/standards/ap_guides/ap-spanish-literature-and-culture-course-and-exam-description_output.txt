About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills
that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking AP
courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and
AP Exams are developed and scored by college faculty
and experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges
and universities in the United States grant credit,
advanced placement, or both on the basis of successful
AP Exam scores; more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the content
and skills that are the focus of the corresponding
college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also
organizes the content and skills into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many AP teachers have
told us they follow in order to focus their instruction.
The intention of this publication is to respect teachers’
time and expertise by providing a roadmap that they
can modify and adapt to their local priorities and
preferences. Moreover, by organizing the AP course
content and skills into units, the AP Program is able to provide teachers and students with formative assessments—Personal Progress Checks—that
teachers can assign throughout the year to measure
student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students:
Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically
challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to equitable preparation and
access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses:
The AP Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP
courses must participate in the AP Course Audit, a
process through which AP teachers’ course materials
are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.

AP Spanish Literature and Culture Course and Exam Description

=== Page 9 ===
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the AP teacher and the school principal (or designated
administrator) to confirm awareness and understanding
of the curricular and resource requirements. A syllabus
or course outline, detailing how course requirements
are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The
AP Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor;
all AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision,
piloting, and analysis to ensure that questions are
accurate, fair, and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development,
College Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher
education institutions. This feedback is carefully
considered to ensure that AP courses and exams are
able to provide students with a college-level learning
experience and the opportunity to demonstrate their
qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam
development process, relies on the expertise of both
AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice
questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course performance
assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands
of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are
scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion
is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained,
and their work is monitored throughout the Reading
for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief
Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers
in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of
the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a curve.
Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which means that
every student who meets the criteria for an AP score of
2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no matter how many
students that is. The criteria for the number of points
students must earn on the AP Exam to receive scores
of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently
validates for credit and placement purposes—include:
§Bullet The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
§Bullet The number of points researchers have found to be predictive that an AP student will succeed when placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
§Bullet Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP scores as follows:
AP Score

=== Page 10 ===
While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and
universities. To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/ placement policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/creditpolicies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score the free-response sections of the AP Exams.
Ninety-eight percent of surveyed educators who took
part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an
AP Reader, including opportunities to:
§Bullet Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college

educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
§Bullet Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure
to the quality and depth of the responses from the
entire pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
§Bullet Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
§Bullet Score from home: AP Readers have online
distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects.
Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
Bullet Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs):
AP Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide suggests a
sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds skill instruction across units, and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
*To report misuses, please call, 877-274-6474 (International: +1-212-632-1781).
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course topics and skills, create
customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
§Bullet Teachers and students sign in to or create their College Board accounts.
§Bullet Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
§Bullet Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
§Bullet Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP Coordinator.
§Bullet Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and
AP Coordinators to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following
additional benefits:
§Bullet Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
§Bullet Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
§Bullet Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student
pack. The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
§Bullet Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

About the AP Spanish
Literature and Culture Course
The AP Spanish Literature and Culture course uses a thematic approach to introduce students
to representative texts (short stories, novels, poetry, plays, and essays) from Peninsular
Spanish, Latin American, and U. S. Hispanic literature. Students develop proficiencies across
the three modes of communication (interpretive, interpersonal, and presentational) in the
range of Intermediate High to Advanced Mid of the American Council on the Teaching of
Foreign Languages’ (ACTFL) Proficiency Guidelines. Through careful examination of the
required readings and other texts, students work to hone their critical reading and analytical
writing skills. Literature is explored within the contexts of its time and place, and students
gain insights on the many voices, historical periods, and cultures represented in the required
readings and other texts. The course also includes a strong focus on cultural, artistic, and
linguistic connections and comparisons, which is supported by the exploration of various
media (art, music, film, articles, and literary criticism).
College Course Equivalent
AP Spanish Literature and Culture is equivalent to a college or university survey course of
literature written in Spanish at the first level counted towards a major in this subject area.
Prerequisites
While there are no prerequisites for this course, AP Spanish Literature and Culture is
designed for students who have successfully completed at least three years of high school level Spanish language study. While not a prerequisite, students may wish to complete the
AP Spanish Language and Culture course before taking AP Spanish Literature and Culture, as
the texts are presented in Spanish. In the case of native or heritage speakers, there may be a
different pathway of study leading to this course.

Course
Framework

Introduction
The AP Spanish Literature and Culture course is designed to provide
students with a learning experience equivalent to that of a college/university
survey course in literature written in Spanish. This thematically based course
introduces students to the formal study of a representative body of texts from
Peninsular Spanish, Latin American, and U.S. Hispanic literature, including
short stories, novels, poetry, drama, and essays, ranging from the Medieval period to the present.
The course provides opportunities for students to demonstrate their proficiency in Spanish across the three modes of communication (interpretive,
interpersonal, and presentational) at the Intermediate
High to Advanced Mid range of performance of ACTFL’s
Proficiency Guidelines. It includes exploration of the
five goal areas (communication, cultures, connections, comparisons, and communities) outlined in ACTFL’s
World Readiness Standards for Learning Languages.
The overarching aims of the course are to provide students with ongoing and varied opportunities to
further develop their proficiencies across a range of
language and analytical skills—with special attention to critical reading and analytical writing—and to encourage them to reflect on the many voices and
cultures included in a rich and diverse body of literature written in Spanish.
The inclusion of “and Culture” in the title of the course
reflects a purposeful alignment of the course to a
standards-based Spanish curriculum. In particular,
the course reflects a meaningful integration of the cultures, connections, and comparisons goal areas of ACTFL’s World-Readiness Standards for Learning
Languages. Emphasis is placed on approaching
the study of literature through global, historical, and
contemporary cultural contexts. Teachers and students
are encouraged to make interdisciplinary connections
and explore linguistic and cultural comparisons. A key
objective of the course is to encourage students not
only to understand and retell the content of the texts
they read, but also to relate that content to literary,
historical, sociocultural, and geopolitical contexts in Spanish.
The course is founded on a required reading list of
38 titles from the 14th century to the contemporary
period, including works that are linguistically and
thematically challenging. The ultimate goal is for
students to read critically, think deeply, and write
analytically to demonstrate their understanding of
the representative texts and to apply what they have
learned from the required texts to others. The study
of the required texts is enhanced by the inclusion of
other thematically related literary texts, works of art,
music, and films to encourage exploration from multiple perspectives, as well as to encourage students to make connections and comparisons. Students should engage in class and small group discussions. They should also participate in independent and group
research projects and share their findings in written or oral presentations.
The course aims to help students progress beyond
reading comprehension to read with critical, historical,
and literary sensitivity. This is an ambitious goal, but it
is the hope that when students apply the methods of
literary analysis suggested in the course, and focus
their attention on linguistic detail coupled with critical
interpretation and analysis of texts, they will acquire
skills that they will be able to apply to many other areas of learning and life.

Themes
The six required course themes in AP Spanish
Literature and Culture provide a meaningful basis for making contextual connections among works of
different genres, periods, movements, and techniques.
Instruction should overlap the themes within the units
instead of creating units that are organized around just one theme.
Las sociedades en contacto
Temas del curso
La construcción del género
La dualidad del ser
El tiempo y el espacio
Las relaciones interpersonales
La creación literaria
Under each theme there are four to six recommended
organizing concepts that are provided to suggest ways
to explore the themes and make meaningful contextual connections among works.
One way to design instruction using the themes
and their organizing concepts is to create essential
questions that serve to motivate students and guide
classroom investigations, learning activities, and assessments. Essential questions are designed to spark students’ curiosity and encourage them to consider how course content relates to larger
questions and issues in the study of literature and in
the humanities in general. Essential questions allow
students to investigate and express different views
on issues, make connections to other disciplines and
compare products, practices, and perspectives of target cultures to their own.
Listed on the following pages are the six required course themes with their suggested organizing concepts, some sample essential questions, and
sample groupings of the required texts. Teachers may
create their own way of designing thematic instruction and may invent their own essential questions.

LITERARY TERMS
The literary terms used in AP Spanish Literature and Culture range from basic to advanced. The list of
terms provided contains a representative selection of terms used in AP classes and in college and
university courses including Introduction to Literary
Analysis and survey courses of Peninsular and Latin
American literatures. This list is neither prescriptive
nor exhaustive; teachers may supplement the list as
they wish for their instruction. The list of literary terms
is intended to set a baseline expectation for the terms
students should be able to identify, explain, and apply in
their study of the texts on the required reading list.
The terms are grouped in a general progression in
ability to interpret and analyze literary texts. Within each of the three groups, six categories are provided:
§Bullet General terms §Bullet Terms that relate to narrative genres §Bullet Terms that relate to poetic genres §Bullet Terms that relate to dramatic genres §Bullet Rhetorical figures §Bullet Literary historical terms
When students are asked to engage in literary analysis, they should do so using the appropriate
literary terms. Consistent practice in identifying,
explaining, and applying literary terms with corrective
feedback will develop students’ abilities to use these terms effectively.
The Glossary of Literary Terms for the AP Spanish
Literature and Culture Course provides additional details, definitions, and examples.

COMPARATIVE WORKS
An essential skill that students need to develop during
the course and demonstrate on the exam is the ability
to transfer what they learn from the required readings
to other comparable works. To build this skill, students need frequent exposure to numerous literary and artistic works from and beyond those required in the course.
To this aim, examples of possible comparative texts
and/or art works are included in each unit for ease of
instruction and assessment. Some of the texts included
are required readings studied in other units that align
with the works being studied in the unit and reinforce understanding across the list. Making connections
among works on the list provides multiple exposures to
each text on the required reading list. Other suggested
texts are nonrequired comparative works that serve
to build skills in applying what has been learned from
required texts to nonrequired ones. Ultimately, the
goal is to develop students’ abilities in identifying and
understanding intertextuality while providing them with
a wide variety of rich literary texts and art works.
Students should be encouraged to make every possible connection between works they have read or seen and the comparative texts and works of art. They
should identify similarities in theme, style, point of
view, tone, language, characters, plot lines, and cultural
perspectives. It is also important that students learn to
identify similarities and differences between texts.
UNITS
The course content is organized into units. The units
have been arranged in a logical chronological sequence, as this is the most common approach to organizing the course.
Pacing recommendations at the unit level and on the
Course at a Glance provide suggestions for how to teach the required course content and administer the Personal Progress Checks. The suggested class
periods are based on a schedule in which the class meets five days a week for 45 minutes each day.
While these recommendations have been made to
aid planning, teachers should of course adjust the
pacing based on the needs of their students, alternate
schedules (e.g., block scheduling), or their school’s academic calendar.

Guides
Introduction
Designed with extensive input from the community of AP Spanish Literature
educators, the unit guides offer teachers helpful guidance in building
students’ skills and knowledge. The suggested sequence was identified
through a thorough analysis of the syllabi of highly effective AP teachers
and the organization of typical college textbooks.
This unit structure respects new AP teachers’ time by providing one
possible sequence they can adopt or modify rather than having to build
from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units enable the AP
Program to provide interested teachers with formative assessments—the
Personal Progress Checks—that they can assign their students at the end
of each unit to gauge progress toward success on the AP Exam. However,
experienced AP teachers who are satisfied with their current course
organization and exam results should feel no pressure to adopt these units,
which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

Using the Unit Guides
~7–8 CLASS PERIODS
Building Course Skills
By the end of the AP Spanish Literature course, students should be able to perform the following five tasks for each required
work: 1) explain the work’s themes and compare them to others; 2) identify literary terms and analyze their effect in the work;
3) define the characteristics of the work’s genre; 4) examine how the work reflects its literary period or movement; and 5) discuss the contexts that influenced the creation of the work. In this first unit students should be able to comprehend the texts that they read. To that end, teachers can provide opportunities for students to practice summarizing and paraphrasing the works, demonstrating that they understand the basic features (characters, setting, plot, etc.).
Students should be able to identify themes in the texts and explain how each theme is developed using examples from the text.
They should also identify the structural, stylistic, and rhetorical devices being employed. It is also important to identify the characteristics of the texts that define each genre along with the aspects of the texts that represent the period.
Preparing for the AP Exam
To prepare students for the listening section of the AP Exam, teachers can use audio clips that discuss the events and political climate of the medieval period in Spain. Or, teachers can use audio selections that highlight the unique characteristics of the romance viejo tradition. For the multiple choice and free-response sections, students will need to focus on the development of themes and the characteristics of each genre, in addition to defining the sociohistorical contexts of the works from this unit. Teachers can assess student progress by asking them to identify the themes in each of the works and then select well-chosen examples. Teachers can also ask students to analyze the characteristics of the genres and define the contexts of the works.
ESSENTIAL
QUESTIONS § ¿Cómo se representan las diversas culturas y religiones de la época en las obras literarias?
§ ¿De qué manera la perspectiva o el punto de vista afecta la representación de eventos históricos?
§ ¿Qué aspectos de la literatura medieval todavía se reflejan en la literatura y la vida de hoy en día?
La época medieval
UNIT 1
Developing Understanding
Medieval Spanish literature reflects the reality of the period. Linguistically, medieval Spanish is
very different from contemporary Spanish, so it will be necessary to assist students with the
language patterns for ease of comprehension. It is also important to note that oral tradition
flourished during this period because few could read. Troubadours and juglares traveled from
town to town sharing news and epic stories through song and poetry. Written texts were often
accompanied by artwork to facilitate understanding for readers.

~7–8 CLASS PERIODS
La época medieval
Developing Understanding
Medieval Spanish literature reflects the reality of the period. Linguistically, medieval Spanish
is very different from contemporary Spanish, so it will be necessary for teachers to assist
students with the language patterns for ease of comprehension. It is also important to note
that oral tradition flourished during this period because few could read. Troubadours and
juglares traveled from town to town sharing news and epic stories through song and poetry.
Written texts were often accompanied by artwork to facilitate understanding for readers.
Building Course Skills
By the end of the AP Spanish Literature course, students should be able to perform the following five tasks for each required
work: 1) explain the work’s themes and compare them to others; 2) identify literary terms and analyze their effect in the work;
3) define the characteristics of the work’s genre; 4) examine how the work reflects its literary period or movement; and 5) discuss the contexts that influenced the creation of the work. In this first unit students should be able to comprehend the texts that they read. To that end, teachers can provide opportunities for students to practice summarizing and paraphrasing the works, demonstrating that they understand the basic features (characters, setting, plot, etc.).
Students should be able to identify themes in the texts and explain how each theme is developed using examples from the text.
They should also identify the structural, stylistic, and rhetorical devices being employed. It is also important to identify the characteristics of the texts that define each genre along with the aspects of the texts that represent the period.
Preparing for the AP Exam
To prepare students for the listening section of the AP Exam, teachers can use audio clips that discuss the events and political climate of the medieval period in Spain. Or, teachers can use audio selections that highlight the unique characteristics of the romance viejo tradition. For the multiple-choice and free-response sections, students will need to focus on the development of themes and the characteristics of each genre, in addition to defining the sociohistorical contexts of the works from this unit. Teachers can assess student progress by asking them to identify the themes in each of the works and select well-chosen examples. Teachers can also ask students to analyze the characteristics of the genres and define the contexts of the works.

~19–20 CLASS PERIODS
El siglo XVI
Developing Understanding
Literary works from the Spanish Renaissance—opening a period also known as the Golden
Age—are the focus of Unit 2. The 16th century is also the era when the colonial period began
in the Americas. Students will read works written on both sides of the Atlantic. This is an
important moment in literature because the language develops from its medieval rudimentary
forms into an art form. Students will become familiar with the characteristics of several
different genres and be able to make comparisons to works introduced in the previous unit.
Building Course Skills
In this unit, students should continue building their comprehension skills by summarizing and paraphrasing the texts that they read.
Students should be able to identify and describe the works’ characters, plot, main ideas, and important events. They should move toward analysis by connecting themes to characters in and across texts. Students should also compare the themes and structural, stylistic, or rhetorical features of this unit’s texts to texts they studied in Unit 1 and to artwork from the same period.
Students will continue to expand their knowledge of the circumstances in which these texts were written through the study of historical, geopolitical, sociocultural, and other relevant contexts of each era.
In their encounters with texts with more abstract meaning, students will move from comprehension to interpretation, discussion, and eventually, analysis.
Preparing for the AP Exam
In this unit, classroom activities can emphasize the thematic complexity of the texts, and students should practice expanding their academic vocabulary to discuss structural, stylistic, and rhetorical elements. Students should compare the features of one text to others on a regular basis. Teachers can introduce new short texts or text fragments similar to those on the reading list to help students continue practicing comparison. Attention should be focused on summarizing key passages of text, identifying literary terms, and comparing themes between required texts.
Students should be able to explain themes from the text and provide examples of thematic development. They should also be able to define and explore the characteristics of the genre, period, or movement and the literary techniques employed. Students often struggle to construct well-organized and effective essays. Teachers can help build their skills in essay writing by providing opportunities to work on an introduction with a strong thesis statement, development of their ideas with relevant examples, and a conclusion.

El siglo XVII
UNIT 3
Developing Understanding
For Peninsular Spanish literature, the 17th century was the pinnacle of artistic production
and comprised the second half of the Golden Age. However, it also marked the beginning of
the decline of the Spanish empire. In this unit, students will encounter complex metaphors,
syntax, and advanced vocabulary. Writers of this period employed these complexities as a
way to criticize their social reality in a form of desengaño, or disillusionment. This provided the
opportunity to question commonly held traditions and perspectives.
Building Course Skills
Due to the complexity of the texts in this unit, students should focus on understanding implied meanings and ambiguities, relying on the comprehension skills they practiced in the first two units. Students should be able to explain what and how the texts communicate to the reader. Texts in this unit share a rich, robust thematic complexity.
Students should practice comparing themes from these works to those in nonrequired texts, texts from previous units, and artwork from the same period. They should be able to identify intermediate-level literary terms and explain how and/or why they are being used in the texts.
Students will encounter many of the same genres from Unit 2. Teachers can give them opportunities to compare how the genres have evolved. They should begin to comprehend both how the period is represented in the texts and how the period influenced the creation of the texts. Student should also identify cultural perspectives, practices, and products in the texts and make comparisons to those studied in previous units.
s
Preparing for the AP Exam
By Unit 3, students are ready to begin listening to author interviews in preparation for that portion of the AP Exam. Teachers can use interviews with contemporary authors where they discuss literature or their creative processes. Teachers can also incorporate audio recordings of 17th century poetry, clips that highlight important historical events or examine works of the period, and author biographies.
Students should be able to write essays comparing the uses and effects of literary figures and rhetorical devices, as well as comparing a theme that the works have in common. They should practice writing short-answers comparing artwork from the period to texts that share a common theme.
Due to the variety of genres in this unit, students should practice writing essays in which they analyze the characteristics of the genre of one of the works by commenting on the work’s structural and stylistic features.
In the essay, they should also analyze cultural aspects from the period that appear in the work. Teachers can also provide opportunities for students to review prompts from past AP Exams and evaluate each other’s samples to model effective written literary analysis.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches into the classroom. They were developed in
partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways that they approach teaching
some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional Approaches section beginning
on p. 153 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Skills
Sample Activity 1
1.A, 1.C
Read Alouds
Select a text or fragment of text (e.g., the first two paragraphs of Don Quijote). Read it aloud to the
class and pause to process it, taking time to unravel syntax and identify how literary figures and
rhetorical devices are used. If possible, project the fragment of text and make notes while working through it to model how to annotate a text.
2
1.A, 4.A
Change of Perspective
Have students recreate a scene from a studied text, but have them change a key element. For
example, they could recreate a scene from El Burlador de Sevilla but change the setting to the
present somewhere in the United States, or they could switch the genders of the characters.
3
2.B
Intertextualizing
Great authors are often great readers who incorporate key elements from their favorite texts into
their own works with their own personal touch. Have students compare Soneto XXIII by Garcilaso de
la Vega and Soneto CLXVI by Luis de Góngora and identify evidence of these types of elements.
4
1.A, 7.A,
7.C, 7.D,
7.F, 7.G
Role Play
To demonstrate comprehension, have students break into groups and act out a scene from a text
in front of the class (e.g., the scene in which Don Quijote attacks the windmills, or when Don Juan
Tenorio meets Tisbea for the first time).

La literatura romántica, realista y naturalista

UNIT 4
Developing Understanding
In this unit, the first two works represent romanticism, which was a reaction to neoclassicism.
Neoclassicism prioritized order, symmetry, and objectivity; unity was valued over creativity.
Works reflecting romanticism value individual rights, creativity, the breaking away from norms,
and idealism. The later two works in the unit reflect characteristics of the two concurrent
Spanish literary movements that were reactions to romanticism during later part of the
19th century: realism and naturalism. These works provide acute descriptions of reality
that employ regional references and dialects. They often portray characters from the lower
and middle classes dealing with common social problems from the period. Naturalist works
include a pessimistic tone, however, contrasting with romanticism’s idealism.
Building Course Skills
The textual layers of the works in this unit continue to help create a distinction between a simple understanding of a text and analysis. As in previous units, students should initially approach the texts for comprehension. With careful attention to the literary features of each text, students should then interpret the author’s implied message, also taking into account the text’s cultural perspectives, products, and practices.
Utilizing this skill, students should be able to interpret any ambiguities and nuances.
As themes become evident, teachers can provide opportunities for explanation and comparison to other texts and the visual arts.
Students should be able to accurately employ a variety of basic and intermediate literary terms while providing textual examples in support of their arguments.
They should clearly connect the texts to the corresponding period or movement and elaborate on how the contexts contributed to the creation of each text.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Teachers can continue to provide opportunities to practice for the interpretive listening section of the exam by listening to author interviews, poetry, and clips that accentuate the characteristics of the major literary movements of the 19th century:
el Romanticismo and el Realismo y el
Naturalismo. Students should practice identifying literary terms and determining how or why they are being used in the text.
Students often struggle with identifying and comparing the use of structural, stylistic, or rhetorical devices. These skills are critical for success in the multiple-choice section as well as in free-response question 4, the text comparison essay. Additionally, students tend to write short-answers instead of essays in the text comparison essay. To combat this, teachers can provide models of essays that demonstrate a clear thesis statement, structured body paragraphs, and a defined conclusion.

La Generación del 98 y el Modernismo
Developing Understanding
The Spanish-American War of 1898 is the historical event that forms the backbone of the
works in this unit. The war marked the culmination of the period of decline for the Spanish
empire, as the remaining Spanish colonies gained independence and Spain was left to search
for a new identity. This is exemplified in the works of the Generation of 98, a group of authors
writing around 1898 who philosophically explored social problems facing society at the time.
El Modernismo, in contrast, marked the birth of a new American literary movement. The
first stage of Modernismo embraced free verse poetry, creativity, beauty, elegance, and the
abstract, while the second stage shifted to political commentary.
Building Course Skills
The texts in this unit are dynamic, profound, and abstract. This provides another opportunity for students to transition from comprehension and explanation to interpretation and literary analysis. Teachers can connect the texts with current events or to students’ personal experiences to facilitate class discussions. Making these connections and observations can help spark student analysis. Teachers can also provide frequent opportunities to discuss how or why a text presents a key literary aspect (theme, literary term, genre, period/ movement, or context). In the discussions, students should support their observations with relevant, well-chosen textual examples to illustrate their points. Students should listen to audio clips that discuss relevant aspects of the studied texts. Students should also compare common themes shared between studied texts and artwork in relation to period, movement, genre, and/or technique.
Preparing for the AP Exam
At this stage, students have read so many works that remembering each one will be challenging. Teachers can review and reuse previously studied works by comparing their key characteristics with the new works from this unit. For the AP Exam, students must recall characters, important events, characteristics of genres, key literary terms, themes, and contexts. Teachers may want to utilize a graphic organizer or template to fill out for each work so that students can jot down pertinent information. They can then use it to review for the exam.
Reviewing previous works will help prepare students for the two free-response questions they often struggle with: Text and Art Comparison and Single Text Analysis. For both, students need to identify and explain the characteristics of a literary period, movement, genre, or technique. Students score higher on the AP Exam when they are familiar with and able to define these important elements of literary texts.

Teatro y poesía del siglo XX
UNIT 6
Developing Understanding
The first third of the 20th century was marked by World War I and the Spanish Civil War, forcing
an artistic departure from el Modernismo. Works from this period are characterized by their
questioning of daily life, their insistence upon defining identity, and experimentation with
new literary forms and ideas. The period can be subdivided according to artistic production.
Vanguard authors attempted to break with all previous movements, experimenting with
creativity and ingenuity while establishing free verse poetry as a principal form of expression
and renewing the uses of metaphors and imagery. Afro-Caribbean poetry from the period
includes auditory elements and neologisms and explores mestizaje. Surrealist works from the
period juxtapose the unconscious with the conscious, making everyday situations illogical
and unexplainable. The Theater of the Absurd uses absurd, impossible, and hyperbolic representations to highlight society’s problems.
Building Course Skills
For each text studied in this unit, students should be able to identify the themes and compare them to other works with ease.
Students should now begin to use advanced literary terms in their discussions of literary texts and in defining characteristics of literary genres. Students should also analyze the cultural perspectives, products, and practices in each text.
To practice literary analysis, teachers can select different elements of texts for close reading. Students can discuss with partners or in small groups, as a class, or through writing. Frequent writing practice, peer editing, and teacher feedback can improve how students analyze a text and support their ideas with textual examples.
Students should also listen to academic presentations of literary criticism as models of literary analysis.
Preparing for the AP Exam
This unit provides unique opportunities for listening to poems read by their authors.
Listening to authors read their own poems helps facilitate nuanced understanding of the works. As in previous units, students should listen to presentations that detail important events from the period that contributed to the creation of the works. They can also listen to presentations about particular aspects of the works or clips that review information from previous units.
Students should also continue to listen to author interviews. Because students often summarize texts, they should practice utilizing textual examples in their writing. This is critical for success in all the free-response questions. Students should practice making a point or argument, supporting it with a brief and carefully selected textual example, then following it with a comment that connects the example to their point or argument. Doing so will help students develop literary analysis in their writing.

~16–17 CLASS PERIODS
El Boom latinoamericano
UNIT 7
Developing Understanding
In the 1960s and 1970s, literature by Latin American authors became widely popular and
read around the world. The works from this period are well-known for employing the literary
technique of magic realism, where the fantastical coexists with everyday realities. Many of
them also express social criticisms. One of the distinguishing characteristics of the works are
their vivid depictions of settings that allow readers to experience the sights, sounds, customs, and traditions of Latin America.
Building Course Skills
Practicing literary analysis should continue to be a focus in this unit.
Students should be able to clearly explain and compare themes in texts. Literary discussions, both written and oral, should employ a variety of literary terms to discuss stylistic, structural, and rhetorical features of the texts. Students should define and compare literary genres, periods, and movements. They should also elaborate on the roles that various contexts have in the creation and interpretation of the texts.
As with previous units, students should continue to analyze cultural perspectives, products, and practices and compare them to other studied texts. Students should listen to audio selections that present literary analysis, poetry, or contextual information that will assist in their study of each text.
Students should then compare what they hear and read to what they have learned in other units. When writing or giving oral presentations, students should organize their thoughts so that their ideas are fully expressed, developed, and presented in a logical and clear order.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The authors studied in this unit gave numerous interviews during their careers.
Many of the interviews included discussions of their work, their careers as writers, and other literary topics. Listening to fragments of these interviews can help students better understand the works that they study and prepare them for the AP Exam. Students should also listen to clips that emphasize the characteristics of the Boom latinoamericano.
Students should continue practicing free-response question 1, Text Explanation, where they provide examples to show how a theme is developed in one of the works. Students should also continue to practice writing essays, in particular, the text comparison essay in free-response question 4. Students can compare one of the works from this unit to a nonrequired text that shares a common theme and write an analysis of how literary devices are utilized in each text.

UNIT 8
Developing Understanding
Unit 8 focuses on recent works that present the realities of life in the 1970s and 1980s in
the United States and Spain. Themes in these works may be familiar to today’s students.
The works from the United States represent two different perspectives of Spanish speakers:
that of a native who has lived their whole life in the United States and that of a migrant who
negotiates assimilation or marginalization. The work from Spain explores how an individual
interacts with the community. All of the works in the unit provide unique opportunities to
explore contemporary cultural perspectives, products, and practices.
Building Course Skills
In this final unit, all the skills of the course come together. Students should be able to explain and compare themes in the texts to other texts and artwork. They should be able to use a variety of vocabulary to discuss and analyze stylistic, structural, rhetorical and literary features of texts. They should be able to analyze, define, and compare aspects of literary genres, movements, and periods.
Students should also be able to analyze the contexts that contributed to the creation of the texts and the texts’ cultural perspectives, products, and practices. They should continue listening to interviews and presentations that discuss aspects of the texts in the unit, and they should write well-organized analytical essays and short responses.
Preparing for the AP Exam
In this final unit, teachers can prepare students for the AP Exam by familiarizing them with the exam’s instructions and tasks.
For the multiple-choice section of the exam, the listening portion includes an author interview, a poem, and an academic presentation. Part B includes selections from the required reading list followed by nonrequired selections. For the text comparison portion, students must compare a required text to a nonrequired text. The final portion of Part B is a critical commentary that discusses a particular aspect of a required reading.
For the free-response section, students often struggle with including all of the requested tasks from the prompts. Using prompts from previous AP Exams as practice, students can underline and/or number each task requested in the prompts. This will help them remember what they must do as they formulate their written responses. Students should review the scoring guidelines as well.
Teachers should highlight the criteria that demonstrate how omitting a task affects the evaluation.

Introduction
The skills and learning objectives inform teachers
about what students are expected to do in the course
and on the exam. The Achievement Level Descriptions (ALDs) present a continuum of expected student performance of the skills and learning objectives by levels 1–5. The ALDs work in concert with one
another and should be considered holistically. While
the ALDs give a picture of what student performance
looks like at each level, they do not necessarily predict students’ exam scores. Teachers can use them to
inform and make adjustments to their instruction and give feedback to students about how to push their performance to the next level.

Selecting and Using
Course Materials
Students must have access to the literary works from
the required reading list. The older texts are public domain and are readily available online. The more
modern texts are still under copyright and are available
in numerous published anthologies. There are several textbooks designed for AP Spanish Literature and
Culture. Each textbook presents a different method to
organize the course as well as strategies for studying
each of the texts. Textbooks should be considered as resources to guide and support instruction.
Authentic Materials
In addition to access to the required readings, it is
critical to integrate a variety of other authentic materials
into instruction and assessment. Authentic materials
are texts or resources designed for native speakers and
not created for the language classroom. Such authentic materials include, but are not limited to:
§Bullet websites §Bullet literary reviews, magazines, and articles
§Bullet audio clips (interviews, poetry recitations, lectures, and presentations) §Bullet podcasts §Bullet music
§Bullet videos (films, documentaries, and TV interviews) §Bullet radio broadcasts §Bullet maps
§Bullet artwork (paintings, sculptures, architecture, and photographs) §Bullet political cartoons
These materials help provide context for the required
readings. These contexts include historical events,
the author’s biography, geopolitical circumstances,
the literary period or movement, genre, and writing
techniques. Students are better able to connect with the required readings when they understand what
was happening when the work was written. Authentic materials also emphasize the cultural products,
practices, and perspectives in each literary work.
Online Tools and Resources
Real Academia Española (RAE) rae.es
The RAE offers online resources, including an online dictionary and grammar resources.
Arte Historia artehistoria.com
Teachers can easily search and find a plethora of
images, videos, articles, and presentations at Arte
Historia. Biographies, narrations of historical events,
and descriptions of literary periods and movements are easily accessible on this site.
Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes cervantesvirtual.com
The Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes contains
facsimiles of original texts, electronic editions of
texts, scholarly publications, literary criticism, and
author information. While its focus is on literature from
Peninsular Spain, there are numerous texts from Latin
America as well.

Professional Organizations
American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese (AATSP) aatsp.org
Teachers can gain insights on teaching Spanish
literature and network with other Spanish educators
by joining the AATSP. There are state chapters of this
organization and a peer-reviewed journal, Hispania, that publishes literary criticism.
American Council on the Teaching of Foreign
Languages (ACTFL) actfl.org
ACTFL is the largest organization of world language
educators in the United States. ACTFL’s standards and
approach for instruction, performance, and assessment are foundational to AP world language and culture courses and exams. ACTFL offers many documents that inform instruction and assessment:
§Bullet World-Readiness Standards for Learning
Languages “creates a roadmap to guide learners to develop competence to communicate effectively
and interact with cultural competence to participate
in multilingual communities at home and around the
world.” The five goal areas (Communication, Culture,
Connections, Comparisons, and Communities) of language constitute the standards for language acquisition. This document is foundational for AP world language and culture courses.
§Bullet Performance Descriptors for Language Learners defines and describes the levels of language performance (novice, intermediate, advanced) in each of the modes of communication that result
from explicit instruction in a classroom setting. It explains the difference between proficiency and performance. AP world language courses base expectations for performance on this document.
§Bullet ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines 2012 defines and describes the levels of proficiency in speaking, writing, listening, and reading that result from language learned within and beyond the classroom.
§Bullet Foreign Language Annals is the official refereed journal of current scholarly research in languages published by ACTFL and available to ACTFL members.
Modern Language Association (MLA) mla.org
The MLA is a large professional organization that
advocates for the study of languages and literature
and specializes in peer-reviewed publications for the study and teaching of literature. The MLA manages a searchable database, the MLA International
Bibliography, where literary articles, books, and
scholarly publications are indexed and made available.

Instructional Strategies
The AP Spanish Literature and Culture course framework outlines the concepts and
skills students need to master to be successful on the AP Exam. In order to address
those concepts and skills effectively, it helps to incorporate a variety of instructional
approaches into daily lessons and activities. The following table presents strategies
that can help students apply their understanding of course concepts.

Receptive Skills: Interpretative Mode (making meaning of written, print, visual, audiovisual, and audio texts)
Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Activating Prior
Knowledge
Providing an opportunity for students to think about what they already know about a concept, place, person, culture, etc., and share their knowledge with a wider audience.
Helps prepare students to encounter new concepts, places, persons, cultures etc., prior to reading a text.
Prepare students with a pre-reading activity.
Show students a painting that represents the historical period, a theme, or a technique that is represented in a work from the required reading list.
Categorizing
Matching the structure and style of a text to the definitions of a genre, period, movement, or technique.

AP Spanish Literature and Culture Course and Exam Description

=== Page 181 ===
Success in AP Spanish Literature and Culture
There are five key elements that students must be
able to manage for each of the 38 required works to be successful on the AP Exam:
1. Themes
Students must be able to identify a theme in a
literary text. The six required course themes should be a focus of the course; however, any theme is
worth exploring even if it is not one of the required themes. Students must be able to explain how the theme is developed and provide well-chosen examples from the text to demonstrate that development.
2. Literary terms
There are many literary terms, some of which are
listed in the course framework. While this is not an
exhaustive list, it is a good place to begin. Students
must learn how to identify structural, rhetorical,
and stylistic literary devices in a text. They must also know how to define their functions, explain
their uses, and analyze their effects. Many students simply identify literary terms by pointing them
out in a text, which is only the first step. Teachers can help make it a habit to move toward analysis
by discussing the function or effect of the literary device in the text.
3. Genres and subgenres
Each literary genre and subgenre has its own set of
characteristics that make it unique, which students
must be able to identify. They must also be able to
recognize the genre or subgenre of a literary work.
It is imperative that students learn to discriminate the characteristics of each genre and analyze how or why the author has chosen the particular genre or subgenre to express their message. It is worth
pointing out that not all literary or artistic works
fit into the defined categories. There are authors that have created hybrid genres that mix elements of different genres and subgenres. These works
are excellent for students to practice pointing out the characteristics of the different genres and subgenres in the work.
4. Literary periods and movements
As time passes, it becomes easier to see patterns amongst literary works that share common themes, genres or subgenres, or aesthetic qualities. Works that are written around the same time and share some of these characteristics are said to belong to a literary period or movement (that may or may not correspond to the artistic period or movement). As with genre, students
should be able to identify how literary periods or movements are different from each other and how they are born as reactions to their predecessors.
Because literary periods and movements are
artistic tendencies, they rarely have defined dates as to when they start or finish. Textual examples help determine whether or not a text belongs to or is affected by a literary period or movement.
There are several texts in the course that could belong to several literary periods or movements because they demonstrate several different
artistic influences that existed during the time that the work was written. Students should have the opportunity to debate and decide for themselves how to categorize works like these.
5. Contexts
To connect with a literary text, students need to know what influenced the creation of the literary work. Knowing these influences will highlight the cultural elements of the text and spark analysis.
Students should have the opportunity to become
familiar with the historical events occuring at the time the text was written. Knowing biographical
facts about the author can also explain characters or events in the texts. Students should also become familiar with the sociocultural and geopolitical elements of the texts.

También quejas del mar estoy haciendo.
¿De dónde sois?

De aquellas cabañas que miráis del viento heridas tan vitorios[o] entre ellas, cuyas pobres paredes desparcidas van en pedazos graves, dando [en] mil [grietas nidos] a las aves.

TISBEA
Si mi mancilla a lástima os provoca, y si injurias del mar os tienen loca, en vuestra compañía para serviros como humilde esclava me llevad; que querría, si el dolor o la afrenta no me acaba, pedir al rey justicia de un engaño cruel, de una malicia.
Del agua derrotado a esta tierra llegó don Juan Tenorio, difunto y anegado;
amparéle, hospedéle en tan notorio peligro, y el vil güésped víbora fue a mi planta e[n] tierno césped.
Con palabra de esposo, la que de esta costa burla hacía se rindió al engañoso;
¡mal haya la mujer que en hombres fía!
Fuése al fin, y dejóme:

ISABELA ¡Calla, mujer maldita!
¡Vete de mi presencia, que me has muerto!
Mas, si el dolor te incita no tienes culpa tú. Prosigue el cuento.

Section II: Free-Response
The following are examples of the kinds of free-response questions found on
the exam. Note that on the actual AP Exam, there will be two short-answer questions and two essay questions.
Short-Answer: Text Explanation (Free-Response Question 1)
Directions: Write a coherent and well organized response IN SPANISH on the topic that appears below.

Instrucciones: Escribe una respuesta coherente y bien organizada EN
ESPAÑOL sobre el siguiente tema.
Identifica al autor y la época de este fragmento. Luego, explica el desarrollo del
tema de las sociedades en contacto dentro de la obra a la que pertenece.
La noche buena se aproxima y la radio igualmente que la bocina de la camioneta que anunciaba las películas del
Teatro Ideal parecían empujarla con canción, negocio y bendición. Faltaban tres días para la noche buena cuando
doña María se decidió comprarles algo a sus niños. Esta sería la primera vez que les compraría juguetes. Cada año se
proponía hacerlo pero siempre terminaba diciéndose que no, que no podían. Su esposo de todas maneras les traía
dulces y nueces a cada uno, así que racionalizaba que en realidad no les faltaba nada. Sin embargo cada Navidad
preguntaban los niños por sus juguetes. Ella siempre los apaciguaba con lo de siempre. Les decía que se esperaran
hasta el seis de enero, el día de los reyes magos y así para cuando se llegaba ese día ya hasta se les había olvidado
todo a los niños. También había notado que sus hijos apreciaban menos y menos la venida de don Chon la noche de
Navidad cuando venía con el costal de naranjas y nueces.
“La noche buena” . . . y no se lo tragó la tierra

Poema 1
A Julia de Burgos [. . .] Tú eres de tu marido, de tu amo; yo no;
yo de nadie, o de todos, porque a todos,
a todos, en mi limpio sentir y en mi pensar me doy.
Tú te rizas el pelo y te pintas; yo no;
a mí me riza el viento, a mí me pinta el sol.
Tú eres dama casera, resignada, sumisa, atada a los prejuicios de los hombres; yo no;
que yo soy Rocinante corriendo desbocado olfateando horizontes de justicia de Dios.

Tú en ti misma no mandas; a ti todos te mandan;
en ti mandan tu esposo, tus padres, tus parientes, el cura, la modista, el teatro, el casino, el auto, las alhajas, el banquete, el champán, el cielo y el infierno, y el qué dirán social.
En mí no, que en mí manda mi solo corazón,
mi solo pensamiento; quien manda en mí soy yo. [. . .]
Julia de Burgos
Approved by the estate representative.

Poema 2
Grito indomable
Cómo van a verme buena si me truena la vida en las venas.
¡Si toda canción se me enreda 1
enredarse: inquietarse como una llamarada 2
llamarada: llama que se levanta del fuego y se apaga pronto !, y vengo sin Dios y sin miedo. . .
¡Si tengo sangre insubordinada y no puedo mostrarme dócil como una criada, mientras tenga un recuerdo de horizonte, un retazo 3

doña María se decidió comprarles algo a sus niños. Esta sería la primera vez que les compraría juguetes. Cada año se
proponía hacerlo pero siempre terminaba diciéndose que no, que no podían. Su esposo de todas maneras les traía
dulces y nueces a cada uno, así que racionalizaba que en realidad no les faltaba nada. Sin embargo cada Navidad
preguntaban los niños por sus juguetes. Ella siempre los apaciguaba con lo de siempre. Les decía que se esperaran
hasta el seis de enero, el día de los reyes magos y así para cuando se llegaba ese día ya hasta se les había olvidado
todo a los niños. También había notado que sus hijos apreciaban menos y menos la venida de don Chon la noche de
Navidad cuando venía con el costal de naranjas y nueces.
“La noche buena” . . . y no se lo tragó la tierra

Question 4: Essay - Text Comparison
Directions: Write a coherent and well-organized essay IN SPANISH on the topic that appears below.
Instrucciones: Escribe una ensayo coherente y bien organizada
EN ESPAÑOL sobre el siguiente tema.
Analiza el efecto de los recursos literarios que las poetas emplean en los dos poemas para desarrollar el tema de la imagen
pública y la imagen privada. En tu ensayo, compara la presentación de este tema en los dos poemas. Debes incluir ejemplos de los textos que apoyen tus ideas.
Poema 1
A Julia de Burgos [. . .] Tú eres de tu marido, de tu amo; yo no;
yo de nadie, o de todos, porque a todos,
a todos, en mi limpio sentir y en mi pensar me doy.
Línea Tú te rizas el pelo y te pintas; yo no;
a mí me riza el viento, a mí me pinta el sol.
Tú eres dama casera, resignada, sumisa, atada a los prejuicios de los hombres; yo no;
que yo soy Rocinante corriendo desbocado olfateando horizontes de justicia de Dios.
5
10 Tú en ti misma no mandas; a ti todos te mandan;
en ti mandan tu esposo, tus padres, tus parientes, el cura, la modista, el teatro, el casino, el auto, las alhajas, el banquete, el champán, el cielo y el infierno, y el qué dirán social.
15 En mí no, que en mí manda mi solo corazón,
mi solo pensamiento; quien manda en mí soy yo. [. . .]
Julia de Burgos
Approved by the estate representative.

Poema 2
Grito indomable
Cómo van a verme buena si me truena la vida en las venas.
Verso 5 10 15 ¡Si toda canción se me enreda 1 como una llamarada 2!, y vengo sin Dios y sin miedo. . .
¡Si tengo sangre insubordinada y no puedo mostrarme dócil como una criada, mientras tenga un recuerdo de horizonte, un retazo 3 de cielo, y una cresta 4 de monte!
Ni tú ni el cielo ni nada podrán con mi grito indomable.
