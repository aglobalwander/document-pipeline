## Getting Coaching Started

We are often asked questions like the following:

- How do I get started?
- Where do I begin?
- How do I find the time to coach?
- How much time should I allow?
- How long will it take to implement Cognitive Coaching?
- What should I do about reluctant teachers?

Although we have no prescriptions for each reader's unique situation, we have some general suggestions gleaned from working with numerous educators and school districts:

- As a novice Cognitive Coach, begin with a colleague who is relatively secure and with whom you already have a trusting relationship. Preview your intentions and procedures. As your skills become more automatic, you may wish to become more venturesome with new acquaintances and less-experienced teachers.
- For administrators whose staff has experienced a more traditional evaluative form of supervision, a demonstration in which staff members observe the differences between Cognitive Coaching and their previous experiences is a highly successful strategy. Communicate clearly at the outset that the purpose of Cognitive Coaching is to refine and make automatic the intellectual skills associated with effective instruction. Be equally clear that the coaching process is not an evaluation. Explain that your coaching behaviors will include pausing, paraphrasing, clarifying, and posing

questions.

- Explain why you remain nonjudgmental and do not give advice. Some Cognitive Coaches have begun by switching roles: having the uninitiated teacher follow the planning conversation map. While the coach teaches a lesson or conducts a meeting, the colleague observes. Thus, the teacher becomes acquainted with the process by actually coaching the coach. Variations of this process have been used with student teachers and first-year teachers to model for them the basics of instructional thought.
