The Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the
16 to 19 age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be
knowledgeable and inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis
on encouraging students to develop intercultural understanding, open‑mindedness, and
the attitudes necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core. Students
study two modern languages (or a modern language and a classical language),
a ­humanities or social science subject, an experimental science, mathematics
and one of the creative arts. Instead of an arts subject, students can choose two
subjects from another area. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes
the Diploma Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare
students effectively for university entrance. In each of the academic areas students
have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can choose subjects
that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.
Normally, three subjects (and not more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and
the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends 240 teaching hours for HL
subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than
at SL. In addition, three core elements—the extended essay, theory of knowledge and creativity,
activity, service—are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.

I. Course description and aims
As one of the three natural sciences in the IB Diploma Programme, biology is primarily concerned with
the study of life and living systems. Biologists attempt to make sense of the world through a variety of
approaches and techniques, controlled experimentation and collaboration between scientists. At a time
of global introspection on human activities and their impact on the world around us, developing and
communicating a clear understanding of the living world has never been of greater importance than it is today.
Through the study of DP biology, students are empowered to make sense of living systems through
unifying themes. By providing opportunities for students to explore conceptual frameworks, they are
better able to develop understanding and awareness of the living world around them. This is carried
further through a study of interactions at different levels of biological organization, from molecules and
cells to ecosystems and the biosphere. Integral to the student experience of the DP biology course is the
learning that takes place through scientific inquiry. With an emphasis on experimental work, teachers
provide students with opportunities to ask questions, design experiments, collect and analyse data,
collaborate with peers, and reflect, evaluate and communicate their findings.
DP biology enables students to constructively engage with topical scientific issues. Students examine
scientific knowledge claims in a real-world context, fostering interest and curiosity. By exploring the
subject, they develop understandings, skills and techniques which can be applied across their studies and beyond.

Through the overarching theme of the nature of science, the course aims to enable students to:
1.
develop conceptual understanding that allows connections to be made between different areas of the subject, and to other DP sciences subjects 2.
acquire and apply a body of knowledge, methods, tools and techniques that characterize science 3.
develop the ability to analyse, evaluate and synthesize scientific information and claims 4.
develop the ability to approach unfamiliar situations with creativity and resilience 5.
design and model solutions to local and global problems in a scientific context 6.
develop an appreciation of the possibilities and limitations of science 7.
develop technology skills in a scientific context 8.
develop the ability to communicate and collaborate effectively 9.
develop awareness of the ethical, environmental, economic, cultural and social impact of science.
II. Curriculum model overview
The DP biology course promotes concept-based teaching and learning to foster critical thinking.
The DP biology course is built on:
• approaches to learning • nature of science • skills in the study of biology.
These three pillars support a broad and balanced experimental programme. As students progress through
the course, they become familiar with traditional experimentation techniques, as well as the application
of technology. These opportunities help them to develop their investigative skills and evaluate the
impact of error and uncertainty in scientific inquiry. The scientific investigation then places a specific
emphasis on inquiry-based skills and the formal communication of scientific knowledge. Finally, the
collaborative sciences project extends the development of scientific communication in a collaborative
and interdisciplinary context, allowing students to work together beyond the confines of biology.

Skills in the study of biology
The skills and techniques students must experience through the course are encompassed within the
tools. These support the application and development of the inquiry process in the delivery of the biology course.
Tools •
Experimental techniques •
Technology •
Mathematics
Inquiry process •
Exploring and designing •
Collecting and processing data •
Concluding and evaluating
Teachers are encouraged to provide opportunities for students to encounter and practise the skills
throughout the programme. Rather than being taught as stand-alone topics, these skills should be
integrated into the teaching of the syllabus when they are relevant to the syllabus topics being covered.
III. Assessment model
There are four assessment objectives for the DP biology course. Having followed the biology course,
students are expected to demonstrate the following assessment objectives.
Assessment objective 1
Demonstrate knowledge of:
• terminology, facts and concepts • skills, techniques and methodologies.
Assessment objective 2
Understand and apply knowledge of:
• terminology and concepts • skills, techniques and methodologies.
Assessment objective 3
Analyse, evaluate, and synthesize:
• experimental procedures • primary and secondary data • trends, patterns and predictions.
Assessment objective 4
Demonstrate the application of skills necessary to carry out insightful and ethical investigations.
