## Can One Person Evaluate and Support?

Research by Carl Glickman (1985) at the University of Georgia sought an answer to the question 'Is it possible for one person to serve as both a supporting supervisor (coach, consultant) and an evaluator of performance?' Glickman found that it can if:

- 1.  Trust exists in the relationship and the process.
- 2.  The teacher is clear about which role the principal is performing in the moment.
- 3.  The principal's behaviors are pure. That is, when evaluating, only evaluating behaviors are used. When consulting, only consulting behaviors are used (providing data, making judgments, interpreting

possible relationships, providing options, offering advice, advocating). When coaching, only coaching behaviors are used (paraphrasing, giving data, asking questions, inviting self-assessment, eliciting analysis, inviting synthesis of learning, requesting commitment). Mingling these three classes of behavior sends a mixed message, and the learning potential of the brain shuts down, which is one more indicator of the power of emotions to disrupt thinking. Anxiety signals from the limbic brain can create neural static, sabotaging the ability of the prefrontal lobe to maintain working memory (Goleman 1997).

Glickman's findings become especially important as many school districts encourage teachers to serve in support roles with their colleagues. Among the forms this support takes are beginning teacher induction programs, peer coaching, mentoring, peer assistance, and peer review. Being an outstanding teacher, however, does not automatically translate into being an effective mentor for other teachers. Just one or two teachers unskilled with the functions of mentoring, consulting, coaching, or peerassisted review can disastrously affect morale and teachers' willingness to be open to collegial support (Costa and Garmston 2000).

On the other hand, many programs have developed thoughtful curricula for preparing teachers to work in support relationships with their peers.
