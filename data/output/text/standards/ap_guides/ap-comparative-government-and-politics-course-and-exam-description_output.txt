AP Equity and Access Policy
College Board strongly encourages educators to make equitable access a guiding
principle for their AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared
students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination
of barriers that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and
socioeconomic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented. Schools
should make every effort to ensure their AP classes reflect the diversity of their
student population. College Board also believes that all students should have
access to academically challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes,
which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to
equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.

About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking
AP courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and
AP Exams are developed and scored by college faculty
and experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges
and universities in the United States grant credit,
advanced placement, or both on the basis of successful
AP Exam scores; more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their own curriculum for AP courses and selecting appropriate college-level readings, assignments, and resources. This course and exam description
presents the content and skills that are the focus of
the corresponding college course and that appear on
the AP Exam. It also organizes the content and skills
into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many
AP teachers have told us they follow in order to focus
their instruction. The intention of this publication is to
respect teachers’ time and expertise by providing a
roadmap that they can modify and adapt to their local
priorities and preferences. Moreover, by organizing the
AP course content and skills into units, the AP Program
is able to provide teachers and students with formative assessments—Personal Progress Checks—that
teachers can assign throughout the year to measure
students’ progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students:
Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically
challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to equitable preparation and
access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses:
The AP Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP courses
must participate in the AP Course Audit, a process through which AP teachers’ course materials are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.

AP Comparative Government and Politics Course and Exam Description

=== Page 9 ===
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the
AP teacher and the school principal (or designated
administrator) to confirm awareness and understanding
of the curricular and resource requirements. A syllabus
or course outline, detailing how course requirements
are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The
AP Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor;
all AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision,
piloting, and analysis to ensure that questions are
accurate, fair, and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development,
College Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher
education institutions. This feedback is carefully
considered to ensure that AP courses and exams are
able to provide students with a college-level learning
experience and the opportunity to demonstrate their
qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam
development process, relies on the expertise of both
AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice
questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course performance
assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands
of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are
scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion
is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained,
and their work is monitored throughout the Reading
for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief
Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers
in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of
the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a curve.
Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which means that
every student who meets the criteria for an AP score of
2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no matter how many
students that is. The criteria for the number of points
students must earn on the AP Exam to receive scores
of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently
validates for credit and placement purposes—include:
§§ The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
§§ The number of points researchers have found to be predictive that an AP student will succeed when placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
§§ Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP scores as follows:
AP Score

College Grade
Equivalent 5
Extremely well qualified
A 4

AP Comparative Government and Politics Course and Exam Description

=== Page 10 ===
While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and
universities. To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/ placement policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/creditpolicies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score the free-response sections of the AP Exams.
Ninety-eight percent of surveyed educators who took
part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an
AP Reader, including opportunities to:
§§ Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
§§ Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure
to the quality and depth of the responses from the entire pool of AP Exam takers and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
§§ Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
§§ Score from home: AP Readers have online
distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects.
Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
§§ Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs):
AP Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.
How to Apply

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide suggests a
sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds skill instruction across units, organizes content
into topics, and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course topics and skills, create
customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.
*To report misuses, please call 877-274-6474  (International: +1-212-632-1781).

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
§§ Teachers and students sign in to or create their College Board accounts.
§§ Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
§§ Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
§§ Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP Coordinator.
§§ Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and
AP Coordinators to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following
additional benefits:
§§ Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
§§ Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
§§ Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student pack.
The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for preadministration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
§§ Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

Instructional
Model
Integrating AP resources throughout the course can help students develop skills and
conceptual understandings. The instructional model outlined below shows possible ways to incorporate AP resources into the classroom.
Plan
Teachers may consider the following approaches as they plan their instruction before teaching each unit.
§§ Review the overview at the start of each unit guide to identify essential questions,
conceptual understandings, and skills for each unit.
§§ Use the Unit at a Glance table to identify related topics that build toward a common
understanding and then plan appropriate pacing for students.
§§ Identify useful strategies in the Instructional Approaches section to help teach the concepts and skills.
Teach
When teaching, supporting resources could be used to build students’ conceptual understanding and their mastery of skills.
§§ Use the topic pages in the unit guides to identify the required content.
§§ Integrate the content with a skill, considering any appropriate scaffolding.
§§ Employ any of the instructional strategies previously identified.
§§ Use the available resources on the topic pages to bring a variety of assets into the classroom.
Assess
Teachers can measure student understanding of the content and skills covered in the unit and provide actionable feedback to students.
§§ At the end of each unit, use AP Classroom to assign students the online Personal
Progress Checks, as homework or an in-class task.
§§ Provide question-level feedback to students through answer rationales; provide unit- and
skill-level feedback using the progress dashboard.
§§ Create additional practice opportunities using the AP Question Bank and assign them through AP Classroom.

About the AP
Comparative Government and Politics Course
AP Comparative Government and Politics introduces students to the rich diversity of political
life outside the United States. The course uses a comparative approach to examine the
political structures; policies; and political, economic, and social challenges of six selected
countries: China, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, Russia, and the United Kingdom. Students compare
the effectiveness of approaches to many global issues by examining how different
governments solve similar problems. They will also engage in disciplinary practices that
require them to read and interpret data, make comparisons and applications, and develop evidence-based arguments.
College Course Equivalent
AP Comparative Government and Politics is equivalent to a one-semester introductory
college course in comparative government and politics.
Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites for AP Comparative Government and Politics. Students should be
able to read a college-level textbook and write grammatically correct, complete sentences.

AP COMPARATIVE
GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS

=== Page 18 ===
Introduction
The AP Comparative Government and Politics course detailed in this
framework reflects what comparative political science teachers, professors,
and researchers agree that a college-level comparative government and
politics course should teach students to do: define and describe major
political concepts, analyze patterns of political processes and behavior and
their consequences, and compare and contrast political institutions and processes across countries.
The AP Comparative Government and Politics Course and Exam Description defines what representative
colleges and universities typically expect students
to know and be able to do in order to earn college credit or placement. Students practice the skills
used by comparative political scientists by studying
data, political writings from different countries, and
the processes and outcomes of politics in a variety
of country settings. Students will show mastery of
these skills on the AP Exam through various means,
including applying concepts, analyzing data, comparing
countries, and writing political science arguments.
Students study six countries in AP Comparative
Government and Politics: China, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria,
Russia, and the United Kingdom.*
Although the course framework is designed to
provide a clear and detailed description of the course
content and skills, it is not a curriculum. Teachers create
their own curricula to meet the needs of their students and any state or local requirements.
*We recognize that the official names of these countries are the People’s Republic of China, Islamic Republic of Iran, United Mexican States,
Federal Republic of Nigeria, Russian Federation, and United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. In AP Comparative Government and Politics, we use the common forms of these names.

Course Framework
Components
Overview
This course framework provides a description of what students should know and
be able to do to qualify for college credit or placement.
The course framework includes two essential components:
1   DISCIPLINARY PRACTICES
The disciplinary practices are central to the study and practice of
comparative government and politics. Students should develop and apply
the described practices on a regular basis over the span of the course.
2   COURSE CONTENT
The course content is organized into commonly taught units of study that
provide a suggested sequence for the course. These units comprise the
content and conceptual understandings that colleges and universities
typically expect students to master to qualify for college credit and/or
placement. This content is grounded in big ideas, which are cross-cutting
concepts that build conceptual understanding and spiral throughout the course.

AP COMPARATIVE
GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS
Course
Content
Based on the Understanding by Design® (Wiggins and McTighe) model, this
course framework provides a description of the course requirements necessary
for student success. The framework specifies what students should know and be
able to do to, with a focus on big ideas that encompass core principles, theories,
and processes of the discipline. The framework also encourages instruction that
prepares students for advanced comparative political science coursework and to be active and informed about politics abroad.
Big Ideas
The big ideas serve as the foundation of the course and enable students to create
meaningful connections among concepts. They are themes that become threads
that run throughout the course. Revisiting the big ideas and applying them in a
variety of contexts allows students to develop a deeper conceptual understanding.
Below are the big ideas of the course and a brief description of each.
2
BIG IDEA 1: POWER AND AUTHORITY (PAU)
Political systems and regimes govern societies and determine who has
power and authority. They shape the level of legitimacy and produce different policy outcomes.
BIG IDEA 2: LEGITIMACY AND STABILITY (LEG)
Political legitimacy is the degree to which a government’s right to rule
is accepted by the citizenry. Governments that maintain high levels of
legitimacy tend to be more stable and have an easier time enacting, implementing, and enforcing their policies.
BIG IDEA 3: DEMOCRATIZATION (DEM)
Democratization is a process that involves the adoption of free and fair
elections, the extension of civil liberties, and the establishment of the rule of
law. Democratization is a long-term and often uneven process that typically
results in increased governmental transparency and greater citizen access and influence over policy making.

UNITS
The course content is organized into commonly
taught units. The units have been arranged in a logical sequence frequently found in many college courses and textbooks.
The five units in AP Comparative Government and
Politics, and their weighting on the multiple-choice section of the AP Exam, are listed below.
Pacing recommendations at the unit level and
on the Course at a Glance table provide suggestions on how to teach the required course content and administer the Personal Progress Checks. The suggested class periods are based on a schedule
Units
Exam Weighting
Unit 1: Political Systems, Regimes, and Governments 18–27%
Unit 2: Political Institutions 22–33%
Unit 3: Political Culture and Participation 11–18%
Unit 4: Party and Electoral Systems and Citizen Organizations 13–18%
Unit 5: Political and Economic Changes and Development 16–24%
in which the class meets five days a week for 45 minutes each day. While these recommendations have been
made to aid planning, teachers should of course adjust the pacing based on the needs of their students,
alternate schedules (e.g., block scheduling), or their school’s academic calendar.
TOPICS
Each unit is broken down into teachable segments
called topics. The topic pages (starting on page 34)
contain all required content for each topic. Although
most topics can be taught in one or two class periods,
teachers are again encouraged to pace the course to suit the needs of their students and school.
BIG IDEA 4: INTERNAL/EXTERNAL FORCES (IEF)
Internal forces, such as political culture, citizen participation, civil society,
interest groups, environmental pressures, and internal divisions based on
class, religion, ethnicity, and/or territory, can both challenge and reinforce
regimes. External forces, especially globalization, include the increasing
worldwide flow of goods, investments, ideas, and people in a manner that is largely unconstrained by national borders.
BIG IDEA 5: METHODS OF POLITICAL ANALYSIS (MPA)
Political scientists collect data and make observations in order to describe
patterns and trends and explain the political behavior of individuals, groups,
organizations, and governments. They use data and ideas from other
disciplines such as economics, sociology, history, and geography when drawing conclusions.

Unit
Guides
Introduction
Designed with extensive input from the community of AP Comparative
Government and Politics educators, the unit guides offer all teachers
helpful guidance in building students’ skills and knowledge. The suggested
sequence in these unit guides was identified through a thorough analysis
of the syllabi of highly effective AP teachers and the organization of typical college textbooks.
This unit structure respects new AP teachers’ time by providing one
possible sequence they can adopt or modify rather than having to build
from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units enable the AP
Program to provide interested teachers with formative assessments—the
Personal Progress Checks—that they can assign their students at the end
of each unit to gauge progress toward success on the AP Exam. However,
experienced AP teachers who are satisfied with their current course
organization and exam results should feel no pressure to adopt these units,
which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

Developing Understanding
Comparative political scientists seek to understand similarities and differences between
states, evaluating political realities and understanding political change. This first unit sets
the foundation for students to think like comparative political scientists by teaching them to
read and analyze qualitative and quantitative data related to the six required course countries
(China, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, Russia, and the United Kingdom) and helping them understand
concepts and examples they can use to support an argument about the countries.
Understanding the similarities and differences in political systems, regimes, and
governments—how they function and how they gain and maintain power and legitimacy—
as well as the terminology used to describe them provides students with the foundational
knowledge needed to be able to compare course countries throughout future units.
Building the
Disciplinary Practices
2.A  3.B  4.A
Comparative political scientists study political systems, principles, institutions, processes, policies, and behaviors in various countries.
This first unit introduces the practice of data analysis. Quantitative data may be represented in tables, charts, graphs, maps, or infographics. Initially, students should accurately describe presented data, which builds an understanding that allows them to then identify and explain trends and patterns in the data.
Like quantitative sources, text-based qualitative sources help students understand how governmental and political institutions function and the reasons for their behaviors.
When asking students to use these sources, have them identify an author’s claim(s) and the supporting evidence and whether that evidence is logical throughout the piece.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The AP Comparative Government and Politics course requires students to apply their knowledge in a variety of contexts and real-world scenarios. On the AP Exam, students will show an understanding of how political concepts actually work, often by describing or explaining an interaction or application within a given scenario.
The conceptual analysis question on the exam requires that students focus on the application of a concept with no required country. Students should go beyond description and definition by explaining the impact of a political concept and transferring their knowledge to different political concepts.
Students often struggle with explanations by neglecting to explain the how or why in the context of the question. Have students practice by asking them to explain the steps, stages, and interactions of processes;
explain and link causes and effects; and identify and explain the significance of similarities and differences.
UNIT OPENERS
Developing Understanding provides an overview that
contextualizes and situates the key content of the unit within the scope of the course.
The big ideas serve as the foundation of the course and
develop understanding as they spiral throughout the course.
The essential questions are thought-provoking questions that motivate students and inspire inquiry.
Building the Disciplinary Practices describes specific aspects
of the practices that are appropriate to focus on in that unit.
Preparing for the AP Exam provides helpful tips and common
student misunderstandings identified from prior exam data.
The Unit at a Glance table shows the topics, related enduring
understandings, and suggested skills. The “class periods”
column has been left blank so that teachers can customize the time they spend on each topic.
The suggested skill for each topic shows one way teachers
can link the content in that topic to a specific AP Comparative
Government and Politics skill. The individual skill has been
thoughtfully chosen in a way that allows teachers to spiral
those skills, along with the disciplinary practices, throughout
the course. The questions on the Personal Progress Checks are
based on this pairing. However, AP Exam questions can pair the content with any of the skills.

Sample Activity 1 1.1
Create Representations
Using the data collection resources identified in essential knowledge statement MPA-1.A.8
(e.g., the Human Development Index), ask students to identify a set of data that can be
used to investigate relationships among course countries, such as voting patterns by
gender and ethnicity. Then have them create a representation that best shows the data
and the trends. Follow up this activity with a whole-group discussion about quantitative analysis and why it is important.
2 1.3
Graphic Organizer
This topic is a good place to introduce a comparative look across the core course
countries. Using a graphic organizer, such as a Venn diagram, and the content in essential
knowledge statements PAU-1.B.1, PAU-1.B.2, and PAU-1.B.3, ask students to generate the
relevant similarities and differences between the countries and their governments.
3 1.6
Discussion Groups
Use learning objective PAU-1.D (Explain sources of power and authority in political
systems) and have students gather information and show their understanding of changes
in power and authority. Ask students to consider peaceful versus violent change or how
different regimes maintain sovereignty. By allowing students to engage in small-group
discussion, you can then scale up to a whole-group discussion, which may expand on the ideas expressed in the small groups.
SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways
to incorporate instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities and are free to alter or edit them. The examples below were developed in

PAU-1
Political systems and regimes reflect the dynamic balance of power between the government and its citizens.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
PAU-1.D
Explain sources of power and authority in political systems.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PAU-1.D.2
How a regime chooses to use power in support of sovereignty is determined in large part by its democratic or authoritarian characteristics— democratic regimes can maintain sovereignty using less power than authoritarian regimes.
PAU-1.D.3
Changes in regimes occur when rules and institutions are replaced either incrementally or suddenly, as a result of elections, coups, or revolutions in which a large portion of the population supports a change in the political system.
PAU-1.D.4
Governments, including political officeholders, can be changed more frequently and easily than regimes through the relatively peaceful process of elections, appointments, and lines of succession. However, governments also change by more violent means, such as revolutions or coups d’état, represented by such violent transitions in Iran and Nigeria.

Distribution of power and authority and the influence of internal and external actors affect regime stability.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
PAU-2.A a. Describe federal and unitary systems among course countries.
b. Explain the purposes of adopting a federal or unitary system.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PAU-2.A.1
Federal states like Mexico, Nigeria, and Russia divide power among different levels of government to confer a degree of local autonomy in supplying social and educational services, while also reserving powers for the national government. Unitary states like China,
Iran, and the United Kingdom concentrate power at the national level with more uniform policies and potentially more efficient policy making.
PAU-2.A.2
The degree to which power is centralized or decentralized can change over time in both federal and unitary states, and in many cases reflects a state response to internal and external actors that include ethnic cleavages and operations of supranational organizations and other countries.

Building the
Disciplinary Practices
4.B  5.A
Comparing countries with similar and different political concepts and processes helps students identify problems, analyze policy making, and ultimately explain implications of policy decisions. Coming to understandings by comparison, without preconceived notions, highlights how countries have solved problems or exacerbated them.
In the previous unit, students began practicing identifying and describing the perspective of the author, and now, they will start to connect the author’s perspective to the political elements of a country and eventually show how the perspective could impact a country’s political elements.
As students begin to read and analyze text based sources in this unit, these sources can serve as models for students’ development of writing their own arguments. Developing an argument in an essay is an important practice in comparative political science and will be assessed on the AP Exam. Student arguments need to be defensible and not simply a restatement of a prompt.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Exam, students will be asked to make connections between political concepts, course countries, and arguments in text-based sources. One way that comparative political scientists often think about those connections is by making comparisons between concepts. Students will make comparisons and draw conclusions on both sections of the exam.
The comparative analysis question on the
AP Exam requires that students focus on comparison of concepts. When making comparisons, it’s important for students to identify the relevant categories of comparison (i.e., what characteristic or attribute they should compare). Two common mistakes that students make are discussing similarities and differences that are (1) not relevant based on the given task and (2) not shared by the objects of comparison. Have students practice identifying categories of comparison regularly. Once students have identified an appropriate and relevant category of comparison, then they can develop their explanation of why the similarities or differences exist and why they are significant.
BIG IDEA 1
Power and Authority  PAU §§ What are the implications of cooperation and conflict within a country’s political system?
Developing Understanding
This unit first looks at the political structure in each course country and then the executive,
legislative, and judicial systems within the political structure. Students develop an
understanding of the various structures of the branches of government as well as how each uses the structure to wield and maintain power.
Knowing and applying country-specific terminology allows students to understand the
similarities and differences between different systems of authority in the context of
the six course countries. At the end of this unit, students should be able to characterize the
advantages and disadvantages of different institutional arrangements and the implications
of having one system over another in regard to stability, legitimacy, and policy making.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways
to incorporate instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities and are free to alter or edit them. The examples below were developed in
partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways that they approach teaching
some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional Approaches section beginning
on p. 129 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 2.2
Debate
A debate gives students both the opportunity to collect evidence in support of their position
and the chance to orally present and defend it. Be sure to direct students to uncover both the
affirming and contradictory evidence on their position. For this topic, you could have students
debate whether policy making is more efficient in a presidential or a parliamentary system.
2 2.4
Critique Reasoning
In 2018, China removed presidential term limits. Using op-eds from major national and
international newspapers and magazines, ask students to undertake critique reasoning to
identify authors’ claims, evidence, and analysis. Additionally, have students make connections
to previously studied relevant course concepts. Allow for collaborative discussion at multiple
levels—pairs, small groups, and whole group—to achieve understanding.
3 2.6
Jigsaw
Using a variety of reference texts (textbooks, websites, databases), place students in
country-specific “expert” groups to examine legislative systems. The structures and
functions of legislatures in course countries are described in PAU-3.E.1. Then organize
students into groups where each course country is represented and have them summarize
and present information on the legislative structures of the course countries, allowing students to become “experts” on each country.
4 2.9
Match Claims and Evidence
After describing the structure and functions of judiciaries (Topic 2.8), give students sample
claims about independent judiciaries and ask them to evaluate and improve on the claims,
if necessary. Then ask them to identify evidence that can be used to support the claims,
culminating with a writing activity that asks them to state how and why the evidence they culled supports the claims.
Unit Planning Notes
Use the space below to plan your approach to the unit. Consider how you want to continue building the
skills of country comparison and source analysis while also introducing argumentation.

The structure and function of political institutions reflect the allocation of power within a political system.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
PAU-3.A
Describe parliamentary, presidential, and semi-presidential systems.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PAU-3.A.1
Parliamentary systems, such as the United
Kingdom, combine the lawmaking and executive functions, which allows the national legislature to select and remove the head of government and cabinet.
PAU-3.A.2
Presidential systems, such as Mexico and Nigeria, feature a cabinet that is mostly responsible to the elected executive, with a legislature that can only remove cabinet members through impeachment. These systems have separate fixed-term, popular elections for the national legislature, and a top executive leader serving as both head of state and head of government.
PAU-3.A.3
Semi-presidential systems, such as Russia, feature separate popular elections for the president and for the national legislature, allowing the president to nominate a prime minister (who must be approved by the legislature); members of the cabinet are held accountable by both the president and legislature.

Judiciaries in course countries have different functions and use various methods to appoint judges to interpret and apply laws and resolve disputes, represented by:
a.	 In China, rule by law (instead of rule of law) means the judicial system is subservient to the decisions of the Chinese Communist
Party (CPC), which controls most judicial appointments.
b.	 The Iranian judiciary’s major function is to ensure that the legal system is based on religious law, so judges must be trained in Islamic Sharia law. The head of the judiciary is appointed by the Supreme Leader and can nominate half of the Guardian Council with approval by the Majles.
c.	 The Mexican judiciary is in transition—the
Supreme Court has the power of judicial review and subsequent constitutional amendments have been implemented with the intent to make the system more independent and effective.

The structure and function of political institutions reflect the allocation of power within a political system.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
PAU-3.H
Explain the importance of independent judiciaries relative to other political institutions.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
PAU-3.H.1
The degree of the judiciary’s independence from other branches of government depends on the amount of authority the courts have to overrule executive and legislative actions, the process by which judicial officials acquire their jobs, the length of judicial terms, the professional and academic backgrounds that judicial officials are expected to have, and the processes used to remove judges from their posts.
PAU-3.H.2
Independent judiciaries can strengthen democracy by maintaining checks and balances, protecting rights and liberties, establishing the rule of law, and maintaining separation of powers.

Developing Understanding
Politics hinges on the interactions between the state and society. A country’s political
patterns are influenced by the characteristics and demands of its population. Citizens
participate in politics both individually and in groups. Cleavages within the population,
such as ethnicity, religion, or class, become politically relevant.
This unit includes civil society, a range of voluntary associations that are autonomous from the
state and that can help mediate state power and enhance the power of citizens. Students learn
about participation in both authoritarian and democratic regimes and how the type of regime
impacts the type of participation. Understanding that concept will help guide students in Unit 4,
where they consider the role and impact of parties and elections on political participation.
Building the
Disciplinary Practices
3.C  3.D  5.B  5.C
In the first unit students learned about the practice of data analysis and how to accurately describe presented data. Unit 2 builds on that understanding and expands it to include the ability to explain patterns and trends in data to draw conclusions about political elements within and across course countries. Students should begin to explain how and/or why processes, systems, institutions, elections, or demographics relate to one another and not simply describe them in isolation. As students continue to build these skills, they will then connect the data and its trends/patterns to draw implications about political systems, principles, institutions, processes, policies, or behaviors within and across the course countries.
In the previous unit, students began writing their own defensible arguments that were not simply restatements of the prompt. They should continue that practice by writing arguments that establish a line of reasoning, utilizing specific evidence to support their claim/thesis and unify the essay.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The AP Exam asks students to analyze quantitative data presented visually and apply that analysis to their understanding of political concepts in both the multiple-choice and free-response sections.
In both types of questions, students will need to be able to (1) identify or describe data, (2) describe patterns or trends in data, (3) describe or explain a political concept, (4) draw conclusions about patterns or trends in data, and (5) explain what the data implies or illustrates about political systems, principles institutions, processes, policies, and behaviors.
Students often struggle to connect conclusions drawn from data to political concepts, such as behavior. Encourage them to take their conclusions further and explain how a trend, identified by data, can lead to conclusions about a course country’s political system or institutions.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways
to incorporate instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities and are free to alter or edit them. The examples below were developed in
partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways that they approach teaching
some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional Approaches section beginning
on p. 129 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 3.1
Debriefing
Civil society is a challenging topic for students. They tend to struggle with defining and
applying it. For complex issues, such as civil society, you can lead a facilitated discussion to
solidify and deepen understanding of civil society, which is reflected in essential knowledge
statements IEF-1.A.1 and IEF-1A.2. You can have students do a comparison across countries,
including researching specific examples. For example, they could compare civil societies in
different types of governments (e.g., authoritarian versus democratic regimes).
2 3.4
Look for a Pattern
This topic presents an opportunity to analyze polling data that addresses values and
beliefs that impacts citizens’ voting and ultimately how they wish governments to make
policy choices that address political problems. Have students examine complex data with
multiple variables to find trends and draw conclusions. The Pew Research Center: Global
Attitudes & Trends is a resource for this data, and course countries may have their own
polling institutions. You may ask students to create their own visual representations after they evaluate data.
3 3.8
Socratic Seminar
By holding a focused discussion around the essential question What changes might
a government face in response to a controversial cleavage? you can provide students
with an opportunity to illustrate their understanding of the learning objectives LEG-2.A
and LEG-2.B and essential knowledge statements LEG-2.A.1 and LEG-2.B.1 to LEG-2.B.4
related to political and social cleavages. This activity also allows for comparative analysis
of cleavages across course countries, which is a challenge area for students.
Unit Planning Notes
Use the space below to plan your approach to the unit. Consider how you want to continue analyzing and

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
DEM-1.A
Explain the nature and role of political participation as related to a regime’s use of authority and power.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
DEM-1.A.1
Political participation can be voluntary or coerced and may occur at the individual or group level.
DEM-1.A.2
Political participation can range from behavior supportive of a regime (either independently or under state direction) to oppositional behavior that seeks to change governmental policies or overthrow the regime.
DEM-1.A.3
Certain political conditions make it more likely that citizens will engage in violent political behavior, including when citizens feel that more conventional options for political participation are ineffective or unavailable.
DEM-1.A.4
Formal political participation (including casting ballots in elections) can be encouraged across regime types to enhance legitimacy, gather input, act as a safety valve, or apply a check on governmental policies, though authoritarian regimes are more likely to use citizen participation to intimidate opposition or give an illusion of influence, while democratic regimes hold elections to allow citizen control of the policy-making process.

Explain how political participation affects and is affected by democratic or authoritarian regime types.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
DEM-1.B.1
Authoritarian and democratic regimes support similar forms of participation to influence policy making (including casting votes in public elections) but differ in how much impact citizens have on policies and policy making based on how open and competitive elections are. In many elections in authoritarian regimes, there are few if any opposition candidates—those advocating differing views from that of the controlling party/elite—who are allowed to run for office. The government often intervenes in these elections to ensure that its preferred candidates and parties win.
DEM-1.B.2
Informal participation, such as protests and political criticism expressed through social media, is treated differently across regime types. In authoritarian systems, there is less tolerance of critical viewpoints that may challenge authoritarian regimes.

b.	 In Iran, religious divisions between the
Shi’a Muslim majority and members of other religions, such as Christianity,
Judaism, and Zoroastrianism, have resulted in a threatening atmosphere despite official recognition; within practitioners of Islam, there are divisions between the
Shi’a majority and those who are Sunni.
There are also ethnic cleavages between the majority Persians and several ethnic minorities, including Azerbaijanis and Kurds.
c.	 In Mexico, ethnic divisions between the
Amerindian (indigenous) population and whites and mestizos, and regional divisions between the north and the south.

Yoruba, and Igbo), and religious and regional cleavages between the north (predominantly
Muslim) and the south (where Christians and animists are concentrated).
e.	 In Russia, cleavages between ethnic Russians, who are more than 80 percent of the population and tend to be Russian Orthodox, and minority, non-Russian populations (including the Chechens in the Caucasus region, who are predominantly Muslim).
f.	 In the United Kingdom, ethnic and regional differences between nations such as the
Scottish, English, Welsh, and Irish; religious differences between Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland; and racial tensions between whites and non-European minorities whose heritage is related to the
United Kingdom’s colonial history.
LEG-2.B.1
Major social and political cleavages differ across course countries and affect voting behavior and party systems as well as informal political networks.
LEG-2.B.2
Course countries have responded differently to
social cleavages and their political consequences.
a.	 Even stable regimes are increasingly dealing with radical/terrorist religious elements that have sprung from long-standing cleavages.
b.	 State responses can range from brute repression to recognition of ethnic/religious minorities and creation of autonomous regions and/or representation of minorities in governmental institutions.
LEG-2.B.3
Examples of the use of social and political cleavages to strengthen legitimacy and hold onto power can be found in all course countries. Such cleavages may also lead to conflict and undermine legitimacy.

UNIT 4
Developing Understanding
Individuals and groups use various ways to gain influence and power within a government and
its political institutions. This unit breaks down the larger concepts about political institutions
studied in Unit 2 and considers how individuals, parties, and citizen organizations influence
power. The exercise of political power in the six course countries occurs in a variety of ways.
For example, the rules of electoral systems, both formal and informal, have a profound impact
on citizen participation. Studying how and why a regime grants or limits access to sources
of power helps students understand and explain how this control ultimately impacts policy making in a global context.
Building the
Disciplinary Practices
2.C  4.C
In this unit, students compare countries with both similar and different political concepts and processes in order to identify problems, analyze policy making, and ultimately explain implications of these policy decisions.
While students often find it easy to make direct comparisons between countries, they struggle with analyzing the implications of how those similarities, or differences, can impact institutions, policies, and behavior.
As students continue to read and analyze text-based sources, it is important for them to begin to connect the implications of the author’s argument to a course country’s political systems, principles, institutions, processes, policies, and behaviors.
Furthermore, students should have the opportunity to read, analyze, and interpret the interplay of several text-based sources related to the course countries.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Although there is not a free-response question focused on source analysis on the
AP Exam, source analysis will be assessed in the multiple-choice questions.
Students should be able to read, analyze, and interpret text-based sources to build the skill of analysis. The author of each source conveys their idea, which is a claim, and they support that claim with evidence.
Students should be able to identify the claim and evidence, but they should also be able to explain how the author’s argument relates to political elements within and across course countries. Political scientists are asked to make predictions based on evidence and data and students may need assistance directly connecting a source’s implication to a predicted outcome.

Sample Activity 1 4.2
Think-Pair-Share
This topic hits two challenge areas for students: comparative analysis and political
institutions. To practice explaining how election rules serve different regime objectives, ask
students to consider ballot access, election wins, and constituency accountability. This
strategy allows students to develop initial ideas, test and revise with a partner, and then share with the larger group.
2 4.3
Making Connections
Write terms or concepts related to political party systems and party membership for
course countries on index cards and have students choose cards at random. Allow
students a couple of minutes to gather and recall information about the terms or concepts.
Then pair students and ask them to find and explain the similarities and differences
between their terms or concepts. This activity addresses the challenge areas of comparative analysis and political institutions.

Quickwrite
Set aside a short, specific amount of time during a class period for students to perform a
quickwrite on social movements and interest groups. As preparation for the free-response
question for which students write an argument, have students write claims and explain
evidence that supports those claims for various topics, such as how social movements
and interest groups affect social and political change in course countries.

Describe electoral systems and election rules among course countries.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
DEM-2.A.1
In some regimes, electoral rules and systems are structured to allow for the competitive selection of representatives, while in other regimes rules are frequently changed to advance different political interests.
a.	 The National People’s Congress of China selects members indirectly through a series of local and regional elections.
b.	 Iran’s Majles members are directly elected in single-member and multimember districts, which sometimes requires a second round of voting; candidates are vetted by the
Guardian Council, and the legislative body lacks formal political party structures; a small number of the 290 seats in the Majles are reserved for non-Muslim minorities, such as Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians.

LEARNING OBJECTIVE
DEM-2.A
Describe electoral systems and election rules among course countries.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE c.	 Mexico’s Congress of the Union has
two chambers: the Chamber of Deputies, which has 300 members directly elected in single-member districts by plurality and an additional 200 members elected by a proportional representation, party list system; and the Chamber of Senators, which has 96 members elected in three seat constituencies and 32 by proportional representation; gender quotas in the party list system have helped increase female representation in the legislature.
d.	 Members of the Nigerian House of Representatives are directly elected in single-member districts with representatives from each of Nigeria’s states; the number of representatives elected from each state is based on population size, whereas the Senate has three members directly elected from each of Nigeria’s 36 states; two major parties have alternated control of the National Assembly.
e.	 Changes to state Duma elections in Russia have returned it to a system in which half of the representatives are directly elected from single-member districts and the other half are chosen through elections that use proportional representation with a threshold.
f.	 The United Kingdom’s House of Commons members are directly elected under single member district, first-past-the-post rules.
DEM-2.A.2
Proportional representation relies on multimember districts that promote multiparty systems.

DEM-2.B.1
Proportional representation can result in an increase in the number of political parties represented in national legislatures, as well as an increase in the election of minority and women candidates.
DEM-2.B.2
Single-member district plurality systems tend to promote two-party systems. They provide voters with strong constituency service and accountability because there is a single representative per district, and they ensure geographic representation.
DEM-2.B.3
Different presidential election systems have different rules for determining election winners;
some systems employ second-round or runoff elections to obtain a majority vote, while others decide elections based on a plurality of most votes cast among candidates in the race.
a.	 Mexico’s president is elected by a plurality of the national popular vote, not an absolute majority.

DEM-2.B
Explain how election rules serve different regime objectives regarding ballot access, election wins, and constituency accountability.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE b.	 Presidential candidates in Nigeria must win the most votes and secure at least 25 percent of the vote in two-thirds of Nigeria’s states, reflecting the federal characteristic of this regime.
c.	 Presidential candidates in Iran and Russia must win an absolute majority of the popular vote in either the first or second round of national voting. If no candidate wins an absolute majority in the first round, the second round is conducted between the top two vote earners in the first round.
d.	 Majoritarian rules in Iran, Nigeria, and Russia provide the winners with a national mandate.
DEM-2.B.4
Different political systems use electoral regulatory organizations to set various rules about ballot access and competition.
a.	 Iran’s Guardian Council excludes reform minded candidates or those who do not support Islamic values from the ballot, which limits the number of candidates and reduces electoral competition and representation.
b.	 As part of their democratic transition,
Mexico and Nigeria have created independent election commissions that attempt to reduce voter fraud and manipulation and enhance electoral competition.
DEM-2.B.5
Some regimes use an appointment system for membership in legislative bodies to promote a diversity of viewpoints, while other regimes use it to advance the political agenda of governing elites.
a.	 Appointments for the United Kingdom’s
House of Lords are approved by the monarch with recommendations made by the prime minister and an independent commission.

Developing Understanding
The interaction of political and economic changes within and across the course countries and
how these changes impact political policies and behaviors is particularly important for students
to understand. They need to connect what they learned about the domestic political power
structure in previous units with how that structure plays out in an interconnected global context.
Every country studied in this course has had profound economic and political change over
the past 30 years. Students will study political changes through the lens of democratization
and the relative success or failure of these efforts to take hold. The economic impact
of globalization on local citizens, relationships between countries, and the response to
challenges presented in this economic reality are the focus of the unit.
Building the
Disciplinary Practices
3.E  5.D
In previous units, students practiced data analysis and looked at what data communicates. As students build on that skill in this unit, they confront the possible limitations of data and need to determine what information is missing. What does the data not tell us about political systems, principles, institutions, processes, policies, and behaviors? Data analysis is a challenge area for students, so regular practice will help. Have students search for credible data sources that might help create a more robust understanding of a political system, principle, institution, process, policy, or behavior from within or across course countries.
In earlier units, students also began building their arguments, which incorporated a defensible claim, relevant evidence, and a line of reasoning. In this unit, they continue to use those skills but now also use refutation, concession, or rebuttal when they respond to opposing perspectives. By offering the rebuttal, but succinctly stating for the reader why their claim/thesis is more effective, they develop a high-quality argument.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The argument essay on the AP Exam asks students to respond to an opposing or alternate perspective or demonstrate a complex understanding of the topic. It is not enough for students to simply identify an opposing or alternate perspective, they should demonstrate a correct understanding of the perspective by briefly describing it and then refute, concede, or rebut that perspective. They may demonstrate a complex understanding in multiple ways:
(1) qualify or modify an argument by considering diverse or alternate views or evidence, (2) explain the nuance of an issue by analyzing multiple variables, or (3) explain relevant or insightful connections across required course countries.
This task is often difficult for students.
Many students can identify an opposing or alternate perspective, but they struggle to explain why the other perspective is incorrect or why the other perspective may be more correct than their own.

Sample Activity 1 5.1
Close Reading
Students often struggle with the differences between international economic
institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World
Trade Organization. Present students with readings about these organizations (charters,
newspaper or magazine articles) and ask them to highlight country-specific words and
passages in order to then connect them to political policies, behaviors, and culture.

Guided Discussion
This umbrella strategy allows you to use multiple techniques with students in a lesson.
For this topic, use brainstorming and quickwrite as strategies during a guided discussion
to help students understand how international and supranational organizations influence
domestic policymakers and national sovereignty. This will help students see the big picture of stability (enduring understanding LEG-3).
3 5.7
Self/Peer Revision
By this point in the course, students should have had multiple opportunities to practice
their argumentative essay writing. This strategy employs students to act as reviewers of
their peers to provide feedback on essay components. This topic offers an opportunity for
students to practice using refutation, concession, or rebuttal in responding to opposing or
alternate perspectives regarding the impact of industrialization and economic development.
4 5.9
Fishbowl
This strategy requires students to be, at different times, active participants and listeners. It
also asks students to bring textual evidence to their discussions to support their opinions.
Using secondary sources about course countries and their natural resource endowments,
ask students to discuss how these natural resources affect political and economic
development. You may wish to focus on rentier states and the “resource curse.”

Demographic changes have political causes and consequences, and they can present challenges to a government’s legitimacy.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
LEG-4.A
Explain political causes and consequences of demographic changes.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
LEG-4.A.1
Growing populations, changing land use and values, and economic opportunities motivate internal and external population movements (including when populations shift from rural to urban areas or when net migration rates change) and the corresponding demographic changes pose significant challenges to governmental resources.
LEG-4.A.2
Government policies and employment opportunities can draw workers to different geographic regions or influence positive or negative migration rates, often deepening preexisting class and regional differences and taxing government resources:
a.	 China’s shifting emphasis from agriculture to industry, the creation of special economic zones, the encouragement of foreign direct investment, and fewer government restrictions and regulations of the economy have led to migration from rural to urban areas and west to east (interior to coast), creating a growing population whose rising incomes allow them to pursue work and educational opportunities abroad.

LEG-5.A.3
Resources are nationalized in China, Iran,
Mexico, Nigeria, and Russia to provide government revenue, consolidate government control, and reduce political influence of foreign governments and multinational corporations (MNCs), all of which can reinforce political legitimacy. The degree of central government control in these states differs,
as represented by:
a.	 The Mexican government’s decision to allow private investment in Pemex b.	 The political control exercised by foreign
MNCs that underwrite Nigeria’s oil production c.	 The high degree of centralized control over natural resource companies under
Russian President Putin that has resulted in wealth concentration

Selecting and Using
Course Materials
Using a wide array of source material helps students
become proficient with the disciplinary practices and develop a conceptual understanding of the course
country governments and their interactions. In addition
to using a college-level textbook that will provide
required course content, students should have regular
opportunities to examine primary and secondary source
material in varied forms, as well as other types of political
science scholarship. Rich, diverse source material gives
teachers more flexibility in designing learning activities
that develop the habits of thinking like a comparative
political scientist that are essential for student success in the course.
Textbooks
The AP Comparative Government and Politics course
requires the use of a college-level textbook. Also,
because the disciplinary practices are fundamental to
the course, a textbook that focuses on skill instruction is useful.
While nearly all college-level comparative government
textbooks address the five units of the AP Comparative
Government and Politics course, they do not always
do so in a balanced fashion. In that case, it will be important for teachers to identify other types of secondary sources and supplement the textbook accordingly to ensure that each of the five topic areas receives adequate attention. Some textbooks
review historical contexts of significant political and
governmental events. Since this is a political science
course rather than a history course, it helps to focus on how those debates or movements shaped or
relate to the present-day governments of the course
countries. Ultimately, it is best to select a textbook
that closely aligns with the course framework and the disciplinary practices.
An example textbook list of college-level textbooks
that meet the AP Course Audit resource requirements is found on AP Central.
Text-Based Qualitative Sources (Primary and Secondary Sources)
Political science writing differs from writing in other
fields. It focuses on what influences political behavior
and attitudes (e.g., voting, party identification, candidate support) and how political ideas and policies are developed and implemented.
Students in this AP course are required to analyze primary and secondary source material, including
arguments written by political scientists and others, in order to deepen their understanding of the key concepts addressed by the textbook and to engage
in the required disciplinary practices. Students are
not expected to conduct original research, but they
should be introduced to scholarly political science research articles.
PRIMARY SOURCES
Students will find it useful to analyze primary source
material regularly to deepen their understanding of the learning objectives and develop the required disciplinary practices. While publishers are
increasingly including primary source material within
the textbook, it is important to introduce students to
a wide variety of source material in order to provide
opportunities to analyze historical and contemporary
evidence from diverse sources. These sources need to
include written documents as well as images, such as
photographs, cartoons, and works of art. The ancillary materials and website sources that accompany most
of the recently published textbooks may have high quality primary source documents, artwork, charts, and other sources of data that are linked to the
topics and themes addressed in the textbook. If the
textbook doesn’t provide ample primary sources, or
the sources are too brief, teachers can supplement the
course with document readers that provide lengthier
selections or online compilations of primary sources related to particular topic areas.

Instructional Approaches V.1 | 131
AP Comparative Government and Politics Course and Exam Description

=== Page 139 ===
SECONDARY SOURCES
Student success in the course also depends on exposure to, and analysis of, multiple secondary
sources in which political scientists present and explain
their arguments. The most common secondary sources
students should encounter include editorials, journal
articles, news media articles, and essays and books
by political scientists. The course framework includes suggested supplemental readings for many of the
topics, but the choice of which secondary texts to use
is entirely up to the teacher. It helps to choose a variety
of sources that represent different points of view and
that will engage students while enhancing learning.
Select high-interest readings and add new articles to keep up with rapidly changing events.
Quantitative Sources
Political science courses require students to
engage with data in a variety of ways. The analysis, interpretation, and application of quantitative information are vital skills for students in AP
Comparative Government and Politics. New textbooks
and publishers’ resources often contain quantitative
information presented via charts, graphs, or other
infographics, but that data may soon become out of
date. Research institutions such as the Pew Research
Center are good resources for current data to practice quantitative skills with students.
Visual Sources
Students will encounter a variety of visual sources on the AP Comparative Government and Politics Exam.
Some visuals contain data, such as a map showing
election results. Other visuals may illustrate political
principles, processes, or behaviors. Visual information may also be expressed in a political cartoon or an infographic.
Students should have opportunities to practice with
a wide variety of visual sources. The textbook may contain some maps and cartoons, and the following
resources provide a wealth of visuals to choose from for bell-ringer exercises and skills practice.
§§ Gapminder is a “fact tank” that offers free
teaching resources based on statistics culled from universities, the UN, and NGOs.
§§ The Economist is a news magazine that broadly covers topics and policies relating to all course countries.
§§ Freedom House is an independent watchdog
organization that presents analysis on the progress and decline of freedom around the world.
Evaluating Quality and Credibility of Different Sources and Perspectives
Students have unprecedented access to information, so it is more important than ever to help them
determine the credibility of sources. The disciplinary
practices require students to evaluate the quality
and credibility of different information sources and perspectives and derive supportable conclusions.
Teachers might want to provide students with a list of
news media websites with different perspectives, such
as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The
Huffington Post, Al Jazeera, TASS, and The Christian
Science Monitor. The BBC also offers a wide range of
articles each day from different sources on a variety of topics.
The table on the following page explains how teachers
might address the credibility and/or reliability of various sources.

Criteria
Considerations
Examples
Credibility §§ Credibility requires students to obtain information from sources with knowledge and expertise in political science. Sources can be print, online, or expert interviews.
§§ Because many students are using the internet or database sources, they should consider the following:
◆ ◆The domain name extensions, which indicate who publishes and owns the domain. Commonly used
extensions include:
–– .edu (educational organization) –– .com (company) –– .org (any organization) –– .gov (government agency) –– .net (network) ◆ ◆The author(s) of the website ◆ ◆The credibility of sources cited in the materials as well as any websites they link to §§ Students should read past the first slash in the domain name to see if the page might be someone’s personal page.
A personal page might be less credible or include a bias that distorts the facts.
§§ Finding out who the authors are, their credentials, and the organization(s) they are associated with will help determine whether they are qualified to write about the topic.
§§ An article that includes citations of sources is often more credible.
§§ Design a lesson to help students identify political perspective by comparing the headlines from different news sources, such as BBC and Al Jazeera.
§§ Have students examine the language used in the lead stories as well as the pictures that accompany them.
§§ Ask students to compare the focus of local news with that of national and international sources and discuss possible reasons certain stories are not covered in the news.
§§ Have students synthesize their findings in a short paper examining the role of the media in providing citizens with political information.
Reliability §§ Students should examine the content of a source (the evidence) to ensure it supports their claims and provides insight and knowledge that relates to the topic. This means that evidence is only relevant when it addresses both the topic in context and the student’s argument.
§§ Because students are investigating political processes and institutions that are changing and evolving, it is important for them to consider whether the information being provided is the most current.
§§ An article about the life of British Prime
Minister Theresa May may not be relevant in supporting a claim about a particular decision by Parliament.
§§ A public opinion poll from 2008 might not be relevant in 2018.

Instructional Strategies
The AP Comparative Government and Politics course framework outlines the concepts and
skills students must master in order to be successful on the AP Exam. In order to address those
concepts and skills effectively, it helps to incorporate a variety of instructional approaches into
daily lessons and activities. The following table presents strategies that can help students apply their understanding of course concepts.
Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Close Reading
Students read, reread, and analyze small chunks of text word for word, sentence by sentence, and line by line.
Develops comprehensive understanding of text.
When students are reading secondary sources, such as a BBC article, have them highlight relevant country-specific words and passages that support the author’s claim.
Create
Representations
Students create tables, graphs, or other infographics to interpret text or data.
Helps students organize information using multiple ways to present data.
Give students a set of data, such as voting patterns by gender and ethnicity, and have them create a graph that best shows the data and the trends.
Critique
Reasoning
Through collaborative discussion, students critique the arguments of others, questioning the author’s perspective, evidence presented, and reasoning behind the argument.
Helps students learn from others as they make connections between concepts and learn to support their arguments with evidence and reasoning that make sense to peers.
Have students critique the argument for learning about
Islam using “To the Youth in Europe and North America.”
Ask them to examine the author’s perspective and the evidence and reasoning he uses to support his position.
Debate
Students present an informal or formal argument that defends a claim with reasons, while others defend different claims about the same topic or issue. The goal is to debate ideas without attacking the people who defend those ideas.
Gives students an opportunity to collect and orally present evidence supporting the arguments for or against a proposition or issue.
Have students debate whether policy making is more efficient in a presidential system or a parliamentary system, using evidence and reasoning to support their claims.

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Debriefing
Teachers facilitate a discussion that leads to consensus understanding or helps students identify the key conclusions or takeaways.
Helps students solidify and deepen understanding of content.
For complex issues such as civil society, lead students in a debrief to ensure understanding.
Discussion
Groups
Students engage in an interactive small-group discussion, often with assigned roles (e.g., questioner, summarizer, facilitator, evidence keeper) to consider a topic, text, or question.
Helps students gain new understanding of or insight into a text or issue by listening to multiple perspectives.
Assign students to groups to discuss a learning objective, such as Explain the importance of independent judiciaries relative to other political institutions, with a view to helping them gain new understanding by hearing the views of their classmates.
Fishbowl
Some students form an inner circle and model appropriate discussion techniques while an outer circle of students listens, responds, and evaluates.
Provides students with an opportunity to engage in a formal discussion and to experience roles both as participant and active listener; students also have the responsibility of supporting their opinions and responses using specific textual evidence.
Have students discuss the arguments presented in country-specific secondary sources and how they relate across governments.
Graphic
Organizer
Students use a visual representation for the organization of information.
Builds comprehension and facilitates discussion by representing information in visual form.
Ask students to use a graphic organizer to compare political beliefs, ideologies, principles, and models. Make sure students use the organizer thoughtfully and are not simply “filling in the blanks.”
Guided
Discussion
A guided discussion is an umbrella strategy that allows for the use of different techniques as you guide students through the lesson.
Helps students see the big picture and builds their confidence when dealing with difficult content or new skills.
Use brainstorming and quickwrite as strategies during a guided discussion to help students understand how political culture in a course country affects beliefs about social and economic equality.

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Jigsaw
Each student in a group reads a different text or a different passage from a single text, taking on the role of “expert” on what was read. Students share the information from that reading with students from other groups and then return to their original groups to share their new knowledge.
Helps students summarize and present information to others in a way that facilitates an understanding of a text (or multiple texts) or issue without having each student read the text in its entirety; by teaching others, they become experts.
Use this strategy to facilitate understanding of high-level readings, such as data analysis papers found on
V-Dem or Freedom House.
Look for a
Pattern
Students evaluate data or create visual representations to find a trend.
Helps students identify patterns that may be used to draw conclusions.
Using a complex graph (with at least two data sets), such as one showing educational attainment and demographics in the six course countries, have students compare the data to find a trend and draw a conclusion.
Making
Connections
Students are given a concept, term, or document and asked to write what they know about it. Then, students are paired and asked to determine, describe, and explain the connection between the two concepts.
Reinforces the fact that political concepts are often connected and provides the opportunity for students to make and explain connections between and among these concepts.
Write concepts related to one of the course big ideas on cards, place them in a box, and have students pick a card at random. Give students a few minutes to gather and recall information about the term, and then pair students and ask them to find the connection between their concepts. Finally, ask the pairs to write a brief explanation of how the concepts are related.
Match Claims and Evidence
Students are given sample claims (most of which can be improved on) to evaluate and revise.
Then students match their revised claims with pieces of evidence that can be used to support the claims. Once claims and evidence are matched, students write a statement explaining how and why the evidence supports the claim.
Provides opportunities for students to edit existing claims and match those claims with evidence in preparation for writing their own argumentative essays.
In the early stages of practicing argumentation, ask small groups of students to write claims and supporting evidence statements based on a question structured in the same way as free response question 4. Have groups trade claims and evidence, revise or modify the claims (if necessary), match the claims and evidence, and write statements explaining why the evidence supports the claim.

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Quickwrite
Students write for a short, specific amount of time about a designated topic.
Helps generate ideas in a short time.
As preparation for the free response question for which students write an argument, have them write claims and explain evidence that supports their claims for various topics, such as the structure of government or political participation.
Self/Peer
Revision
Students work alone or with a partner to examine a piece of writing for accuracy and clarity.
Provides students with an opportunity to edit a written text to ensure the correctness of identified components.
Have students perform self- and peer revisions of their practice argument essays so they have the opportunity to review their practice claims, supporting evidence, sourcing, analysis, and reasoning.
Socratic
Seminar
This is a focused discussion tied to a topic, essential question, or selected text in which students ask questions of one another. The questions initiate a conversation that continues with a series of responses and additional questions.
Helps students arrive at a new understanding by asking questions that clarify; challenging assumptions; probing perspective and point of view; questioning facts, reasons, and evidence;
or examining implications and outcomes.
Use an essential question from the start of a unit, such as How does the perceived legitimacy of a government by its citizenry impact how other countries see it? to initiate a discussion in which students can illustrate their understanding of the learning objectives and essential knowledge statements.
Think-Pair-
Share
Students think through a question or issue alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with the class.
Enables the development of initial ideas that are then tested with a partner in preparation for revising ideas and sharing them with a larger group.
To practice comparing executive leadership in course countries, ask students to consider structure, function, and change, and have them use think-pair-share to come up with similarities and differences.

Developing the
Disciplinary Practices
Throughout the AP Comparative Government and
Politics course, students will develop skills that are
fundamental to the discipline of comparative political
science. Since these disciplinary practices represent
the complex skills that adept comparative political
scientists demonstrate, students will benefit from
multiple opportunities to develop these skills in a scaffolded manner.
A college-level comparative political science course will
challenge students to put that knowledge into action through various discipline-based practices common
to the field. One of the aims of the AP Comparative
Government and Politics course is to have students think like political scientists.
The disciplinary practices and their related skills
articulated in the course framework equip students to
understand, analyze, and apply political information
in a process similar to that followed by political
scientists. This process begins with a close analysis
of quantitative and qualitative sources and reaches
its conclusion when evidence is used effectively to
support an argument about political systems, principles, institutions, processes, policies, or behaviors.
The unit guides feature a suggested skill for each
course topic. However, teachers are free to use either
that skill or one of their choosing to allow students to
practice the skills using course content. It is important
to help students develop all the skills throughout the
course, and teachers should use their professional
judgment to sequence and scaffold them appropriately for their students.
The tables on the pages that follow provide sample
activities and instructional strategies for incorporating the skills into instruction.

Disciplinary Practice 5: Develop an argument in essay format
Political scientists examine data, evidence, and differing perspectives to develop claims about
political systems, principles, institutions, processes, policies, and behaviors. As they begin to
articulate their positions, political scientists use reasoning processes that rely on their awareness
of different types of relationships, connections, and patterns within the data, evidence, and
perspectives. They then formulate a claim, or thesis, and develop an argument that explains how the claim is supported by the available evidence.
A strong argument also accounts for how some evidence might seem to refute or rebut the
claim, addressing alternate perspectives. Students should learn how to create persuasive and
meaningful arguments by improving their proficiency with each of these practices in turn.

Won’t Fade Away,” Bloomberg Opinion, January 19, 2018.
As with any social uprising, the unpredictable factor when trying to gauge
the longevity of this particular movement is the strength of the state. . . .
What we are witnessing in Iran now should not be viewed as an isolated
outcry, but rather . . . a hybrid momentum that started in 1999 and led
by students who later became involved in the Green Movement. They are
belatedly joining the current unrest, which is evolving to include new social
classes of people who were not at the center of previous protests.
Although this momentum has not been linear, neither were the Arab
uprisings in 2011. The Iranian demonstrators’ demands—food subsidies,
jobs and lower prices—are perfectly attainable if the regime re-allocates
its resources from the military to the economy. The fact that it is highly
unlikely to do so, coupled with the demonstrators’ resentment, could inspire
more protests in the near future that may forge a broader alliance between
the middle class and the working class. It is unlikely that this simmering
social movement will wait another decade to rear its head.
10.	 Which of the following is supported by the main idea of the passage?
(A)	Demonstrators in Iran are unpredictable and unclear in their demands,
which will lead them to be crushed by the government.
(B)	 The Arab uprisings in 2011 were the catalyst for the protests in Iran.
(C)	 The Iranian state could meet the demonstrators’ demands and end the uprisings but probably will not.
(D)	Students were the largest group of protesters in Iran, and their issues were resolved in 2011.
11.	 Which of the following statements is an implication of the argument presented in the passage?
(A)	Because social movements lack organized hierarchy, it is difficult to meet
their demands, and Iran is likely to face continued political instability.
(B)	 It is wrong to conflate the Green Movement, which was about foreign
direct investment, with this most recent movement, which is about economic struggle.
(C)	 Iran has a strong state that is able to suppress opposition movements and is
able to control all social media posts about political protests.
(D)	Since the Green Movement was not successful, citizens have stopped
believing that protests are an effective means of voicing frustration with the government.

14.	 Which of the following is an implication of the chart?
(A)	A two-child policy in the 1980s would have been a more effective response
to demographic pressures than the one-child policy was.
(B)	 The fertility rate in China was heavily influenced by the one-child policy, especially between 1990 and 2015.
(C)	 China’s one-child policy was an effective response to demographic pressures.
(D)	China’s one-child policy was unnecessary, as the fertility rate would have
declined similarly without a policy restricting fertility rates.
15.	 Economic liberalization policies in Mexico resulted in which of the following?
(A)	Internal migration from the north of the country to the south
(B)	 The removal of maquiladora zones in the north (C)	 The removal of agricultural subsidies

Identifies an alternate perspective but does not refute, concede, or rebut that perspective
•	 “There are some who argue that authoritarian regimes are more effective at
maintaining sovereignty because they say that authoritarian regimes have
more control over the people and thus can more easily maintain their rule.”
Examples of acceptable responses to an alternate perspective
may include:
•	 “Although democratic regimes are good at maintaining sovereignty in
a country, authoritarian regimes may be just as effective at maintaining
sovereignty. Authoritarian regimes can maintain sovereignty without
consulting representatives or citizens and can make difficult decisions
for the good of the country. Therefore, authoritarian regimes can be better at maintaining sovereignty.”
•	 “Although democratic regimes are good at maintaining sovereignty
in a country, there are potential problems. Democratic regimes have
to incorporate citizen input into decision making, which can lead to
counterproductive policies or decisions that are not necessarily good for democracy.”
•	 “Although authoritarian regimes are good at maintaining sovereignty,
democratic regimes can also be effective at maintaining sovereignty.
Governing with the consent of the people, democratic regimes are
good at maintaining sovereignty by maintaining government legitimacy.
Having a legitimate and democratic government can be very efficient for maintaining sovereignty.”
Additional Notes
•	 To earn this point, the response must have a defensible claim or thesis (earned the point in Row A).
•	 Responses that demonstrate an incorrect understanding of the alternate perspective do not earn this point.

Federal states like Mexico, Nigeria, and Russia divide power among difef rent levels of government to confer a degree of local autonomy in supplying social and educational services, while also reserving powers for the national government. Unitary states like China,
Iran, and the United Kingdom concentrate power at the national level with more uniform policies and potentially more efficient policy making.
PAU-2.A.2
The degree to which power is centralized or decentralized can change over time in both federal and unitary states, and in many cases reflects a state response to internal and external actors that include ethnic cleavages and operations of supranational organizations and other countries.

Criteria | Considerations | Examples ------------------------------------
Credibility | §§ Credibility requires students to obtain information from sources with knowledge and expertise in political science. Sources can be print, online, or expert interviews.
§§ Because many students are using the internet or database sources, they should consider the following:
◆◆ The domain name extensions, which indicate who publishes and owns the domain. Commonly used
extensions include:
– – .edu (educational organization) – – .com (company) – – .org (any organization) – – .gov (government agency) – – .net (network) ◆◆ The author(s) of the website ◆◆ The credibility of sources cited in the materials as well as any websites they link to §§ Students should read past the first slash in the domain name to see if the page might be someone’s personal page.
A personal page might be less credible or include a bias that distorts the facts.
§§ Finding out who the authors are, their credentials, and the organization(s) they are associated with will help determine whether they are qualified to write about the topic.
§§ An article that includes citations of
sources is often more credible. | §§ Design a lesson to help students identify political perspective by comparing the headlines from difef rent news sources, such as BBC and Al Jazeera.
§§ Have students examine the language used in the lead stories as well as the pictures that accompany them.
§§ Ask students to compare the focus of local news with that of national and international sources and discuss possible reasons certain stories are not covered in the news.
§§ Have students synthesize their findings in a short paper examining the role of the media in providing citizens with political information.
Reliability | §§ Students should examine the content of a source (the evidence) to ensure it supports their claims and provides insight and knowledge that relates to the topic. This means that evidence is only relevant when it addresses both the topic in context and the student’s argument.
§§ Because students are investigating political processes and institutions that are changing and evolving, it is important for them to consider whether the information being provided is the
most current. | §§ An article about the life of British Prime
Minister Theresa May may not be relevant in supporting a claim about a particular decision by Parliament.
§§ A public opinion poll from 2008 might not be relevant in 2018.

--- Table 1 on Page 141 ---
Strategy | Defni ition | Purpose | Example ------------------------------------------
Close Reading | Students read, reread, and analyze small chunks of text word for word, sentence by sentence, and line by line. | Develops comprehensive
understanding of text. | When students are reading secondary sources, such as a BBC article, have them highlight relevant country-specific words and passages that support the author’s claim.
Create
Representations | Students create tables, graphs, or other infographics to interpret text or data. | Helps students organize information using multiple
ways to present data. | Give students a set of data, such as voting patterns by gender and ethnicity, and have them create a graph that best shows the data and the trends.
Critique
Reasoning | Through collaborative discussion, students critique the arguments of others, questioning the author’s perspective, evidence presented, and reasoning behind the argument. | Helps students learn from others as they make connections between concepts and learn to support their arguments with evidence and reasoning that make sense to peers. | Have students critique the argument for learning about
Islam using “To the Youth in Europe and North America.”
Ask them to examine the author’s perspective and the evidence and reasoning he uses to support his position.
Debate | Students present an informal or formal argument that defends a claim with reasons, while others defend difef rent claims about the same topic or issue. The goal is to debate ideas without attacking the people who defend those ideas. | Gives students an opportunity to collect and orally present evidence supporting the arguments for or against a proposition or issue. | Have students debate whether policy making is more efficient in a presidential system or a parliamentary system, using evidence and reasoning to support their claims.

--- Table 1 on Page 142 ---
Strategy | Defni ition | Purpose | Example ------------------------------------------
Debriefni g | Teachers facilitate a discussion that leads to consensus understanding or helps students identify the key conclusions or takeaways. | Helps students solidify and deepen understanding of content. | For complex issues such as civil society, lead students in a debrief to ensure understanding.
Discussion
Groups | Students engage in an interactive small-group discussion, often with assigned roles (e.g., questioner, summarizer, facilitator, evidence keeper) to consider a topic, text, or question. | Helps students gain new understanding of or insight into a text or issue by listening to
multiple perspectives. | Assign students to groups to discuss a learning objective, such as Explain the importance of independent judiciaries relative to other political institutions, with a view to helping them gain new understanding by hearing the views of their classmates.
Fishbowl | Some students form an inner circle and model appropriate discussion techniques while an outer circle of students listens,
responds, and evaluates. | Provides students with an opportunity to engage in a formal discussion and to experience roles both as participant and active listener; students also have the responsibility of supporting their opinions and responses using
specific textual evidence. | Have students discuss the arguments presented in country-specific secondary sources and how they relate across governments.
Graphic
Organizer | Students use a visual representation for the
organization of information. | Builds comprehension and facilitates discussion by representing information in visual form. | Ask students to use a graphic organizer to compare political beliefs, ideologies, principles, and models. Make sure students use the organizer thoughtfully and are not simply “filling in the blanks.”
Guided
Discussion | A guided discussion is an umbrella strategy that allows for the use of difef rent techniques as you guide students through the lesson. | Helps students see the big picture and builds their confidence when dealing with difficult content or new skills. | Use brainstorming and quickwrite as strategies during a guided discussion to help students understand how political culture in a course country afef cts beliefs about social and economic equality.

--- Table 1 on Page 143 ---
Strategy | Defni ition | Purpose | Example ------------------------------------------
Jigsaw | Each student in a group reads a difef rent text or a difef rent passage from a single text, taking on the role of “expert” on what was read. Students share the information from that reading with students from other groups and then return to their original groups to share their new knowledge. | Helps students summarize and present information to others in a way that facilitates an understanding of a text (or multiple texts) or issue without having each student read the text in its entirety; by teaching others, they become experts. | Use this strategy to facilitate understanding of high-level readings, such as data analysis papers found on
V-Dem or Freedom House.
Look for a
Pattern | Students evaluate data or create visual representations to find a trend. | Helps students identify patterns that may be used
to draw conclusions. | Using a complex graph (with at least two data sets), such as one showing educational attainment and demographics in the six course countries, have students compare the data to find a trend and draw a conclusion.
Making
Connections | Students are given a concept, term, or document and asked to write what they know about it. Then, students are paired and asked to determine, describe, and explain the connection
between the two concepts. | Reinforces the fact that political concepts are often connected and provides the opportunity for students to make and explain connections between and among these concepts. | Write concepts related to one of the course big ideas on cards, place them in a box, and have students pick a card at random. Give students a few minutes to gather and recall information about the term, and then pair students and ask them to find the connection between their concepts. Finally, ask the pairs to write a brief explanation of how the concepts are related.
Match Claims and Evidence | Students are given sample claims (most of which can be improved on) to evaluate and revise.
Then students match their revised claims with pieces of evidence that can be used to support the claims. Once claims and evidence are matched, students write a statement explaining how and why the evidence supports the claim. | Provides opportunities for students to edit existing claims and match those claims with evidence in preparation for writing their
own argumentative essays. | In the early stages of practicing argumentation, ask small groups of students to write claims and supporting evidence statements based on a question structured in the same way as free response question 4. Have groups trade claims and evidence, revise or modify the claims (if necessary), match the claims and evidence, and write statements explaining why the evidence supports the claim.

--- Table 1 on Page 144 ---
Strategy | Defni ition | Purpose | Example ------------------------------------------
Quickwrite | Students write for a short, specific amount of time
about a designated topic. | Helps generate ideas in a short time. | As preparation for the free response question for which students write an argument, have them write claims and explain evidence that supports their claims for various topics, such as the structure of government or political participation.
Self/Peer
Revision | Students work alone or with a partner to examine a piece of writing for accuracy and clarity. | Provides students with an opportunity to edit a written text to ensure the correctness of identified components. | Have students perform self- and peer revisions of their practice argument essays so they have the opportunity to review their practice claims, supporting evidence, sourcing, analysis, and reasoning.
Socratic
Seminar | This is a focused discussion tied to a topic, essential question, or selected text in which students ask questions of one another. The questions initiate a conversation that continues with a series of responses and additional questions. | Helps students arrive at a new understanding by asking questions that clarify; challenging assumptions; probing perspective and point of view; questioning facts, reasons, and evidence;
or examining implications and outcomes. | Use an essential question from the start of a unit, such as How does the perceived legitimacy of a government by its citizenry impact how other countries see it? to initiate a discussion in which students can illustrate their understanding of the learning objectives and essential knowledge statements.
Think-Pair-
Share | Students think through a question or issue alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with the class. | Enables the development of initial ideas that are then tested with a partner in preparation for revising ideas and sharing them with a larger group. | To practice comparing executive leadership in course countries, ask students to consider structure, function, and change, and have them use think-pair-share to come up with similarities and difef rences.

Learning Objectives: IEF-3.C IEF 3.D |  | (A) | Define economic liberalization
Acceptable definition:
• Economic liberalization occurs when a state reduces its economic role and embraces free market mechanisms. | 1 point
1.A
(B) | Describe a measure that a democratic or authoritarian government could use to liberalize their economy.
Acceptable descriptions include:
• Democratic or authoritarian governments can eliminate subsidies or tariffs to liberalize their economies.
• Democratic or authoritarian governments can privatize government-owned industries to liberalize their economies.
• Democratic or authoritarian governments can open their markets to foreign direct investment to liberalize their economies. | 1 point
1.A
(C) | Explain one reason why a country would choose to liberalize its economy.
Acceptable explanations include:
• A country might choose to liberalize its economy to remedy undesirable domestic circumstances, such as one of the following:
• rising unemployment • reduced productivity • trade deficits.
• Liberalizing the economy could take pressure off of the government and satisfy its citizens.
• A country might choose to liberalize its economy due to pressure from other countries and international organizations.
• A country might choose to liberalize its economy because free trade and a liberalized economy helps to develop a middle class. | 1 point
1.B
(D) Explain why a decision to introduce economic liberalization polices might affect social cleavages. 1 point
1.B
Acceptable explanations include:
• Economic liberalization policies might affect social cleavages because the economic policies often
contribute to rising inequality between classes or regions.
• Economic liberalization policies might affect social cleavages because the economic policies often
contribute to inequalities because a middle class develops, but so do disparities among groups (rich/ poor, urban/rural)
• Economic liberalization policies might affect social cleavages because less protectionism and freer
movement of goods and services may cause tensions with immigration and people looking for work. |  | | Total for question 1 | 4 points

Perspectives (0-1 points) 5.D | 0 points | 1 point
Responds to an opposing or alternate perspective using refutation, concession, or rebuttal | Decision Rules and Scoring Notes | | Responses that do not earn this point:
• Restate the opposite of the claim or thesis

sovereignty, they are wrong because it is clear that authoritarian regimes are more effective.”
Identifies an alternate perspective but does not refute, concede, or rebut that perspective
• “There are some who argue that authoritarian regimes are more effective at
maintaining sovereignty because they say that authoritarian regimes have
more control over the people and thus can more easily maintain their rule.” | Examples of acceptable responses to an alternate perspective
may include:
• “Although democratic regimes are good at maintaining sovereignty in
a country, authoritarian regimes may be just as effective at maintaining
sovereignty. Authoritarian regimes can maintain sovereignty without
consulting representatives or citizens and can make difficult decisions
for the good of the country. Therefore, authoritarian regimes can be better at maintaining sovereignty.”
• “Although democratic regimes are good at maintaining sovereignty
in a country, there are potential problems. Democratic regimes have
to incorporate citizen input into decision making, which can lead to
counterproductive policies or decisions that are not necessarily good for democracy.”
• “Although authoritarian regimes are good at maintaining sovereignty,
democratic regimes can also be effective at maintaining sovereignty.
Governing with the consent of the people, democratic regimes are
good at maintaining sovereignty by maintaining government legitimacy.
Having a legitimate and democratic government can be very efficient for maintaining sovereignty.” | Additional Notes
• To earn this point, the response must have a defensible claim or thesis (earned the point in Row A).
• Responses that demonstrate an incorrect understanding of the alternate perspective do not earn this point. |
