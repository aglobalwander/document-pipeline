Laws of Probability
If A and B are mutually exclusive, then:
The probability of A or B equals the probability of A plus the probability of B
If A and B are independent, then:
The probability of  A  and B equals the probably of A times the probability of B
Hardy-Weinberg Equations p squared plus, 2 times p times q, plus q squared, equals 1 p = frequency of allele 1 in a population p plus q equals 1 q = frequency of allele 2 in a population x bar = sample mean n = sample size
s = sample standard deviation (i.e., the sample-based estimate of the standard deviation of the population) o = observed results e = expected results the summation = sum of all
Degrees of freedom are equal to the number of distinct possible outcomes minus one.

Water Potential

psi psi = equ als psi sub p plus psi sub s psi sub p= pressure potential psi sub s = solute potential
The water potential will be equal to the solute potential of a solution in an open container because the pressure potential of the solution in an open container is zero.
The Solute Potential of a Solution
psi s ub S equals negative i times C times R times T i = ionization constant (1.0 for sucrose because sucrose does not ionize in water)
C = molar concentration
R = pressure constant
