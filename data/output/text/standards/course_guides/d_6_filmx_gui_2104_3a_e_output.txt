Introduction
The Diploma Programme
The Diploma Programme is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19
age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and
inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to
develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness and the attitudes necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The Diploma Programme model
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core (see figure 1). It encourages the
concurrent study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study two modern languages (or a modern
language and a classical language), a humanities or social science subject, an experimental science,
mathematics and one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma
Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance.
In each of the academic areas, students have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can
choose subjects that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.

Film guide 3
Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they can, instead
of an arts subject, choose two subjects from another area. Normally, three subjects (and not more than
four) are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends
240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than at SL.
At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of
the course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some element of coursework assessed by teachers.
The core of the Diploma Programme model
All Diploma Programme students participate in the three course elements that make up the core of the model.
Theory of knowledge (TOK) is a course that is fundamentally about critical thinking and inquiry into the
process of knowing rather than about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines
the nature of knowledge and how we know what we claim to know. It does this by encouraging students
to analyse knowledge claims and explore questions about the construction of knowledge. The task of TOK
is to emphasize connections between areas of shared knowledge and link them to personal knowledge
in such a way that an individual becomes more aware of his or her own perspectives and how they might differ from others’.
Creativity, activity, service (CAS) is at the heart of the Diploma Programme. The emphasis in CAS is on
helping students to develop their own identities, in accordance with the ethical principles embodied in
the IB mission statement and the IB learner profile. It involves students in a range of activities alongside
their academic studies throughout the Diploma Programme. The three strands of CAS are creativity (arts
and other experiences that involve creative thinking), activity (physical exertion contributing to a healthy
lifestyle) and service (an unpaid and voluntary exchange that has a learning benefit for the student). Possibly,
more than any other component in the Diploma Programme, CAS contributes to the IB’s mission to create a
better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect.
The extended essay, including the world studies extended essay, offers the opportunity for IB students to
investigate a topic of special interest, in the form of a 4,000-word piece of independent research. The area of
research undertaken is chosen from one of the students’ six Diploma Programme subjects or, in the case of
the interdisciplinary world studies essay, two subjects, and acquaints them with the independent research
and writing skills expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally presented, structured
writing, in which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent manner, appropriate to
the subject or subjects chosen. It is intended to promote high-level research and writing skills, intellectual
discovery and creativity. An authentic learning experience, it provides students with an opportunity to
engage in personal research on a topic of their choice under the guidance of a supervisor.

Approaches to teaching and learning
Approaches to teaching and learning (ATL) across the Diploma Programme refers to deliberate strategies,
skills and attitudes that permeate the teaching and learning environment. These approaches and tools,
intrinsically linked with the learner profile attributes, enhance student learning and assist student
preparation for the Diploma Programme assessment and beyond. The aims of approaches to teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme are to:
•
empower teachers as teachers of learners as well as teachers of content •
empower teachers to create clearer strategies for facilitating learning experiences in which students
are more meaningfully engaged in structured inquiry and greater critical and creative thinking •
promote both the aims of individual subjects (making them more than course aspirations) and linking
previously isolated knowledge (concurrency of learning) •
encourage students to develop an explicit variety of skills that will equip them to continue to be
actively engaged in learning after they leave school, and to help them not only obtain university
admission through better grades but also prepare for success during tertiary education and beyond •
enhance further the coherence and relevance of the students’ Diploma Programme experience •
allow schools to identify the distinctive nature of an IB Diploma Programme education with its blend of idealism and practicality.
The five approaches to learning (developing thinking skills, social skills, communication skills, self management skills and research skills) along with the six approaches to teaching (teaching that is inquiry based, conceptually focused, contextualized, collaborative, differentiated and informed by assessment)
encompass the key values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy.
DP Approaches to teaching and learning website.
The IB mission statement and the IB learner profile
The Diploma Programme aims to develop in students the knowledge, skills and attitudes they will need
to fulfill the aims of the IB, as expressed in the organization’s mission statement and the learner profile.
Teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme represent the reality in daily practice of the organization’s educational philosophy.
The DP film syllabus is closely linked to this, striving to develop internationally minded people who are:
• inquirers • knowledgeable • thinkers • communicators • principled • open-minded • caring • balanced • risk-takers • reflective.

Academic honesty
Academic honesty in the Diploma Programme is a set of values and behaviours informed by the attributes
of the learner profile. In teaching, learning and assessment, academic honesty serves to promote personal
integrity, engender respect for the integrity of others and their work, and ensure that all students have an
equal opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquire during their studies.
All coursework—including work submitted for assessment—is to be authentic, based on the student’s
individual and original ideas with the ideas and work of others fully acknowledged. Assessment tasks that
require teachers to provide guidance to students or that require students to work collaboratively must be
completed in full compliance with the detailed guidelines provided by the IB for the relevant subjects.
For further information on academic honesty in the IB and the Diploma Programme, please consult the following IB publications.
•
Academic honesty in the IB educational context •
Effective citing and referencing •
Diploma Programme: From principles into practice •
General regulations: Diploma Programme
Specific information regarding academic honesty as it pertains to external and internal assessment components of DP film can be found in this guide.
Acknowledging the ideas or work of another person
Coordinators and teachers are reminded that candidates must acknowledge all sources used in work
submitted for assessment. The following is intended as a clarification of this requirement.
Diploma Programme candidates submit work for assessment in a variety of media that may include audio visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print or electronic sources. If a candidate uses
the work or ideas of another person, the candidate must acknowledge the source using a standard style of
referencing in a consistent manner. A candidate’s failure to acknowledge a source will be investigated by the
IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.
The IB does not prescribe which style(s) of referencing or in-text citation should be used by candidates; this
is left to the discretion of appropriate faculty/staff in the candidate’s school. The wide range of subjects,
three response languages and the diversity of referencing styles make it impractical and restrictive to insist
on particular styles. In practice, certain styles may prove more commonly used, but schools are free to
choose a style that is appropriate for the subject concerned and the language in which candidates’ work is
written. Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a given subject, it is expected that the
minimum information given includes: name of author; date of publication; title of source; page numbers, as
applicable; date of access (electronic sources); URL (electronic sources).
The following criteria must be applied.
•
Students are expected to use a standard style and use it consistently so that credit is given to all
sources used, including sources that have been paraphrased or summarized.
•
When writing, students must clearly distinguish (in the body of the text) between their words and
those of others by the use of quotation marks (or other method, such as indentation) followed by an
appropriate citation that denotes an entry in the bibliography.

=== Page 12 ===

Film guide 6 •
Students are not expected to show faultless expertise in referencing, but are expected to demonstrate that all sources have been acknowledged.
•
Students must be advised that any audio-visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data that is
crucial to their work and that is not their own must also be attributed. Again, an appropriate style of referencing/citation must be used.
Learning diversity and learning support requirements
Schools must ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided to
candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the following IB documents.

Introduction
Technical requirements for this course
Any school undertaking the DP film course must ensure they have the necessary technical equipment and
instructor expertise required to meet the course aims, objectives and formal assessment requirements, as described in this guide.
Failure to ensure this will result in problematic assessment material and could lead to students not receiving grades for this subject in their final diploma.

Film guide 8
Introduction
Nature of the subject
Film
Film is a powerful and stimulating art form and practice.
The DP film course aims to develop students as proficient interpreters and makers of film texts. Through the
study and analysis of film texts, and through practical exercises in film production, the film course develops
students’ critical abilities and their appreciation of artistic, cultural, historical and global perspectives in film.
Students examine film concepts, theories, practices and ideas from multiple perspectives, challenging their
own viewpoints and biases in order to understand and value those of others.
DP film students experiment with film and multimedia technology, acquiring the skills and creative
competencies required to successfully communicate through the language of the medium. They develop an
artistic voice and learn how to express personal perspectives through film.
The film course emphasizes the importance of working collaboratively. It focuses on the international
and intercultural dynamic that triggers and sustains contemporary film, while fostering in students an
appreciation of the development of film across time, space and culture. DP film students are challenged to
understand alternative views, to respect and appreciate the diverse cultures that exist within film, and to have open and critical minds.
DP film students require courage, passion and curiosity.
•
Courage—to experiment and create, to explore ideas through action and to harness imagination.
•
Passion—to communicate and to act communally, and to research and formulate ideas, communicating discoveries in a variety of forms.
•
Curiosity—about themselves and others and the world around them, and about the limitless possibilities of human expression through film.
At the core of the DP film course lies the need for creative exploration and innovation. Students are
challenged to acquire and develop critical thinking, reflective analysis and the imaginative synthesis that is
achieved through practical engagement in the art, craft and study of film.
Culture and film
For this film guide, culture (which is a central component of the course) is defined as learned and
shared beliefs, values, interests, attitudes, products and patterns of behaviour created by society. This
view of culture includes an organized system of symbols, ideas, explanations, beliefs and material
production that humans create and manipulate in their daily lives. Culture is dynamic and organic,
and it operates on many levels in the global context—international, national, regional and local, as
well as among different social groups within a society. Culture is seen as fluid and subject to change.
Culture provides the overall framework within which humans learn to organize their thoughts,
emotions and behaviours in relation to their environment. Within this framework, cultural
context, which specifically appears throughout the taught syllabus and assessment tasks of the
DP film course, refers to the conditions that influence, and are influenced by, culture. These include
economic, geographical, historical, institutional, political, social and technological factors.

=== Page 15 ===
Nature of the subject
Film guide 9
Distinction between SL and HL
The film syllabus articulates a differential between the SL and HL courses. It allows for greater breadth
and depth in the teaching and learning at HL through an additional assessment task. This task requires
HL students to reflect on the subject matter, skills and experiences encountered in the core syllabus areas
in order to formulate their own intentions for a completed film based on their experiences as developing
international filmmakers. They work collaboratively as a core production team in order to effectively communicate on screen.
Film and the Diploma Programme core
Film and the extended essay
An extended essay (EE) in film within the DP core provides students with an opportunity to undertake
independent research into a topic of special interest. Students are encouraged to apply a range of skills in order
to develop and explore a focused research question appropriate to film in an imaginative and critical way. It
requires them to test and validate their research by considering its effect on the art form and practice of film.
Students working on an EE in film must frame an appropriately focused research question. It is the task of
the supervisor to ensure that this research question leads the student along a path that uses appropriate
primary filmic sources and secondary sources that encourage the application of relevant film concepts,
theories, practices or ideas. The essay topic may relate to a specific area of the DP film course, but this is
not a requirement and other areas of the subject may be explored. It is important that the topic reflects the
student’s particular interest and enthusiasm within the subject area.
Examples of suitable extended essays in film include the following.
•
Are the claims that the television series The Bridge (2011), Veronica Mars (2004) and Mad Men (2007)
should be classified as updates to classic film noir justified?
•
How did the legacy of the classical European avant-garde cinema contribute to the French New Wave?
•
How effectively can the theories of the male gaze and the female spectator be explored in specific film texts?
•
To what extent can film director Julie Dash (b. 1952) be considered as an auteur?
•
To what extent do the film cultures of Bollywood and Tollywood (Telugu cinema) differ in terms of cinematic style, form and context?
•
To what extent have the films of director Apichatpong “Joe” Weerasethakul (b. 1970) challenged the traditional Thai film studio system?
Students must ensure that their EE does not duplicate other work they are submitting for the diploma. For
example, it must not be based on the same films the student has studied for any assessment tasks as part of
the DP film course. Supervisors play an important role in guiding students on these distinctions. Students
risk their diploma if academic misconduct is detected.
Detailed guidance on undertaking extended essays in film can be found in the Extended essay guide.
Film and creativity, activity, service
Creativity, activity, service (CAS) experiences can be associated with each of the subject groups of the DP.
Film students have excellent opportunities for making links between film and the CAS strands. The practical
nature of the subject combines effectively with a range of CAS activities that complement the academic rigour of the Diploma Programme.

=== Page 16 ===
Nature of the subject
Film guide 10
Film teachers can assist students in making links between their subjects and their CAS experiences, where
appropriate. This will provide students with relevance in both their subject learning and their CAS learning
through purposeful discussion and real experiences. It will motivate and challenge the students, strengthen
subject understanding and knowledge, and allow students to enjoy different approaches to their subjects.
As a result of the knowledge and understanding students develop about issues or themes as part of the
taught content of the subject, they might then investigate, plan, act, reflect on and demonstrate CAS
experiences in a more informed and meaningful way. Similarly, CAS experiences outside of the classroom
might ignite students’ passion for addressing a particular issue or theme inside the film classroom.
Film students might choose, for example, to engage with CAS through:
•
participation in a range of artistic activities, workshops and festivals created in collaboration with others •
planning and executing film projects for the school, local or wider community •
planning and creating films that target a specific audience with specific needs.
CAS experiences can be a single event or may be an extended series of events. It is important to note that CAS
experiences must be distinct from, and may not be included or used in, the student’s DP course requirements.
Film and theory of knowledge
The theory of knowledge (TOK) course engages students in reflection on the nature of knowledge and
on how we know what we claim to know. The course identifies eight ways of knowing: reason, emotion,
language, sense perception, intuition, imagination, faith and memory. Students explore these means of
producing knowledge within the context of various areas of knowledge: the natural sciences, the social
sciences, the arts, ethics, history, mathematics, religious knowledge systems and indigenous knowledge
systems. The course also requires students to make comparisons between the different areas of knowledge:
reflecting on how knowledge is arrived at in the various disciplines, what the disciplines have in common, and the differences between them.
The arts subjects complement the TOK ethos by revealing interdisciplinary connections and allowing
students to explore the strengths and limitations of individual and cultural perspectives. Just as in TOK,
studying the arts requires students to reflect on, and question, their own bases of knowledge. In addition,
by exploring other DP subjects through an arts approach, students can gain an understanding of the
interdependent nature of knowledge and are encouraged to become “active, compassionate and lifelong
learners who understand that other people, with their differences, can also be right” (IB mission statement).
The arts can help us understand ourselves, our patterns of behaviour and our relationships to each other and
our wider environment. Students of the arts subjects study the various artistic approaches through which
knowledge, skills and attitudes from different cultural traditions are acquired, developed and transmitted.
They analyse artistic knowledge from various perspectives and acquire knowledge through experiential
means as well as more traditional academic methods. Questions related to TOK activities that a film student might consider include the following.
•
Are certain ways of knowing employed in radically different ways in the arts as opposed to other areas of knowledge?
•
How do artistic judgments differ from other types of judgment, such as moral judgments?
•
Is it possible for film to represent the world without transforming it?
•
To what extent do you agree with Michael Haneke’s (b. 1942) claim that “film is 24 lies per second at
the service of truth, or at the service of the attempt to find the truth?” •
To what extent is imagination a fundamental requirement for viewing film?
•
What moral responsibilities do filmmakers have?

=== Page 17 ===
Nature of the subject
Film guide 11 •
What, if anything, do the different subjects that make up the arts have in common?
•
Why might we be more concerned with process rather than product in the search for knowledge?
Film and international-mindedness
International-mindedness represents an openness and curiosity about the world and its people that begins
with students understanding themselves in order to effectively connect and collaborate with others. The
arts provide a unique opportunity for students to recognize the dynamic cultural influences around them
and the significance of diversity in the making of film. The DP film course gives students the opportunity to
study a wide variety of film texts and filmmakers from a range of contrasting contexts. Through creating,
investigating, critically analysing and appreciating differing cinematic forms and styles, students deepen
their understanding of film, as well as their knowledge, understanding and experience of the arts within
the global community. They become more informed and reflective, and develop their abilities to become
enriched practitioners, communicators, collaborators and creative thinkers. They learn to acknowledge the
elements that appear in all cinematic forms and filmic traditions, and also to recognize the unique ways in
which particular cultures express and represent their values and identity through shared artistic endeavour.
Engaging with sensitive topics
Studying film enables students to engage with exciting, stimulating and personally relevant topics and
issues. However, it should be noted that often such topics and issues can also be sensitive and personally
challenging for some students. Teachers should be aware of this and provide guidance on how to approach
and engage with such topics in a responsible manner. Consideration should also be given to the personal,
political and spiritual values of others, particularly in relation to race, gender or identity.
Prior learning
The film course at both SL and HL requires no previous experience.
The course is designed to enable students to experience film on a personal level; achievement in this subject
is reflected in how students develop, extend and refine the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary for studying film.
The film course provides a relevant learning opportunity for a diverse range of students as it offers an
appropriate foundation for further study in film, creative arts and other related subjects. In addition, by
instilling discipline and refining communication, as well as creative and collaborative skills, it offers an
extremely valuable course of study for students who may wish to pursue a career or further education studies in areas unconnected to film.
Links to the Middle Years Programme
DP film builds upon some of the conceptual areas and skills within the arts as outlined in the Middle Years
Programme (MYP) Arts guide.
MYP arts provides students with the opportunity to develop as artists, as well as to learn about the arts
through conceptual understandings that are essential to the subject. Learning in the arts takes place

=== Page 18 ===
Nature of the subject
Film guide 12
within contexts relevant to the student, whether personally, locally, nationally, internationally or globally
significant. Throughout the MYP arts course, students are required to develop knowledge, think creatively
and make connections between, and respond to, their own work as well as that of others.
MYP arts, and specifically the discipline of media, provides a solid introduction for the DP film course.
In thinking creatively, arts students become successful learners of media through a cycle of creativity.
Emphasis is placed on the artistic process, allowing the students to plan, create, share, reflect and evaluate
the process of presenting media. Students further develop their repertoire in order to engage and convey
feelings, experiences and ideas, and to build on the skills developed in the Primary Years Programme (PYP).
In MYP arts, students are provided with opportunities to prepare for the DP film course through:
•
understanding the role of media in original and displaced contexts, and to use this understanding to inform their work as artistic communicators •
discovering the aesthetics of film and media, and analysing and expressing this in various forms •
acquiring, developing and applying skills in the process of making and sharing media •
thinking creatively, developing curiosity, and purposefully exploring and challenging boundaries •
constructing meaning and transferring learning to new settings •
responding to their world, to their own art and its audience, and to the work of others.
Further detail on arts in the MYP can be found here.
Film and academic honesty
Assessment tasks across the arts vary considerably, from multimedia comparative studies, formal written work
and the presentation of practical work to the collection of ideas and stimuli that inspire the creative process.
Although guidelines for maintaining academic honesty are consistent for all subjects and components,
the variety and richness of tasks in the DP arts means that each component raises its own challenges for
maintaining academic honesty. For more information, please see Academic honesty in the Diploma Programme.
Referencing sources
If a student uses any content from any source, including the internet, these must be acknowledged consistently
following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school. This referencing style must clearly identify
the section of the work that is being attributed and its origin. When the student is aware that another person’s
work or ideas have influenced their own but it has not been referred to directly in their work, the source must
be included as a reference in a list of sources within the student’s research. This is particularly relevant to the
arts where the creative process will be the result of many stimuli, influences and sources of inspiration.
Film students need to be aware of their responsibility as artists to be the original creators of, or have a
significant role in the creation of, the images and sound used in their film work. Students should therefore
be encouraged to find creative solutions to technical and artistic challenges in their work rather than
seeking to use the work of others in their original filmmaking.
Further information about academic honesty can be found here.
Academic honesty
Key opportunities for guiding students on academic honesty issues are identified in each of the assessment tasks later in this guide.

=== Page 19 ===
Nature of the subject
Film guide 13
Authenticity
Most of the assessment tasks in the arts are completed as coursework, and so have strict conditions under
which student work must be completed, presented and—in the case of internally assessed work—assessed.
There are also formal requirements that must be followed to ensure that the work received by examiners and
moderators is consistent and can be assessed against marking criteria. Since these conditions and formal
requirements are designed to provide each student with equal opportunity to demonstrate achievement,
failure to follow them is a form of academic misconduct as it can lead to students being unfairly advantaged.
Coursework authentication form (6/FCAF)
During the creation of assessment work in film, teachers are required to meet with students at various
intervals in order to discuss the progress being made by each student and to verify the origin and
credibility of the coursework being created. These one-to-one interactions, which might be formal
meetings and/or informal discussions in the classroom, provide the teacher with the necessary evidence to authenticate each student’s work.
For all of the assessment tasks for the DP film course, teachers must provide a written summary of
the authentication conversations using the DP film Coursework authentication form (6/FCAF), which
is submitted to the IB as part of the upload of assessment material. Further details regarding the
authentication requirements for each assessment task are identified later in this guide.

Introduction
Approaches to teaching and learning in film
Approaches to the teaching of film
The taught syllabus for this course has been designed to reflect the dynamic nature of film and filmmaking.
While the syllabus provides details of core teaching requirements, the flexibility of the film course allows for
a variety of approaches and teaching styles. In designing and delivering the curriculum, teachers have a free
choice in the selection of films, filmmakers, production roles, film concepts and contexts they cover. In the
assessment tasks, students are also encouraged to identify material for study based on their own personal
interests and what inspires and excites them in film.
Teachers are encouraged to interpret the taught syllabus creatively according to local circumstances and
the context of the school. This is an international film programme. How teachers choose to explore films and
filmmaking practices from various spaces, times and cultures is left to their own discretion. Teachers should
not only teach content and production skills that they themselves are familiar with and knowledgeable
about, but should also be risk-takers and expose students to unfamiliar concepts and contexts.
It is possible to run the DP film course with just one student. Teachers in this situation must find creative
opportunities to meet the requirement in the taught course for collaboration (which is an assessment requirement in the HL course).
The programme embodies many of the approaches to teaching and learning (ATL) skills that empower
teachers and students to facilitate meaningful learning experiences. Teachers should consider how their
planning of the two-year course ensures that the teaching of film is:
• based on inquiry • focused on conceptual understanding • developed in local and global contexts • focused on effective teamwork and collaboration • differentiated to meet the needs of all learners • informed by assessment.
For more information about approaches to teaching in the DP, please visit the DP Approaches to teaching and learning subject website.
Approaches to learning in film
The DP film course is student-centred and places student exploration at the heart of a holistic learning
experience. Learning about film relies on action, and the course must be experienced practically.
Collaboration is essential to learning in film, and students should experience and reflect on its processes, benefits and challenges.

=== Page 24 ===
Approaches to teaching and learning in film
Film guide 18
The film course is designed to enable students to learn through cognitive, metacognitive and affective skills,
as outlined in the DP Approaches to teaching and learning guide. Students should experience a taught film curriculum that develops the following skills.
•
Thinking skills •
Communication skills •
Social skills •
Self-management skills •
Research skills
Film students learn through problem-solving and inquiry. They communicate their learning through action,
project planning, workshops, presentations and screenings, as well as oral, visual and written expression.
The course requires higher-order thinking skills, such as analysis and synthesis. Students should also learn
what is relevant and useful for their own investigations, and how to put their knowledge and understanding into practice by transforming ideas into action.
For more information about approaches to learning in the DP, please visit the DP Approaches to teaching and learning subject website.
The selection of materials for assessment
The assessment tasks for the DP film course are intentionally student-centred. Teachers should
encourage students to identify and select material for study that will best help them to fulfill the
requirements of each task and to provide the best opportunity for fulfilling the assessment criteria.
Therefore, the task instructions and assessment criteria should be shared with the students and become a regular focus of interaction.
The film journal
From the beginning of the course, and at regular intervals, it is recommended that each student should
maintain a film journal. This is the student’s own record of his or her development as a DP filmmaker. It should be used to record or retain the following.
•
Reflections on challenges and achievements •
Creative ideas •
Completed work •
Critical analyses and experiences of watching films •
Detailed evaluations and feedback •
All documentation associated with practical filmmaking (such as scripts, storyboards and schedules) •
Feedback from peers, teachers and others •
Research into primary and secondary materials •
Skills acquisition and development
Students should be encouraged to find the most appropriate ways of recording their development and
have free choice in deciding what form the film journal takes. Owing to the nature of the subject, the journal
will most likely include a significant number of digital files and elements that need to be securely stored

=== Page 25 ===
Approaches to teaching and learning in film
Film guide 19
and backed up over the two years of the course. The content of the journal should focus specifically on the
analysis of learning experiences, rather than being simply a record of successes or an exhaustive chronicle of
everything the student experiences in the film course.
Although the film journal itself is not directly assessed or moderated, students are likely to select, adapt and
present for assessment large extracts from it. It is therefore regarded as a highly valuable activity of the film
course, developing the student’s ability to document the processes and skills involved in research, planning, practical production and reflection.
Research
When carrying out research, students should consult a range of reliable primary and secondary sources.
The suitability of the sources for each assessment task will depend on its nature and use, and on the film
texts, concepts, theories, practices and ideas being investigated. As well as the more obvious sources
(books, websites, videos and articles), research may also include live experiences and encounters such as
workshops, lectures, correspondence with experts and screenings. All sources consulted during the course
must be cited following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school and be maintained as an ongoing list of sources.
Please note that each of the assessment tasks for the DP film course require a list of sources (as well as in text or on-screen citations) to be submitted as part of the formal requirements.
Health and safety
All schools are required to follow health and safety guidelines in their film-production work, observing
standard regulations on film production. Each school should recognize and accept the responsibilities and
obligations to provide a safe and healthy working environment for film students. Schools are ultimately
responsible for the health and safety of students and staff in all film-production work.
•
Students must be supported in making safe choices while filming, with teachers actively guiding them
to assess and avoid risk or injury throughout the course.
•
When working with adults or members of the wider community, teachers must ensure that all of the
appropriate safeguarding measures (as defined by the individual school) have been taken to enable students to work safely with others.
Teachers are advised to carry out their own regular risk assessments during the course and to involve students in this process.
Ethics and film work
As part of the collective consideration of the school, film students must be supported in maintaining an
ethical perspective during their course. Schools must be vigilant to ensure that work undertaken by the
students is appropriate for the context of the school and the age of the students.

=== Page 26 ===
Approaches to teaching and learning in film
Film guide 20
Student work in the DP film course must not:
• damage the environment • glamorize the taking of drugs • inappropriately reference socially taboo subjects • incite or condone intolerance or hatred of others • include excessive or gratuitous violence •
make reference to, or represent, explicit sexual activity.
Please note this list is illustrative and not exhaustive.

The recommended teaching time is 240 hours to complete HL courses and 150 hours to complete SL courses,
as stated in the document General regulations: Diploma Programme (page 4 article 8.2).
It is anticipated that most taught activities for DP film will cover several different parts of the course at once,
so the time allocations indicated in the “Core syllabus areas” table are neither prescriptive nor restrictive.
Careful planning of class activities, film screenings and, where feasible, lectures from film scholars and
workshops with industry professionals, is needed to ensure the best use of the time and resources available.
Syllabus details
The suggestions for taught activities outlined in the syllabus content that follows are intended to stimulate a
broad range of exciting and engaging approaches to fulfilling the requirements of the course. These are not
intended to be prescriptive nor restrictive activities, but illustrate many possible pathways to fully preparing
students for the demands of the film assessment tasks. Further resources to underpin the planning and
delivery of this course can be found in the Film teacher support material.

Overview of the course
Core areas
The film syllabus consists of the following core areas.
•
Exploring film production roles •
Reading film •
Contextualizing film •
Collaboratively producing film (HL only)
The core syllabus areas for DP film have been designed to fully connect with each assessment task. These
areas must be central to the planning and designing of the taught film programme that is developed and
delivered by the teacher. Students are required to understand the relationship between these areas and
how each one informs and shapes their work in film.
The inquiry cycle
The film course is intended to be taught through dynamic cycles of inquiry, action and reflection.
“Through inquiry, action and reflection, IB programmes aim to develop a range of thinking,
self-management, social communication and research skills referred to in IB programmes as ‘approaches to learning’”
What is an IB education? (2013:5)

=== Page 29 ===
Syllabus content
Film guide 23
Inquiry
Inquiry in the film course involves both structured inquiry into established bodies of knowledge and
engagement with complex problems in order to better understand them. Through this process, students
should be encouraged to examine possibilities for further inquiry, experimentation, exploration and
personal development in order to reach a deeper level of understanding.
Action
Action in the film course is both a strategy and an outcome, ensuring that learning emerges out of practical,
real-world experiences. Action involves learning by doing, the practical application that enhances learning
not only of acquired subject knowledge, but also further develops skills, processes and products involved in the study, application and appreciation of film.
Reflection
Reflection in the film course requires students to become critically aware of their own development
as international filmmakers and calls on them to scrutinize their influences, methods and conclusions,
as well as the products and performances that grow from their experiences and endeavours. Students
experience presenting work in a variety of formats, consider the potential impact of this work and
evaluate the extent to which they can fulfill intentions.
Taught content
To fully prepare students for the demands of the film assessment tasks, teachers are expected to ensure that
their planning addresses each of the requirements stated in the following table, which is represented as the interplay between inquiry, action and reflection.

Exploring film production roles
For this area of the course, students are required to explore various film production roles through
engagement with all phases of the filmmaking process. The development of film production skills is a
complex process that requires creativity, imagination and problem-solving skills, as well as meticulous
organizational and analytical skills. It almost always involves close collaboration with others and can
demand a scrupulous attention to detail and a willingness to persevere.
Teachers should guide students through initial creative exercises, gradually leading them towards more
substantial projects. Students should learn the overall structure of filmmaking, the formulation of filmmaking
intentions, the skills, responsibilities and professional expectations associated with each film production
role and the nature of the relationships in a production team. Students should be encouraged to work in a
variety of film production roles to enable them to explore their skills and aptitudes in different fields.
Preparing for internal assessment
It is intended that the work undertaken within this core syllabus will not only inform the approach students
take for the film portfolio assessment task, but also provide much of the material required to complete the
assessment task. Therefore, students must begin retaining and collating work from day one of the course to
ensure they have enough material to fulfill the formal requirements of the task.

Terminology
Film production roles
For the purposes of the DP film course, students are required to experience working in a variety of
film production roles. These roles are as follows.
•
Cinematographer—responsible for the camera and for achieving the artistic and technical
decisions related to the framed image. Click here to see a more detailed description of the cinematographer role.
•
Director—responsible for the artistic and logistic aspects of the production, visualizing the
script and guiding the other individuals involved in the film in order to fulfill their artistic vision.
Click here to see a more detailed description of the director role.
•
Editor—responsible for assembling the raw footage, selecting shots and constructing the film
in order to meet the artistic vision for the film. Click here to see a more detailed description of the editor role.
•
Sound—responsible for capturing, creating, sourcing and assembling the audio elements of
the film. Click here to see a more detailed description of the sound role.
•
Writer—responsible for writing the screenplay, for updating the script during production and
for supporting others in realizing the artistic intentions for the film. Click here to see a more detailed description of the writer role.
•
One other clearly defined film production role not specified above (see below).
The intention of the optional “one other clearly defined film production role” is to ensure that
as new technologies emerge over time, centres that become equipped with appropriate film
technologies and expertise can incorporate them into their film courses to further broaden the
production experiences of their candidates. This may be any role deemed a creative role within
the filmmaking process such as animator, art director, costume designer, production designer,
production illustrator or special effects. Film teachers are not expected to teach these optional
roles as part of the core syllabus; however, students who show enthusiasm or aptitude in these
areas may wish to explore outside of the more traditional film roles offered.
Filmmaker intentions
For the purposes of the DP film course, filmmaker intentions are specific aims that students
formulate in order to guide their work in each chosen film production role. These intentions are
likely to arise from exposure to influences from films and filmmakers, and should be used to lead the
practical exploration and experimentation in each film production role. Filmmaker intentions
should be authentic and meaningful personal goals that the student is passionate about fulfilling.
These intentions could be as simple as developing a new skill or attempting a specific technique in
their production work (such as creating a silhouette as a cinematographer or using a mask to create
the effect of binoculars as editor) or might be more abstract, attempting to create work that echoes a
recognizable film style or the creation of a particular mood through their filmmaking work (such as the
photographic feel of Grapes of Wrath [1940] or the use of photographic stills seen in Run Lola Run [1998]).
Students may or may not necessarily fulfill their stated filmmaker intentions in their production
work, and they should be encouraged to reflect on the process of learning in this area. This work
goes to the heart of the IB learner profile and requires students to approach their learning with
forethought, independence and a willingness to fail and try again. This is the very essence of being
a risk-taker. Students are bound to come across successes and challenges in equal measure as they
attempt to fulfill their filmmaker intentions. It is important that, from the outset, students perceive
the value of failure as part of their process of learning in this work.

Exploring film production roles: Inquiry
Teachers should develop tasks and activities that enable students to engage with various film texts, seeking
influence and inspiration in order to guide their own production work. Students should research a variety
of film production roles and acquire an understanding of industry practices and essential skills required
for a minimum of three roles. They should have experience of examining their own personal interests and
inspirations in order to identify filmmaker intentions.
Taught activities for this area might include the following.
Lesson
Sources
Activities
Cinematographer
Examples of dolly-zoom in excerpts from Vertigo (1958) and Goodfellas (1990).
Q. What is the effect of the dolly-zoom and how is it achieved?
•
Students watch examples and research the dolly zoom (also called reverse-tracking, reverse-zoom or vertigo shot). Students propose a scene (from an existing or original script) where this effect could be used to convey meaning. Students research what technology is required to achieve this shot and how to do it.
•
Extension activity: Students attempt to create their own dolly-zoom.
Writer
Previously screened film, studied in depth in class, that fulfills the three-act structure paradigm as articulated by screenwriting teacher
Syd Field (b. 1935).
Q. To what extent can a screenwriting formula be identified in a film?
•
Having carried out research into Field’s structure, students locate a copy of the script from a chosen film and break it down to clearly identify where each plot state begins and ends.
Students share their findings with the class and examine the extent to which all of the films selected match the structure.
•
Extension activity: Students locate and research films that subvert the three-act structure.

Activities
Editor
Extracts from a variety of films that create an alternative reality through filmmaking techniques, such as La
Jetée (1962) or Being
John Malkovich (1999) or Doctor Who (1963).
Q. How can editing techniques be used to suggest an alternative reality?
•
Students watch examples of films and make notes on the editing techniques used to differentiate between realities. Students identify transitions, pace and the links between image and sound to make these story transitions believable.
Students write their own sequence where there is a transition between two worlds and plan what tools they will use to create this transition.
•
Extension activity: Students re-edit existing film material or create their own film, manipulating the footage through editing techniques and effects to suggest moments of alternative reality, such as flashbacks, hallucinations and transitions into other worlds. Students analyse the effectiveness of their own work and that of others in the class.
Director
Excerpts from Hitchcock’s
Rope (1948).
Show in two-minute segments from a variety of places in the film.
Q. Why is it important for the director to pre-plan blocking?
•
Students do preliminary research on the basic premise of the film (Wikipedia or IMDb will suffice for this assignment). Screen a scene/ segment to the class and ask students to map out the movement of each character and the camera. Repeat this activity two or three times.
Ask students to discuss any observations they have made regarding actor or camera movement. Why is blocking important?
•
Extension activity: Provide students with a one page script (with three or more characters, to be appropriately challenging) for them to block the scene on paper and with actors.
Sound
Extracts from films from different decades containing significant sound design and foley work, such as The
Conversation (1974), Blow out (1981), Memento (2000) and Gravity (2013).
Q. How significant is the contribution of sound design to the overall effectiveness of a film?
•
Students research how sound was created for two of the films watched. In small groups, students select a five-minute sequence that has an example of dialogue, soundtrack and sound effect. Students make a list of all the sounds in the five-minute sequence under each heading. Select a second scene and watch it without sound. Students list all of the sounds one might hear and then play back the scene to see if anything was missed. This activity can be repeated with numerous scenes as it brings greater awareness to the sound role.

Exploring film production roles: Action
Teachers should develop tasks and activities that enable students to acquire, develop and apply practical
filmmaking skills and techniques, in a variety of forms and a minimum of three film production roles.
Students should experience working both individually and collaboratively as creative risk-takers on a variety
of filmmaking exercises and experiments in order to fulfill their filmmaker intentions. They should have
experience of collaborating to create at least one completed film, working in one film production role.
Taught activities for this area might include the following.
Lesson
Sources
Activities
Editor
Students watch extracts from films that employ the Soviet montage “Kuleshov” effect, such as Battleship Potemkin (1925)—the Odessa steps scene—and The Godfather (1972)—the baptism scene.
Q. How can the juxtaposition of images create new meaning?
•
Students research the “Kuleshov” effect and screen the given montage examples. Students make notes on each scene and discuss how the juxtaposition of images creates a third distinct meaning. Students then select two opposing images/concepts and create a 30-second montage. An example would be to juxtapose images of water use in rural Kenya versus North
America to provide a new global perspective on water. Still images, screen grabs and video footage are all appropriate. These are shared with the class.
Cinematography
Research cinematic techniques
Q. What shots are required for basic coverage?
•
Students research the cinematic techniques required for basic coverage. In groups of three, students plan, shoot and edit a short scene that is based around a part of a card or chess game.
The students should focus on the portrayal of space and the relationship between the characters and the game while obtaining all necessary shots for appropriate coverage (such as master shot, insert shots, reaction shots) and paying attention to the rule of thirds, the 180-degree rule, eye-lines, and continuity of hands, cards or chess pieces. This activity is also useful for directing and editing as students view and reflect on their work.

Activities
Director
Students work with a short script (of their own or an existing script).
Q. To what extent does genre convention dictate direction?
•
Students are given four contrasting genres to work with. Working in groups of four, each student will become responsible for directing the scene in the allocated genre.
After reviewing notes on genre from the “Contextualizing film” areas, students take turns to direct each other in the scene using the appropriate conventions. Dialogue must remain the same, but actor and camera blocking, lighting and other mise-en-scène elements may be changed so that the sequence is representative of each selected genre. Each director should have a plan of how to work with the actors and have storyboards or sketches to consult on set. The directors should debrief as a team, discussing the problems and solutions of working with the actors and the camera, and identifying how their own work could be improved.
Writer
Short story or fairy tale.
For a student-friendly guide to writing a script, search For a Few Days More by April Rider.
Q. How is a screenplay different to a written story?
•
Ask students to research the correct formatting for a screenplay. Students select a short story
or fairy tale and adapt it into a screenplay using appropriate formatting. Students should avoid the temptation of including camera and editing directions in the screenplay.
Sound
A short sequence of film that does not create any diegetic or non-diegetic sound.
Q. How can sound be used as a suggestive device in film?
•
Students create three or four diegetic sounds (sounds that originate from a source within the world of the film) and non-diegetic sounds (sounds that come from a source outside of the world of the film, such as those that have been added for mood or effect) for a short sequence of film. The sounds that students create should attempt to evoke a specific mood, suggest an emotional shift in the narrative, create anxiety or be used to develop a particular character.
When the students have created the sounds and applied them to the sequence, they share their work and assess the most effective techniques used.

Exploring film production roles: Reflection
Teachers should develop tasks and activities that enable students to reflect on their acquisition of skills
and chart their learning in a variety of film production roles. Students should be able to reflect on the
successes and challenges of their exercises, experiments and complete films, evaluating the impact this
work has had on them as a filmmaker and the extent to which their filmmaker intentions were fulfilled.
They should have experience of collating evidence of their explorations in a portfolio, presenting work in both visual and written forms.
Taught activities for this area might include the following.
Lesson
Sources
Activities
Cinematographer
Students reflect on and choose extracts from three short video experiments they have done as a focus for a blog.
Q. How does a cinematographer set up a shot?
•
Students create a video blog that explains techniques that a beginner filmmaker might use to effectively set up a camera for the shoot (such as preparing the camera, how to use a handheld camera, how to use a tripod).
Director
Students reflect on and choose extracts from three short video experiments they have created as examples.
Q. How does a director work with actors?
•
Students create a workshop for the film class that explains and explores techniques a director might use to prepare actors for their roles (such as rehearsals, working with character, camera blocking). The workshop could be recorded so that participants can see the results of working on character.
Sound
Films containing famous leitmotifs (theme sound), such as Star Wars (1977) and Jaws (1975). These are applied to a scene from
Monsters, Inc. (2001).
This could also be done with film or TV theme music.
Q. How can a leitmotif define a character?
•
Students research leitmotifs, playing the selected clips with the original music in place.
Students should start to experiment with playing alternative leitmotifs over other clips from famous films (such as “The Imperial March” from Star Wars or the Jaws theme played over the character of “Boo” in Monsters, Inc.). With a partner, students reflect on the effect this has on the film and discuss the impact on mood, foreshadowing and audience expectation.
•
Extension activity: Students create their own personal leitmotif for a film clip.

Writer
Students identify a film of their choice for study that follows the three-act model.
Q. To what extent do films follow a set model?
Keeping their analysis of the feature film’s three acts
in mind, students create a treatment and a pitch for
their selected film. Students reflect on what details need to be included and what can be left out when trying to pitch a film script.
Reading film
For this area of the course, it is essential that students understand how meaning is constructed within and
through film texts and are able to view the production of these texts in a broader framework. Students
should be able to acquire and use the appropriate tools for analysing films from various cultural contexts
and place these within wider critical perspectives. Students should be able to identify how film uses a range
of film elements to represent experiences and stories. Students should develop both their own enjoyment
of film and lifelong habits of critical inquiry, engaging them as both a filmmaker and as an audience member.
Preparing for external assessment
The taught activities outlined below are expected to be delivered prior to students commencing the formal
textual analysis assessment task, for which they will be required to examine a film text that they have not previously studied.

Terminology
Cultural context
For the purposes of the DP film course, cultural context refers to the conditions that influence and
are influenced by culture. Cultural context appears in both the taught syllabus and the assessment
tasks, and involves consideration of some of the following factors, some of which may be blended (such as socio-economic factors).
•
Economic (for example, the economic classes and issues explored within a film’s narrative) •
Geographical (for example, the geographical location of a film’s origin) •
Historical (for example, the period in time in which a film was created) •
Institutional (for example, the production, distribution and exhibition factors involved for a film) •
Political (for example, a film that attempts to persuade, subvert or create a political effect) •
Social (for example, the communities, identities or issues represented in a film) •
Technological (for example, the tools, products and methods used to create a film)
Film elements
For the purposes of the DP film course, film elements has been chosen as an umbrella term to
cover factors that are broadly associated with film language, formalist film analysis and vocabulary
pertaining to the creation and reception of film texts. Therefore, consideration of film elements
in both the taught syllabus and assessment tasks may involve consideration of a variety of the following. (This list is not exhaustive.) •
Cinematography (such as colour, composition, exposure, framing, focus scale, movement, shot type, and so on) •
Critical response and reception •
Editing (such as continuity, cut, dissolve, match, montage, pace, transition, and so on) •
Filmmakers’ influences, intentions and vision •
Genre, codes and conventions •
Mise-en-scène (such as acting and figure behaviour, art direction, costume and make up, décor, lighting, set and setting, space, and so on) •
Motifs, symbols and themes •
Narrative structure •
Sound (such as dialogue, sound editing, sound effects and foley, soundtrack and music or score, diegetic and non-diegetic, and so on)

Reading film: Inquiry
Teachers should develop tasks and activities that enable students to explore a variety of film texts (including
narrative, documentaries, television shows and shorts) that originate from various cultural contexts in
order for students to gain an understanding of how film elements combine to convey meaning. Students
should be able to research and respond to a variety of film texts, using both primary and secondary sources,
identifying how the film texts are constructed and the ways in which choices in film elements convey
meaning. They must have experience of acquiring and developing technical and critical film vocabulary to support their analysis.

Contextualizing film
For this area of the course, it is essential that students understand how film has evolved and developed
across time, space and culture. Students should be able to identify and explore a range of films from
contrasting cultural contexts and should consider the frameworks that exist within various areas of film
focus. Students need to be able to develop an awareness of links and relationships between individual and
collective cinematic experiences and express their findings in a variety of ways.
Culture across time and space
The cultural diversity of film is a powerful component of its status as a significant art form. Students are
expected to reflect this diversity in their contextualizing film work. Teachers are urged to counsel their
students in identifying work for this core area that challenges existing assumptions and exposes them to unfamiliar and globally minded subject matter.
For this film course, culture is defined as learned and shared beliefs, values, interests, attitudes, products
and all patterns of behaviour created by society. This view of culture includes an organized system of
symbols, ideas, explanations, beliefs and material production that humans create and manipulate in their
daily lives. Culture is dynamic and organic, and it operates on many levels across both time (historical) and
space (geographical). It is important that culture is seen as fluid and subject to change.
Preparing for external assessment
The taught activities outlined below are expected to be delivered prior to students commencing the formal
comparative study assessment task, for which students will be required to examine an area of film focus
and related film texts they have not previously studied in depth.

Collaboratively producing film (HL only)
Engagement in the collaborative creation of original finished work defines the HL experience for this course.
HL students will need to build on the subject matter, skills and experiences encountered in the other core
syllabus areas (reading film, contextualizing film and exploring film production roles) and engage in a
process of synthesis. This task requires creative cooperation, team work, open-mindedness and problem solving to successfully take original films from inception to completion.
The collaborative nature of this syllabus area is fundamental, acknowledging that successful filmmaking
most often depends on the combined effort of those involved in the process. Students will experience
working as members of core production teams, in addition to their work in discrete film production roles.
Preparing for external assessment
It is intended that the work undertaken within this core syllabus area will inform the approach students
eventually take for the collaborative film project assessment task. These taught activities are expected
to be delivered prior to students commencing the task, after which they are required to form new core
production teams and to initiate entirely new ideas and plans for completed films.

Core production team
For this DP Film guide, a core production team is a group of students who are fully responsible for
defining the scope of original completed films and for ensuring that all creative and logistical aspects
of pre-production, production and post-production are carried out successfully. For this taught
area, students are required to work collaboratively as part of a core production team of two to four
students from within the school community. Students can choose to work collaboratively. They may
choose to work with fellow students from their film class, with students from other film classes in the
school, or with students in the school who are not studying film. They can also choose to work with a combination of all three options.
While each student in the group will take on one single film production role (defined below) for
each completed film, it is expected that, as members of the core production team, each student
will take on numerous other responsibilities and tasks during the project in order to support the
cooperative realization of each completed film. This flexible and supportive collaboration is central
to this taught area and each student should keep a record of the nature of their collaborations.
They should reflect on their approaches to team work, problem-solving, time management and
conflict resolution as a member of the core production team, and should evaluate the successes
and challenges encountered as part of the creative process.
Film production roles
For the purposes of the DP film course, students are required to experience working in a variety of
film production roles. These roles are as follows.
•
Cinematographer—responsible for the camera and for achieving the artistic and technical
decisions related to the framed image. Click here to see a more detailed description of the cinematographer role.
•
Director—responsible for the artistic and logistic aspects of the production, visualizing the
script and guiding the other individuals involved in the film in order to fulfill their artistic vision.

•
Editor—responsible for assembling the raw footage, selecting shots and constructing the film
in order to meet the artistic vision for the film. Click here to see a more detailed description of the editor role.
•
Sound—responsible for capturing, creating, sourcing and assembling the audio elements of
the film. Click here to see a more detailed description of the sound role.
•
Writer—responsible for writing the screenplay, for updating the script during production and
for supporting others in realizing the artistic intentions for the film. Click here to see a more detailed description of the writer role.

Collaboratively producing film: Inquiry
Teachers should develop tasks and activities that enable students to reflect on their experiences of watching
films and consider how exposure to films and filmmakers might guide and influence their own work, enabling
them to set clear intentions for filmmaking. Students should be able to consider how the film elements, areas
of film focus, film production roles and cultural contexts they have explored in the DP film course can
inform and shape their own filmmaking practices. They should have experience of forming core production
teams in order to collaboratively create plans for making at least one original completed film, identifying the
roles, responsibilities, skills and techniques required, and formulating intentions for the completed films.
Taught activities for this area might include the following.
Lesson

Activities
Short film structure
Students select short films that are less than 7 minutes in length from online channels.
Q. How does a film script evolve into scenes?
•
Students break down the script of one chosen film into scenes in order to identify how it has been structured. This could be contrasted against the paradigm presented by Syd Field for feature films (see “Exploring film production
roles: Inquiry”).
Filmic influences
Students choose films that are personally relevant or inspirational.
Q. Where do inspirations for filmmaking come from?
•
Students reflect on films they have watched over the length of the course and list the films, directors, key moments and work of individual technicians that have been inspirational to them. This can be used as the basis for a short presentation to the class.
The pitch
Students investigate the original pitches and pre production art used for three films of their choice.
Q. What makes a credible film pitch?
•
As a group, the students work together to devise a pitch for a new Pixar animated film dealing with the problems of being a teenager. The pitch should present the group’s ideas and include
illustrations or photos to illustrate key moments— at least two images for the beginning, middle and
the end of the film. The pitch should be presented to a panel of peers who critique the delivery and content of the pitch.
Treatment styles
Students investigate a treatment written for a film of their choice.
Q. What makes a credible film treatment?
•
In groups, students use a poem or song lyric as the basis for a film treatment, writing their prose to include details of the intended directorial style. Each group prepares a treatment that shows the influence of a specific genre, movement or tradition. For example, in the style of the romantic comedy genre, in the style of the French New Wave movement or in the style of German expressionism. Treatments should be shared with the class and the most engaging aspects identified.

Storyboard
Students choose films that have storyboards available and identify a variety of graphic techniques used to convey mise en scène, composition, actor blocking and camera movement in the storyboards.
The script for a one-act play (these can be found online or the school theatre department might be able to provide a selection of scripts).
Q. How can storyboards be used and interpreted to create directorial style?
•
Having looked at a variety of storyboards from existing films, each student chooses a one act play script and creates a storyboard for a new film adaptation. The boards, which can be drawn or use photographs, should convey the essential elements for the film as well as communicating a directorial style (for example, how might Aesop’s Fox and Crow be different if it was directed by Tim Burton instead of Quentin Tarantino?).
Public service announcement
(PSA)
Students collaborate on a one-minute PSA.
Q. How do all the roles work together?
•
In a small collaborative group, students plan and produce a 30–60-second PSA. Each participant is involved with pre-production, production and post-production. Students should reflect on how the group worked together. This exercise is best delivered prior to the students beginning their collaborative film project as it draws out the group’s strengths, weaknesses and compatibility.
This work is screened to the rest of the class in order to identify the most “credible” features of the work.
Reverse engineering
A short segment from a film.
Q. How do the professionals do it?
•
Students select a short scene from a feature film to recreate. Students should work within their chosen role and are expected to collaborate with all team members.
Students will need to carefully screen the clip, making note of shots, angles, blocking, art direction, movement, dialogue, sound effects, soundtrack, transitions and pacing. Teachers should check the clip before students begin to ensure it is appropriately challenging and should provide marks for how accurately students have recreated their scene.

Special effects creation
Students identify special effects techniques used in the films of Georges Méliès (1861–1938).
Q. What are the traditional filmmaking techniques used for special effects?
•
In a group, students plan and film a “wizard battle”. This magical skirmish should be accomplished using as many special effects from the early history of film as possible, such as stopping the camera, running footage backwards, simple stop-motion, on-set effects, make-up, lighting, and other techniques they have identified from Méliès’ films. When finished, the group should screen their film and give a class presentation on how the effects were accomplished.
Collaboratively producing film: Reflection
Teachers should develop tasks and activities that enable students to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses
of their own individual work in film production roles. Students should be able to reflect on their
collaborations as part of a core production team, evaluating the successes and challenges of the process
and the extent to which at least one completed film fulfilled stated intentions. They should have experience
of presenting work in both audio-visual and written forms.

Q. How does directorial intent change with the creation of the film?
•
Students read or watch an interview with a director on a specific film they have seen and reflect on how the director’s intentions were
realized in the film. This could be done as a class or individually by students. Students reflect on their own intentions and whether they are drawn to certain styles, themes or characters.
Test audience screening
Students screen films they have worked on for a group of peers who have not seen the work before.
Q. What are the benefits of running a test screening when making a film?
•
Students screen their films for the audience, who will watch without (as far as possible) knowing the content of the films or the identity of the production team. They answer the following four questions.
– Why do you think this film was made?
– What do you think this film says to its audience?
– What makes you think that?
– What is your reaction to the film?
The production team should listen to reactions without responding or attempting to explain what the audience does not understand. Students should
reflect on this experience, considering where they have been successful and how they could improve their work further.
The connections between these core syllabus areas and each of the film assessment tasks can be seen in the
table “Linking the DP film core syllabus areas to the assessment tasks”, which both teachers and students
may find useful to guide their ongoing work in film.

Assessment
Assessment in the Diploma Programme
General
Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most important aims of assessment in the
Diploma Programme are that it should support the subject aims and objectives and encourage a variety
of approaches to student learning. Both external and internal assessments are used in the DP. IB examiners
mark work produced for external assessment, while work produced for internal assessment is marked by teachers and externally moderated by the IB.
There are two types of assessment identified by the IB.
•
Formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is concerned with providing accurate
and helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of learning taking place and the nature of
students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop students’ understanding and capabilities.
Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide information to
monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives.
•
Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring student achievement.
The DP primarily focuses on summative assessment designed to record student achievement at, or towards
the end of, the course of study. However, many of the assessment instruments can also be used formatively
during the course of teaching and learning, and teachers are encouraged to do this. A comprehensive
assessment plan is viewed as being integral with teaching, learning and course organization. For further
information, see the IB Programme standards and practices document.
The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not norm-referenced. This approach to
assessment judges students’ work by their performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, not in
relation to the work of other students. For further information on assessment within the DP, please refer to
the publication Diploma Programme assessment: Principles and practice.
To support teachers in the planning, delivery and assessment of the DP courses, a variety of resources can
be found on the DP film subject website or purchased through the IB store at store.ibo.org.
Teachers are free to decide the order in which students undertake the assessment tasks; however, it should
be noted that the submission deadline for internal assessment tasks (20 April/20 November) falls before the
deadline for external tasks (30 April/30 November).
Methods of assessment
The IB uses several methods to assess work produced by students.
Assessment criteria
Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended. Each criterion concentrates on
a particular skill that students are expected to demonstrate. An assessment objective describes what
students should be able to do, and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do it. Using

=== Page 56 ===
Assessment in the Diploma Programme
Film guide 50
assessment criteria allows discrimination between different tasks and encourages a variety of responses.
Each criterion comprises a set of hierarchically ordered level descriptors. Each level descriptor is worth one
or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The maximum marks for each
criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are added
together to give the total mark for the piece of work.
Markbands
Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance against which responses are judged.
They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds
to a range of marks to differentiate student performance. A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which
particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.
Inclusive assessment arrangements
Inclusive assessment arrangements are available for candidates with assessment access requirements.
These arrangements enable candidates with diverse needs to access the examinations and demonstrate
their knowledge and understanding of the constructs being assessed.
The IB document Candidates with assessment access requirements provides details on all the inclusive
assessment arrangements available to candidates with learning support requirements. The IB document
Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes outlines the position of the IB with regard to candidates
with diverse learning needs in the IB programmes. For candidates affected by adverse circumstances, the
IB documents General regulations: Diploma Programme and Diploma Programme Assessment procedures provide details on access consideration.
Responsibilities of the school
The school is required to ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided
to candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Candidates with
assessment access requirements and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes.

Assessment
Internal assessment
Purpose of internal assessment
Internal assessment is an integral part of the course and is compulsory for both SL and HL students. It
enables students to demonstrate the application of their skills and knowledge, and to pursue their personal
interests, without the time limitations and other constraints that are associated with written examinations.
The internal assessment should, as far as possible, be woven into normal classroom teaching and not be a
separate activity conducted after a course has been taught.
The internal assessment requirements at SL and HL are the same. Both SL and HL students complete the film portfolio.
Guidance and authenticity
The film portfolio (SL and HL) submitted for internal assessment must be the student’s own work. The
teacher should play an important role during both the planning stage and the period when the student is
working on the internally assessed work. It is the responsibility of the teacher to ensure that students are
familiar with:
•
the requirements of the type of work to be internally assessed •
the assessment criteria; students must understand that the work submitted for assessment must address these criteria effectively.
Teachers and students must discuss the internally assessed work. Students should be encouraged to initiate
discussions with the teacher to obtain advice and information, and students must not be penalized for
seeking guidance. As part of the learning process, teachers should read and give advice to students on one
draft of the work. The teacher should provide oral or written advice on how the work could be improved,
but not edit the draft. The next version handed to the teacher must be the final version for submission.
It is the responsibility of teachers to ensure that all students understand the basic meaning and significance
of concepts that relate to academic honesty, especially authenticity and intellectual property. Teachers
must ensure that all student work for assessment is prepared according to the requirements and must
explain clearly to students that the internally assessed work must be entirely their own. Where collaboration
between students is permitted, it must be clear to all students what the difference is between collaboration and collusion.
All work submitted to the IB for moderation or assessment must be authenticated by a teacher, and must
not include any known instances of suspected or confirmed malpractice. Each student must confirm that the
work is his or her authentic work and constitutes the final version of that work. Once a student has officially
submitted the final version of the work it cannot be retracted. The requirement to confirm the authenticity
of work applies to the work of all students, not just the sample work that will be submitted to the IB for
the purpose of moderation. For further details, refer to the IB publications Academic honesty, the Diploma
Programme: From principles into practice and the relevant articles in General regulations: Diploma Programme.

=== Page 60 ===
Internal assessment
Film guide 54
Authenticity may be checked by discussion with the student on the content of the work, and scrutiny of one or more of the following.
•
The student’s initial proposal •
One draft of the work •
The references cited •
The style of writing compared with work known to be that of the student •
The analysis of written work, where appropriate, by a web-based plagiarism detection service such as www.turnitin.com
The same piece of work cannot be submitted to meet the requirements of both the internal assessment and the extended essay.
Time allocation
Internal assessment is an integral part of the DP film course, contributing 40% of the final assessment in
the SL course and 25% in the HL course. This weighting should be reflected in the time that is allocated to
teaching the knowledge, skills and understanding required to undertake the work, as well as the total time allocated to carry out the work.
Using assessment criteria for internal assessment
For internal assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion has
level descriptors describing specific achievement levels, together with an appropriate range of marks. The
level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure to achieve may be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL against the criteria using the level descriptors.
•
The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL in the film portfolio.
•
The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained
by the student, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be
made when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark
awarded should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is
not necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.
•
When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors for each criterion until
they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a
piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the
one that more appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.
•
Where there are two or more marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper marks
if the student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent; the work may be close
to achieving marks in the level above. Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work
demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in the level below.
•
Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.
•
Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying
the appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.

=== Page 61 ===
Internal assessment
Film guide 55 •
The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by a
student. Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of the work being assessed.
•
A student who attains a high achievement level in relation to one criterion will not necessarily
attain high achievement levels in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a student who attains a low
achievement level for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the other
criteria. Teachers should not assume that the overall assessment of the students will produce any particular distribution of marks.
•
It is recommended that the assessment criteria be made available to students.

Introduction
Students at SL and HL undertake a variety of filmmaking exercises in a range of film production roles in
order to fulfill defined filmmaker intentions. They acquire and develop practical skills and techniques
through participation in film exercises, experiments and the creation of at least one completed film.
Students reflect on how learning has further contributed to their understanding of film production roles
and the extent to which their filmmaker intentions were fulfilled.
Each student submits a film portfolio for assessment, containing the following.
a.
Portfolio pages (9 pages maximum: 3 pages maximum per film production role) and a list of all sources used.
b.
A film reel (9 minutes maximum: 3 minutes maximum per film production role, including one completed film).

Internal assessment
Film guide 56
Terminology
Film production roles
For this assessment task, students must work in three discrete film production roles selected from the following list.
•
Cinematographer •
Director •
Editor •
Sound •
Writer •
One other clearly defined film production role not specified above (see below).
In the majority of cases, it is expected that schools will only offer the five traditional film production
roles. However, the optional “one other clearly defined film production role” is included here to
ensure that, where teachers feel they have specific expertise or knowledge, or as new technologies
emerge over time and schools become equipped with new film technologies and skills, these
optional roles can be incorporated them into their film courses to further broaden the production
experiences of their candidates. It is important to note that these other roles must be visually creative
film production roles within the filmmaking process such as animator, art director, costume designer,
production designer, production illustrator or special effects (rather than purely logistical roles, such
as producer). Film teachers are not expected to offer these optional roles as part of the core
syllabus unless they have the expertise, knowledge and technology in place to support them.
Please note: The “one other clearly defined film production role” may only count as ONE of the
three film production roles selected for this assessment. The other two roles must come from the prescribed list.
Filmmaker intentions
For this assessment task, students are required to identify specific creative intentions for their work
in each chosen film production role. These filmmaker intentions, which are likely to arise from
exposure to influences from other films and filmmakers, are intended to lead the process of practical
exploration and experimentation in each film production role in order to help the student develop
a better understanding of the role and to reach a stronger level of proficiency with the associated
production skills. Therefore, the filmmaker intentions should be authentic and meaningful personal
goals that the student is passionate about fulfilling. Filmmaker intentions need to be clearly defined
and articulated and should directly link to the creative output of the specific film production role
chosen, communicating how a student intends to make meaning for an audience on screen through
their work. Students may or may not necessarily fulfill their stated filmmaker intentions in their
production work, and they should be encouraged to reflect on the process of learning in this area.
Please note: students should be guided to set appropriately challenging goals for themselves through
their filmmaker intentions. Narrow or unchallenging goals (such as carrying out logistical tasks or
aiming to produce intentionally low-quality work, for example) will be self-penalizing for students.
As such, students should invest time into researching, developing and honing their filmmaker
intentions to ensure they are clear, focused and appropriately creative, in order to provide them
with the maximum potential for success in all production work that ensues.

Film guide 57
Preparation process
Creative risk-taking
This assessment task calls for students to take the lead in approaching unfamiliar situations, and to explore
and develop new skills and techniques in order to make discoveries. This task goes to the heart of the
IB learner profile and requires students to approach their learning with forethought, independence and
a willingness to fail and try again through the IB’s inquiry cycle. This is the very essence of being a risk taker. Students are bound to come across successes and challenges in equal measure as they grapple with
film production roles and the associated technologies. They should therefore be encouraged to embrace
these challenges and give equal value to the areas that pushed and developed them as to the areas that
come more naturally. It is important that students perceive the value of failure as part of their process of
learning in this task from the outset. Students should be reminded that creative risk-taking does not allow
for breaching rules regarding ethical content or the disregard of health and safety considerations.
Assessment process
In preparation for this task, students at SL and HL must have undertaken the activities outlined within the
“Exploring film production roles” section as part of the core syllabus. Students then undertake the following process for assessment.
Inquiry •
Each student reflects on their experiences of watching, discussing and writing about films. They
identify an area of interest that excites and inspires them, and develop appropriately creative and
suitably challenging filmmaker intentions they would like to achieve through production work.
•
Using both primary and secondary sources, each student carries out research into three selected film
production roles they would like to work in, and acquires an understanding of how these discrete
roles contribute to filmmaking, as well as an understanding of the industry practices and techniques required to work in these areas.
•
Each student undertakes a series of preproduction tasks, including formulating a plan for practically
exploring the chosen film production roles in order to acquire, develop and apply skills, and to fulfill their stated filmmaker intentions.
Action •
Each student undertakes a range of practical production activities in the chosen film production
roles they have selected. They experience working both individually and collaboratively in a range
of film activities, grappling with the skills associated with the film production roles and attempting
to effectively fulfill their stated filmmaker intentions. This must include the creation of at least one completed film (3 minutes maximum).
•
Each student undertakes a range of experiments and explorations, demonstrating creative exploration
and production skill in each chosen film production role. Activities may be teacher-led or student led. Any teacher-led activities must allow room for student ownership and individual creativity. A
literal remake of an existing film sequence, for example, could be considered a useful teaching activity,
but could also be limiting for inclusion for assessment without adequate opportunities for student-led creative interpretation and flexibility.
Reflection •
Making clear links to the identified films and filmmakers that inspired this work, each student reflects
on their explorations and on the impact this learning has had on their understanding of the three film
production roles in which they have worked, and evaluates the extent to which they fulfilled their filmmaker intentions.

=== Page 64 ===
Internal assessment
Film guide 58 •
As a result of the outlined inquiry, action and reflection processes, each student compiles a film
portfolio for assessment containing portfolio pages (9 pages maximum: 3 pages maximum per film
production role), a list of all sources used and a film reel (9 minutes maximum: 3 minutes maximum
per film production role, including one completed film).
Task details
For this assessment task, students are required to work in three clearly defined film production roles
for which they will be generating evidence for submission. Students must be made aware of the specific
requirements of this task from early on in the DP film course to ensure that they make informed choices
about which film production roles they wish to select, and to create and maintain a digital space in which to retain the clips of evidence they generate.
Students are required to define filmmaker intentions for each film production role.
•
These intentions must be authentically identified by the student and must lead all practical production
activities for this assessment task. The intentions must be clear, focused, appropriately creative and suitably challenging.
•
Students should clearly identify in their portfolio pages the influences that have helped shape their filmmaker intentions.
•
Students are expected to reflect on and evaluate the extent to which their filmmaker intentions have
been fulfilled in their work, and the ways in which this work has further shaped their understanding of
how each film production role contributes to effective filmmaking.
Ethical filmmaking
As part of the collective consideration of the school, film students must be supported in maintaining
an ethical perspective during their course. Schools must be vigilant to ensure that work undertaken
by the student is appropriate for the context of the school and the age of the students.
Student work for this assessment task must not:
• damage the environment • glamorize the taking of drugs • inappropriately reference socially taboo subjects • incite or condone intolerance or hatred of others • include excessive or gratuitous violence •
make reference to, or represent, explicit sexual activity.
In this task, the moderator is particularly interested in the extent to which students can evaluate their
acquisition, development and application of film production skills and the ways in which these contribute
to a greater understanding of how film production roles contribute to effective filmmaking. They are also looking for evidence of:
•
understanding of each selected film production role and filmmaker intentions for working in these roles •
the student’s engagement with the film production roles and the experience of practical exploration
in order to fulfill their filmmaker intentions and hone their skills •
reflection and evaluation of their ongoing film production work and the impact this learning has had
on their understanding of the three film production roles in which they have worked, and the extent
to which they fulfilled their filmmaker intentions.

Internal assessment
Film guide 59
Please note: No element of the work submitted for this assessment may appear in any other DP film
assessment (including the HL collaborative film project task).
Gathering evidence for assessment
During the two-year course, students must participate in a variety of original production activities in their
three chosen film production roles in order to generate numerous clips of evidence for this task. This
evidence may take the form of the following types of film material.
Evidence
Description
Exercises and experiments
These are the best clips from film exercises or experimental activities that
demonstrate proficiency in the production skills appropriate to each film
production role. The activities might have been initiated for the sake of training,
the improvement of skills or the discovery of something previously unrealized.
They may be undertaken without necessarily intending to create a completed film
or a finished product to be seen by an audience and can be teacher-led or initiated
by the student, as long as there is sufficient opportunity for creative exploration and student ownership.
Completed films and excerpts
These are completed projects that have all technical parts or elements in place
and are intended as either fully completed films or as excerpts from completed
films that are suitable for screening to an audience. As part of this assessment
task, students must submit at least one completed film (3 minutes in length
maximum) on which they have worked in one film production role. Completed
films submitted for assessment must not include credits, in order to ensure student
anonymity. The creation of completed films must not be teacher-led.
Working with others
Students may choose to work with other people in the creation of their film production work, or may work
independently if they wish. Students can choose to work collaboratively in production teams with fellow
students from their film class, with students from other film classes in the school, or with students in the
school who are not studying film. They can also choose to work with a combination of all three options.
Where production work is collaborative, all film production roles must be taken on by students from the
same school. Professionals or students from other schools may not be part of the production team.
Important: there must not be any duplication of film production roles within a production team.
That is, there should be only one cinematographer, only one director, and so on, in each group.
Where students choose to work with individuals who are not part of the DP film class, teachers must ensure
that they are able to regularly oversee production work and schedule consultations with the students to
ensure that they are able to verify the authenticity of the work being produced for assessment.
Actors appearing in production work may be adults or members of the wider community; however, teachers
must ensure that all of the appropriate safeguarding measures (as defined by the individual school) have
been taken when students are working with other adults.
Please note: No part of the work undertaken in this project can be used for the collaborative film project assessment task.

=== Page 66 ===
Internal assessment
Film guide 60
Structuring the portfolio pages
The portfolio pages should present an edited collection of key learning experiences intended to showcase the
filmmaker’s intentions, approach, planning work and development of skills in a variety of film production roles.
The portfolio pages (9 pages maximum: 3 pages maximum per film production role) provide documentary
evidence of the student’s work in each of the three roles undertaken during the task. They should clearly
articulate and provide evidence of the following processes.
•
Inquiry: the process of shaping their filmmaker intentions for each film production role in response
to the knowledge, insights and perspectives gained from research, including the conventions,
techniques, processes and responsibilities associated with each role. This also includes the significant
influences encountered during the film course and the student’s overarching expectations for their production work.
•
Action: the process of acquiring, applying and developing skills in each film production role, and an
account of their practical experiments, exercises and discoveries.
•
Reflection: The student’s reflection and evaluation on how the process of grappling with challenges,
experiences of success and the extent to which they have fulfilled their filmmaker intentions, led to a
deeper knowledge and understanding of each film production role.
The portfolio pages should contain a balance between written work and visual evidence, and are likely to
consist of annotated extracts from the student’s planning documentation (including excerpts from scripts,
storyboards and planning notes). The layout and word count for the portfolio pages are intentionally not
prescribed for this task in order to provide students with creative freedom in determining how best to present their explorations and findings.
The portfolio pages should contain a table of contents and a list of the clips submitted to evidence each
specific film production role (providing the timecode and a very brief description for each clip on the film
reel). These are excluded from the overall page count, as is the list of all sources used.
Supporting visual evidence
Students are encouraged to use diagrams, floor plans, images, sketches, screen-grabs or visuals that are
relevant to their chosen film production role in their portfolio pages. They may also include their own
photographs and images, as necessary, ensuring they are of an appropriate quality. All visual evidence must
directly link to the student’s developing understanding of each film production role and must be clearly
labelled and appropriately referenced to acknowledge the source, following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school.
Preparing the work for submission
The portfolio pages are assessed on screen and students must ensure that their work is clear and
legible when presented in a digital, on-screen format. The work should be created using a common
page size (A4 or US Letter) and be typed in a legible sans serif 12-point font. The portfolio pages may contain legible handwriting.
The film portfolio must not be labelled with the student’s name or include any credits in order to ensure anonymity in the marking process.

=== Page 67 ===
Internal assessment
Film guide 61
Structuring the film reel
Students are required to select clips of evidence from their gathered film production work in order to
assemble a film reel for assessment. The film reel is submitted to the IB as one single video file. It must
contain three chapters (one for each discrete film production role) and be structured as follows.
Film reel
Film production role 1
Film production role 2
Film production role 3
Black slate (10 seconds)
Black slate (10 seconds)
Black slate (10 seconds) 1–6 clips of evidence 1–6 clips of evidence 1 completed film (without credits)
Best evidence from exercises, experiments, completed films or excerpts in the role
Best evidence from exercises, experiments, completed films or excerpts in the role 3 minutes maximum (excluding black slate) 3 minutes maximum (excluding black slate) 3 minutes maximum (excluding black slate)
Students are strongly encouraged to submit multiple clips of evidence for film production roles 1 and 2,
as long as the combined material for each role does not exceed 3 minutes maximum. The recommended
minimum length of each clip is 30 seconds. Students must submit a completed film (without credits) for film production role 3.
Teachers should remind students that the clips of evidence submitted in the film reel should represent the
best work in each selected film production role and that the work will be judged on how it best fulfills the
assessment criteria for the task. Materials submitted that do not provide sufficient evidence of skill in the
selected production role will result in a compromised mark for that role.
Please note: there is a tension between the creative risk-taking encouraged in the taught syllabus
(Exploring film production roles) and the need for proficiency to be demonstrated in each film
production role within the film portfolio assessment task.
When selecting clips of evidence for their film reel, students may choose to include rough experimental
work completed during the course in order to demonstrate where they began with their exploration
of the chosen role. However, this evidence should also be accompanied by clips that also demonstrate
how students successfully resolved problems or overcame challenges encountered while developing
their skills in that role. These “resolved” clips of evidence should showcase their best work as it
developed during the course. Resolved work may include evidence from reshoots, retakes, re-edits,
rewrites or other filmed attempts that demonstrate deliberate and considered strategies to overcome
challenges associated with a specific role in order to develop proficient skills and techniques.
Alternatively, students may choose to submit only resolved or honed clips of evidence within the
film reel. Both approaches are equally acceptable in order to present the best evidence for each film production role.

Black slate
The film reel must be structured using a 10-second black slate (excluded from the total time limit), which is
placed before each of the three film production roles in order to identify each clip of evidence submitted per role and the length of each clip.

Use of non-original materials in the film reel
Students are expected to be the creators of the vast majority of audio-visual materials submitted for the film
portfolio assessment task. Students are, however, where deemed necessary by their filmmaker intentions,
permitted to submit some non-original materials within their film reels to accompany their own original work.
Defining non-original materials
Non-original materials are defined as any audio, visual or written materials that are not originally created
by the DP film student themselves, or that are not created through collaboration with other students in
the school. Non-original materials include material that is deemed to be copyright, Creative Commons, copyright-free, royalty-free, and so on.
Acknowledging the use of non-original material
In the film portfolio, non-original materials may be used within a student’s chosen film production role and/
or used outside of their chosen film production role.
All non-original materials used in a student’s film reel must be appropriately acknowledged, following the
protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school. Any non-original materials that are not recorded in
the submitted list of sources will be treated as a potential breach of academic honesty regulations and will
be investigated by the IB. This may result in a penalty being imposed by the IB final award committee.
Students choosing to use non-original materials within a specific film production role must explain how the
non-original materials have been creatively integrated into their work in the body of the portfolio pages.
Creative integration
Creative integration refers to the selection, curation, manipulation, and/or alteration of the non-original
materials, in order to effectively adjust and/or incorporate the materials into the film reel. The inclusion of
non-original materials in the film portfolio is intended to help to support the effectiveness of the student’s
own original work, in line with their filmmaker intentions. Non-original materials must not be used as a
substitute for student creativity. Thus, any decision to incorporate non-original material within a chosen film
production role must be clearly linked to filmmaker intentions, and the explanation of how the materials
have been creatively integrated is likely to include consideration of how and why these materials were
required, the methods, techniques and/or processes undertaken to integrate them, and the ways in which
these have helped fulfill the stated filmmaker intentions.

=== Page 69 ===
Internal assessment
Film guide 63
Limiting the use of non-original material
While there is no defined limit on the amount of non-original material a student may use in a submitted
film reel, students are strongly reminded that assessors expect the majority of audio-visual materials to
be created by the students themselves, and the over use of non-original material in the film reel is likely to
be self-penalizing. Likewise, the explanations required in the portfolio pages for the excessive use of non original material are likely to limit the discussion of other important matters related to a student’s creative
choices and their overarching filmmaker intentions.
Please note: Submitted materials that include non-original materials within a chosen film production
role that lack creative integration into the student’s own work may be self-penalizing in criterion B.
See below for further guidance.
Non-original materials that are within the scope of a film production role
The following table provides examples of non-original materials that would be considered to be within the
scope of a chosen film production role. Students choosing to use non-original materials when working in
these roles must also explain how the non-original materials have been creatively integrated into their
work in the body of the portfolio pages. Students who are not being assessed for these specific roles are
free to use non-original materials, without evaluating their use, so long as they are appropriately referenced
in the submitted list of sources. Please note this list is not exhaustive and there may be other materials that
may reasonably be considered within the scope of a role.

Academic honesty
All sources must be acknowledged following the protocol of the standard referencing style chosen by the school.
•
If a student uses work, ideas or images belonging to another person when writing up the film portfolio
pages, the student must acknowledge the source in a consistent manner.
•
A student’s failure to acknowledge a source will be investigated by the IB as a potential breach of
regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.
The role of the teacher
Teachers must ensure that their students are appropriately prepared for the demands of this task through
the careful planning and delivery of the “Exploring film production roles” core syllabus area. Only specific
elements of this task may be teacher-led, and students should be made fully aware of the assessment
criteria against which their work will be judged. Exercises and experiments that are led by the teacher
must still demonstrate student initiative and voice. The teacher should stress the importance of risk taking, trial and error, and the value of failure in developing the skills required for the film portfolio.
Teachers are required to meet with students at each stage of inquiry, action and reflection to discuss the
progress made to date, and to verify the authenticity of the coursework being created by each student.
The key outcomes of these one-to-one interactions, which might be formal meetings and/or informal
discussions in the classroom, must be summarized by the teacher on the DP film Coursework authentication
form (6/FCAF), which is submitted to the IB as part of the upload of assessment material.
While students are working on this assessment task, the teacher should:
•
discuss with each student their filmmaker intentions, influences, exploration with techniques, as
well as ethical considerations and the age-appropriateness of the subject matter •
ensure that students work in three separate roles over the duration of the two-year course •
assist with sourcing and maintaining the necessary technical hardware and software to enable
students to effectively work in a variety of film production roles and to facilitate the student’s
assembly of their film portfolio. It is important that the submitted exercises, experiments, completed
films and excerpts from completed films and accompanying portfolio pages are the student’s own
choice and offer the opportunity for creative exploration •
remind students that their work will be assessed on how it best fulfills the assessment criteria for the
task, and not judged on how many clips or portfolio pages are submitted •
ensure each student acknowledges all sources used throughout the film portfolio and includes them
in the list of sources (which is excluded from the page count) • give feedback on one draft of the film portfolio •
meet with students at each stage of inquiry, action and reflection to discuss the progress made to date
and to verify the authenticity of the work being created by each student •
authenticate the completed film portfolio and provide comments on each student’s submission to assist with moderation.

Formal requirements of the task
Each student submits a film portfolio for assessment, containing the following.
a.
Portfolio pages (9 pages maximum: 3 pages per film production role) and a list of all sources used.
b.
A film reel (9 minutes maximum: 3 minutes maximum per film production role).
The procedure for submitting the assessment materials can be found in Diploma Programme Assessment procedures.
Students should be informed that where the submitted materials exceed the maximum page and
time limits for each film production role within the film portfolio, moderators will only assess the
work that falls within the prescribed limits. Submitted work must not contain any appendices as these will not be read by moderators.

Textual analysis (SL and HL)
SL 30%, HL 20%
Introduction
Students at both SL and HL demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of how meaning is constructed
in film. They do this through a written analysis of a prescribed film text, based on a chosen extract (lasting
no more than five minutes) from that film. Students consider the cultural context of the film and a variety
of film elements in their analysis, which is written using appropriate film vocabulary.
Each student submits the following for assessment.
a.
A written textual analysis (1,750 words maximum) and a list of all sources used.
Terminology
Cultural context
For this assessment task, cultural context involves consideration of some of the following factors,
some of which may be blended (such as socio-economic factors). Cultural context can relate to the
time period depicted in the film and/or the time period of the film’s production, as appropriate.
•
Economic •
Geographical •
Historical •
Institutional •
Political •
Social •
Technological
Film elements
For this assessment task, film elements may include, but are not limited to, the following.
•
Cinematography (such as camera placement, colour, composition, exposure, framing, focus scale, movement, shot type, and so on) •
Critical response and reception •
Editing (such as continuity, cut, dissolve, match, montage, pace, transition, and so on) •
Filmmakers’ influences, intentions and vision •
Genre, codes and conventions •
Mise-en-scène (such as acting and figure behaviour, art direction, costume and make up, décor, lighting, set and setting, space, and so on) •
Motifs, symbols and themes •
Narrative structure •
Sound (such as dialogue, sound editing, sound effects and Foley, soundtrack and music or score, diegetic and non-diegetic, and so on)

Film guide 70
Preparation process
Selecting a film text •
The IB releases a prescribed list of 10 films each year in the September edition of the DP Coordinators notes.
•
The list is valid for two years for each individual year group of students.
•
Teachers select three to five film texts from the prescribed list for each DP film class they teach.
Teachers must ensure that the films they select are not studied in class at any point during the two year course, so it is advised that teachers familiarize themselves with the list as soon as it is released
and make any necessary adjustments to their planning.
•
Teachers share the titles of the three to five selected film texts with their students one month before
the task is due to be submitted to the teacher. While the selected film texts cannot be studied in depth
in class, a collective screening of the selected films is considered an appropriate way of ensuring that
students have access to the films and to enable them to make their final choices.
•
Each student chooses one film text from those selected by the teacher before undertaking the
process for assessment outlined below. The chosen film text must not have been previously studied
by the student and, once selected, the chosen film text cannot be used by the student in any other
assessment task for the DP film course or the extended essay.
Assessment process
In preparation for this task, students at SL and HL must have undertaken the activities outlined within
the “Reading film” section as part of the core syllabus. Students then undertake the following process for assessment.
Inquiry •
Each student identifies an extract from the chosen film text for analysis. The extract may be up to five
minutes in length and must be a single, continuous sequence of the film.
•
Each student carries out research into the chosen film text. This research should include consideration
of the cultural context of the chosen film text as well as a variety of film elements identified by the student.
•
Each student carries out a detailed analysis of the selected extract, paying particular attention to how
meaning is constructed through the use of a variety of film elements (defined above) and formulating their own interpretations.
•
Each student considers how a selection of the identified film elements in the selected extract relate
to the cultural context of the film, to the film text as a whole and, where appropriate, to other films, as identified by the student.
Action •
As a result of the inquiry process, each student completes a written analysis of the chosen film text
and extract (1,750 words maximum) using relevant and accurate film vocabulary. Each student may
incorporate supporting visual evidence where relevant and appropriate.
Reflection •
Each student reflects on the learning undertaken in this task in order to review and refine their textual analysis ahead of submission.

=== Page 77 ===
External assessment
Film guide 71
Task details
The textual analysis (1,750 words maximum) is intended to be a formalist exercise rather than a thesis-driven
essay. The focus of the work should be on how meaning is conveyed through the use of film elements in
the chosen film text, with consideration of the cultural context of the film and communicated through the
use of relevant and accurate film vocabulary common to the study of film and appropriate for film analysis.
In this task, the examiner is looking for evidence of the extent to which the student is able to demonstrate
an understanding of:
•
the cultural context of the chosen film text, making reference to relevant research that relates to the selected film and comes from appropriate sources •
how the chosen extract from the film makes use of film elements to convey meaning in the chosen
film. This work is supported by the appropriate use of relevant film vocabulary •
how the cultural context of the film and a selection of identified film elements in the selected extract relate to each other •
how identified film elements in the selected extract relate to the chosen film text as a whole. This
might also feasibly include, where appropriate, relationships to other film texts.
Students should begin the textual analysis by clearly stating the film text they have chosen, the extract they
will be analysing and the specific film elements they are going to discuss.
The textual analysis should be structured to reflect the balance demonstrated by the weighting of each assessment criterion.
The list of all sources used is excluded from the textual analysis word limit.
Supporting visual material
Students may use carefully selected and relevant illustrations such as screen-grabs, visuals or annotated
diagrams to support their analysis of the chosen film text. Screen-grabs from the chosen film are permitted
in this assessment task, as long as the images are clearly referenced and the work is not distributed outside
the IB. All supporting visual material must be clearly labelled and appropriately referenced to acknowledge
the source, following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school. The labels, which are
excluded from the final word limit of the textual analysis, should contain the minimum information needed
to ensure the examiner understands the significance of the illustration. Labels must not include commentary,
as this will be considered as part of the textual analysis discussion and therefore included in the word count.
Preparing the work for submission
The textual analysis should adopt a formal, academic register and may be written in the first person,
reflecting the student’s personal opinion and reaction, where appropriate.
The finished textual analysis will be submitted online and students must ensure that their work is clear and
legible when presented in a digital, on-screen format. The textual analysis should be constructed using a
common page size (A4 or US Letter) and be typed in a legible sans serif 12-point font. Students must state
the number of words used at the end of the textual analysis.
The textual analysis must not be labelled with the student’s name in order to ensure anonymity in the marking process.

Film guide 72
Academic honesty and in-text citation
All sources must be acknowledged following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school.
•
If a student uses work, ideas or images belonging to another person in the textual analysis, the student
must acknowledge the source as an in-text citation.
•
Students must also submit a separate list of these sources using a standard style of referencing in a consistent manner.
•
A student’s failure to appropriately acknowledge a source will be investigated by the IB as a potential
breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.
Further information about citations can be found in the IB’s Effective citing and referencing guide.
The role of the teacher
Teachers must ensure that their students are appropriately prepared for the demands of this task through
the careful planning and delivery of the “Reading film” core syllabus areas.
Teachers are required to meet with students at each stage of inquiry, action and reflection to discuss the
progress made to date, and to verify the authenticity of the coursework being created by each student.
The key outcomes of these one-to-one interactions, which might be formal meetings and/or informal
discussions in the classroom, must be summarized by the teacher on the DP film Coursework authentication
form (6/FCAF), which is submitted to the IB as part of the upload of assessment material.
The teacher should also:
•
ensure that the selected film has not been studied by the student before and that it is not used in any
other assessment task for the DP film course or the extended essay •
ensure that students acknowledge all sources used, reference them as in-text citations appropriately
throughout the textual analysis and include them in the list of sources (which is excluded from the word limit) •
give feedback on one draft of the written textual analysis. Please note that the drafting and redrafting
of the textual analysis in response to teacher feedback is not permitted •
make students aware that the relative weights of the marks for each criterion (8/12/8) should be used as
an approximate guide for how much attention should be devoted to the requirements of each criterion •
encourage each student to reflect on their learning and experiences associated with this task.
Formal requirements of the task
Each student submits the following for assessment.
a.
A written textual analysis (1,750 words maximum) and a list of all sources used.
The procedure for submitting the assessment materials can be found in Diploma Programme Assessment procedures.
Students should be informed that where the submitted materials exceed the maximum word limit
for the textual analysis, examiners will only assess the work that falls within the prescribed limits.
Submitted work must not contain any appendices as these will not be read by examiners.

Comparative study (SL and HL)
SL 30%, HL 20%
Introduction
Students at SL and HL carry out research into a chosen area of film focus, identifying and comparing two
films from within that area and presenting their discoveries as a recorded multimedia comparative study.
Each student submits the following for assessment.
a.
A recorded multimedia comparative study (10 minutes maximum).
b.
A list of all sources used.
Terminology
Film focus
For this task, students select an area of film focus that interests and excites them from one of the following.
•
Film movements (such as French New Wave, German expressionism, Third Cinema, and so on) •
Film genre and film style (such as film noir, romantic comedy, science fiction, Western, and so on) •
Film theory (such as auteur theory, feminist film theory, Marxist film theory, and so on)
Cultural context
For this assessment task, cultural context involves consideration of some of the following factors,
some of which may be blended (such as socio-economic factors). Cultural context can relate to the
time period depicted in the film and/or the time period of the film’s production, as appropriate.
•
Economic •
Geographical •
Historical •
Institutional •
Political •
Social •
Technological
Preparation process
The early stages of this task require students to carry out research into film concepts, theories, practices and
ideas that interest and excite them, and that will ensure maximum potential for meeting the needs of the
assessment task criteria. From this research, they identify the task components for a recorded multimedia comparative study.

=== Page 83 ===
External assessment
Film guide 77
Terminology
Task components
For this assessment task, each student identifies, selects and researches each of the following task components.
1.
One area of film focus (from the list above).
2.
Two films for comparison from within the chosen area of film focus, one of which originates
from a contrasting time (historical) or space (geographical) to the personal context of the
student, and the other film identified for comparison must arise from a contrasting cultural
context to the first film. Students are required to select films they have not previously studied
in depth. The selected films cannot come from the prescribed list of film texts provided for the
textual analysis assessment task and, once selected, the films cannot be used by the student in
any other assessment task for the DP film course or the extended essay.
3.
A clearly defined topic for a recorded multimedia comparative study, which links both the
selected films and the identified area of film focus. Each student should invest time in
researching, developing and honing their topic (which in most cases is likely to be expressed
in the form of a research question) to ensure it is clear, focused and concise, in order to provide
them with the maximum potential for success in this task. The topic should seek to enrich
the student’s understanding of the chosen area of film focus and should avoid a plot-driven approach to comparison.
The assessment criteria for this task requires students to provide a strong justification for the choice of
task components as part of the recorded multimedia comparative study, explaining the reasons why
they have chosen the films, focus, and cultural context and why they are appropriate for study. This
should also include the student’s justification for how the films arise from contrasting cultural contexts.
Assessment process
In preparation for this task, students at SL and HL must have undertaken the activities outlined within the
“Contextualizing film” section as part of the core syllabus. Students then undertake the following process for assessment.
Inquiry •
Each student carries out broad research, using both primary and secondary sources, in order to
investigate possible areas of film focus and films for comparison from within the areas of film focus,
using materials from a range of sources, including original films, critiques, publications and other
media. While students may find it useful to source some information from informal film fan websites
they should seek to extend their research beyond casual reviews and opinions to include sources of
academic criticism, film history and other scholarly analysis.
•
Each student decides the selection of the task components, which includes a clearly defined topic
for the comparative study (which in most cases is likely to be expressed in the form of a research
question). Each student defines the cultural context of the selected films and justifies why these task components were chosen for the comparative study.
•
Each student undergoes a process of comparing and contrasting their selected films (and carrying out
further focused research into the task components) in order to deepen their understanding of each
film. It is likely that the student will consider the ways in which film elements work together to convey
meaning in their analysis of how the selected films compare and contrast.

=== Page 84 ===
External assessment
Film guide 78
Action •
Each student assembles their findings, developing a personal and critically reflective perspective, and
identifies and gathers appropriate audio-visual material to support the study.
•
As a result of the inquiry and action processes outlined above, each student prepares a recorded
multimedia comparative study (10 minutes maximum) for submission, ensuring a balance between
visual and spoken elements, while making clear reference to their sources as on-screen citations. The
primary weight of evidence for the study should be selected from the two chosen films, which should be given equal consideration.
•
The resulting work should demonstrate the student’s engagement with both primary research (the
viewing and analysing of significant moments in the chosen films) and secondary research (developing
a balanced academic perspective), enabling the student to present a synthesis of their own research
and their discoveries in terms of critical, academic, and technical research.
Reflection •
Students reflect on the learning undertaken in this task, and review and refine their comparative study ahead of submission.
Task details
The comparative study is a recorded multimedia presentation (10 minutes maximum) comprising sound and
images. The selection and assembly of the material for submission is an important aspect of the task, and students
should ensure that information is communicated clearly, logically and audibly in a visually appropriate manner.
In this task, the examiner is looking for evidence of the extent to which students are able to demonstrate an understanding of the following.
•
The task components selected for the study (the area of film focus, two films and the topic), which
should include the cultural context of the selected films and a justification of why these components
were chosen for the comparative study. Students should be explicit with their justification, clearly
explaining why the task components have been selected for this assessment task and why they are appropriate for study.
•
The links that exist between the selected films, as well as the student’s ability to identify connections,
similarities and differences while relating these back to the chosen area of film focus. It is likely
that the student will consider the ways in which film elements work together to convey meaning
in their analysis of how the selected films compare and contrast. Students should ensure they give
equal weight to both of the films selected for study in their analysis. The work should be supported
throughout with accurate and appropriate film vocabulary.
•
How to effectively construct a comparative study in order to present the work undertaken clearly,
logically and in a visually appropriate manner. The study should be supported by a suitable range of relevant sources.
Recorded commentary
The comparative study must contain a recording of the student’s voice throughout, introducing the study and
justifying the chosen topic and selected films, as well as providing the commentary for the main body of the
work. This voiced commentary may be recorded numerous times until the student is happy with the material.
Students may also, if they choose, use a pre-written script (which must be the student’s own work) to be read,
recorded and edited into the comparative study. They may also include breaks in their recorded commentary
to enable other audio-visual material included in the study to be clearly heard, and likewise should reduce the
volume of audio-visual material during the recorded commentary to ensure it is entirely audible.
Please note: The student must not appear on screen at any time in the comparative study.

Use of audio-visual material and copyright
On-screen text, keynote slides, still images, animations, audio recordings and carefully selected and relevant
clips from the selected films are all permitted within the comparative study, where appropriate. The primary
weight of audio-visual evidence must come from the two chosen films and the student’s recorded voice,
which should be recorded in isolation to reduce any additional background noise. While the length of film
clips a student can use is not dictated, the clip length should directly match the specific point being made by the student in the recorded commentary.
•
Each student must use legal copies of their two chosen films in order to extract the video or audio
content for editing into the comparative study. Once the final comparative study has been submitted
for assessment to the IB, each student must ensure that the extracted media files are destroyed.
•
Students must be aware that their work is solely for academic purposes and that they are not permitted
to share or distribute any copyright-protected content used in the comparative study outside of the IB
without the express written consent of the copyright holder(s).
•
Students are required to clearly reference the two chosen films in the submitted list of sources.
•
It is the responsibility of the student to obtain, extract and delete any copyright materials used for this task.
Black slate
The comparative study must begin with a 10-second black slate (included in the total time limit) that clearly
states the chosen task components using on-screen text. The student’s recorded commentary, which
begins simultaneously with the black slate, should address the justification of these task components.
Task components •
Area of film focus •
Titles of the two films for comparison •
The chosen topic

An example black slate for the comparative study
Preparing the work for submission
The comparative study should adopt a formal, academic register and may be delivered in the first person, as
appropriate, presenting the student’s personal opinion and perspective as a film student.
The finished comparative study will be submitted online. Students must ensure that their recorded voiceover
is clear and audible, and that any text is legible when viewed on screen. Overcrowded or inaudible materials
may result in examiners being unable to interpret and understand the intentions of the work, which will
result in the examiner being unable to reward the full scope of the work. Where appropriate, students may use subtitles to facilitate understanding.
The comparative study must not be labelled with the student’s name in order to ensure anonymity in the marking process.

Further examples of possible task components can be found in the Film teacher support material.
Academic honesty and on-screen citation
All sources must be acknowledged following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school.
•
If a student uses work, ideas or images belonging to another person in the comparative study, the
student must acknowledge the source as an on-screen citation during the submitted multimedia
study, either as a voiced reference as part of the recorded commentary or as on-screen text.
•
Students must also submit a separate list of these sources using a standard style of referencing in a consistent manner.
•
A student’s failure to appropriately acknowledge a source used in the recorded multimedia
comparative study (as outlined in the “Use of audio-visual material and copyright” section), will be
investigated by the IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the
IB final award committee.
Further information about citations can be found in the IB’s Effective citing and referencing guide.
The role of the teacher
Teachers must ensure that their students are prepared for the demands of this task through the careful
planning and delivery of the “Contextualizing film” core syllabus areas.
It is important for students to have exposure to a range of film movements, genres, styles and
theories as part of the taught content of the DP film course in order to enable them to approach
this assessment task with a broad foundation in the subject area. Teachers are reminded that films
previously studied in depth may not be used by students for this assessment.

=== Page 87 ===
External assessment
Film guide 81
Teachers are required to meet with students at each stage of inquiry, action and reflection to discuss the
progress made to date, and to verify the authenticity of the coursework being created by each student.
The key outcomes of these one-to-one interactions, which might be formal meetings and/or informal
discussions in the classroom, must be summarized by the teacher on the DP film Coursework authentication
form, which is submitted to the IB as part of the upload of external assessment material.
The teacher should also:
•
discuss each student’s choice of task components (the area of film focus, two films and topic),
encouraging them to engage with films that contrast with the student’s own personal context in
terms of time (historical) and space (geographical). It is important that the two selected films are
authentically identified and chosen by the student and not by the teacher •
ensure that the two films chosen for comparison have not been studied by the student before and
that they are not used by the student in any other assessment task for the DP film course or the extended essay •
ensure that students are equipped to carry out film research using books, online sources and other
academic reference material and that they acknowledge all sources used and reference them as on screen citations appropriately throughout the comparative study, as well as including them in the separate list of sources •
assist students with setting up the necessary technical hardware and software to enable the
recording of the student’s voiceover and facilitate the student’s assembly of their chosen visual and audio components •
give verbal or written feedback to one draft version of the recorded multimedia comparative
study. Please note that the drafting and redrafting of the work in response to teacher feedback is not permitted •
encourage each student to reflect on their learning and experiences associated with this task •
make students aware that the relative weights of the marks for each criterion (12/12/8) should be
used as an approximate guide for how much attention should be devoted to the requirements of each criterion.
Formal requirements of the task
Each student submits the following for assessment.
a.
A recorded multimedia comparative study (10 minutes maximum).
b.
A list of all sources used.
The procedure for submitting the assessment materials can be found in Diploma Programme Assessment procedures.
Students should be informed that where the submitted materials exceed the maximum time limit
for the comparative study, examiners will only assess the work that falls within the prescribed limits.
Materials that fall under the minimum time limit are likely to be self-penalising. Submitted work must
not contain any appendices as these will not be read by examiners.

Collaborative film project (HL only)
HL 35%
Introduction
Bringing together all they have encountered during the film course (including films and filmmakers encountered,
concepts and contexts explored, and skills and techniques acquired), students at HL work collaboratively to plan
and create an original completed film. Students work in core production teams of two to four students for this
project, with each individual writing a project report that justifies the creative choices made in order to convey
meaning in one film production role and reflects on their collaborative contribution to the project.
The main focus of this task is on the nature of collaboration throughout the creative process and on the
individual student’s ability to support and effectively contribute to the successful realization of the group’s agreed intentions.
Each student submits the following.
a.
A completed cover sheet.
b.
A completed film (7 minutes maximum).
c.
A project report (2,000 words maximum) and a list of all sources used.
Terminology
Core production team
For the purposes of this assessment task, students are required to work collaboratively as part of core
production teams of two to four students from within the school community. Students can choose
to work collaboratively with other DP film students from the same class (including SL students), with
students from the school who are not part of the DP film course (including film students in the year
below or students who are not taking DP film) or a mix of both. The core production team is fully
responsible for defining the scope of the original film and for ensuring that all creative and logistical
aspects of pre-production, production and post-production are carried out successfully.
While each student in the group will take on one single film production role (defined below) it is expected
that, as members of the core production team, each student will take on numerous other responsibilities
and tasks during the project in order to support the cooperative realization of the completed film. This
flexible and supportive collaboration is central to this assessment task and each student should keep
a record of the nature of their collaborations. They should reflect on their approaches to team work,
problem-solving, time management and conflict resolution as a member of the core production team,
and should evaluate the successes and challenges encountered as part of the creative process.
Film production roles
For the purposes of this assessment task, students must take responsibility for one of the following
film production roles (one discrete role per student in the group, with no duplication of roles in the team) for which they will be assessed.
•
Cinematographer •
Director •
Editor •
Sound •
Writer
Please note: The “one other clearly defined film production role not specified above” that appears
in the film portfolio assessment task is not available as an option for this HL task.

=== Page 93 ===
External assessment
Film guide 87
Preparation process
In preparation for this task, HL students should reflect on their own personal experiences, interests and
skills in film. This is essentially an audit of the experiences of the DP film course to date, and a process of
identifying where each individual is at the start of the project, and what they are able to bring to the task.
Students then use the outcome of this process to support the formation of the core production teams and
the sharing of ideas in order to formulate a plan for an original film.
Assessment process
In preparation for this task, students at HL must have undertaken the activities outlined within the
“Collaboratively producing film” section of the core syllabus. Students then undertake the following process for assessment.
Inquiry •
Each student joins a core production team, making a group of two to four students from the school
community. Each member of the core production team discusses the contexts within which they
will work, developing an overall framework for their original film (which is inspired by research),
considering both theoretical approaches, such as genre and style, as well as practical considerations.
•
Each core production team collaboratively creates a production plan for an original film. The group
also clearly articulate their agreed intentions for the film.
•
Each core production team seeks approval for the plan for filming from the teacher. Once approved,
each student begins planning their involvement in the production, including the selection of their one film production role.
Action •
Each core production team collaboratively engages in the pre-production, production and post production phases in order to produce the completed film (7 minutes maximum).
•
Each student carries out their one film production role, making considered creative choices and
deploying their skills in order to convey meaning and contribute to the overall effectiveness of the film.
•
Each student is expected to participate in all three phases of production regardless of the individual
film production role they have taken for assessment purposes, in order to help fulfill the identified intentions of the group.
Reflection •
Each core production team collaboratively writes a logline for the completed film (articulated in 50
words or less) which provides a very brief summary of the film.
•
Each student reflects on the creation of the original film and on the creative choices they made
in their one film production role in order to convey meaning. They also reflect on the process of
collaboration and the successes and challenges encountered as a member of the core production
team in attempting to fulfil the agreed intentions of the group.
•
Each student documents and presents their reflections on the completed collaborative film project as a 2,000 word (maximum) project report.

=== Page 94 ===
External assessment
Film guide 88
Task details
The original film created by each core production team should be a maximum of 7 minutes in length. The
completed film submitted for assessment must not include credits, in order to ensure student anonymity.
Please note: each student is strongly encouraged to select a film production role for which they
have already gained some experience and skill (through research into industry expectations for the
role, engagement with exercises and experiments and through trial and error during the production
phases). If a student does not have experience in the film production role they choose it is expected
that they will gain the relevant experience and essential skills necessary before commencing work in
the HL collaborative film project assessment task.
In this task, the moderator is looking for evidence of the extent to which students are able to:
•
demonstrate skills in their one chosen film production role to successfully contribute to the overall effectiveness of the completed film •
justify the creative choices made in order to convey meaning in the completed film in their one chosen film production role •
reflect on the process of collaboration and the successes and challenges encountered as members of
the core production team in attempting to fulfill the intentions of the group.
Ethical filmmaking
DP film students should be supported in maintaining an ethical perspective during their course.
Schools must be vigilant to ensure that work undertaken by the student is appropriate for the
context of the school and the age of the students.
Student work for this assessment task must not:
• damage the environment • glamorize the taking of drugs • inappropriately reference socially taboo subjects • incite or condone intolerance or hatred of others • include excessive or gratuitous violence •
make reference to, or represent, explicit sexual activity.
Working with others
Only students from the school are permitted to be members of the core production team. These can be
DP film students (including SL students) or other students from the school who are not part of the course
(including film students in the year below or students who are not taking DP film), as long as the size of the
core production team is between two and four students. Each member of the core production team
must have one discrete film production role from the list provided.
Where students choose to form core production teams with individuals who are not part of the DP film
class, teachers must ensure that they are able to regularly observe team meetings, monitor production work
and schedule consultations with the students to ensure that they are able to verify the authenticity of the work being produced for assessment.

=== Page 95 ===
External assessment
Film guide 89
Core production teams are permitted to enlist the help of other people in the creation of their original
films, such as production assistants, actors and crew members, so long as all key decision-making is still
made by the two to four members of the core production team. These additional individuals (with the
exception of actors) must be students from the same school. Actors may be adults or members of the wider
community; however, teachers must ensure that all of the appropriate safeguarding measures (as defined
by the individual school) have been taken when students are working with other adults.
Please note: No part of the work undertaken in this project can be used for the film portfolio
assessment task by any HL students involved in the project. Likewise, work undertaken for the film
portfolio assessment task cannot be submitted for this HL task. SL students who volunteer to be
involved in the project, however, are permitted to evidence their work in a clearly defined film
production role for assessment purposes in the film portfolio task.
Black slate
The completed film must include a 10-second black slate (placed before the film and excluded from the
total time limit) to enable the assessor to identify the title of the film, the logline (articulated in 50 words or
less) and the one film production role taken by the student.
Name of film
Logline (articulated in 50 words or less)
Film production role taken by the student
Figure 4
An example of the layout for the black slate
Cover sheet
A cover sheet is provided by the IB for this task and a completed cover sheet must be submitted for each
student as part of the upload materials. Failure to submit the cover sheet will result in the work not
being marked. The cover sheet records the following information for this task.
•
The number of students in the core production team and the film production roles taken.
•
A clear statement of the core production team’s agreed intentions for the film (200 words or less).
•
A clear statement explaining how any music that appears in the film was created (in 200 words or less)
—this statement may be collaboratively written and shared between all students in the group.
Core production teams who decide against using music in their film must indicate this by checking the appropriate box.
•
The length of the completed film.
Please note: By submitting the cover sheet, students certify that all audio and visual materials
submitted in the completed film are entirely original and have been created by the core production
team or through collaboration with other students in the school.

Film guide 90
Structuring the project report
The project report (2,000 words) is a written account of the student’s involvement in the collaborative film
project. The project report should contain a table of contents (excluded from the word count), which should
also clearly state the number of words the student has used. The list of all sources used is also excluded from the word limit.
Students should order their project report using the following headings, giving equal weight to each area.
1.
Creative work in my one film production role
Work in this section of the film report should include the student’s justification of the creative choices
made in order to convey meaning in the completed film in their one chosen film production role.
Discussion is likely to evidence the creative work undertaken during the pre-production, production and
post-production phases and the ways in which their production skills, techniques and/or approaches were
effectively deployed in order to convey meaning and to contribute to the overall effectiveness of the film.
2.
Collaboration with my core production team
Each student must include a clear statement of the core production team’s agreed intentions for the
film on the submitted cover sheet. This statement should be identical for each member of the core production team.
Work in this section of the film report should include the student’s reflection on the successes and
the challenges of participation in the core production team and involve discussion on the ways in
which their collaborations helped to fulfill the agreed intentions of the group (even if their team’s
intentions were not necessarily fulfilled). Discussion is likely to evidence the student’s work beyond the
one chosen film production role and their approaches to effective group work, including (but not
limited to):
– approaches to effective group work – giving and receiving constructive feedback – managing time – problem-solving – resolving conflict – supporting others – working flexibly, reliably and responsibly.
Reflecting on collaboration does not mean that students should see this as an opportunity to
complain, blame or criticize the role of other core production team members.
Throughout this section of the report students should cite informative moments and examples from
within the completed film to evidence their contributions and to support their reasoning.
Supporting visual evidence
Students should use carefully selected and relevant diagrams, floor plans, images, sketches, screen-grabs or
visuals considered necessary in the project report. They may also include their own photographs and images
as necessary, ensuring they are of an appropriate quality. All visual evidence must be clearly labelled and
appropriately referenced to acknowledge the source, following the protocol of the referencing style chosen
by the school. The labels, which are excluded from the final word limit of the project report, should contain
the minimum information to ensure the examiner understands the significance of the visual evidence.
Supporting visual evidence and labels must not include commentary, as this will be considered as part of
the project report discussion and therefore be included in the word count.

=== Page 97 ===
External assessment
Film guide 91
Preparing the work for submission
The project report is assessed on screen so students must ensure that their work is clear and legible when
presented in a digital, on-screen format. The project report should be created using a common page size (A4
or US Letter) and be typed in a legible sans-serif 12-point font. The work may also contain legible handwriting.
The collaborative film project work must not be labelled with the student’s name or include any
credits in order to ensure anonymity in the marking process.
Use of non-original materials in the completed film
Students are expected to be the creators of all audio-visual materials submitted for the collaborative film
project assessment task. Therefore, the submitted film must not contain any non-original materials.
Defining non-original materials
Non-original materials are defined as any audio, visual or written materials that are not originally created
by the DP film students themselves, or that are not created through collaboration with other students in
the school. Non-original materials include material that is deemed to be copyright, Creative Commons, copyright-free, royalty-free, and so on.
As a differentiating standalone HL assessment task, the collaborative film project is a self-contained
summative project that is designed to reward authentic collaboration, innovative problem-solving and
creative meaning-making in one film production role over 90 hours. Thus, the script and all visual and
audio materials contained in each completed film must be original and have been specifically created and
captured for the assessment task by one or more of the DP film students participating in the core production
team, or through collaboration with other students in the school.
Due to the restrictions on non-original materials, students are prohibited from creating documentaries
that rely on non-original/archive footage in this assessment task.
Use of music in the completed film
Students should be reminded that they are being assessed for one specific film production role and that the
focus of their production work should be on creating meaning using the core tools and skills associated with
that role. As the role of composer is outside any of the permitted film production roles for this assessment
task, the inclusion or omission of music in a completed film will have a limited impact on an individual
student’s assessment. As such, there is no expectation for submitted films to contain any music.
Creating original music for a completed film
Where core production teams collaboratively agree to create and include music in their films, students will
need to be creative problem-solvers in order to generate entirely original music. It is important to ensure
that the examiner is fully aware of how any music used in the film was sourced and created, in line with the outlined policy.
Please note: Although various members of the core production team may choose to collaborate in the
process of recording, producing and editing original music for the film, the ultimate responsibility for
composing music falls firmly outside the responsibility of any of the permitted film production roles
for this task. As such, any detailed discussion about the composition of music is most likely to appear in
section 2 of the project report, under the heading “Collaboration with my core production team”.

=== Page 98 ===
External assessment
Film guide 92
The following table outlines the only approved approaches to the creation of music and the necessary evidence required for assessment.
Approved approaches to creating original music
Compulsory evidence required for assessment
Optional evidence for inclusion in the project report
Collaborating with student musician(s) from the school to create original music specifically for the film.
Every student in the group must include a statement on the cover sheet explaining how the music was created.
•
All students in the core production team may choose to discuss how they collaboratively agreed to use music in the film.
•
Any students involved in the recording, production and/or editing of the music within their film production role should discuss their involvement in this process in section 1 of the project report.
•
Any students involved in the composition of the music may choose to discuss their involvement in this area in section 2 of the project report.
Members of the core production team working together to create their own original music specifically for the film.
Every student in the group must include a statement on the cover sheet explaining how the music was created.
•
Any students involved in the recording, production and/or editing of the music within their film production role should discuss their involvement in this process in section 1 of the project report.
•
Any students involved in the composition of the music may choose to discuss their involvement in this area in section 2 of the project report.
Background images and situational branding
Students should make every effort, where achievable, to avoid capturing situational or incidental advertising or branding in their films.
In some instances, it is inevitable that pre-existing media or props will be captured “in-camera” by the
students. Common examples include depictions of characters interacting with mise-en-scène props, or
scrolling through digital screens displaying existing websites, apps, games, maps and so on. The inclusion of
these instances of in-camera media and location-based sounds in a completed film will not be penalized by
an examiner; however, students are expected to make every effort to ensure their original films do not rely
on extended depictions of pre-existing media. Students should work consciously to be creative problem solvers and devise innovative solutions to depicting extended sequences of content of this kind within a film’s narrative.
The deliberate inclusion of pre-existing media into a film’s edit (for example, intentionally adding
materials that were not captured in-camera during post-production) is not permitted.

=== Page 99 ===
External assessment
Film guide 93
Academic honesty
All sources must be acknowledged following the protocol of the referencing style chosen by the school.
•
If a student uses work, ideas or images belonging to another person when writing up the project report,
the student must acknowledge the source using a standard style of referencing in a consistent manner.
•
A student’s failure to acknowledge a source will be investigated by the IB as a potential breach of
regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.
The role of the teacher
Teachers must use sound judgment as to how much assistance or support can be provided, remembering at
all times that this is a student-oriented task. In general, teacher assistance in work intended for assessment
should be confined to asking questions, making suggestions and offering technical guidance. The situation
is comparable to a teacher commenting on a draft of an essay, offering pointers for ways to improve the
work but refraining from doing any of that work for the student.
Teachers must ensure that their students are appropriately prepared for the demands of this task through
the careful planning and delivery of the “Collaboratively producing film” core syllabus activities. This
assessment task must not be teacher-led and students should be made fully aware of the assessment criteria against which their work will be judged.
Teachers are required to meet with students at each stage of inquiry, action and reflection to discuss the
progress made to date, and to verify the authenticity of the coursework being created by each student.
The key outcomes of these one-to-one interactions, which might be formal meetings and/or informal
discussions in the classroom, must be summarized by the teacher on the DP film Coursework authentication
form (6/FCAF), which is submitted to the IB as part of the upload of assessment material.
The teacher should also:
•
discuss with each student their intentions and planning, including but not limited to proposed
techniques and methods, as well as age-appropriateness of subject matter •
ensure that health and safety matters are fully addressed for all participants •
ensure that students are acknowledging all sources used, and referencing them appropriately •
ensure that students have worked with an appropriate number of other students to form core production teams, as outlined above •
assist with sourcing and maintaining the necessary technical hardware and software to enable
students to effectively work in their discrete film production roles and create their completed films •
use their best judgment in assisting students, keeping in mind that this is an assessment task. Their
help should generally be limited to asking questions and making suggestions •
ensure that students correctly identify in their work the one role they have worked in •
support students in working collaboratively and in ensuring they fulfill their commitment to the rest of
the core production team throughout the production phases •
ensure that each student appropriately completes the required cover sheet •
give feedback on one draft of the completed film and project report, authenticate the completed
work and provide comments on each student’s submission to assist with moderation. While this is a
collaborative creative project, it is essential that teachers assess each student’s individual contribution to the completed films.
Teachers are not permitted to participate in the production of the completed film in any capacity other than as described above.
