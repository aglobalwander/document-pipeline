## CONCLUSION

The mission of Cognitive Coaching is to produce self-directed persons with the cognitive capacities for self-directed learning. Ultimately, the support person with the greatest flexibility in choices and repertoire has the greatest capacity to support growth. It is for this reason that Cognitive Coaches, devoted to mediating thinking, will occasionally draw from the other support services of collaborating and consulting to achieve these ends.

The Cognitive Coach knows that through his support services in collaboration and consulting he can provide data, ideas, and structured experiences that can enhance the teacher's cognitive capacity, teaching alternatives, and instructional skills. The coach also knows that through collaborating and/or consulting, opportunities will arise that can enhance the teacher's development of resourcefulness related to the five states of mind: efficacy, flexibility, consciousness, craftsmanship, and interdependence. (See chapter 7.)

Thus, even though coaches may enter other support functions, their 'default position' is always grounded in the values, principles, and purposes of Cognitive Coaching.
