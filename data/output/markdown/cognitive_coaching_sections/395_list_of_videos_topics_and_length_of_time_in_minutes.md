## List of Videos, Topics, and Length of Time in Minutes

F ollowing is a list of videos that accompany the text. Videos may be viewed by logging on to the HTML as noted. Each video is coded with a number. The first number identifies the chapter and if the chapter contains more than one video, the second number indicates sequence of videos. For example, Video 2-1 would be chapter 2, video number 1. In some cases there is more than one video segment. The third number indicates the segment: 3-1.2. Also included are some suggestions to direct your attention to the salient features of this video. So that you can anticipate the time needed for viewing, the duration of each video in minutes and seconds is also listed.

While each video is intended to focus on a certain coaching skill or map, the demonstration will also include multiple skills. For example, while viewing the video on the planning conversation, you will also be aware of the use of rapport, questioning, paraphrasing, pausing, and so on.
