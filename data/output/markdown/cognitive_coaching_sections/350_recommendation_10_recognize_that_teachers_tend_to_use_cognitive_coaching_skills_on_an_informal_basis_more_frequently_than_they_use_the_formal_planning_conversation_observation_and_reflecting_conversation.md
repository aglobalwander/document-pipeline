## Recommendation #10: Recognize That Teachers Tend to Use Cognitive Coaching Skills on an Informal Basis More Frequently Than They Use the Formal Planning Conversation, Observation, and Reflecting Conversation

Teachers using Cognitive Coaching during the course of a year reported that they used Cognitive Coaching skills informally more frequently than they used them on a formal basis, including a planning conversation, and observation, and a reflecting conversation (Awakuni 1995). Still, whether teachers were coached formally, including the planning conversation, classroom observation, and reflecting conversation, or informally, they identified Cognitive Coaching as having a positive impact on their

teaching (Alseike 1997).
