Introduction
The Diploma Programme
The Diploma Programme is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to 19
age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and
inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to
develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The Diploma Programme model
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core (see figure 1). It encourages the
concurrent study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study: two modern languages (or a modern
language and a classical language); a humanities or social science subject; an experimental science;
mathematics; one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma
Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance.
In each of the academic areas students have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can
choose subjects that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.

The Diploma Programme
Physics guide 3
Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they can, instead
of an arts subject, choose two subjects from another area. Normally, three subjects (and not more than
four) are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends 240
teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than at SL.
At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of
the course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some element of coursework assessed by teachers.
The core of the Diploma Programme Model
All Diploma Programme students participate in the three course elements that make up the core of
the model. Theory of knowledge (TOK) is a course that is fundamentally about critical thinking and inquiry
into the process of knowing rather than about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course
examines the nature of knowledge and how we know what we claim to know. It does this by encouraging
students to analyse knowledge claims and explore questions about the construction of knowledge. The
task of TOK is to emphasize connections between areas of shared knowledge and link them to personal
knowledge in such a way that an individual becomes more aware of his or her own perspectives and how they might differ from others.
Creativity, action, service (CAS) is at the heart of the Diploma Programme. The emphasis in CAS is on helping
students to develop their own identities, in accordance with the ethical principles embodied in the IB
mission statement and the IB learner profile. It involves students in a range of activities alongside their
academic studies throughout the Diploma Programme. The three strands of CAS are Creativity (arts, and
other experiences that involve creative thinking), Action (physical exertion contributing to a healthy lifestyle)
and Service (an unpaid and voluntary exchange that has a learning benefit for the student). Possibly more
than any other component in the Diploma Programme, CAS contributes to the IB’s mission to create a better
and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect.
The extended essay, including the world studies extended essay, offers the opportunity for IB students to
investigate a topic of special interest, in the form of a 4,000-word piece of independent research. The area of
research undertaken is chosen from one of the students’ Diploma Programme subjects, or in the case of the
interdisciplinary world studies essay, two subjects, and acquaints them with the independent research and
writing skills expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally presented, structured writing, in
which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent manner, appropriate to the subject
or subjects chosen. It is intended to promote high-level research and writing skills, intellectual discovery
and creativity. As an authentic learning experience it provides students with an opportunity to engage in
personal research on a topic of choice, under the guidance of a supervisor.
Approaches to teaching and approaches to learning
Approaches to teaching and learning across the Diploma Programme refers to deliberate strategies,
skills and attitudes which permeate the teaching and learning environment. These approaches and
tools, intrinsically linked with the learner profile attributes, enhance student learning and assist student
preparation for the Diploma Programme assessment and beyond. The aims of approaches to teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme are to:

=== Page 14 ===
The Diploma Programme
Physics guide 4 •
empower teachers as teachers of learners as well as teachers of content •
empower teachers to create clearer strategies for facilitating learning experiences in which students
are more meaningfully engaged in structured inquiry and greater critical and creative thinking •
promote both the aims of individual subjects (making them more than course aspirations) and linking
previously isolated knowledge (concurrency of learning) •
encourage students to develop an explicit variety of skills that will equip them to continue to be
actively engaged in learning after they leave school, and to help them not only obtain university
admission through better grades but also prepare for success during tertiary education and beyond •
enhance further the coherence and relevance of the students’ Diploma Programme experience •
allow schools to identify the distinctive nature of an IB Diploma Programme education, with its blend of idealism and practicality.
The five approaches to learning (developing thinking skills, social skills, communication skills, self management skills and research skills) along with the six approaches to teaching (teaching that is inquiry based, conceptually focused, contextualized, collaborative, differentiated and informed by assessment)
encompass the key values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy.
The IB mission statement and the IB learner profile
The Diploma Programme aims to develop in students the knowledge, skills and attitudes they will need
to fulfill the aims of the IB, as expressed in the organization’s mission statement and the learner profile.
Teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme represent the reality in daily practice of the organization’s educational philosophy.
Academic honesty
Academic honesty in the Diploma Programme is a set of values and behaviours informed by the attributes
of the learner profile. In teaching, learning and assessment, academic honesty serves to promote personal
integrity, engender respect for the integrity of others and their work, and ensure that all students have an
equal opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquire during their studies.
All coursework—including work submitted for assessment—is to be authentic, based on the student’s
individual and original ideas with the ideas and work of others fully acknowledged. Assessment tasks that
require teachers to provide guidance to students or that require students to work collaboratively must be
completed in full compliance with the detailed guidelines provided by the IB for the relevant subjects.
For further information on academic honesty in the IB and the Diploma Programme, please consult the IB
publications Academic honesty, The Diploma Programme: From principles into practice and General regulations:
Diploma Programme. Specific information regarding academic honesty as it pertains to external and internal
assessment components of this Diploma Programme subject can be found in this guide.
Acknowledging the ideas or work of another person
Coordinators and teachers are reminded that candidates must acknowledge all sources used in work
submitted for assessment. The following is intended as a clarification of this requirement.
Diploma Programme candidates submit work for assessment in a variety of media that may include audio visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print or electronic sources. If a candidate uses
the work or ideas of another person, the candidate must acknowledge the source using a standard style of

=== Page 15 ===
The Diploma Programme
Physics guide 5
referencing in a consistent manner. A candidate’s failure to acknowledge a source will be investigated by the
IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.
The IB does not prescribe which style(s) of referencing or in-text citation should be used by candidates; this
is left to the discretion of appropriate faculty/staff in the candidate’s school. The wide range of subjects,
three response languages and the diversity of referencing styles make it impractical and restrictive to insist
on particular styles. In practice, certain styles may prove most commonly used, but schools are free to
choose a style that is appropriate for the subject concerned and the language in which candidates’ work is
written. Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a given subject, it is expected that the
minimum information given includes: name of author, date of publication, title of source, and page numbers as applicable.
Candidates are expected to use a standard style and use it consistently so that credit is given to all sources
used, including sources that have been paraphrased or summarized. When writing, candidates must clearly
distinguish between their words and those of others by the use of quotation marks (or other method, such
as indentation) followed by an appropriate citation that denotes an entry in the bibliography. If an electronic
source is cited, the date of access must be indicated. Candidates are not expected to show faultless expertise
in referencing, but are expected to demonstrate that all sources have been acknowledged. Candidates must
be advised that audio-visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print or in electronic
sources that is not their own must also attribute the source. Again, an appropriate style of referencing/ citation must be used.
Learning diversity and learning support requirements
Schools must ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided to
candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Candidates with
assessment access requirements and Learning diversity within the International Baccalaureate programmes/
Special educational needs within the International Baccalaureate programmes.

The Nature of science (NOS) is an overarching theme in the biology, chemistry and physics courses. This
section, titled “Nature of science”, is in the biology, chemistry and physics guides to support teachers in
their understanding of what is meant by the nature of science. The “Nature of science” section of the guide
provides a comprehensive account of the nature of science in the 21st century. It will not be possible to cover
in this document all the themes in detail in the three science courses, either for teaching or assessment.
It has a paragraph structure (1.1, 1.2, etc) to link the significant points made to the syllabus (landscape
pages) references on the NOS. The NOS parts in the subject-specific sections of the guide are examples of a
particular understanding. The NOS statement(s) above every sub-topic outline how one or more of the NOS
themes can be exemplified through the understandings, applications and skills in that sub-topic. These are
not a repeat of the NOS statements found below but an elaboration of them in a specific context. See the section on “Format of the syllabus”.
Technology
Although this section is about the nature of science, the interpretation of the word technology is
important, and the role of technology emerging from and contributing to science needs to be clarified.
In today’s world, the words science and technology are often used interchangeably; however, historically
this is not the case. Technology emerged before science, and materials were used to produce useful and
decorative artefacts long before there was an understanding of why materials had different properties
that could be used for different purposes. In the modern world the reverse is the case: an understanding
of the underlying science is the basis for technological developments. These new technologies in their turn drive developments in science.
Despite their mutual dependence they are based on different values: science on evidence, rationality and
the quest for deeper understanding; technology on the practical, the appropriate and the useful with an
increasingly important emphasis on sustainability.
1.	 What is science and what is the scientific endeavour?
1.1.
The underlying assumption of science is that the universe has an independent, external reality
accessible to human senses and amenable to human reason.
1.2.
Pure science aims to come to a common understanding of this external universe; applied science
and engineering develop technologies that result in new processes and products. However, the boundaries between these fields are fuzzy.
1.3.
Scientists use a wide variety of methodologies which, taken together, make up the process of science.
There is no single “scientific method”. Scientists have used, and do use, different methods at different
times to build up their knowledge and ideas, but they have a common understanding about what makes them all scientifically valid.
1.4.
This is an exciting and challenging adventure involving much creativity and imagination as well
as exacting and detailed thinking and application. Scientists also have to be ready for unplanned,
surprising, accidental discoveries. The history of science shows this is a very common occurrence.
1.5.
Many scientific discoveries have involved flashes of intuition and many have come from speculation or simple curiosity about particular phenomena.
Nature of science
Introduction

=== Page 17 ===
Nature of science
Physics guide 7 1.6.
Scientists have a common terminology and a common reasoning process, which involves using
deductive and inductive logic through analogies and generalizations. They share mathematics,
the language of science, as a powerful tool. Indeed, some scientific explanations only exist in mathematical form.
1.7.
Scientists must adopt a skeptical attitude to claims. This does not mean that they disbelieve everything,
but rather that they suspend judgment until they have a good reason to believe a claim to be true or
false. Such reasons are based on evidence and argument.
1.8.
The importance of evidence is a fundamental common understanding. Evidence can be obtained by
observation or experiment. It can be gathered by human senses, primarily sight, but much modern
science is carried out using instrumentation and sensors that can gather information remotely and
automatically in areas that are too small, or too far away, or otherwise beyond human sense perception.
Improved instrumentation and new technology have often been the drivers for new discoveries.
Observations followed by analysis and deduction led to the Big Bang theory of the origin of the
universe and to the theory of evolution by natural selection. In these cases, no controlled experiments
were possible. Disciplines such as geology and astronomy rely strongly on collecting data in the field,
but all disciplines use observation to collect evidence to some extent. Experimentation in a controlled
environment, generally in laboratories, is the other way of obtaining evidence in the form of data, and
there are many conventions and understandings as to how this is to be achieved.
1.9.
This evidence is used to develop theories, generalize from data to form laws and propose hypotheses.
These theories and hypotheses are used to make predictions that can be tested. In this way theories
can be supported or opposed and can be modified or replaced by new theories.
1.10.
Models, some simple, some very complex, based on theoretical understanding, are developed to
explain processes that may not be observable. Computer-based mathematical models are used to
make testable predictions, which can be especially useful when experimentation is not possible.
Models tested against experiments or data from observations may prove inadequate, in which case they may be modified or replaced by new models.
1.11.
The outcomes of experiments, the insights provided by modelling and observations of the natural
world may be used as further evidence for a claim.
1.12.
The growth in computing power has made modelling much more powerful. Models, usually
mathematical, are now used to derive new understandings when no experiments are possible (and
sometimes when they are). This dynamic modelling of complex situations involving large amounts of
data, a large number of variables and complex and lengthy calculations is only possible as a result of
increased computing power. Modelling of the Earth’s climate, for example, is used to predict or make
a range of projections of future climatic conditions. A range of different models has been developed
in this field and results from different models have been compared to see which models are most
accurate. Models can sometimes be tested by using data from the past and used to see if they can
predict the present situation. If a model passes this test, we gain confidence in its accuracy.
1.13.
Both the ideas and the processes of science can only occur in a human context. Science is carried out
by a community of people from a wide variety of backgrounds and traditions, and this has clearly
influenced the way science has proceeded at different times. It is important to understand, however,
that to do science is to be involved in a community of inquiry with certain common principles, methodologies, understandings and processes.
2.	 The understanding of science 2.1.
Theories, laws and hypotheses are concepts used by scientists. Though these concepts are connected,
there is no progression from one to the other. These words have a special meaning in science and it is
important to distinguish these from their everyday use.
2.2.
Theories are themselves integrated, comprehensive models of how the universe, or parts of it, work.
A theory can incorporate facts and laws and tested hypotheses. Predictions can be made from the
theories and these can be tested in experiments or by careful observations. Examples are the germ theory of disease or atomic theory.
2.3.
Theories generally accommodate the assumptions and premises of other theories, creating a consistent
understanding across a range of phenomena and disciplines. Occasionally, however, a new theory
will radically change how essential concepts are understood or framed, impacting other theories and
causing what is sometimes called a “paradigm shift” in science. One of the most famous paradigm
shifts in science occurred when our idea of time changed from an absolute frame of reference to
an observer-dependent frame of reference within Einstein’s theory of relativity. Darwin’s theory of
evolution by natural selection also changed our understanding of life on Earth.

=== Page 18 ===
Nature of science
Physics guide 8 2.4.
Laws are descriptive, normative statements derived from observations of regular patterns of behaviour.
They are generally mathematical in form and can be used to calculate outcomes and to make predictions.
Like theories and hypotheses, laws cannot be proven. Scientific laws may have exceptions and may
be modified or rejected based on new evidence. Laws do not necessarily explain a phenomenon. For
example, Newton’s law of universal gravitation tells us that the force between two masses is inversely
proportional to the square of the distance between them, and allows us to calculate the force between
masses at any distance apart, but it does not explain why masses attract each other. Also, note that the
term law has been used in different ways in science, and whether a particular idea is called a law may
be partly a result of the discipline and time period at which it was developed.
2.5.
Scientists sometimes form hypotheses—explanatory statements about the world that could be true or
false, and which often suggest a causal relationship or a correlation between factors. Hypotheses can be
tested by both experiments and observations of the natural world and can be supported or opposed.
2.6.
To be scientific, an idea (for example, a theory or hypothesis) must focus on the natural world and
natural explanations and must be testable. Scientists strive to develop hypotheses and theories that
are compatible with accepted principles and that simplify and unify existing ideas.
2.7.
The principle of Occam’s razor is used as a guide to developing a theory. The theory should be as
simple as possible while maximizing explanatory power.
2.8.
The ideas of correlation and cause are very important in science. A correlation is a statistical link or
association between one variable and another. A correlation can be positive or negative and a correlation
coefficient can be calculated that will have a value between +1, 0 and −1. A strong correlation (positive
or negative) between one factor and another suggests some sort of causal relationship between
the two factors but more evidence is usually required before scientists accept the idea of a causal
relationship. To establish a causal relationship, ie one factor causing another, scientists need to have a
plausible scientific mechanism linking the factors. This strengthens the case that one causes the other,
for example smoking and lung cancer. This mechanism can be tested in experiments.
2.9.
The ideal situation is to investigate the relationship between one factor and another while controlling all
other factors in an experimental setting; however, this is often impossible and scientists, especially in biology
and medicine, use sampling, cohort studies and case control studies to strengthen their understanding of
causation when experiments (such as double-blind tests and clinical trials) are not possible. Epidemiology
in the field of medicine involves the statistical analysis of data to discover possible correlations when little
established scientific knowledge is available or the circumstances are too difficult to control entirely. Here,
as in other fields, mathematical analysis of probability also plays a role.
3.	 The objectivity of science 3.1.
Data is the lifeblood of scientists and may be qualitative or quantitative. It can be obtained purely from
observations or from specifically designed experiments, remotely using electronic sensors or by direct
measurement. The best data for making accurate and precise descriptions and predictions is often
quantitative and amenable to mathematical analysis. Scientists analyse data and look for patterns,
trends and discrepancies, attempting to discover relationships and establish causal links. This is not
always possible, so identifying and classifying observations and artefacts (eg types of galaxies or
fossils) is still an important aspect of scientific work.
3.2.
Taking repeated measurements and large numbers of readings can improve reliability in data
collection. Data can be presented in a variety of formats such as linear and logarithmic graphs that
can be analysed for, say, direct or inverse proportion or for power relationships.
3.3.
Scientists need to be aware of random errors and systematic errors, and use techniques such as error
bars and lines of best fit on graphs to portray the data as realistically and honestly as possible. There is
a need to consider whether outlying data points should be discarded or not.
3.4.
Scientists need to understand the difference between errors and uncertainties, accuracy and precision,
and need to understand and use the mathematical ideas of average, mean, mode, median, etc.
Statistical methods such as standard deviation and chi-squared tests are often used. It is important
to be able to assess how accurate a result is. A key part of the training and skill of scientists is in being
able to decide which technique is appropriate in different circumstances.
3.5.
It is also very important for scientists to be aware of the cognitive biases that may impact experimental
design and interpretation. The confirmation bias, for example, is a well-documented cognitive bias
that urges us to find reasons to reject data that is unexpected or does not conform to our expectations
or desires, and to perhaps too readily accept data that agrees with these expectations or desires. The
processes and methodologies of science are largely designed to account for these biases. However,
care must always be taken to avoid succumbing to them.

=== Page 19 ===
Nature of science
Physics guide 9 3.6.
Although scientists cannot ever be certain that a result or finding is correct, we know that some scientific
results are very close to certainty. Scientists often speak of “levels of confidence” when discussing
outcomes. The discovery of the existence of a Higgs boson is such an example of a “level of confidence”.
This particle may never be directly observable, but to establish its “existence” particle physicists had
to pass the self-imposed definition of what can be regarded as a discovery—the 5-sigma “level of
certainty”—or about a 0.00003% chance that the effect is not real based on experimental evidence.
3.7.
In recent decades, the growth in computing power, sensor technology and networks has allowed
scientists to collect large amounts of data. Streams of data are downloaded continuously from many
sources such as remote sensing satellites and space probes and large amounts of data are generated
in gene sequencing machines. Experiments in CERN’s Large Hadron Collider regularly produce
23 petabytes of data per second, which is equivalent to 13.3 years of high definition TV content per second.
3.8.
Research involves analysing large amounts of this data, stored in databases, looking for patterns and
unique events. This has to be done using software that is generally written by the scientists involved.
The data and the software may not be published with the scientific results but would be made generally available to other researchers.
4.	 The human face of science 4.1.
Science is highly collaborative and the scientific community is composed of people working in science,
engineering and technology. It is common to work in teams from many disciplines so that different
areas of expertise and specializations can contribute to a common goal that is beyond one scientific
field. It is also the case that how a problem is framed in the paradigm of one discipline might limit
possible solutions, so framing problems using a variety of perspectives, in which new solutions are possible, can be extremely useful.
4.2.
Teamwork of this sort takes place with the common understanding that science should be open minded and independent of religion, culture, politics, nationality, age and gender. Science involves
the free global interchange of information and ideas. Of course, individual scientists are human and
may have biases and prejudices, but the institutions, practices and methodologies of science help
keep the scientific endeavour as a whole unbiased.
4.3.
As well as collaborating on the exchange of results, scientists work on a daily basis in collaborative groups
on a small and large scale within and between disciplines, laboratories, organizations and countries,
facilitated even more by virtual communication. Examples of large-scale collaboration include:
–
The Manhattan project, the aim of which was to build and test an atomic bomb. It eventually
employed more than 130,000 people and resulted in the creation of multiple production and
research sites that operated in secret, culminating in the dropping of two atomic bombs on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
–
The Human Genome Project (HGP), which was an international scientific research project set
up to map the human genome. The $3-billion project beginning in 1990 produced a draft
of the genome in 2000. The sequence of the DNA is stored in databases available to anyone on the internet.
–
The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), organized under the auspices of
the United Nations, is officially composed of about 2,500 scientists. They produce reports
summarizing the work of many more scientists from all around the world.
–
CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, an international organization set up
in 1954, is the world’s largest particle physics laboratory. The laboratory, situated in Geneva,
employs about 2,400 people and shares results with 10,000 scientists and engineers covering
over 100 nationalities from 600 or more universities and research facilities.
All the above examples are controversial to some degree and have aroused emotions among scientists and the public.
4.4.
Scientists spend a considerable amount of time reading the published results of other scientists. They
publish their own results in scientific journals after a process called peer review. This is when the work
of a scientist or, more usually, a team of scientists is anonymously and independently reviewed by
several scientists working in the same field who decide if the research methodologies are sound and
if the work represents a new contribution to knowledge in that field. They also attend conferences

=== Page 20 ===
Nature of science
Physics guide 10
to make presentations and display posters of their work. Publication of peer-reviewed journals on
the internet has increased the efficiency with which the scientific literature can be searched and
accessed. There are a large number of national and international organizations for scientists working in specialized areas within subjects.
4.5.
Scientists often work in areas, or produce findings, that have significant ethical and political implications.
These areas include cloning, genetic engineering of food and organisms, stem cell and reproductive
technologies, nuclear power, weapons development (nuclear, chemical and biological), transplantation
of tissue and organs and in areas that involve testing on animals (see IB animal experimentation policy).
There are also questions involving intellectual property rights and the free exchange of information
that may impact significantly on a society. Science is undertaken in universities, commercial companies,
government organizations, defence agencies and international organizations. Questions of patents
and intellectual property rights arise when work is done in a protected environment.
4.6.
The integrity and honest representation of data is paramount in science—results should not be fixed
or manipulated or doctored. To help ensure academic honesty and guard against plagiarism, all
sources are quoted and appropriate acknowledgment made of help or support. Peer review and the
scrutiny and skepticism of the scientific community also help achieve these goals.
4.7.
All science has to be funded and the source of the funding is crucial in decisions regarding the type
of research to be conducted. Funding from governments and charitable foundations is sometimes
for pure research with no obvious direct benefit to anyone, whereas funding from private companies
is often for applied research to produce a particular product or technology. Political and economic
factors often determine the nature and extent of the funding. Scientists often have to spend time
applying for research grants and have to make a case for what they want to research.
4.8.
Science has been used to solve many problems and improve humankind’s lot, but it has also been used
in morally questionable ways and in ways that inadvertently caused problems. Advances in sanitation,
clean water supplies and hygiene led to significant decreases in death rates but without compensating
decreases in birth rates, this led to huge population increases with all the problems of resources,
energy and food supplies that entails. Ethical discussions, risk–benefit analyses, risk assessment and
the precautionary principle are all parts of the scientific way of addressing the common good.
5.	 Scientific literacy and the public understanding of science 5.1.
An understanding of the nature of science is vital when society needs to make decisions involving
scientific findings and issues. How does the public judge? It may not be possible to make judgments
based on the public’s direct understanding of a science, but important questions can be asked about
whether scientific processes were followed and scientists have a role in answering such questions.
5.2.
As experts in their particular fields, scientists are well placed to explain to the public their issues and
findings. Outside their specializations, they may be no more qualified than ordinary citizens to advise
others on scientific issues, although their understanding of the processes of science can help them to
make personal decisions and to educate the public as to whether claims are scientifically credible.
5.3.
As well as comprising knowledge of how scientists work and think, scientific literacy involves being
aware of faulty reasoning. There are many cognitive biases/fallacies of reasoning to which people
are susceptible (including scientists) and these need to be corrected whenever possible. Examples
of these are the confirmation bias, hasty generalizations, post hoc ergo propter hoc (false cause), the
straw man fallacy, redefinition (moving the goal posts), the appeal to tradition, false authority and the
accumulation of anecdotes being regarded as evidence.
5.4.
When such biases and fallacies are not properly managed or corrected, or when the processes and
checks and balances of science are ignored or misapplied, the result is pseudoscience. Pseudoscience
is the term applied to those beliefs and practices that claim to be scientific but do not meet or follow
the standards of proper scientific methodologies, ie they lack supporting evidence or a theoretical
framework, are not always testable and hence falsifiable, are expressed in a non-rigorous or unclear
manner and often fail to be supported by scientific testing.
5.5.
Another key issue is the use of appropriate terminology. Words that scientists agree on as being
scientific terms will often have a different meaning in everyday life and scientific discourse with
the public needs to take this into account. For example, a theory in everyday use means a hunch or
speculation, but in science an accepted theory is a scientific idea that has produced predictions that
have been thoroughly tested in many different ways. An aerosol is just a spray can to the general
public, but in science it is a suspension of solid or liquid particles in a gas.

Whatever the field of science—whether it is in pure research, applied research or in engineering new
technology—there is boundless scope for creative and imaginative thinking. Science has achieved a
great deal but there are many, many unanswered questions to challenge future scientists.

Nature of physics
Introduction
“Physics is a tortured assembly of contrary qualities: of scepticism and
rationality, of freedom and revolution, of passion and aesthetics, and of soaring imagination and trained common sense.”
Leon M Lederman (Nobel Prize for Physics, 1988)
Physics is the most fundamental of the experimental sciences, as it seeks to explain the universe itself from
the very smallest particles—currently accepted as quarks, which may be truly fundamental—to the vast distances between galaxies.
Classical physics, built upon the great pillars of Newtonian mechanics, electromagnetism and
thermodynamics, went a long way in deepening our understanding of the universe. From Newtonian
mechanics came the idea of predictability in which the universe is deterministic and knowable. This led
to Laplace’s boast that by knowing the initial conditions—the position and velocity of every particle
in the universe—he could, in principle, predict the future with absolute certainty. Maxwell’s theory of
electromagnetism described the behaviour of electric charge and unified light and electricity, while
thermodynamics described the relation between energy transferred due to temperature difference and
work and described how all natural processes increase disorder in the universe.
However, experimental discoveries dating from the end of the 19th century eventually led to the demise
of the classical picture of the universe as being knowable and predictable. Newtonian mechanics failed
when applied to the atom and has been superseded by quantum mechanics and general relativity.
Maxwell’s theory could not explain the interaction of radiation with matter and was replaced by quantum
electrodynamics (QED). More recently, developments in chaos theory, in which it is now realized that small
changes in the initial conditions of a system can lead to completely unpredictable outcomes, have led to a fundamental rethinking in thermodynamics.
While chaos theory shows that Laplace’s boast is hollow, quantum mechanics and QED show that the initial
conditions that Laplace required are impossible to establish. Nothing is certain and everything is decided by
probability. But there is still much that is unknown and there will undoubtedly be further paradigm shifts as our understanding deepens.
Despite the exciting and extraordinary development of ideas throughout the history of physics, certain
aspects have remained unchanged. Observations remain essential to the very core of physics, sometimes
requiring a leap of imagination to decide what to look for. Models are developed to try to understand
observations, and these themselves can become theories that attempt to explain the observations. Theories
are not always directly derived from observations but often need to be created. These acts of creation can
be compared to those in great art, literature and music, but differ in one aspect that is unique to science:
the predictions of these theories or ideas must be tested by careful experimentation. Without these tests,
a theory cannot be quantified. A general or concise statement about how nature behaves, if found to be
experimentally valid over a wide range of observed phenomena, is called a law or a principle.
The scientific processes carried out by the most eminent scientists in the past are the same ones followed by
working physicists today and, crucially, are also accessible to students in schools. Early in the development of
science, physicists were both theoreticians and experimenters (natural philosophers). The body of scientific
knowledge has grown in size and complexity, and the tools and skills of theoretical and experimental
physicists have become so specialized that it is difficult (if not impossible) to be highly proficient in both

=== Page 23 ===
Nature of physics
Physics guide 13
areas. While students should be aware of this, they should also know that the free and rapid interplay
of theoretical ideas and experimental results in the public scientific literature maintains the crucial links between these fields.
At the school level both theory and experiments should be undertaken by all students. They should
complement one another naturally, as they do in the wider scientific community. The Diploma Programme
physics course allows students to develop traditional practical skills and techniques and increase their
abilities in the use of mathematics, which is the language of physics. It also allows students to develop
interpersonal and digital communication skills which are essential in modern scientific endeavour and are
important life-enhancing, transferable skills in their own right.
Alongside the growth in our understanding of the natural world, perhaps the more obvious and relevant
result of physics to most of our students is our ability to change the world. This is the technological side of
physics, in which physical principles have been applied to construct and alter the material world to suit our
needs, and have had a profound influence on the daily lives of all human beings. This raises the issue of the
impact of physics on society, the moral and ethical dilemmas, and the social, economic and environmental
implications of the work of physicists. These concerns have become more prominent as our power over the
environment has grown, particularly among young people, for whom the importance of the responsibility
of physicists for their own actions is self-evident.
Physics is therefore, above all, a human activity, and students need to be aware of the context in which
physicists work. Illuminating its historical development places the knowledge and the process of physics
in a context of dynamic change, in contrast to the static context in which physics has sometimes been
presented. This can give students insights into the human side of physics: the individuals; their personalities,
times and social milieux; their challenges, disappointments and triumphs.
The Diploma Programme physics course includes the essential principles of the subject but also, through
selection of an option, allows teachers some flexibility to tailor the course to meet the needs of their
students. The course is available at both SL and HL, and therefore accommodates students who wish to
study physics as their major subject in higher education and those who do not.
Teaching approach
There are a variety of approaches to the teaching of physics. By its very nature, physics lends itself to an
experimental approach, and it is expected that this will be reflected throughout the course. The order
in which the syllabus is arranged is not the order in which it should be taught, and it is up to individual
teachers to decide on an arrangement that suits their circumstances. Sections of the option material may be
taught within the core or the additional higher level (AHL) material if desired, or the option material can be taught as a separate unit.
Science and the international dimension
Science itself is an international endeavour—the exchange of information and ideas across national
boundaries has been essential to the progress of science. This exchange is not a new phenomenon but it
has accelerated in recent times with the development of information and communication technologies.
Indeed, the idea that science is a Western invention is a myth—many of the foundations of modern-day
science were laid many centuries ago by Arabic, Indian and Chinese civilizations, among others. Teachers
are encouraged to emphasize this contribution in their teaching of various topics, perhaps through the
use of timeline websites. The scientific method in its widest sense, with its emphasis on peer review,
open-mindedness and freedom of thought, transcends politics, religion, gender and nationality. Where
appropriate within certain topics, the syllabus details sections in the group 4 guides contain links illustrating the international aspects of science.

=== Page 24 ===
Nature of physics
Physics guide 14
On an organizational level, many international bodies now exist to promote science. United Nations bodies such
as UNESCO, UNEP and WMO, where science plays a prominent part, are well known, but in addition there are
hundreds of international bodies representing every branch of science. The facilities for large-scale research in,
for example, particle physics and the Human Genome Project are expensive, and only joint ventures involving
funding from many countries allow this to take place. The data from such research is shared by scientists
worldwide. Group 4 teachers and students are encouraged to access the extensive websites and databases of
these international scientific organizations to enhance their appreciation of the international dimension.
Increasingly there is a recognition that many scientific problems are international in nature and this has led to a
global approach to research in many areas. The reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are
a prime example of this. On a practical level, the group 4 project (which all science students must undertake)
mirrors the work of real scientists by encouraging collaboration between schools across the regions.
The power of scientific knowledge to transform societies is unparalleled. It has the potential to produce
great universal benefits, or to reinforce inequalities and cause harm to people and the environment. In line
with the IB mission statement, group 4 students need to be aware of the moral responsibility of scientists to
ensure that scientific knowledge and data are available to all countries on an equitable basis and that they
have the scientific capacity to use this for developing sustainable societies.
Students’ attention should be drawn to sections of the syllabus with links to international-mindedness.
Examples of issues relating to international-mindedness are given within sub-topics in the syllabus content.
Teachers could also use resources found on the Global Engage website (http://globalengage. ibo.org).
Distinction between SL and HL
Group 4 students at standard level (SL) and higher level (HL) undertake a common core syllabus, a common
internal assessment (IA) scheme and have some overlapping elements in the option studied. They are
presented with a syllabus that encourages the development of certain skills, attributes and attitudes, as
described in the “Assessment objectives” section of the guide.
While the skills and activities of group 4 science subjects are common to students at both SL and HL,
students at HL are required to study some topics in greater depth, in the additional higher level (AHL)
material and in the common options. The distinction between SL and HL is one of breadth and depth.
Prior learning
Past experience shows that students will be able to study a group 4 science subject at SL successfully with
no background in, or previous knowledge of, science. Their approach to learning, characterized by the IB
learner profile attributes, will be significant here.
However, for most students considering the study of a group 4 subject at HL, while there is no intention to
restrict access to group 4 subjects, some previous exposure to formal science education would be necessary.
Specific topic details are not specified but students who have undertaken the IB Middle Years Programme
(MYP) or studied an equivalent national science qualification or a school-based science course would be well prepared for an HL subject.
Links to the Middle Years Programme
Students who have undertaken the MYP science, design and mathematics courses will be well prepared for
group 4 subjects. The alignment between MYP science and Diploma Programme group 4 courses allows
for a smooth transition for students between programmes. The concurrent planning of the new group 4
courses and MYP: Next Chapter (both launched in 2014) has helped develop a closer alignment.

=== Page 25 ===
Nature of physics
Physics guide 15
Scientific inquiry is central to teaching and learning science in the MYP. It enables students to develop a
way of thinking and a set of skills and processes that, while allowing them to acquire and use knowledge,
equip them with the capabilities to tackle, with confidence, the internal assessment component of group 4
subjects. The vision of MYP sciences is to contribute to the development of students as 21st-century learners.
A holistic sciences programme allows students to develop and utilize a mixture of cognitive abilities, social
skills, personal motivation, conceptual knowledge and problem-solving competencies within an inquiry based learning environment (Rhoton 2010). Inquiry aims to support students’ understanding by providing
them with opportunities to independently and collaboratively investigate relevant issues through both
research and experimentation. This forms a firm base of scientific understanding with deep conceptual roots for students entering group 4 courses.
In the MYP, teachers make decisions about student achievement using their professional judgment, guided
by criteria that are public, precise and known in advance, ensuring that assessment is transparent. The IB
describes this approach as “criterion-related”—a philosophy of assessment that is neither “norm-referenced”
(where students must be compared to each other and to an expected distribution of achievement) nor
“criterion-referenced” (where students must master all strands of specific criteria at lower achievement
levels before they can be considered to have achieved the next level). It is important to emphasize that
the single most important aim of MYP assessment (consistent with the PYP and DP) is to support curricular
goals and encourage appropriate student learning. Assessments are based upon evaluating course aims
and objectives and, therefore, effective teaching to the course requirements also ensures effective teaching
for formal assessment requirements. Students need to understand what the assessment expectations,
standards and practices are and these should all be introduced early and naturally in teaching, as well as
in class and homework activities. Experience with criterion-related assessment greatly assists students
entering group 4 courses with understanding internal assessment requirements.
MYP science is a concept-driven curriculum, aimed at helping the learner construct meaning through
improved critical thinking and the transfer of knowledge. At the top level are key concepts which are broad,
organizing, powerful ideas that have relevance within the science course but also transcend it, having
relevance in other subject groups. These key concepts facilitate both disciplinary and interdisciplinary
learning as well as making connections with other subjects. While the key concepts provide breadth, the
related concepts in MYP science add depth to the programme. The related concept can be considered
to be the big idea of the unit which brings focus and depth and leads students towards the conceptual understanding.
Across the MYP there are 16 key concepts with the three highlighted below the focus for MYP science.
The key concepts across the MYP curriculum
Aesthetics
Change
Communication
Communities
Connections
Creativity
Culture
Development
Form
Global interactions
Identity

MYP students may in addition undertake an optional onscreen concept-based assessment as further
preparation for Diploma Programme science courses.

Science and theory of knowledge
The theory of knowledge (TOK) course (first assessment 2015) engages students in reflection on the nature
of knowledge and on how we know what we claim to know. The course identifies eight ways of knowing:
reason, emotion, language, sense perception, intuition, imagination, faith and memory. Students explore
these means of producing knowledge within the context of various areas of knowledge: the natural sciences,
the social sciences, the arts, ethics, history, mathematics, religious knowledge systems and indigenous
knowledge systems. The course also requires students to make comparisons between the different areas of
knowledge, reflecting on how knowledge is arrived at in the various disciplines, what the disciplines have in common, and the differences between them.
TOK lessons can support students in their study of science, just as the study of science can support
students in their TOK course. TOK provides a space for students to engage in stimulating wider discussions
about questions such as what it means for a discipline to be a science, or whether there should be ethical
constraints on the pursuit of scientific knowledge. It also provides an opportunity for students to reflect on
the methodologies of science, and how these compare to the methodologies of other areas of knowledge.
It is now widely accepted that there is no one scientific method, in the strict Popperian sense. Instead, the
sciences utilize a variety of approaches in order to produce explanations for the behaviour of the natural
world. The different scientific disciplines share a common focus on utilizing inductive and deductive
reasoning, on the importance of evidence, and so on. Students are encouraged to compare and contrast
these methods with the methods found in, for example, the arts or in history.
In this way there are rich opportunities for students to make links between their science and TOK courses.
One way in which science teachers can help students to make these links to TOK is by drawing students’
attention to knowledge questions that arise from their subject content. Knowledge questions are open ended questions about knowledge such as:
•
How do we distinguish science from pseudoscience?
•
When performing experiments, what is the relationship between a scientist’s expectation and their perception?
•
How does scientific knowledge progress?
•
What is the role of imagination and intuition in the sciences?
•
What are the similarities and differences in methods in the natural sciences and the human sciences?
Examples of relevant knowledge questions are provided throughout this guide within the sub-topics in
the syllabus content. Teachers can also find suggestions of interesting knowledge questions for discussion
in the “Areas of knowledge” and “Knowledge frameworks” sections of the TOK guide. Students should be
encouraged to raise and discuss such knowledge questions in both their science and TOK classes.

Syllabus
Format of the syllabus
The format of the syllabus section of the group 4 guides is the same for each subject. This new structure
gives prominence and focus to the teaching and learning aspects.
Topics or options
Topics are numbered and options are indicated by a letter. For example, “Topic 8: Energy production”, or
“Option D: Astrophysics”.
Sub-topics
Sub-topics are numbered as follows, “6.1 – Circular motion”. Further information and guidance about
possible teaching times are contained in the teacher support material.
Each sub-topic begins with an essential idea. The essential idea is an enduring interpretation that is
considered part of the public understanding of science. This is followed by a section on the “Nature of
science”. This gives specific examples in context illustrating some aspects of the nature of science. These are
linked directly to specific references in the “Nature of science” section of the guide to support teachers in
their understanding of the general theme to be addressed.
Under the overarching “Nature of science” theme there are two columns. The first column lists
“Understandings”, which are the main general ideas to be taught. There follows an “Applications and
skills” section that outlines the specific applications and skills to be developed from the understandings. A
“Guidance” section gives information about the limits and constraints and the depth of treatment required
for teachers and examiners. The contents of the “Nature of science” section above the two columns and
contents of the first column are all legitimate items for assessment. In addition, some assessment of
international-mindedness in science, from the content of the second column, will be assessed as in the previous course.
The second column gives suggestion to teachers about relevant references to international-mindedness.
It also gives examples of TOK knowledge questions (see Theory of knowledge guide published 2013) that
can be used to focus students’ thoughts on the preparation of the TOK prescribed essay title. The links
section may link the sub-topic to other parts of the subject syllabus, to other Diploma Programme subject
guides or to real-world applications. Finally, the “Aims” section refers to how specific group 4 aims are being addressed in the sub-topic.

Group 4 experimental skills
I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.
Confucius
Integral to the experience of students in any of the group 4 courses is their experience in the classroom
laboratory or in the field. Practical activities allow students to interact directly with natural phenomena
and secondary data sources. These experiences provide the students with the opportunity to design
investigations, collect data, develop manipulative skills, analyse results, collaborate with peers and evaluate
and communicate their findings. Experiments can be used to introduce a topic, investigate a phenomenon
or allow students to consider and examine questions and curiosities.

=== Page 32 ===
Approaches to the teaching and learning of physics
Physics guide 22
By providing students with the opportunity for hands-on experimentation, they are carrying out some of
the same processes that scientists undertake. Experimentation allows students to experience the nature of
scientific thought and investigation. All scientific theories and laws begin with observations.
It is important that students are involved in an inquiry-based practical programme that allows for the
development of scientific inquiry. It is not enough for students just to be able to follow directions and to
simply replicate a given experimental procedure; they must be provided with the opportunities for genuine
inquiry. Developing scientific inquiry skills will give students the ability to construct an explanation based
on reliable evidence and logical reasoning. Once developed, these higher order thinking skills will enable
students to be lifelong learners and scientifically literate.
A school’s practical scheme of work should allow students to experience the full breadth and depth of
the course including the option. This practical scheme of work must also prepare students to undertake
the independent investigation that is required for the internal assessment. The development of students’
manipulative skills should involve them being able to follow instructions accurately and demonstrate the
safe, competent and methodical use of a range of techniques and equipment.
The “Applications and skills” section of the syllabus lists specific lab skills, techniques and experiments that
students must experience at some point during their study of the group 4 course. Other recommended lab
skills, techniques and experiments are listed in the “Aims” section of the syllabus outline.
Aim 6 of the group 4 subjects directly relates to the development of experimental and investigative skills.
Mathematical requirements
All Diploma Programme physics students should be able to:
•
perform the basic arithmetic functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division •
carry out calculations involving means, decimals, fractions, percentages, ratios, approximations and reciprocals •
carry out manipulations with trigonometric functions •
carry out manipulations with  logarithmic and exponential functions (HL only) • carry out manipulations with radians • use scientific notation (for example, 3.6 × 106) • use direct and inverse proportion • solve simple algebraic equations • solve linear simultaneous equations •
plot graphs (with suitable scales and axes) including two variables that show linear and non-linear relationships •
interpret graphs, including the significance of gradients, changes in gradients, intercepts and areas •
draw lines (either curves or linear) of best fit on a scatter plot graph •
on a best-fit linear graph, construct linear lines of maximum and minimum gradients with relative
accuracy (by eye) taking into account all uncertainty bars •
interpret data presented in various forms (for example, bar charts, histograms and pie charts) •
represent arithmetic mean using x-bar notation (for example, x) •
express uncertainties to one or two significant figures, with justification.

Data booklet
The data booklet must be viewed as an integral part of the physics programme and should be used
throughout the delivery of the course and not just reserved for use during the external assessments. The
data booklet contains useful equations, constants, data, structural formulae and tables of information.
Explicit links have been provided in the “Syllabus outline” section of the subject guide that provide direct
references to information in the data booklet which will allow students to become familiar with its use and
contents. It is suggested that the data booklet be used for all in-class study and school-based assessments.
For both SL and HL external assessments, clean copies of the data booklet must be made available to both
SL and HL candidates for all papers.
Use of information communication technology
The use of information communication technology (ICT) is encouraged throughout all aspects of the course
in relation to both the practical programme and day-to-day classroom activities. Teachers should make use
of the ICT pages of the teacher support materials (TSM).
Planning your course
The syllabus as provided in the subject guide is not intended to be a teaching order. Instead it provides
detail of what must be covered by the end of the course. A school should develop a scheme of work that best
works for its students. For example, the scheme of work could be developed to match available resources,
to take into account student prior learning and experience, or in conjunction with other local requirements.
HL teachers may choose to teach the core and AHL topics at the same time or teach them in a spiral fashion,
by teaching the core topics in year one of the course and revisiting the core topics through the delivery of
the AHL topics in year two of the course. The option topic could be taught as a stand-alone topic or could be
integrated into the teaching of the core and/or AHL topics.
However the course is planned, adequate time must be provided for examination revision. Time must also
be given for students to reflect on their learning experience and their growth as learners.

Physics guide 30
Essential idea: Scientists aim towards designing experiments that can give a “true value” from their measurements, but due to the limited precision in measuring devices,
they often quote their results with some form of uncertainty.
1.2 – Uncertainties and errors
Nature of science:
Uncertainties: “All scientific knowledge is uncertain… if you have made up your mind already, you might not solve it. When the scientist tells you he does not know the
answer, he is an ignorant man. When he tells you he has a hunch about how it is going to work, he is uncertain about it. When he is pretty sure of how it is going to work,
and he tells you, ‘This is the way it’s going to work, I’ll bet,’ he still is in some doubt. And it is of paramount importance, in order to make progress, that we recognize this
ignorance and this doubt. Because we have the doubt, we then propose looking in new directions for new ideas.” (3.4)

Essential idea: Einstein’s study of electromagnetism revealed inconsistencies between the theory of Maxwell and Newton‘s mechanics. He recognized that both theories
could not be reconciled and so choosing to trust Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism he was forced to change long-cherished ideas about space and time in mechanics.
A.1 – The beginnings of relativity
Nature of science:
Paradigm shift: The fundamental fact that the speed of light is constant for all inertial observers has far-reaching consequences about our understanding of space and time.
Ideas about space and time that went unchallenged for more than 2,000 years were shown to be false. The extension of the principle of relativity to accelerated frames of
reference leads to the revolutionary idea of general relativity that the mass and energy that spacetime contains determine the geometry of spacetime. (2.3)

Essential idea: Observers in relative uniform motion disagree on the numerical values of space and time coordinates for events, but agree with the numerical value of
the speed of light in a vacuum. The Lorentz transformation equations relate the values in one reference frame to those in another. These equations replace the Galilean
transformation equations that fail for speeds close to that of light.

Nature of science:
Creative and critical thinking: Einstein’s great achievement, the general theory of relativity, is based on intuition, creative thinking and imagination, namely to connect the
geometry of spacetime (through its curvature) to the mass and energy content of spacetime. For years it was thought that nothing could escape a black hole and this is

Essential idea: A simple diagram that plots the luminosity versus the surface temperature of stars reveals unusually detailed patterns that help understand the inner workings
of stars. Stars follow well-defined patterns from the moment they are created out of collapsing interstellar gas, to their lives on the main sequence and to their eventual death.
D.2 – Stellar characteristics and stellar evolution
Nature of science:
Evidence: The simple light spectra of a gas on Earth can be compared to the light spectra of distant stars. This has allowed us to determine the velocity, composition and
structure of stars and confirmed hypotheses about the expansion of the universe. (1.11)
Understandings:
•
Stellar spectra •
Hertzsprung–Russell (HR) diagram •
Mass–luminosity relation for main sequence stars •
Cepheid variables •
Stellar evolution on HR diagrams •
Red giants, white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes •

Applications and skills:
•
Explaining how surface temperature may be obtained from a star’s spectrum •
Explaining how the chemical composition of a star may be determined from the star’s spectrum •

Describing the reason for the variation of Cepheid variables •
Determining distance using data on Cepheid variables •
Sketching and interpreting evolutionary paths of stars on an HR diagram •
Describing the evolution of stars off the main sequence •
Describing the role of mass in stellar evolution
Theory of knowledge:
•
The information revealed through spectra needs a trained mind to be
interpreted. What is the role of interpretation in gaining knowledge in the
natural sciences? How does this differ from the role of interpretation in other areas of knowledge?
Utilization:
•
An understanding of how similar stars to our Sun have aged and evolved assists in our predictions of our fate on Earth
Aims:

Essential idea: The Hot Big Bang model is a theory that describes the origin and expansion of the universe and is supported by extensive experimental evidence.
D.3 – Cosmology
Nature of science:

Essential idea: The modern field of cosmology uses advanced experimental and observational techniques to collect data with an unprecedented degree of precision and as
a result very surprising and detailed conclusions about the structure of the universe have been reached.
D.5 – Further cosmology
Nature of science:
Cognitive bias: According to everybody’s expectations the rate of expansion of the universe should be slowing down because of gravity. The detailed results from the
1998 (and subsequent) observations on distant supernovae showed that the opposite was in fact true. The accelerated expansion of the universe, whereas experimentally
verified, is still an unexplained phenomenon. (3.5)
Understandings:
•
The cosmological principle •
Rotation curves and the mass of galaxies •
Dark matter •
Fluctuations in the CMB •
The cosmological origin of redshift •

International-mindedness:
•
This is a highly collaborative field of research involving scientists from all over the world
Theory of knowledge:
•
Experimental facts show that the expansion of the universe is accelerating
yet no one understands why. Is this an example of something that we will never know?
Aims:
•
Aim 2: unlike how it was just a few decades ago, the field of cosmology has
now developed so much that cosmology has become a very exact science on the same level as the rest of physics •
Aim 10: it is quite extraordinary that to settle the issue of the fate of the
universe, cosmology, the physics of the very large, required the help of particle physics, the physics of the very small

Assessment
General
Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most important aims of assessment in the
Diploma Programme are that it should support curricular goals and encourage appropriate student
learning. Both external and internal assessments are used in the Diploma Programme. IB examiners mark
work produced for external assessment, while work produced for internal assessment is marked by teachers and externally moderated by the IB.
There are two types of assessment identified by the IB.
•
Formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is concerned with providing accurate
and helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of learning taking place and the nature of
students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop students’ understanding and capabilities.
Formative assessment can also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide information to
monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives.
•
Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring student achievement.
The Diploma Programme primarily focuses on summative assessment designed to record student
achievement at, or towards the end of, the course of study. However, many of the assessment instruments
can also be used formatively during the course of teaching and learning, and teachers are encouraged to
do this. A comprehensive assessment plan is viewed as being integral with teaching, learning and course
organization. For further information, see the IB Programme standards and practices document.
The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not norm-referenced. This approach to
assessment judges students’ work by their performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, and
not in relation to the work of other students. For further information on assessment within the Diploma
Programme please refer to the publication Diploma Programme assessment: principles and practice.
To support teachers in the planning, delivery and assessment of the Diploma Programme courses, a variety
of resources can be found on the OCC or purchased from the IB store (http://store.ibo.org). Additional
publications such as specimen papers and markschemes, teacher support materials, subject reports and
grade descriptors can also be found on the OCC. Past examination papers as well as markschemes can be purchased from the IB store.
Methods of assessment
The IB uses several methods to assess work produced by students.
Assessment criteria
Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended. Each criterion concentrates on
a particular skill that students are expected to demonstrate. An assessment objective describes what
students should be able to do, and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do it. Using
assessment criteria allows discrimination between different answers and encourages a variety of responses.
Each criterion comprises a set of hierarchically ordered level descriptors. Each level descriptor is worth one
Assessment in the Diploma Programme

=== Page 141 ===

Assessment in the Diploma Programme
Physics guide 131
or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The maximum marks for each
criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are added
together to give the total mark for the piece of work.
Markbands
Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance against which responses are judged.
They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds
to a range of marks to differentiate student performance. A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which
particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.
Analytic markschemes
Analytic markschemes are prepared for those examination questions that expect a particular kind of
response and/or a given final answer from students. They give detailed instructions to examiners on how to
break down the total mark for each question for different parts of the response.
Marking notes
For some assessment components marked using assessment criteria, marking notes are provided. Marking
notes give guidance on how to apply assessment criteria to the particular requirements of a question.
Inclusive assessment arrangements
Inclusive assessment arrangements are available for candidates with assessment access requirements.
These arrangements enable candidates with diverse needs to access the examinations and demonstrate
their knowledge and understanding of the constructs being assessed.
The IB document Candidates with assessment access requirements provides details on all the inclusive
assessment arrangements available to candidates with learning support requirements. The IB document
Learning diversity within the International Baccalaureate programmes/Special educational needs within the
International Baccalaureate programmes outlines the position of the IB with regard to candidates with diverse
learning needs in the IB programmes. For candidates affected by adverse circumstances, the IB documents
General regulations: Diploma Programme and the Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Programme provide details on special consideration.
Responsibilities of the school
The school is required to ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided
to candidates with special educational needs that are in line with the IB documents Candidates with
assessment access requirements and Learning diversity within the International Baccalaureate programmes/
Special educational needs within the International Baccalaureate programmes.

Assessment
Internal assessment
Purpose of internal assessment
Internal assessment is an integral part of the course and is compulsory for both SL and HL students. It
enables students to demonstrate the application of their skills and knowledge, and to pursue their personal
interests, without the time limitations and other constraints that are associated with written examinations.
The internal assessment should, as far as possible, be woven into normal classroom teaching and not be a
separate activity conducted after a course has been taught.
The internal assessment requirements at SL and at HL are the same. This internal assessment section of the
guide should be read in conjunction with the internal assessment section of the teacher support materials.
Guidance and authenticity
The work submitted for internal assessment must be the student’s own work. However, it is not the intention
that students should decide upon a title or topic and be left to work on the internal assessment component
without any further support from the teacher. The teacher should play an important role during both
the planning stage and the period when the student is working on the internally assessed work. It is the
responsibility of the teacher to ensure that students are familiar with:
•
the requirements of the type of work to be internally assessed • the IB animal experimentation policy •
the assessment criteria—students must understand that the work submitted for assessment must address these criteria effectively.
Teachers and students must discuss the internally assessed work. Students should be encouraged to initiate
discussions with the teacher to obtain advice and information, and students must not be penalized for
seeking guidance. As part of the learning process, teachers should read and give advice to students on one
draft of the work. The teacher should provide oral or written advice on how the work could be improved,
but not edit the draft. The next version handed to the teacher must be the final version for submission.
It is the responsibility of teachers to ensure that all students understand the basic meaning and significance
of concepts that relate to academic honesty, especially authenticity and intellectual property. Teachers
must ensure that all student work for assessment is prepared according to the requirements and must
explain clearly to students that the internally assessed work must be entirely their own. Where collaboration
between students is permitted, it must be clear to all students what the difference is between collaboration and collusion.
All work submitted to the IB for moderation or assessment must be authenticated by a teacher, and must not
include any known instances of suspected or confirmed academic misconduct. Each student must confirm
that the work is his or her authentic work and constitutes the final version of that work. Once a student has
officially submitted the final version of the work it cannot be retracted. The requirement to confirm the
authenticity of work applies to the work of all students, not just the sample work that will be submitted to
the IB for the purpose of moderation. For further details refer to the IB publications Academic honesty (2011),
The Diploma Programme: From principles into practice (2009) and the relevant articles in General regulations:
Diploma Programme (2012).

=== Page 147 ===

Internal assessment
Physics guide 137
Authenticity may be checked by discussion with the student on the content of the work, and scrutiny of one or more of the following:
• the student’s initial proposal • the first draft of the written work • the references cited •
the style of writing compared with work known to be that of the student •
the analysis of the work by a web-based plagiarism detection service such as http://www.turnitin.com.
The same piece of work cannot be submitted to meet the requirements of both the internal assessment and the extended essay.
Group work
Each investigation is an individual piece of work based on different data collected or measurements
generated. Ideally, students should work on their own when collecting data. In some cases, data collected
or measurements made can be from a group experiment provided each student collected his or her own
data or made his or her own measurements. In physics, in some cases, group data or measurements may be
combined to provide enough for individual analysis. Even in this case, students should have collected and
recorded their own data and they should clearly indicate which data are theirs.
It should be made clear to students that all work connected with the investigation should be their own. It is
therefore helpful if teachers try to encourage in students a sense of responsibility for their own learning so
that they accept a degree of ownership and take pride in their own work.
Time allocation
Internal assessment is an integral part of the physics course, contributing 20% to the final assessment in
the SL and the HL courses. This weighting should be reflected in the time that is allocated to teaching the
knowledge, skills and understanding required to undertake the work, as well as the total time allocated to carry out the work.
It is recommended that a total of approximately 10 hours of teaching time for both SL and HL should be allocated to the work. This should include:
•
time for the teacher to explain to students the requirements of the internal assessment •
class time for students to work on the internal assessment component and ask questions •
time for consultation between the teacher and each student •
time to review and monitor progress, and to check authenticity.
Safety requirements and recommendations
While teachers are responsible for following national or local guidelines, which may differ from country to
country, attention should be given to the guidelines below, which were developed for the International Council
of Associations for Science Education (ICASE) Safety Committee by The Laboratory Safety Institute (LSI).
It is a basic responsibility of everyone involved to make safety and health an ongoing commitment. Any
advice given will acknowledge the need to respect the local context, the varying educational and cultural
traditions, the financial constraints and the legal systems of differing countries.

Physics guide 141
Using assessment criteria for internal assessment
For internal assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion has
level descriptors describing specific achievement levels, together with an appropriate range of marks. The
level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure to achieve may be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL against the criteria using the level descriptors.
•
Assessment criteria are the same for both SL and HL.
•
The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained
by the student, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be
made when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark
awarded should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is
not necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.
•
When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors for each criterion until
they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a
piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the
one that more appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.
•
Where there are two or more marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper marks
if the student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent; the work may be close
to achieving marks in the level above. Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work
demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in the level below.
•
Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks (fractions and decimals) are not acceptable.
•
Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying
the appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.
•
The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by a
student. Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of the work being assessed.
•
A student who attains a high achievement level in relation to one criterion will not necessarily
attain high achievement levels in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a student who attains a low
achievement level for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the other
criteria. Teachers should not assume that the overall assessment of the students will produce any particular distribution of marks.
•
It is recommended that the assessment criteria be made available to students.

Practical work and internal assessment
General introduction
The internal assessment requirements are the same for biology, chemistry and physics. The internal
assessment, worth 20% of the final assessment, consists of one scientific investigation. The individual
investigation should cover a topic that is commensurate with the level of the course of study.
Student work is internally assessed by the teacher and externally moderated by the IB. The performance in
internal assessment at both SL and HL is marked against common assessment criteria, with a total mark out of 24.
Note: Any investigation that is to be used to assess students should be specifically designed to match the relevant assessment criteria.
The internal assessment task will be one scientific investigation taking about 10 hours and the write-up
should be 6 to 12 pages long. Investigations exceeding this length will be penalized in the communications
criterion as lacking in conciseness. Examiners will be instructed not to read beyond the 12-page limit.
The practical investigation, with generic criteria, will allow a wide range of practical activities satisfying the
varying needs of biology, chemistry and physics. The investigation addresses many of the learner profile
attributes well. See section on “Approaches to the teaching and learning of physics” for further links.
The task produced should be complex and commensurate with the level of the course. It should require a
purposeful research question and the scientific rationale for it. The marked exemplar material in the teacher
support materials will demonstrate that the assessment will be rigorous and of the same standard as the assessment in the previous courses.
Some of the possible tasks include:
• a hands-on laboratory investigation • using a spreadsheet for analysis and modelling •
extracting data from a database and analysing it graphically •
producing a hybrid of spreadsheet/database work with a traditional hands-on investigation •
using a simulation, provided it is interactive and open-ended
Some task may consist of relevant and appropriate qualitative work combined with quantitative work.
The tasks include the traditional hands-on practical investigations as in the previous course. The depth
of treatment required for hands-on practical investigations is unchanged from the previous internal
assessment and will be shown in detail in the teacher support materials. In addition, detailed assessment of
specific aspects of hands-on practical work will be assessed in the written papers as detailed in the relevant
topic(s) in the “Syllabus content” section of the guide.
The task will have the same assessment criteria for SL and HL. The five assessment criteria are personal
engagement, exploration, analysis, evaluation and communication.

Duration: 10 hours
Weighting: 20% •
Individual investigation •
This investigation covers assessment objectives 1, 2, 3 and 4.
Internal assessment criteria
The new assessment model uses five criteria to assess the final report of the individual investigation with the following raw marks and weightings assigned:
Personal engagement
Exploration
Analysis
Evaluation
Communication
Total 2 (8%) 6 (25%) 6 (25%) 6 (25%) 4 (17%) 24 (100%)
Levels of performance are described using multiple indicators per level. In many cases the indicators
occur together in a specific level, but not always. Also, not all indicators are always present. This means
that a candidate can demonstrate performances that fit into different levels. To accommodate this, the
IB assessment models use markbands and advise examiners and teachers to use a best-fit approach in
deciding the appropriate mark for a particular criterion.
Teachers should read the guidance on using markbands shown above in the section called “Using
assessment criteria for internal assessment” before starting to mark. It is also essential to be fully acquainted
with the marking of the exemplars in the teacher support material. The precise meaning of the command
terms used in the criteria can be found in the glossary of the subject guides.
Personal engagement
This criterion assesses the extent to which the student engages with the exploration and makes it their own.
Personal engagement may be recognized in different attributes and skills. These could include addressing
personal interests or showing evidence of independent thinking, creativity or initiative in the designing,
implementation or presentation of the investigation.

Rationale for practical work
Although the requirements for IA are centred on the investigation, the different types of practical activities
that a student may engage in serve other purposes, including:
•
illustrating, teaching and reinforcing theoretical concepts •
developing an appreciation of the essential hands-on nature of much scientific work •
developing an appreciation of scientists’ use of secondary data from databases •
developing an appreciation of scientists’ use of modelling •
developing an appreciation of the benefits and limitations of scientific methodology.
Practical scheme of work
The practical scheme of work (PSOW) is the practical course planned by the teacher and acts as a summary
of all the investigative activities carried out by a student. Students at SL and HL in the same subject may carry out some of the same investigations.

=== Page 158 ===
Internal assessment
Physics guide 148
Syllabus coverage
The range of practical work carried out should reflect the breadth and depth of the subject syllabus at each
level, but it is not necessary to carry out an investigation for every syllabus topic. However, all students must
participate in the group 4 project and the IA investigation.
Planning your practical scheme of work
Teachers are free to formulate their own practical schemes of work by choosing practical activities according
to the requirements outlined. Their choices should be based on:
• subjects, levels and options taught • the needs of their students • available resources • teaching styles.
Each scheme must include some complex experiments that make greater conceptual demands on students.
A scheme made up entirely of simple experiments, such as ticking boxes or exercises involving filling in
tables, will not provide an adequate range of experience for students.
Teachers are encouraged to use the online curriculum centre (OCC) to share ideas about possible practical
activities by joining in the discussion forums and adding resources in the subject home pages.
Flexibility
The practical programme is flexible enough to allow a wide variety of practical activities to be carried out.
These could include:
•
short labs or projects extending over several weeks • computer simulations • using databases for secondary data • developing and using models •
data-gathering exercises such as questionnaires, user trials and surveys • data-analysis exercises • fieldwork.
Practical work documentation
The 4/PSOW form is a record of all practical activities carried out by a class. The form is not required to
moderate the individual investigations, so it is not necessary to submit this form. However, the 4/PSOW
is an essential planning and recording document for teachers to ensure that a suitable range of practical
activities is carried out and that the appropriate hours are allocated to practical work. Teachers should
continue to maintain this form (or their own version of it including all the same information) to record the
practical activities carried out by the class. The form should be retained in the school and made available to
the IB, for example, during the five-year school evaluation process.

=== Page 159 ===
Internal assessment
Physics guide 149
Time allocation for practical work
The recommended teaching times for all Diploma Programme courses are 150 hours at SL and 240 hours
at HL. Students at SL are required to spend 40 hours, and students at HL 60 hours, on practical activities
(excluding time spent writing up work). These times include 10 hours for the group 4 project and 10 hours
for the internal assessment investigation. (Only 2–3 hours of investigative work can be carried out after the
deadline for submitting work to the moderator and still be counted in the total number of hours for the practical scheme of work.)

Physics guide 150 150
Assessment
The group 4 project
The group 4 project is an interdisciplinary activity in which all Diploma Programme science students must
participate. The intention is that students from the different group 4 subjects analyse a common topic
or problem. The exercise should be a collaborative experience where the emphasis is on the processes
involved in, rather than the products of, such an activity.
In most cases students in a school would be involved in the investigation of the same topic. Where
there are large numbers of students, it is possible to divide them into several smaller groups containing
representatives from each of the science subjects. Each group may investigate the same topic or different
topics—that is, there may be several group 4 projects in the same school.
Students studying environmental systems and societies are not required to undertake the group 4 project.
Summary of the group 4 project
The group 4 project is a collaborative activity where students from different group 4 subjects work together
on a scientific or technological topic, allowing for concepts and perceptions from across the disciplines to
be shared in line with aim 10—that is, to “develop an understanding of the relationships between scientific
disciplines and their influence on other areas of knowledge”. The project can be practically or theoretically
based. Collaboration between schools in different regions is encouraged.
The group 4 project allows students to appreciate the environmental, social and ethical implications
of science and technology. It may also allow them to understand the limitations of scientific study, for
example, the shortage of appropriate data and/or the lack of resources. The emphasis is on interdisciplinary
cooperation and the processes involved in scientific investigation, rather than the products of such investigation.
The choice of scientific or technological topic is open but the project should clearly address aims 7, 8 and 10 of the group 4 subject guides.
Ideally, the project should involve students collaborating with those from other group 4 subjects at all
stages. To this end, it is not necessary for the topic chosen to have clearly identifiable separate subject
components. However, for logistical reasons, some schools may prefer a separate subject “action” phase (see the following “Project stages” section).
Project stages
The 10 hours allocated to the group 4 project, which are part of the teaching time set aside for developing
the practical scheme of work, can be divided into three stages: planning, action and evaluation.
Planning
This stage is crucial to the whole exercise and should last about two hours.
•
The planning stage could consist of a single session, or two or three shorter ones.
•
This stage must involve all group 4 students meeting to “brainstorm” and discuss the central topic, sharing ideas and information.

=== Page 161 ===

The group 4 project
Physics guide 151 •
The topic can be chosen by the students themselves or selected by the teachers.
•
Where large numbers of students are involved, it may be advisable to have more than one mixed subject group.
After selecting a topic or issue, the activities to be carried out must be clearly defined before moving
from the planning stage to the action and evaluation stages.
A possible strategy is that students define specific tasks for themselves, either individually or as members of
groups, and investigate various aspects of the chosen topic. At this stage, if the project is to be experimentally
based, apparatus should be specified so that there is no delay in carrying out the action stage. Contact with
other schools, if a joint venture has been agreed, is an important consideration at this time.
Action
This stage should last around six hours and may be carried out over one or two weeks in normal scheduled
class time. Alternatively, a whole day could be set aside if, for example, the project involves fieldwork.
•
Students should investigate the topic in mixed-subject groups or single-subject groups.
•
There should be collaboration during the action stage; findings of investigations should be shared
with other students within the mixed/single-subject group. During this stage, in any practically-based
activity, it is important to pay attention to safety, ethical and environmental considerations.
Note: Students studying two group 4 subjects are not required to do two separate action phases.
Evaluation
The emphasis during this stage, for which two hours are probably necessary, is on students sharing their
findings, both successes and failures, with other students. How this is achieved can be decided by the teachers, the students or jointly.
•
One solution is to devote a morning, afternoon or evening to a symposium where all the students, as
individuals or as groups, give brief presentations.
•
Alternatively, the presentation could be more informal and take the form of a science fair where
students circulate around displays summarizing the activities of each group.
The symposium or science fair could also be attended by parents, members of the school board and the
press. This would be especially pertinent if some issue of local importance has been researched. Some of the
findings might influence the way the school interacts with its environment or local community.
Addressing aims 7 and 8
Aim 7: “develop and apply 21st century communication skills in the study of science.”
Aim 7 may be partly addressed at the planning stage by using electronic communication within and
between schools. It may be that technology (for example, data logging, spreadsheets, databases and so
on) will be used in the action phase and certainly in the presentation/evaluation stage (for example, use of
digital images, presentation software, websites, digital video and so on).
Aim 8: “become critically aware, as global citizens, of the ethical implications of using science and technology.”

=== Page 162 ===
The group 4 project
Physics guide 152
Addressing the international dimension
There are also possibilities in the choice of topic to illustrate the international nature of the scientific
endeavour and the increasing cooperation required to tackle global issues involving science and technology.
An alternative way to bring an international dimension to the project is to collaborate with a school in another region.
Types of project
While addressing aims 7, 8 and 10 the project must be based on science or its applications. The project may
have a hands-on practical action phase or one involving purely theoretical aspects. It could be undertaken in a wide range of ways:
•
designing and carrying out a laboratory investigation or fieldwork •
carrying out a comparative study (experimental or otherwise) in collaboration with another school •
collating, manipulating and analysing data from other sources, such as scientific journals,
environmental organizations, science and technology industries and government reports • designing and using a model or simulation •
contributing to a long-term project organized by the school.
Logistical strategies
The logistical organization of the group 4 project is often a challenge to schools. The following models
illustrate possible ways in which the project may be implemented.
Models A, B and C apply within a single school, and model D relates to a project involving collaboration between schools.
Model A: mixed-subject groups and one topic
Schools may adopt mixed subject groups and choose one common topic. The number of groups will depend on the number of students.
Model B: mixed-subject groups adopting more than one topic
Schools with large numbers of students may choose to do more than one topic.
Model C: single-subject groups
For logistical reasons some schools may opt for single subject groups, with one or more topics in the action
phase. This model is less desirable as it does not show the mixed subject collaboration in which many scientists are involved.
Model D: collaboration with another school
The collaborative model is open to any school. To this end, the IB provides an electronic collaboration board
on the OCC where schools can post their project ideas and invite collaboration from other schools. This
could range from merely sharing evaluations for a common topic to a full-scale collaborative venture at all stages.

=== Page 163 ===

The group 4 project
Physics guide 153
For schools with few Diploma Programme (course) students it is possible to work with non-Diploma
Programme or non-group 4 students or undertake the project once every two years. However, these schools
are encouraged to collaborate with another school. This strategy is also recommended for individual
students who may not have participated in the project, for example, through illness or because they have
transferred to a new school where the project has already taken place.
Timing
The 10 hours that the IB recommends be allocated to the project may be spread over a number of weeks.
The distribution of these hours needs to be taken into account when selecting the optimum time to carry
out the project. However, it is possible for a group to dedicate a period of time exclusively to project work if all/most other schoolwork is suspended.
Year 1
In the first year, students’ experience and skills may be limited and it would be inadvisable to start the
project too soon in the course. However, doing the project in the final part of the first year may have the
advantage of reducing pressure on students later on. This strategy provides time for solving unexpected problems.
Year 1–year 2
The planning stage could start, the topic could be decided upon, and provisional discussion in individual
subjects could take place at the end of the first year. Students could then use the vacation time to think
about how they are going to tackle the project and would be ready to start work early in the second year.
Year 2
Delaying the start of the project until some point in the second year, particularly if left too late, increases
pressure on students in many ways: the schedule for finishing the work is much tighter than for the other
options; the illness of any student or unexpected problems will present extra difficulties. Nevertheless,
this choice does mean students know one another and their teachers by this time, have probably become
accustomed to working in a team and will be more experienced in the relevant fields than in the first year.
Combined SL and HL
Where circumstances dictate that the project is only carried out every two years, HL beginners and more experienced SL students can be combined.
Selecting a topic
Students may choose the topic or propose possible topics and the teacher then decides which one is the
most viable based on resources, staff availability and so on. Alternatively, the teacher selects the topic or
proposes several topics from which students make a choice.
Student selection
Students are likely to display more enthusiasm and feel a greater sense of ownership for a topic that they
have chosen themselves. A possible strategy for student selection of a topic, which also includes part of
the planning stage, is outlined here. At this point, subject teachers may provide advice on the viability of proposed topics.
•
Identify possible topics by using a questionnaire or a survey of students.
•
Conduct an initial “brainstorming” session of potential topics or issues.

=== Page 164 ===
The group 4 project
Physics guide 154 •
Discuss, briefly, two or three topics that seem interesting.
•
Select one topic by consensus.
•
Students make a list of potential investigations that could be carried out. All students then discuss
issues such as possible overlap and collaborative investigations.
A reflective statement written by each student on their involvement in the group 4 project must be included
on the cover sheet for each internal assessment investigation. See Handbook of procedures for the Diploma
Programme for more details.
