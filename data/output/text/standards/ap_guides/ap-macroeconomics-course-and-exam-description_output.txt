AP Equity and Access Policy
College Board strongly encourages educators to make equitable access a guiding
principle for their AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared
students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination
of barriers that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and
socioeconomic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented. Schools
should make every effort to ensure their AP classes reflect the diversity of their
student population. College Board also believes that all students should have
access to academically challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes,
which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to
equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.

About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking
AP courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and
AP Exams are developed and scored by college faculty
and experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges
and universities in the United States grant credit,
advanced placement, or both on the basis of successful
AP Exam scores; more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
to provide teachers and students with formative assessments—Personal Progress Checks—that
teachers can assign throughout the year to measure
student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the content
and skills that are the focus of the corresponding
college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also
organizes the content and skills into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many AP teachers have
told us they follow in order to focus their instruction.
The intention of this publication is to respect teachers’
time and expertise by providing a roadmap that they
can modify and adapt to their local priorities and
preferences. Moreover, by organizing the AP course
content and skills into units, the AP Program is able
Enrolling Students:
Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically
challenging coursework before they enroll in AP classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to equitable preparation and
access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses:
The AP Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP
courses must participate in the AP Course Audit, a
process through which AP teachers’ course materials
are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.

AP Macroeconomics Course and Exam Description

=== Page 9 ===
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the AP teacher and the school principal (or designated
administrator) to confirm awareness and understanding
of the curricular and resource requirements. A syllabus
or course outline, detailing how course requirements
are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The
AP Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor;
all AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision,
piloting, and analysis to ensure that questions are
accurate, fair, and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development,
College Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher
education institutions. This feedback is carefully
considered to ensure that AP courses and exams are
able to provide students with a college-level learning
experience and the opportunity to demonstrate their
qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam
development process, relies on the expertise of both
AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple-choice
questions are scored by machine, the free-response questions and through-course performance
assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands
of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are
scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion
is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained,
and their work is monitored throughout the Reading
for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief
Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers
in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of
the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a curve.
Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which means that
every student who meets the criteria for an AP score of
2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no matter how many
students that is. The criteria for the number of points
students must earn on the AP Exam to receive scores
of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently
validates for credit and placement purposes—include:
§Bullet The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
§Bullet The number of points researchers have found to be predictive that an AP student will succeed when placed into a subsequent higher-level college course.
§Bullet Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP scores as follows:
AP Score

While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and
universities. To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/ placement policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/creditpolicies
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score the free-response sections of the AP Exams.
Ninety-eight percent of surveyed educators who took
part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an
AP Reader, including opportunities to:
§Bullet educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college
§Bullet Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure
to the quality and depth of the responses from the
entire pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
§Bullet Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
§Bullet Score from home: AP Readers have online
distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects.

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide suggests a
sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds skill instruction across units, organizes content
into topics, and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course topics and skills, create
customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.
*To report misuses, please call, 877-274-6474  (International: +1-212-632-1781).

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
§Bullet Teachers and students sign in to or create their College Board accounts.
§Bullet Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
§Bullet Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
§Bullet Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP Coordinator.
§Bullet Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and
AP Coordinators to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following
additional benefits:
§Bullet Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
§Bullet Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
§Bullet Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student pack.
The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
§Bullet Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

About the AP
Macroeconomics Course
AP Macroeconomics is a college-level course that introduces students to the principles
that apply to an economic system as a whole. The course places particular emphasis on the
study of national income and price-level determination. It also develops students’ familiarity
with economic performance measures, the financial sector, stabilization policies, economic
growth, and international economics. Students learn to use graphs, charts, and data to analyze, describe, and explain economic concepts.
College Course Equivalent
AP Macroeconomics is equivalent to a one-semester introductory college course in economics.
Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites for AP Macroeconomics. Students should be able to read a
college-level textbook and possess basic mathematics and graphing skills.

Introduction
The AP Macroeconomics course outlined in this framework reflects a
commitment to what economics teachers, professors, and researchers
have agreed is the main goal of a college-level macroeconomics course:
to introduce students to the principles that apply to an economic system as a whole.
The AP Macroeconomics Course and Exam Description
defines concepts, skills, and understandings required
by representative colleges and universities for granting college credit or placement. The course prepares
students to think like economists by using principles
and models to describe economic situations and predict
and explain outcomes. Like economists, students do so by using graphs, charts, and data.
Although the course framework is designed to provide a
clear and detailed description of the course content and
skills, it is not a curriculum. A college-level textbook that
covers required course content should be used, and
teachers create their own curricula to meet the needs of
their students and any state or local requirements.

Components
Overview
This course framework provides a clear and detailed description of the course requirements necessary for student success.
The course framework includes two essential components:
1   COURSE SKILLS
The course skills are central to the study and practice of economics.
Students should develop and apply the described skills on a regular basis over the span of the course.
2   COURSE CONTENT
The course content is organized into commonly taught units of study that
provide a suggested sequence for the course. These units comprise the
content and conceptual understandings that colleges and universities
typically expect students to master to qualify for college credit and/or
placement. This content is grounded in big ideas, which are cross-cutting
concepts that build conceptual understanding and spiral throughout the course.

Skills
The AP Economics skills describe what a student should be able to do while
exploring course concepts. The table that follows presents these skills, which
students should develop during the AP Macroeconomics and AP Microeconomics
courses. These skills form the basis of the tasks on the AP Exam.
The unit guides later in this publication embed and spiral these skills throughout the
course, providing teachers with one way to integrate the skills in the course content
with sufficient repetition to prepare students to transfer those skills when taking the
AP Exam. Course content may be paired with a variety of skills on the AP Exam.
More detailed information about teaching the course skills can be found in the

Course
Content
Based on the Understanding by Design® (Wiggins and McTighe) model, this course
framework provides a clear and detailed description of the course requirements
necessary for student success. The framework specifies what students must
know, be able to do, and understand, with a focus on big ideas that encompass
core principles and theories of the discipline. The framework also encourages
instruction that prepares students for advanced economics coursework.
Big Ideas
The big ideas serve as the foundation of the course and allow students to create
meaningful connections among concepts. They are often overarching concepts
or themes that become threads that run throughout the course. Revisiting the
big ideas and applying them in a variety of contexts allows students to develop
deeper conceptual understanding. Below are the big ideas of the course and a brief
description of each:
BIG IDEA 1: ECONOMIC MEASUREMENTS (MEA)
Economists construct measurements to monitor the state of an economy and
evaluate its performance over time. Governments, firms, and citizens often use
these measurements to help inform policy, business, and personal decisions.
BIG IDEA 2: MARKETS (MKT)
Competitive markets bring together buyers and sellers to exchange goods
and services for mutual gain. The simple model of supply–demand can be applied in different market contexts.
BIG IDEA 3: MACROECONOMIC MODELS (MOD)
Macroeconomic models are simplified representations that depict basic
economic relationships and can be used to predict and explain how those relationships are affected by economic shocks.
BIG IDEA 4: MACROECONOMIC POLICIES (POL)
Government taxation and spending policies and central bank monetary
policy can affect an economy’s output, price level, and level of employment, both in the short run and in the long run.

UNITS
The course content is organized into commonly
taught units. The units have been arranged in a logical sequence frequently found in many college courses and textbooks.
The six units in AP Macroeconomics and their weighting on the multiple-choice section of the AP Exam are listed below.
Pacing recommendations at the unit level and on the
Course at a Glance provide suggestions for how to teach the required course content and administer the Personal Progress Checks. The suggested class
periods are based on a schedule in which the class meets five days a week for 45 minutes each day, with the assumption that there are approximately 70 instructional days per semester. While these recommendations have been made to aid planning,
teachers should of course adjust the pacing based on
the needs of their students, alternate schedules (e.g.,
block scheduling), or their school’s academic calendar.
TOPICS
Each unit is broken down into teachable segments
called topics. The topic pages (starting on page 34) contain the required content for each topic.

AP MACROECONOMICS
Unit
Guides
Introduction
Designed with input from the community of AP Macroeconomics
educators, the unit guides offer teachers helpful guidance in building
students’ skills and knowledge. The suggested sequence was identified
through a thorough analysis of the syllabi of highly effective AP teachers
and the organization of commonly assigned classroom resources.
This unit structure respects new AP teachers’ time by providing one
possible sequence they can adopt or modify rather than having to
build from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units enable the
AP Program to provide interested teachers with formative assessments—
the Personal Progress Checks—that they can assign their students at
the end of each unit to gauge progress toward success on the AP Exam.
However, experienced AP teachers who are satisfied with their current
course organization and exam results should feel no pressure to adopt
these units, which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

Building Course Skills
1.A  1.C  4.A  4.C
This unit focuses on giving students a thorough understanding of basic economic concepts so that they can appropriately apply these concepts with increasing sophistication in subsequent units. Application of economic principles and models will be an important skill throughout the course. Many students have not had significant exposure to the study of economics in previous coursework, so employing the tools of an economist may not come naturally. With that in mind, it’s important to give students many opportunities, starting early in the course, to describe economic concepts and apply their understanding of those concepts graphically and numerically. It helps for students to see from the beginning of the course how graphs can be used as tools for making sense of economic situations and predicting and explaining economic outcomes; even if a graph is not asked for on the exam, drawing one may help students answer a given question or explain a situation.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Many students lose points on the free response section of the AP Exam for failing to properly label all the elements of a graph and demonstrate the effects of changes on graphs. When introducing students to graphing in this unit, first model how to set up graphs, emphasizing the importance of properly labeling axes, curves, and equilibrium points. Give students opportunities to practice setting up graphs and demonstrating the effects of changes on their graphs. It is important to continue to emphasize and appropriately model these skills throughout the course.
Another challenging concept for students is differentiating between movement along a curve and shifts of a curve. In the context of learning about the basic model of supply and demand in this unit, consider spending time helping students distinguish between the effects of a price change and changes in the determinants of supply and demand. This will help students apply this understanding in other market models that come later in the course.

UNIT 1
Developing Understanding
To understand economics, students must first understand that because most resources are
scarce, individuals and societies must make choices. Examining how and why these choices
are made will help students begin to understand the principles of supply and demand along
with the importance of specialization and exchange.
In addition to introducing these basic economic concepts, this unit introduces foundational
models that set the stage for more advanced economic analysis in subsequent units.

The suggested skill for each topic shows one way to link the
content in that topic to a specific AP Economics skill. The
individual skill has been thoughtfully chosen in a way that allows
teachers to spiral the skill throughout the course. Students
should be able to use multiple skills with each topic, so the

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples
below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways
that they approach teaching some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional
Approaches section beginning on p. 113 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 1.2
Real-World Examples
Provide students with the following scenario: They have four hours and need to decide how
they are going to spend those four hours doing only two things. Students will then draw the
PPC curve and describe how they will spend those four hours. Using specific, real-world
examples, have students explain what happens when a point is inside the curve, on the curve, and beyond the curve.
2 1.4
Simulation and Debriefing
Carry out a classroom auction for an item of value in order to introduce students to the
relationship between price and quantity demanded. Use the data from the auction to graph
demand. Then simulate a change in one of the determinants of demand (e.g., by providing
students with fake money to increase their income) so that students can distinguish
between a change in quantity demanded and a change in demand. Debrief the experience
with students to ensure that connections are made to the concepts being studied.
3 1.6
Graph and Switch
Instruct students to draw and then manipulate a series of product markets based on changes in
market conditions. After completing each example, pair students with a partner and have them
switch graphs and provide feedback to one another regarding the graphs they have drawn.

them up for future analysis of macroeconomic concepts and issues. Students will learn how
the economy works with a model of the circular flow of inputs and outputs and the money
that pays for them. Students will also explore how economists assess the performance of the
economy with an introduction to measures of economic performance and the business cycle.
These concepts will be revisited in different contexts and models in the units that follow.
Building Course Skills
1.A  1.B  1.C  1.D  2.C  3.A
In this unit, students will continue to build on their application of economic principles and models by examining key measures of economic performance: gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment, and inflation.
Give students opportunities to fully explain these indicators, including what they measure, how they are calculated, and what limitations they have. Since these indicators will be used in different models and contexts later in the course, students should not simply memorize a textbook definition of each indicator. It will be difficult for students to apply their understanding of these indicators in other contexts if they cannot fully explain them.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Exam, students will be expected to identify and represent economic concepts using quantitative data and calculations.
Quantitative analysis is an important practice for economists and an important skill in this unit. When teaching this course, keep in mind that quantitative analysis in economics involves interpretation and application, which is more cognitively demanding than just carrying out a simple calculation. To help them gain fluency, have students practice basic calculations such as converting nominal values into real values. However, it is important to prepare students for the exam with a thorough grounding in the concepts and sufficient practice applying them in numerical contexts. If students do not fully understand the underlying concepts and just memorize a formula or mathematical process, they may struggle to carry out the appropriate calculations or analysis of given data in different contexts on the AP Exam.

Sample Activity 1 2.1
Simulation and Debriefing
Assign students to be either households or businesses and carry out a classroom simulation
to demonstrate the relationships represented by the circular flow model. Debrief the
experience with students to ensure that connections are made to the concepts being studied.
2 2.2
Discussion Groups
Assign students to groups to discuss the limitations of GDP. Provide students with a series
of questions to prompt discussion (e.g., What is counted and not counted in GDP? Does
GDP measure the well-being of that country’s society? ).
3 2.3
Simplify the Problem
Show students how to access the most recent “Employment Situation Summary” from the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics website. Instruct students to scroll down the page and
use the household survey data provided to calculate the labor force participation rate and
unemployment rate themselves. Then have them verify their work based on the data given in the summary.
4 2.4
Real-World Examples
Instruct students to work together to create a classroom market basket using current
prices of the products they typically purchase compared to a base year, such as the year
of their birth. (The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Databases, Tables & Calculators are a
helpful data source for this activity.) Discuss the limitations of the market basket, such as substitution and quality differences.
5 2.1, 2.3, 2.4
Ask the Expert
Assign small groups to research the three economic indicators addressed in this unit: the
unemployment rate, the inflation rate, and GDP. As part of their research, students should find
current data and articles so that they are prepared to explain the status of their indicator to
their classmates. Once students have become experts on their given indicator, have groups
rotate through each expert station to learn about the indicators they have not yet mastered.

Developing Understanding
In the previous unit, students were introduced to key macroeconomic indicators and the
business cycle. In this unit, students will learn how to represent and evaluate these concepts
in the context of a specific economic model: the aggregate demand–aggregate supply model.
The aggregate demand–aggregate supply model is a powerful tool that allows economists
to represent the impact of spending and production decisions, economic fluctuations, and
policy actions on macroeconomic outcomes, including output, income, unemployment, and inflation.
Building Course Skills
1.A  2.A  3.A  3.C  4.A  4.B  4.C
Economists rely on economic models as analytical tools to help make sense of the world. Give students meaningful and repetitive practice using the aggregate demand–aggregate supply model to look back to interpret an economic outcome and look forward to anticipate the effects of policy and other changes. Doing so will not only build students’ fluency in the skill categories of interpretation and manipulation but will also help them appreciate the explanatory power of economic models.
In this unit, students will continue to develop their quantitative skills, this time in the context of learning about multipliers. Give students opportunities for guided practice calculating multipliers and explaining how changes in spending and taxes lead to changes in real GDP.
Preparing for the AP Exam
The aggregate demand–aggregate supply model is foundational to the study of macroeconomics and, as such, is frequently tested on the AP Exam. Students often conflate the aggregate demand–aggregate supply model with the market supply and demand model introduced in the first unit and may, for example, label the axes of their aggregate demand–aggregate supply graphs with “Price” and “Quantity” rather than “Price
Level” and “Real GDP.” To prevent this, make sure students conceptually understand the difference between aggregate demand (aggregate supply) and demand (supply) and the implications when graphing and interpreting a graph.
Another challenging concept for students is the difference between macroeconomic outcomes in the short run and the long run.
Spend time helping students understand the distinction. On the AP Exam students will be asked to explain (verbally and graphically) the effect of policy actions and changes in economic conditions in the short run and long run and how the economy may achieve long-run equilibrium in the absence of policy actions.

MOD-2.C.1
The short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve describes the relationship between the price level and the quantity of goods and services supplied in an economy.
MOD-2.C.2
The SRAS curve is upward-sloping because of sticky wages and prices. [See EK MOD-2.E.1]

MOD-2.D
Explain (using graphs as appropriate) how movement along the SRAS curve implies a relationship between the price level (and inflation) and unemployment.

Moving along the SRAS curve, an increase in the price level is associated with an increase in output, which means employment must correspondingly rise. With the labor force held constant, unemployment will fall. So, there is a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. [See EK MOD-3.A.1]

Required Course Content
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
MOD-2
Economists use the aggregate demand–aggregate supply model to represent
the relationship between the price level and aggregate output in an economy
and to illustrate how output, employment, and the price level respond to macroeconomic shocks.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
MOD-2.G
Explain (using graphs as appropriate) the short-run and long-run equilibrium price level and output level.
MOD-2.G.1
Short-run equilibrium occurs when the aggregate quantity of output demanded and the aggregate quantity of output supplied are equal—i.e., at the intersection of the AD and SRAS curves.
MOD-2.G.2
Long-run equilibrium occurs when the AD and SRAS curves intersect on the LRAS—i.e., at the full-employment level of real output.
MOD-2.G.3
The short-run equilibrium output can be at the full-employment level of output, above it, or
below it, creating positive (i.e., inflationary) or negative (i.e., recessionary) output gaps.

Developing Understanding
In the previous unit, students explored the effects of fiscal policy. In this unit, students will
evaluate the macroeconomic effects of monetary policy. Before doing so, though, they
should first have an understanding of how the financial sector works and be able to describe
how monetary policy is implemented and transmitted through the banking system. This
understanding begins with an introduction to financial assets, including money, and the way in
which fractional reserve banking allows for the expansion of the money supply. Students will
then build on their understanding of the financial sector by learning how to model the money
market, the reserve market, and the loanable funds market.
Building Course Skills
1.A  1.B  2.A  3.C  4.A  4.C
In this unit, students will describe the workings of the financial sector so they can apply that understanding in context. Devote sufficient time to introducing students to new concepts and vocabulary. Vocabulary lists or rote memorization on their own will not allow for knowledge transfer.
Students will also be expected to represent a number of different markets graphically in this unit. Explain the underlying assumptions of each market and practice modeling these assumptions so that students can create properly labeled graphs to represent and evaluate economic situations.
Students will continue to build their quantitative skills by interpreting bank balance sheets and calculating changes in demand deposits, loans, and reserves in the banking system as a result of deposits, withdrawals, and monetary policy. Once again, it’s important to spend time grounding students in the underlying concepts—in this case, with a thorough introduction to fractional reserve banking—and provide ample time for numerical examples and practice.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Predicting and explaining the effects of fiscal and monetary policy actions is an important role of economists and an expectation of students on the AP Exam. Understanding fiscal and monetary policy will also help students become more informed citizens.
When responding to free-response questions on the AP Exam that ask which open-market operation is appropriate in a given economic scenario, students often use a scattershot approach and list all possible monetary policy actions rather than the appropriate open-market operation. Students should practice carefully reading and responding to the question, ensuring that they answer the question that is being asked. This will help students perform better on the exam and move them away from rote memorization and toward greater understanding.
Balance sheet questions are a common challenge area for students on the AP Exam.
Use past AP Exam questions to analyze the tasks and determine key vocabulary and misunderstandings students have when approaching the questions. Then provide opportunities for guided practice answering questions.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples
below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways
that they approach teaching some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional
Approaches section beginning on p. 113 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 4.1
QHT
Provide students with a list of critical vocabulary for this topic (e.g., stock, bond, interest
rate, loan). Have students mark the list with a Q for words they have a question about, an H
for words they have heard and might be able to identify, and a T for words they know well
enough to teach to their peers. Discuss their markings as a class and have students who
marked any words with a T describe the terms to their classmates.
2 4.4, 4.5, 4.6
Simulation and Debriefing
Carry out an in-class simulation of open-market operations in an economy with limited
reserves to give students a frame of reference for how T-accounts record lending activity
while also observing the effects of central bank purchases and sales of securities. Have
students take on the role of banks and give them a blank T-account and set of assets,
typically securities and cash (deposits). With you acting as the central bank, introduce policy
actions that require the “banks” to adjust their T-accounts accordingly. Debrief the experience
with students to ensure that connections are made to the concepts being studied.
3 4.5, 4.7
Practice Modeling
The money market, the reserve market, and the loanable funds market are introduced in this
unit. When introducing how to graph each market, first model it for students by drawing it
on the board and explaining the underlying assumptions while doing so (e.g., why the money
demand curve is downward-sloping and why the money supply curve is vertical). Then
provide an opportunity for students to practice generating the graph with appropriate labels
themselves and work through different scenarios and shifts within the context of each graph.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
POL-1.D.1
Central banks implement monetary policies to achieve macroeconomic goals, such as price stability.
POL-1.D.2
The tools of monetary policy may include the central bank’s discount rate and other administered interest rates (e.g., interest on reserves), open market operations, and the required reserve ratio. The tools used and the way in which they are implemented differ between economies that have limited reserves in their banking system and economies that have ample reserves in their banking system.
(The banking system in the United States has ample reserves, and the Federal Reserve’s key policy tool is interest on reserves.)
POL-1.D.3
When the central bank conducts an open market purchase (sale), reserves increase (decrease), thereby increasing (decreasing) the monetary base.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
POL-1.D.5
Many central banks carry out policy to hit a target range for an overnight interbank lending rate, sometimes referred to as the central
bank’s policy rate. (In the United States, this is the federal funds rate.)
POL-1.D.6
Central banks can influence the nominal
interest rate in the short run, which in turn will affect investment and consumption. [See also
EK MKT-5.G.2 for the influence on net capital inflows.] In an economy with limited reserves, the central bank can influence the nominal interest rate by changing the money supply. In an economy with ample reserves, changes in the money supply do not effectively change the nominal interest rate; instead, the central bank can influence the nominal interest rate by changing its administered interest rates.
POL-1.D.7
Expansionary or contractionary monetary policies are used to restore full employment when the economy is in a negative (i.e., recessionary) or positive (i.e., inflationary) output gap.
POL-1.D.8
Monetary policy can influence interest rates, aggregate demand, real output, and the price level. [See also EK MKT-5.E.3 for the effect on exchange rates.]

Developing Understanding
In many ways, Unit 5 is a culmination and an extension of material that has been introduced
previously. For example, in Units 3 and 4, students learned that public policy can affect the
economy’s output, price level, and level of employment in the short run; in this unit, students
will build on this understanding to examine the long-run implications of policy actions and the concept of economic growth.
Similarly, in Unit 2 students were introduced to inflation and unemployment as economic
indicators, and in Unit 3 they learned about the relationship between inflation and
unemployment; in this unit, students explore how the Phillips curve model is used to represent this relationship in the short run and long run.
Building Course Skills
2.A  2.B  3.A  3.B  4.B
In this unit, it helps to place a strong emphasis on fully explaining cause and-effect relationships. Each step in the chain of cause and effect should be modeled and practiced so students are able to appropriately predict and explain the consequences of a change. Students often make leaps in their reasoning that generate an incorrect prediction about the consequences of an action. Successful explanations that describe the effects of monetary policy on the economy, for example, begin with a discussion of how monetary policy is likely to affect interest rates. If students are unable to explain how monetary policy affects interest rates and how interest rates affect household and firm spending, then they are unlikely to demonstrate a strong understanding of the long-run consequences of stabilization policies undertaken by a central bank. Make connections for students to topics covered previously so they can recognize and build on earlier concepts.
Preparing for the AP Exam
It is crucial for economists, especially those who advise policymakers, to consider what actions lead to economic growth. In this unit and on the AP Exam, students will be asked to predict and explain the long-run implications of policy actions. To do so, they need to understand the difference between the short run and long run, how economic growth is measured, and the determinants of economic growth.
Questions involving the Phillips curve model are a common challenge area for students on the AP Exam. As with other models introduced in the course, it’s important to spend time first establishing the assumptions behind the model and provide sufficient time practicing graphing given economic situations and changes.
Students should understand the importance of proper labeling, the difference between movement along the curve versus shifts of the curve, and the distinction between the short run and the long run.

Developing Understanding
Unit 6 introduces students to the concept of an open economy in which a country interacts
with the rest of the world through both product and financial markets. This unit is often
challenging for students because economic activity between nations must be facilitated
by currency exchange, which introduces another market to be considered when analyzing macroeconomic situations.
Changes in economic activity affect the supply of and demand for a nation’s currency and
subsequently the value of that currency. But it is also true that changes in the value of a
country’s currency can affect economic activity in that country. In addition to these insights,
students have the opportunity in this unit to consider the effects of economic policy on
exchange rates and the implications of such changes.
Building Course Skills
1.A  1.C  3.A  3.B  4.A  4.C
In this unit, students will be asked to not only demonstrate a robust understanding of economic principles but also show that they know how to interpret and manipulate economic models in the context of an open economy. They need to synthesize the concepts they have learned throughout the course to explain changes in net exports, financial capital flows, and policy actions in the foreign exchange market, and demonstrate this understanding via graphical representations.
Students often struggle to make the necessary connections between concepts in this unit, so provide them with guided opportunities to practice describing chains of cause and effect verbally and graphically.
It is important that students take care to include each step along the way and describe it in enough detail to clarify the reason for the subsequent change. This will help ensure that they actually understand and can explain the connection between macroeconomic variables and the international movement of goods, services, and financial capital.
Preparing for the AP Exam
When taking the AP Exam, students commonly struggle to properly represent the foreign exchange market graphically and predict and explain the effects of changes in this market. It often helps to approach the teaching of the foreign exchange market as another application of the basic supply and demand model—when one nation demands another’s currency, the other nation must be willing to supply its own currency to trade, and this interaction determines the equilibrium price, or exchange rate. Be sure to spend sufficient time in class modeling how to graph the foreign exchange market with appropriately labeled curves and axes so students don’t needlessly lose points on the exam. When labeling the vertical axis, emphasize that the exchange rate is expressed in terms of one unit of the domestic currency.

Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 6.3, 6.4
Simulation and Debriefing
Carry out a classroom simulation to demonstrate how the value of a currency in the foreign
exchange market is established and how economic conditions influence the value of the
currency. Distribute pretend foreign currency to students and explain that they will need
to exchange their money for domestic currency in order to purchase a domestic good
(e.g., a candy bar). Carry out an auction for the domestic currency while recording the data.
Then change the scenario (e.g., distribute more money as a result of improved employment
conditions). Debrief the experience with students to ensure that connections are made to the concepts being studied.
2 6.4
Think-Pair-Share
Use the problem set on teaching foreign exchange in the Mastering Economic Thinking
Skills module. The problem set provides eight scenarios (p. 42) that will result in an
appreciation or depreciation of the value of a currency. Pair students and provide each pair
with one of the eight scenarios. Allow time for students to first individually draw graphs
indicating the effects of the situation on the foreign exchange market, using both the dollar
and the euro market. Then they should clearly indicate the effect on the exchange rate.
Have students share their responses with their partners. Once they come to a consensus,
have a representative from each of the eight scenarios go to the board to graph and explain the effects to the class.
3 6.5
Activating Prior Knowledge
After drawing correctly labeled graphs of a given currency and manipulating exchange
rates based on a change in market conditions, challenge students to determine a
subsequent change in net exports based on the exchange rate change shown on
their graph. Students will connect this to a change in aggregate demand (which they
were first introduced to in Unit 3), ultimately resulting in a change in output, price level, and unemployment.

The current account (CA) records net exports, net income from abroad, and net unilateral transfers.
MEA-4.A.2
The CA is not always balanced; it may show a surplus or a deficit. A nation’s balance of trade
(i.e., net exports) is part of the current account and may also show a surplus or a deficit.
MEA-4.A.3
The capital and financial account (CFA) records financial capital transfers and purchases and sales of assets between countries.
MEA-4.A.4
The CFA is not always balanced; it may show a surplus (financial capital inflow) or a deficit (financial capital outflow).
MEA-4.A.5
The balance of payments (BOP) is an accounting system that records a country’s international transactions for a particular time period. It consists of the CA and the CFA.
MEA-4.A.6
Any transaction that causes money to flow into a country is a credit to its BOP account, and any transaction that causes money to flow out is a debit. The sum of all credit entries should match the sum of all debit entries (CA+CFA=0).

Selecting and Using
Course Materials
Although a college-level textbook will cover the
required course content, students should also examine
alternative source material in different and varied forms
to develop the habits of thinking like an economist.
Textbooks
The AP Macroeconomics course requires the
use of a college-level textbook. It is unlikely that a
high-school-level textbook will cover the content and
skills of the course in the depth necessary to succeed
on the AP Exam. It is important to select a textbook that
covers the content of the AP Macroeconomics course
as detailed in the course framework. Additionally, a
textbook that emphasizes skill development will be
helpful in providing students with opportunities to
practice graphing, solving numerical problems, and explaining economic situations.
An example textbook list of college-level textbooks
that meet the AP Course Audit resource requirements is provided on AP Central.
Quantitative Sources
College-level economics courses require students to
engage with data in a variety of ways. New textbooks
and publishers’ resources often contain quantitative
information presented via charts, graphs, or other
infographics, but the data within them may quickly become out of date. The Federal Reserve Bank of
St. Louis’s FRED Economic Data is a good resource for
current data to practice quantitative skills with students, as are government agencies such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Bureau of Economic
Analysis (BEA).

Secondary Sources
Supplementing the textbook with editorials, journal articles, news articles, and essays and books by
economists can help bring course concepts to life and
encourage students to think critically. Using a variety
of sources that represent different points of view will engage students while enhancing learning.

Teaching the
AP Economics Courses
The AP Macroeconomics course framework presents
content in six units to be taught in a single semester.
If a teacher is offering both AP Macroeconomics and AP Microeconomics with the same students over the course of two semesters and does not want to
repeat the introductory material that is covered in both courses, they can use the AP Microeconomics course framework for Units 1 and 2. Following the
AP Microeconomics course framework for the
first two units will ensure coverage of topics that are included in the AP Microeconomics course
(e.g., consumer choice theory, elasticity, etc.) but not the AP Macroeconomics course. From there, they can proceed to AP Macroeconomics Unit 2 or AP Microeconomics Unit 3, depending on which course they choose to teach first.

Instructional Strategies
The AP Macroeconomics course framework outlines the concepts and skills
students need to master to be successful on the AP Exam. In order to address
those concepts and skills effectively, it helps to incorporate a variety of instructional
approaches into daily lessons and activities. The following table presents strategies
that can help students apply their understanding of course concepts.
Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Activating Prior
Knowledge
Students recall what they already know about a concept and make connections to current studies.
To prepare students to establish content connections.
When the topic of economic growth comes up in a later part of the course, ask students to recall what they already learned about economic growth in the first unit in the context of learning about the production possibilities curve (PPC).
Ask the Expert
Students are assigned as “experts” on topics they have mastered. Groups rotate through the expert stations to learn about topics they have not yet mastered.
To provide opportunities for students to share their knowledge and learn from one another.
To work through the costs that unexpected inflation and deflation impose on individuals, assign students to represent a specific segment of the population (e.g., lenders, borrowers, individuals living on fixed incomes, etc.), each of which serves as a station. Have students rotate through the stations as each expert explains how unexpected inflation or deflation affects the segment that he or she is representing.
Debate
Students engage in an informal or a formal argumentation of an issue.
The goal is to debate ideas without attacking the people who defend those ideas.
To provide students with an opportunity to collect and orally present evidence supporting the affirmative and negative arguments of a proposition or an issue.
Have students debate whether or not the
United States should adopt a balanced budget amendment.

Purpose
Example
Discussion
Groups
Students engage in an interactive, small-group discussion to consider a topic or question.
To gain new understanding or insight on a topic or question from multiple perspectives.
Assign students to mixed-ability groups to discuss the limitations of GDP.
Fishbowl
Students discuss specific topics within groups.
Some students form the inner circle and model appropriate discussion techniques, while an outer circle of students listens, responds, and evaluates.
To provide students with an opportunity to engage in a formal discussion and to experience roles both as participant and active listener.
Have students discuss fiscal and/or monetary policy actions that address a specific economic situation (e.g., stagflation, a recession).
Graph and Switch
Students generate a graph and then switch papers or whiteboards to review each other’s work.
To allow students to practice creating different representations and both give and receive immediate feedback.
Provide students with a given scenario (e.g., a given unemployment rate, a natural rate of unemployment, and an inflation rate) and ask students to draw a correctly labeled graph of the short-run and long-run
Phillips curves. Have students switch papers and provide feedback on each other’s work. Then change the situation (e.g., an increase in expected inflation) and repeat the exercise.
Group
Presentation
Students work with their peers to prepare a presentation on a given topic and then disseminate information to their classmates.
To provide students with an opportunity to work with one another to synthesize information for the purpose of disseminating it to their peers.
Create small groups of students and assign each to a country (such as the
United States or Japan) or a region (such as the European
Union or Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation) and ask them to prepare and deliver a presentation on how their country or region was affected by the
Great Recession and what monetary and/or fiscal policy actions were undertaken.
Have students include graphs in their presentation to describe the economic situation of their subject during the recession and the market impact of the fiscal and monetary policies.

Model Questions
Students answer questions from released
AP Exams.
To provide rigorous practice and assess students’ ability to respond to AP-level multiple-choice and free-response questions.
After teaching students about banking and the expansion of the money supply, provide an opportunity for students to practice answering a previous free-response question on the topic.
Numbered Heads
Together
Each student is assigned a number. Members of a group work together to agree on an answer to a question you pose.
Randomly select one number. The student with that number answers for the group.
To provide students with an opportunity to learn from one another and work together to reach a solution.
Use this strategy to work through a few problems that involve calculating and using multipliers.
Practice
Modeling
Model techniques for the class. Students then practice using those techniques and gain feedback from their peers.
To learn from the teacher’s example and then have opportunities for guided practice.
When introducing a new graph in the course, model it for students first by drawing it on the board, explaining what you are doing and why. Then provide an opportunity for students to practice generating the graph with appropriate labels themselves. Allow students to provide feedback to one another and circle the room to check for understanding.
QHT
Students expand their prior knowledge of vocabulary words by marking words with a Q, an
H, or a T (Q signals words students have a question about; H signals words students have heard and might be able to identify;
T signals words students know well enough to teach to their peers).
To allow students to build on their prior knowledge of words and to provide a forum for peer teaching and learning of new words.
When introducing financial assets, provide students with a list of critical vocabulary (e.g., stock, bond, interest rate, loan). Have students mark the list with a Q for words they have a question about, an H for words they have heard and might be able to identify, and a T for words they know well enough to teach to their peers.
Discuss their markings as a class and have students who marked any words with a T describe the terms to their classmates.

Purpose
Example
Real-World
Examples
Teacher and students relate personal stories, examples, or anecdotes to illustrate key content.
To create relevance and personal meaning of economic terms and models, which can otherwise be very abstract for students.
Ask students to explain the trade-offs they face in their lives when choosing how to allocate the limited time they have before school.
Connect the conversation to the concepts of scarcity and opportunity cost.
Simplify the
Problem
Students use simpler numbers or examples to help solve a problem.
To provide insight into the strategies needed to solve the problem.
When introducing the idea of real versus nominal measures, provide students with a tangible example to which they can relate. One popular example involves looking at the highest grossing movies. Students can practice using the GDP deflator for those years to find which movie made the most money in real terms.
Simulation and Debriefing
Students assume the role of characters or economic agents in a simulation or case study. Students then discuss and reflect on the activity to clarify its purpose.
To help students better grasp a concept by participating in short, memorable experiences.
Carry out a classroom auction for an item of value in order to introduce students to the concept of demand.
Debrief as a class to reflect on the purpose and meaning of the activity.
Socratic
Seminar
This is a focused discussion in which students engage with open-ended questions tied to a specific topic or text. The discussion continues with student responses and, when needed, additional open ended questions that allow students to express their ideas and engage in complex thinking.
To help students arrive at a new understanding by asking questions that clarify; challenge assumptions; question facts, reasons, and evidence; or examine implications and outcomes.
Have students participate in a Socratic seminar in order to explain GDP and how it is measured.

Systematic and Explicit
Instruction
Instruction that involves a teacher demonstrating a specific plan for solving problem types and students using this plan to think their way through a solution.
To provide students with procedures and questions to ask when solving problems.
Demonstrate a specific plan for solving problems that ask students to determine appropriate terms of trade between two parties. Systematically walk through an example that involves first calculating the opportunity cost of producing each good or service and then evaluating that data to determine the range of values at which specialization and trade according to their comparative advantages would be beneficial to each party.
Think-Pair-Share
Students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with the class.
To construct meaning about a topic or question by first developing ideas individually that are then tested and revised with a partner and the class.
Provide students with a worksheet that has a series of scenarios, some of which represent a change in supply or demand and some of which represent movement along a demand or supply curve. Have students complete the worksheet on their own and then pair with a partner to explain whether the situation represents a change in demand/supply or movement along a demand/ supply curve. Have students share with the entire class.
Vocabulary
Notebook
Using a designated format such as a notebook, journal or personal list to maintain an ongoing list of vocabulary words, definitions, and connection to academic study.
To facilitate and sustain a systematic process of vocabulary development.
Scarcity is the first topic of the course, and students will immediately be introduced to important economic terms that will come up throughout the course. Have students start a vocabulary notebook with definitions of key terms (e.g., scarcity, economics, land, labor, capital) and continue to add to their notebook with each new topic.

Developing Course Skills
Throughout the course, students will develop skills
that are fundamental to the discipline of economics.
Students will benefit from multiple opportunities to
develop these skills in a scaffolded manner since they
represent the complex skills that adept economists demonstrate.
The AP Macroeconomics course framework provides
a suggested skill for each course topic. However, the
suggested skill provided should not be the only one
used to teach any given topic. One skill is provided as
a starting point for thinking about how to approach
teaching that topic, but it is important in the discipline
of economics for students to be able to use all the
skills. For example, “Topic 1.4: Demand” suggests skill
“4.A: Draw an accurately labeled graph or visual to represent an economic model or market.” When
approaching the topic of demand, students will need
to be able to draw a demand curve (Skill Category 4).
However, within that given topic, students will also
need to do things like describe the law of demand (Skill
Category 1), explain what might have caused a shift
in the demand curve (Skill Category 2), and predict
and explain the result of a change in a determinant of demand (Skill Category 3).
The tables on the pages that follow look at each skill
category and provide examples of questions for each
skill, along with sample activities and strategies for incorporating that skill into the course.

1:  Principles and Models 30–40% of the multiple-choice questions assess students’ ability to define economic principles and models.
Students will need to describe and compare economic concepts, principles, and models. Additionally, students will need to identify economic concepts, principles, or models illustrated by an example.
Numerical Analysis
Skill Categories 1, 2, and 3 all include skills that require analyzing numbers or performing calculations to identify economic concepts, principles, or models (Skill 1.C), to interpret outcomes (Skill 2.C), and to determine the effects of changes (Skill 3.C).
16–20% of total multiple-choice questions will include analyzing numbers or performing calculations.
2: Interpretation 25–32% of the multiple-choice questions assess
students’ ability to explain given economic outcomes.
Students will need to explain how a specific economic outcome occurs, given one or more contributing
variables, or what action(s) should be taken in order to achieve a specific economic outcome.
3: Manipulation 30–40% of the multiple-choice questions assess
students’ ability to determine outcomes of specific economic situations.
Students will need to use economic concepts,
principles, or models to determine the outcome of an
economic situation or determine the effects of one or more changes on other economic markets.
4:  Graphing and Visuals
Skill Category 4 is not assessed in multiple-choice
questions since it requires students to draw a graph
or visual representation, which can only be assessed
on the free-response section of the exam. However,
students will be expected to answer multiple-choice
questions in which a graph or visual representation is provided.

Big Idea 1: Economic Measurements (MEA)
Economists construct measurements to monitor the state of an economy and evaluate its performance
over time. Governments, firms, and citizens often use these measurements to help inform policy, business, and personal decisions.
Enduring
Understanding
Learning Objective
Essential Knowledge
MEA-1
An economy’s performance can be measured by different indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP), the inflation rate, and the unemployment rate.
MEA-1.A a. Define (using the circular flow diagram as appropriate) how GDP is measured and its components.
b. Calculate nominal GDP.
MEA-1.A.1
GDP is a measure of final output of the economy.
MEA-1.A.2
GDP as a total flow of income and expenditure can be represented by the circular flow diagram.
MEA-1.A.3
There are three ways of measuring GDP: the expenditures
approach, the income approach, and the value-added approach.
MEA-1.B
Define the limitations of GDP.
MEA-1.B.1
GDP is a useful indicator of a nation’s economic performance,
but it has some limitations, such as failing to account for nonmarket transactions.
MEA-1.C a. Define the labor force, the unemployment rate, and the labor force participation rate.
b.	 Explain how changes in employment and the labor market affect the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate.
c. Calculate the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate.
MEA-1.C.1
The unemployment rate is the percentage of the labor force that is out of work.
MEA-1.C.2
The labor force participation rate is another measure of
the labor market activity in an economy. The labor force
participation rate is the percentage of the adult population that is in the labor force.
MEA-1.D
Define the limitations of the unemployment rate.
MEA-1.D.1
The measured unemployment rate is often criticized for
understating the level of joblessness because it excludes
groups such as discouraged workers and part-time workers.

Big Idea 1: Economic Measurements (MEA)  cont’d
Enduring
Understanding
Learning Objective
Essential Knowledge
MEA-1
An economy’s performance can be measured by different indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP), the inflation rate, and the unemployment rate.
MEA-1.E a. Define the types of unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment.
b. Explain changes in the types of unemployment.
MEA-1.E.1
Economists primarily focus on three types of unemployment:
cyclical, frictional, and structural.
MEA-1.E.2
The natural rate of unemployment is the unemployment rate
that would exist when the economy produces full-employment
real output. It is equal to the sum of frictional and structural unemployment.
MEA-1.E.3
The deviation of the actual unemployment rate from the natural rate is cyclical unemployment.
MEA-1.E.4
The natural rate of unemployment can gradually change
over time because of such things as changes in labor force characteristics.
MEA-1.F a. Define the consumer price index (CPI), inflation, deflation, disinflation, the inflation rate, and real variables.
b. Explain how price indices can be used to calculate the inflation rate and to compare nominal variables over time periods.
c.	 Calculate the CPI, the inflation rate, and changes in real variables.
MEA-1.F.1
The consumer price index (CPI) measures the change in income
a consumer would need in order to maintain the same standard
of living over time under a new set of prices as under the original set of prices.
MEA-1.F.2
The CPI measures the cost of a fixed basket of goods and
services in a given year relative to the base year.
X  Exclusion:
Calculating the producer price index (PPI) is beyond the scope of the course and AP Exam.
MEA-1.F.3
The inflation rate is determined by calculating the percentage
change in a price index such as the CPI or GDP deflator.
MEA-1.F.4
Real variables, such as real wages, are the nominal variables deflated by the price level.
MEA-1.G
Define the shortcomings of the CPI as a true measure of inflation.
MEA-1.G.1
The CPI as a measure of inflation has some shortcomings,
such as substitution bias, causing it to overstate the true inflation rate.
MEA-1.H
Explain the costs that unexpected inflation (deflation) imposes on individuals and the economy.
MEA-1.H.1
Unexpected inflation arbitrarily redistributes wealth from one

Essential Knowledge
MEA-1
An economy’s performance can be measured by different indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP), the inflation rate, and the unemployment rate.
MEA-1.I
Define nominal GDP and real GDP.
MEA-1.I.1
Nominal GDP is a measure of how much is spent on output.
Real GDP is a measure of how much is produced.
MEA-1.I.2
Nominal GDP measures aggregate output using current prices.
Real GDP measures aggregate output using constant prices,
thus removing the effect of changes in the overall price level.
MEA-1.J
Calculate real GDP and the
GDP deflator.
MEA-1.J.1
One way of measuring real GDP is to weigh final goods and
services by their prices in a base year. Because this can lead to
overstatement of real GDP growth, statistical agencies actually use different methods.
MEA-1.J.2
Nominal GDP can be converted to real GDP by using the
GDP deflator.
MEA-2
The economy fluctuates between periods of expansion and contraction in the short run, but economic growth can occur in the long run.
MEA-2.A a.	 Define (using graphs and data as appropriate) turning points and phases of the business cycle.
b. Explain (using graphs and data as appropriate) turning points and phases of the business cycle.
MEA-2.A.1
Business cycles are fluctuations in aggregate output and
employment because of changes in aggregate supply and/or aggregate demand.
MEA-2.A.2
The phases of a business cycle are recession and expansion.
MEA-2.A.3
The turning points of a business cycle are peak and trough.
MEA-2.A.4
The difference between actual output and potential output is the output gap.
MEA-2.A.5
Potential output is also called full-employment output. It is the
level of GDP where unemployment is equal to the natural rate of unemployment. [See EK MEA-1.E.2]

MEA-2.B a. Define measures and determinants of economic growth.
b. Explain (using graphs and data as appropriate) the determinants of economic growth.
c. Calculate (using graphs and data as appropriate) per capita GDP and economic growth.
MEA-2.B.1
Economic growth can be measured as the growth rate in real
GDP per capita over time.
MEA-2.B.2
Aggregate employment and aggregate output are directly
related because firms need to employ more workers in order
to produce more output, holding other factors constant. This is captured by the aggregate production function.
MEA-2.B.3
Output per employed worker is a measure of average labor productivity.
MEA-2.B.4
Productivity is determined by the level of technology and physical and human capital per worker.
MEA-2.B.5
The aggregate production function shows that output per
capita is positively related to both physical and human capital per capita.
MEA-3
Money makes it possible to compare the value of goods and services, and interest rates provide a measure of the price of money that is borrowed or saved.
MEA-3.A a. Define the principal attributes—liquidity, rate of return, and risk— associated with various classes of financial assets, including money.
b. Explain the relationship between the price of previously issued bonds and interest rates.
MEA-3.A.1
The most liquid forms of money are cash and demand deposits.
MEA-3.A.2
Other financial assets people can hold in place of the most
liquid forms of money include bonds (interest-bearing assets) and stocks (equity).
MEA-3.A.3
The price of previously issued bonds and interest rates on bonds are inversely related.
MEA-3.A.4
The opportunity cost of holding money is the interest that could
have been earned from holding other financial assets such as bonds.

b.	 Explain the relationship between changes in nominal interest rates, expected inflation, and real interest rates.
c. Calculate the nominal and real interest rate.
MEA-3.B.1
A nominal interest rate is the rate of interest paid for a loan, unadjusted for inflation.
MEA-3.B.2
Lenders and borrowers establish nominal interest rates as the
sum of their expected real interest rate and expected inflation.
MEA-3.B.3
A real interest rate can be calculated in hindsight by subtracting
the actual inflation rate from the nominal interest rate.
MEA-3.C a. Define money and its functions.
b.	 Calculate (using data as appropriate) measures of money.
MEA-3.C.1
Money is any asset that is accepted as a means of payment.
MEA-3.C.2
Money serves as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value.
MEA-3.C.3
The money supply is measured using monetary aggregates designated as M1 and M2.
MEA-3.C.4
The monetary base (often labeled as M0 or MB) includes currency in circulation and bank reserves.
MEA-4
Foreign trade accounting measures the flow of goods, services, and financial capital between countries.
MEA-4.A a. Define the current account (CA), the capital and financial account (CFA), and the balance of payments (BOP).
b. Explain how changes in the components of the CA and CFA affect a country’s BOP.
c.	 Calculate the CA, the CFA, and the BOP.
MEA-4.A.1
The current account (CA) records net exports, net income from abroad, and net unilateral transfers.
MEA-4.A.2
The CA is not always balanced; it may show a surplus or a
deficit. A nation’s balance of trade (i.e., net exports) is part of the
current account and may also show a surplus or a deficit.
MEA-4.A.3
The capital and financial account (CFA) records financial capital
transfers and purchases and sales of assets between countries.
MEA-4.A.4
The CFA is not always balanced; it may show a surplus (financial
capital inflow) or a deficit (financial capital outflow).
MEA-4.A.5
The balance of payments (BOP) is an accounting system that
records a country’s international transactions for a particular time period. It consists of the CA and the CFA.
MEA-4.A.6
Any transaction that causes money to flow into a country is
a credit to its BOP account, and any transaction that causes
money to flow out is a debit. The sum of all credit entries should match the sum of all debit entries (CA+CFA=0).

MOD-1
The production possibilities curve (PPC) model is used to demonstrate the full employment level of output and to illustrate changes in full employment.
MOD-1.A
Define scarcity and economic resources.
MOD-1.A.1
Individuals and societies are forced to make choices because most resources are scarce.
MOD-1.B a.	 Define (using graphs as appropriate) the PPC and related terms.
b. Explain (using graphs as appropriate) how the PPC illustrates opportunity costs, tradeoffs, inefficiency, efficiency, and economic growth or contraction under various conditions.
c. Calculate (using data from PPCs or tables as appropriate) opportunity cost.
MOD-1.B.1
The PPC is a model used to show the tradeoffs associated with allocating resources.
MOD-1.B.2
The PPC can be used to illustrate the concepts of scarcity,
opportunity cost, efficiency, underutilized resources, and economic growth or contraction.
MOD-1.B.3
The shape of the PPC depends on whether opportunity costs are constant, increasing, or decreasing.
MOD-1.B.4
The PPC can shift because of changes in factors of production as well as changes in productivity/technology.
MOD-1.B.5
Economic growth results in an outward shift of the PPC.
MOD-1.C
Explain (using graphs as appropriate) how the PPC is related to the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve.
MOD-1.C.1
An outward shift in the PPC is analogous to a rightward shift of
the long-run aggregate supply curve. [See LO MOD-2.I]
MOD-2
Economists use the aggregate demand– aggregate supply model to represent the relationship between the price level and aggregate output in an economy and to illustrate how output, employment, and the price level respond to macroeconomic shocks.
MOD-2.A a. Define (using graphs as appropriate) the aggregate demand (AD) curve.
b. Explain (using graphs as appropriate) the slope of the AD curve and its determinants.
MOD-2.A.1
The aggregate demand (AD) curve describes the relationship
between the price level and the quantity of goods and services
demanded by households (consumption), firms (investment),
government (government spending), and the rest of the world (net exports).
MOD-2.A.2
The negative slope of the AD curve is explained by the real
wealth effect, the interest rate effect, and the exchange rate effect. [See EK MKT-3.A.1]
MOD-2.A.3
Any change in the components of aggregate demand
(consumption, investment, government spending, or net
exports) that is not due to changes in the price level leads to a shift of the AD curve.

MOD-2.B a. Define the expenditure multiplier, the tax multiplier, the marginal propensity to consume, and the marginal propensity to save.
b. Explain how changes in spending and taxes lead to changes in real GDP.
c. Calculate how changes in spending and taxes lead to changes in real GDP.
MOD-2.B.1
A $1 change to autonomous expenditures leads to further changes in total expenditures and total output.
MOD-2.B.2
The expenditure multiplier quantifies the size of the change
in aggregate demand as a result of a change in any of the components of aggregate demand.
MOD-2.B.3
The tax multiplier quantifies the size of the change in aggregate demand as a result of a change in taxes.
MOD-2.B.4
The expenditure multiplier and tax multiplier depend on the marginal propensity to consume.
MOD-2.B.5
The marginal propensity to consume is the change in consumer
spending divided by the change in disposable income. The sum
of the marginal propensity to consume and marginal propensity to save is equal to one.
MOD-2.C a. Define (using graphs as appropriate) the short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve.
b. Explain (using graphs as appropriate) the slope of the SRAS curve and its determinants.
MOD-2.C.1
The short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve describes the
relationship between the price level and the quantity of goods and services supplied in an economy.
MOD-2.C.2
The SRAS curve is upward-sloping because of sticky wages and prices. [See EK MOD-2.E.1]
MOD-2.C.3
Any factor that causes production costs to change, such as a
change in inflationary expectations, will cause the SRAS curve to shift.
MOD-2.D
Explain (using graphs as appropriate) how movement along the SRAS curve implies a relationship between the price level (and inflation) and unemployment.
MOD-2.D.1
Moving along the SRAS curve, an increase in the price
level is associated with an increase in output, which means
employment must correspondingly rise. With the labor
force held constant, unemployment will fall. So, there is a
short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment.
[See EK MOD-3.A.1]
MOD-2.E
Define (using graphs as appropriate) the short run and the long run.
MOD-2.E.1
In the long run all prices and wages are fully flexible, while in the
short run some input prices are fixed. A consequence of flexible
long-run prices and wages is the lack of a long-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment.

Economists use the aggregate demand– aggregate supply model to represent the relationship between the price level and aggregate output in an economy and to illustrate how output, employment, and the price level respond to macroeconomic shocks.
MOD-2.F
Define (using graphs as appropriate) the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve.
MOD-2.F.1
The LRAS curve corresponds to the production possibilities
curve (PPC) because they both represent maximum sustainable
capacity. Maximum sustainable capacity is the total output an
economic system will produce over a set period of time if all resources are fully employed. [See LO MOD-2.I]
MOD-2.F.2
The LRAS curve is vertical at the full-employment level of
output because in the long run wages and prices fully adjust.
MOD-2.G
Explain (using graphs as appropriate) the short-run and long-run equilibrium price level and output level.
MOD-2.G.1
Short-run equilibrium occurs when the aggregate quantity
of output demanded and the aggregate quantity of output
supplied are equal—i.e., at the intersection of the AD and SRAS curves.
MOD-2.G.2
Long-run equilibrium occurs when the AD and SRAS curves
intersect on the LRAS—i.e., at the full-employment level of real output.
MOD-2.G.3
The short-run equilibrium output can be at the full-employment
level of output, above it, or below it, creating positive
(i.e., inflationary) or negative (i.e., recessionary) output gaps.
MOD-2.H
Explain (using graphs as appropriate) the response of output, employment, and the price level to an aggregate demand or aggregate supply shock in the short run.
MOD-2.H.1
A positive (negative) shock in AD causes output, employment,
and the price level to rise (fall) in the short run.
MOD-2.H.2
A positive (negative) shock in SRAS causes output and
employment to rise (fall) and the price level to fall (rise) in the short run.
MOD-2.H.3
Inflation can be caused by changes in aggregate demand (demand-pull) or aggregate supply (cost-push).
MOD-2.I
Explain (using graphs as appropriate) the response of output, employment, and the price level to an aggregate demand or aggregate supply shock in the long run.
MOD-2.I.1
In the long run, in the absence of government policy actions,
flexible wages and prices will adjust to restore full employment
and unemployment will revert to its natural rate after a
shock to aggregate demand or short-run aggregate supply.
[See EK MEA-1.E.2]
MOD-2.I.2
Shifts in the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve
indicate changes in the full-employment level of output and economic growth.

POL-1.A a.	 Define fiscal policy and related terms.
b.	 Explain (using graphs as appropriate) the short-run effects of a fiscal policy action.
c.	 Calculate the short-run effects of a fiscal policy action.
POL-1.A.1
Governments implement fiscal policies to achieve macroeconomic goals, such as full employment.
POL-1.A.2
The tools of fiscal policy are government spending and taxes/ transfers.
POL-1.A.3
Changes in government spending affect aggregate demand
directly, and changes in taxes/transfers affect aggregate demand indirectly.
POL-1.A.4
The government spending multiplier is greater than the tax multiplier.
POL-1.A.5
Expansionary or contractionary fiscal policies are used to
restore full employment when the economy is in a negative (i.e.,
recessionary) or positive (i.e., inflationary) output gap.
POL-1.A.6
Fiscal policy can influence aggregate demand, real output,
and the price level. [See also EK MKT-5.E.2 for the effect on exchange rates.]
POL-1.A.7
The AD–AS model is used to demonstrate the short-run effects of fiscal policy.
POL-1.B
Define why there are lags to discretionary fiscal policy.
POL-1.B.1
In reality, there are lags to discretionary fiscal policy because of
factors such as the time it takes to decide on and implement a policy action.
POL-1.C a. Define automatic stabilizers.
b.	 Explain how automatic stabilizers moderate business cycles.
POL-1.C.1
Automatic stabilizers support the economy during recessions
and help prevent the economy from being overheated during expansionary periods.
POL-1.C.2
Tax revenues decrease automatically as GDP falls, preventing consumption and the economy from falling further.
POL-1.C.3
Tax revenues increase automatically as GDP rises, slowing
consumption and preventing the economy from overheating.
POL-1.C.4
Government policies, institutions, or agencies may also have
social service programs whose transfer payments act as automatic stabilizers.

POL-1
Fiscal and monetary policy have short-run effects on macroeconomic outcomes.
POL-1.D a. Define monetary policy and related terms.
b.	 Explain (using graphs as appropriate) the short run effects of a monetary policy action.
c. Calculate (using data and balance sheets as appropriate) the effects of a monetary policy action.
POL-1.D.1
Central banks implement monetary policies to achieve macroeconomic goals, such as price stability.
POL-1.D.2
The tools of monetary policy may include the central bank’s
discount rate and other administered interest rates (e.g., interest
on reserves), open market operations, and the required reserve
ratio. The tools used and the way in which they are implemented
differ between economies that have limited reserves in their
banking system and economies that have ample reserves in
their banking system. (The banking system in the United States
has ample reserves, and the Federal Reserve’s key policy tool is interest on reserves.)
POL-1.D.3
When the central bank conducts an open-market purchase
(sale), reserves increase (decrease), thereby increasing (decreasing) the monetary base.
POL-1.D.4
When the central bank conducts an open-market purchase
(sale) in an economy with limited reserves, the effect on the
money supply is greater than the effect on the monetary base because of the money multiplier.
POL-1.D.5
Many central banks carry out policy to hit a target range for
an overnight interbank lending rate, sometimes referred to as
the central bank’s policy rate. (In the United States, this is the federal funds rate.)
POL-1.D.6
Central banks can influence the nominal interest rate in the
short run, which in turn will affect investment and consumption.
[See also EK MKT-5.G.2 for the influence on net capital inflows.]
In an economy with limited reserves, the central bank can
influence the nominal interest rate by changing the money
supply. In an economy with ample reserves, changes in the
money supply do not effectively change the nominal interest
rate; instead, the central bank can influence the nominal interest rate by changing its administered interest rates.
POL-1.D.7
Expansionary or contractionary monetary policies are used to
restore full employment when the economy is in a negative (i.e.,
recessionary) or positive (i.e., inflationary) output gap.
POL-1.D.8
Monetary policy can influence interest rates, aggregate
demand, real output, and the price level. [See also EK MKT-5.E.3 for the effect on exchange rates.]
POL-1.D.9
A money market model, a reserve market model, and/or the
AD–AS model may be used to demonstrate the short-run effects of monetary policy.

POL-1
Fiscal and monetary policy have short-run effects on macroeconomic outcomes.
POL-1.E
Define why there are lags to monetary policy.
POL-1.E.1
In reality, there are lags to monetary policy caused by the time
it takes to recognize a problem in the economy and the time it takes the economy to adjust to the policy action.
POL-1.F
Explain (using graphs as appropriate) the effects of combined fiscal and monetary policy actions.
POL-1.F.1
A combination of expansionary or contractionary fiscal and
monetary policies may be used to restore full employment
when the economy is in a negative (i.e., recessionary) or positive (i.e., inflationary) output gap.
POL-1.F.2
A combination of fiscal and monetary policies can influence
aggregate demand, real output, the price level, and interest
rates. [For additional details on fiscal and monetary policy
actions and how to demonstrate their effects graphically, see LO POL-1.A and LO POL-1.D.]
POL-2
The banking system plays an important role in the expansion of the money supply.
POL-2.A a.	 Define key terms related to the banking system and the expansion of the money supply.
b.	 Explain how the banking system creates and expands the money supply.
c.	 Calculate (using data and balance sheets as appropriate) the effects of changes in the banking system.
POL-2.A.1
Depository institutions (such as commercial banks) organize their assets and liabilities on balance sheets.
POL-2.A.2
Depository institutions operate using fractional reserve banking.
POL-2.A.3
Banks’ reserves are divided into required reserves and excess reserves.
POL-2.A.4
Excess reserves are the basis of expansion of the money supply by the banking system.
POL-2.A.5
The money multiplier is the ratio of the money supply to the monetary base.
POL-2.A.6
The size of expansion of the money supply depends on the money multiplier.
POL-2.A.7
The maximum value of the money multiplier can be calculated as the reciprocal of the required reserve ratio.
POL-2.A.8
The amount predicted by the simple money multiplier may
be overstated because it does not take into account a
bank’s desire to hold excess reserves or the public holding more currency.

POL-3
There are long-run implications of monetary and fiscal policy.
POL-3.A a.	 Explain (using graphs as appropriate) how inflation is a monetary phenomenon.
b.	 Define the quantity theory of money.
c.	 Calculate the money supply, velocity, the price level, and real output using the quantity theory of money.
POL-3.A.1
Inflation (deflation) results from increasing (decreasing) the
money supply at too rapid of a rate for a sustained period of time.
POL-3.A.2
When the economy is at full employment, changes in the money
supply have no effect on real output in the long run.
POL-3.A.3
In the long run, the growth rate of the money supply determines
the growth rate of the price level (inflation rate) according to the quantity theory of money.
POL-3.B a.	 Define the government budget surplus (deficit) and national debt.
b. Explain the issues involved with the burden of the national debt.
POL-3.B.1
The government budget surplus (deficit) is the difference
between tax revenues and government purchases plus transfer payments in a given year.
POL-3.B.2
A government adds to the national debt when it runs a budget deficit.
POL-3.B.3
A government must pay interest on its accumulated debt, thus
increasing the national debt and increasingly forgoing using
those funds for alternative uses. [See also LO POL-3.C on crowding out.]
POL-3.C a.	 Define crowding out.
b.	 Explain (using graphs as appropriate) how fiscal policy may cause crowding out.
POL-3.C.1
When a government is in budget deficit, it typically borrows to finance its spending.
POL-3.C.2
A loanable funds market model can be used to show the effect
of government borrowing on the equilibrium real interest
rate and the resulting crowding out of private investment.
[See MKT-4]
POL-3.C.3
Crowding out refers to the adverse effect of increased
government borrowing, which leads to decreased levels of
interest-sensitive private sector spending in the short run.
POL-3.C.4
A potential long-run impact of crowding out is a lower rate of
physical capital accumulation and less economic growth as a result.

POL-4.A.2
Government policies that invest in infrastructure and technology affect growth.
POL-4.A.3
Supply-side fiscal policies affect aggregate demand, aggregate
supply, and potential output in the short run and long run by
influencing incentives that affect household and business economic behavior.

AP Macroeconomics Graphs and Visuals
Students are expected to model economic situations using graphs or visual representations throughout the
AP Macroeconomics course. The pages that follow identify the graphs and visuals that are required on the AP
Macroeconomics Exam along with the associated learning objectives. One illustrative example of the set-up of
each graph or visual is provided for reference; however, it is only one example and students are expected to do
more than simply set up a graph or visual on the AP Macroeconomics Exam. As the AP Economics Skills outline,
students must be able to demonstrate their understanding of specific economic situations on accurately labeled
graphs (e.g., via properly labeled and placed points and curves) and demonstrate the effect of changes on
accurately labeled graphs or visuals (e.g., via properly labeled shifts in curves, new quantities and/or prices, and
arrows indicating the direction of change). Students must also be able to interpret and manipulate provided graphs
and visuals representing different economic situations. To access past AP Exam questions and formative practice
questions that use graphs or visual representations, teachers can visit the AP Question Bank on AP Classroom
and filter questions by stimulus, skill, topic, and other criteria.
Draw and Analyze Provided Graphs and Visuals
The following graphs and visuals are relevant in the context of both the multiple-choice and free-response
sections of the AP Macroeconomics exam. This means that students should be able to answer questions about
a provided graph or visual of each of the following models and be able to draw a graph or visual themselves using each of the following models.
