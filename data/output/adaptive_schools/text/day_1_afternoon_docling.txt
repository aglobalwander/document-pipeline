WHAT?  metaphor -&gt; collaboration looks like in systems

WHY?  importance of work with collaboration

FRACTALS WHAT?

A metaphor for what collaboration can look like in systems

WHY?

To provide a way for participants to remember importance of their work with collaboration

in geometry, through invention of IBM mathematician Benoit (Benwau) Mandelbrot

Visual side of math https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56gzV0od6DU

used to thinking of coastlines as static

real coastline looks much different than map

coastline ever changing due -&gt; external elements / forces against - waves and sea level

mathematical model that track marks left by the passage of energy and motion

Fractal geometry visualizes the way things fold, unfold / refold

feed back into each other

Mandelbrot set-&gt;geometrical shape / icon of how world works

Element of 'sameness'

Same details on all levels of magnification

Theoretically this shape could go on forever

Within pattern of fractals are similar details on many different scales.

Trees, circulatory systems (heart+), lightning

Snowflakes, broccoli, ferns and artichokes everyday examples of fractal scaling.

Snowflakes, amazingly different, but within each single one is internal sameness

Each part contains within it the whole

YOU are a fractal--one cell / genetic makeup multiplied many times over

Fractals reveal a repetition of patterns across scale.

## echoes fractally-microscopic / telescopic

The smallest section of a fern is repeated over scale, showing the whole in the smallest part.

metaphor -&gt; collaboration looks like in systems

Classrooms, schools and districts-similar details on many different scales display fractal scaling in their values, patterns of interaction, dispositions towards power and control.

classroom patterns repeated at school / district levels.

district / school patterns repeated in patterns seen in classrooms.

One piece of system contains whole -identities, beliefs, values, assumptions.

about repeated patterns that offer feedback loops to system echoes fractally- social systems behave fractally

Fractals describe the patterns of energy within dynamic change and transformations. are images of the way things fold, unfold and refold, as they feed back into each other and themselves. Holographic-take 1 part of picture, have whole.

Fractal geometry is used to mathematically model the tracks and marks left by the passage of activity. The fracture marks left in the earth by an earthquake or a winding coastline scored by the turbulence of ocean wind and waves are examples of fractals in the natural world. When a dynamic thunderstorm self-organizes into a tornado, it leaves behind a fractal shape of its destruction.

focuses on broken, wrinkled and uneven shapes.

used to mathematically model the tracks and marks left by the passage of activity.

Classrooms, schools and districts display fractal scaling in their values, patterns of interaction and dispositions.

Our intention is to have collaboration as a fractal in the system. So what's happening in the classroom is reflected in what's happening in the school, in the district, and even the boardroom.

Trainers might include examples, such as:

A teacher provides an alternative to fluorescent lighting in her classroom. Other teacher began the same practice noting positive impact on student energy.

Two teachers determined to speak to each other with obvious courtesy in the hallway as students are passing. Students began to imitate the two teachers and these language patterns began to spread throughout the school.

Comes from tradition of conductors on trains announcing the next stops

## How?

Use charted agenda, or slide.

What: what mean by adaptive

Why: central concept / organizing principle of the AS work.

To use tools, must understand whole.

foundation for all that follows

How:  balance of 4 days:  how become adaptive

Being adaptive -- 3 elements

What is an adaptive school?

Why does that matter?

How are you adaptive--moment to moment and over time?

Suggested Language:

WHAT?

We'll describe what we mean by adaptive and explore what it is, why it is so important to your schools and how-in a reader's digest form--you can achieve it. The balance of the workshop is more about how to become adaptive.

## WHY?

Adaptivity is the organizing principle of the Adaptive Schools work. To effectively use the tools, one must understand the whole. This is the foundation for all that follows.

## HOW?

## Inductive process

10-2 Trainer Input using the slides, followed by Pairs Process.

## Suggested Language:

We will be start by exploring the 'What?' and looking at a variety of examples that demonstrate the significance of identity changes.

inductive process of constructing your understanding of adaptive

examples:  significance of identity changes

We'll begin by looking at librarians who have transitioned from being the providers of resources to becoming the developers of others' resources.

Follow this language pattern for all the examples.

Trainers may wish to add pertinent local examples. In doing so, follow the To/From pattern.

biological world for example of adapted species:

Monarch butterfly

lays eggs on milkweed plant

Eggs hatch

larvae eat milkweed.

Attach Chrysalis

Milkweed plant = weed. killed it to build communities.

no more monarch butterfly

Has adapted to its environment-- past tense

think linear / nonlinear (Heifitz' Adaptive Leadership)

å

Adapted / linear:   A + B = C

leaders / organizations use predominantly technical, linear, logical problem-solving approaches answer?--structures, schedules

Show Adapted vs. Adaptive slide.

## Suggested Language:

The science of evolutionary biology explains adaptivity by first contrasting it with being adapted. Monarch butterflies are good examples of an adapted species. They lay their eggs only on milkweed plants. When the larvae hatch they feed on milkweed leaves, growing until it is time to spin a chrysalis that is attached to the milkweed plant. The larvae metamorphose into adult butterflies and the cycle repeats. Without milkweed, the monarchs are in danger.

Show Adapted definition slide.

Suggested Language:

Adapted means to have evolved through specialization to fit specific conditions within tightly defined boundaries.

The Monarch butterfly is a premiere example.

Adaptive / nonlinear:  A + B could give R+M+O or P+I+J

Show slide of deer in backyard for an example.

## Suggested Language:

Deer, coyote, and raccoons serve as familiar counter-examples of species thriving even with loss of habitat. In many parts of the country housing development spreads, yet animals such as these survive, becoming adaptive to their environments.

WHAT:  Definition of adaptive.

## Form

1 -ways structure our organizations 2 -ways do our work B's-bells, buses, beans, behinds, books

To change form-&gt;need to clarify identity

Show slide with definition of Adaptive

***not strongest of species that survive, nor most intelligent, but one most responsive to change

## Suggested Language:

When we use the word 'form,' we mean the ways we structure our organizations and how, where, and when we do our work. Examples include schedules, processes, and sequences that have become habitual.

When we clarify our identity-from a hospital healing the sick to a hospital promoting health-we break habits and behave differently.

Keep doing what always done, keep getting what already got definition of insanity-knowing don't like results, but keep doing things-same expecting different things

New challenges require new / increasingly flexible forms

THE WHY OF ADAPTIVITY: DRIVING FORCES WHAT?

Acknowledging the forces in our environment driving schools to be adaptive

Support organizations in being proactive, rather than reactive

WHY? Enhanced student success Maintain capacity to deal with change

half sheets

Talked about WHAT adaptive is, now move to WHY need to do it One from each table

## HOW?

Have table groups generate lists of the forces around them that are spurring the need for adaptivity for them and their organizations (e.g., demographics, accountability, systems, technology, community expectations)

Groups report out and trainers have the option of recording on a master chart.

How? asked questions every month teach to kids, parents, etc.

## offers:

- -clarity in identity

-focused / thoughtful in decision-making

-examining / breaking of patterns -&gt; adaptive

THE HOW OF ADAPTIVITY: FOCUSING QUESTIONS

LG, p. 26

Suggested Language:

WHAT?

Focusing Questions offers one strategy for the 'How' of becoming adaptive.

## WHY?

Schools that make these three questions part of their practice are focused and thoughtful in their approach to decision-making. These questions support clarity in identity and the breaking of patterns, leading to greater adaptivity.

## HOW?

Trainer gives short input on each question with examples; trainer may add other appropriate examples.

Why identity important?  Holds everything.

Identity is biggest container-inside are beliefs, values, assumptions, perceptions, capabilities, behaviors

## Who believe are dictates actions

Lecturer / Guide-practices will be different

What believe about us? About students? Their parents?  Our organization?

Anthropology study:  hallway when no one there valued by institution? How space arranged? What's in trophy case? On the walls?

Who we believe we are as organization shapes identity of organization AND individuals within organizationdone in concert

## Who are you?

## work of Adaptive Schools Seminars

- -develop resources / capacities of organization and individuals
- -to cohesively respond to changing needs of students / society.

## rationale

Folktale--Chopped end off ham. Why? Mom taught me. Grandma? Great grandma? Hams this big. Ovens this big. cut off to fit in oven.

If answer is 'way it's always been done', not adaptive.

Makes difference in dynamics of conversation conversations all the time when know 2 ways of talking-choice point-knowing different intentions for talk

TWO WAYS OF TALKING LG, pp. 27-34 WHAT?

Understanding and differentiating dialogue and discussion.

WHY?

## Suggested Language:

Collaboration occurs through conversation. As groups become more skillful in having different conversations for different purposes, they accomplish more with greater effectiveness and satisfaction. These conversation patterns are critical to promoting a spirit of inquiry.

Dialogue-intention:  shared understanding

Success = each group member has expanded perspective-larger than when went into conversation

Discussion-intention: decision that stays made-if not enough dialogue, have decisions that are weak.

Suggested Language:

Conversations sometimes turn from casual to one that is more professional and substantive in nature. This leads us to a deliberation point: Is this a conversation about opening up our thinking and perspectives and clarifying our understandings? Or is it about honing our focus and becoming more specific? This leads us to two very different ways of talking. The first, dialogue, is a conversation that has understanding as its outcome. The second, discussion, is a conversation that has as its outcome, a decision. WHAT?

SUSPENSION AND BALCONY VIEW 10-2 Strategy

2 metacognitive processes

1 -&gt; dialogue

2 -&gt; discussion

Productive dialogue requires suspension

outcome of understanding-&gt;

suspension is disciplined / intentional

setting aside of your own values, beliefs and mental models -&gt; understand those of others

Covey: 'Seek first to understand, then to be understood.'

Intellectual humility = suspension

Intellectual humility = suspension

Soldiers defend mission-&gt;action Scouts explore

How do I come into dialogue?

(homesteader / pioneer)

If this belief is true, what else must I accept is true? What information exists that contradicts my belief, idea, etc.?

Most powerful is Balcony View

second metacognitive process -&gt; Balcony View

perspective-&gt; productive discussion

## Discussion

-metacognitive processes pay attention to is balcony view

in discussion, 3 views

Ego-own perspective

Balcony View refers to one of three perspectives:

Ego-centric, which is seeing things from your own personal perspective ego- is from the Greek word for 'I'

## Allo-other perspective

Allo-centric, which is seeing things empathically, from the other's perspective allo- is the Greek root for 'other'

Most powerful is balcony-macro self and other persons / group.

outcome is NOT to persuade others to choose same decision I want

If not in balcony:

Begin serial advocacy: I think we should 'initiative'

If watching from balcony, remember to inquire not to advocate or persuade.

filter: what might be most powerful for group decision

Macro-centric, which is the Balcony View, allowing you to pay attention to self and to others.

The outcome of discussion is to arrive at a decision, and my purpose may be to influence others to choose the decision that I see as the best.

If not in the Balcony, we might engage in serial advocacy, which is not as powerful as inquiring of the person ahead of me. By inquiring from the Balcony, we learn what people want as well as why, info needed to arrive at the most powerful decision for the group.

bogs groups down when don't know whether they are dialoguing or discussing make decisions that don't stay made / low implementation -&gt; didn't have dialogue in discussion -&gt; confusion / tension / emotion rises -&gt; go back to dialogue not linear, can go back to dialogue -&gt; resourcefulness

use both in same meeting - but must label what drives people crazy: both happen at same time instead, 'let's move into dialogue for minute to deepen our thinking' -&gt; 'maybe we know enough now to shift to discussion'

big ramifications -&gt; dialogue first to have decide -&gt; time to develop common understandings decision about ordering new pencils, don't dialogue

Once again, turn to your partner and paraphrase your understandings of 'Balcony View' and why it is vital for productive discussion.

If this belief is true, what else must I accept is true?

What information exists that contradicts my belief, idea, etc.?

## WHAT?

Practice of new concepts represented by Two Ways of Talking

## WHY?

The dialogue practice supports a move from comprehension to application on Bloom's taxonomy and assists the learner in internalizing the concept and skills of dialogue.

## HOW?

Pairs Square into dialogue groups of 4 (scaffold formal dialogue opportunities over the four days, and so, start with small numbers).

## Suggested Language:

Keep focused on the purpose of dialogue, speak to the center, and use the pattern of pausing, paraphrasing, and posing questions.

Use prompt on slide.

## DIALOGUE REFLECTION (IF TIME)

## WHAT?
