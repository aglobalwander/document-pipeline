Overview of the ISCA International Model
The ISCA International Model 2nd edition provides a framework for encouraging and promoting best
practices among international school counselors. Overall, the Model is our profession’s manual on what,
why, and how to implement a school counseling program.
When all counselors use the ISCA International Model, the best of what each individual has to offer con tributes to a unified vision for international school counseling programs. The Model will guide the forma tion, review, and improvement of counseling programs at schools all over the world.
How to Use the ISCA International Model
The International Model is not prescriptive, reactive, or a one-size fits all framework. Rather, its purpose is
to help guide counselors to build programs that are best suited for their school population. It tells school
counselors what an effective school counseling program should do; it does not tell counselors how to get
there. How counselors and schools deliver the model is left to the discretion of the professionals within each
school. Just as there are many routes a traveler can take to reach a destination, there are many ways for
counselors to arrive at the same goal: to develop a comprehensive and preventative counseling program. Of
course, the route chosen depends upon current location, mode of transportation, and resources at the travel er’s disposal. The same is true of each school’s implementation of this Model.
Within the Model we have an implementation guide and several downloadable tools that will help you put
the Model into action at your school. Buy your copy today! Visit www.iscainfo.com.
The ISCA Student Standards
The ISCA Student Standards are internationally recognized content standards for students that guide
school counseling programs by outlining the specific knowledge, attitudes, and skills that students
should be able to demonstrate as a result of an effective school counseling program.
In May 2022, ISCA revised the ISCA Student Standards to achieve the following goals:

■Standards include identity development as part of the Global Perspective Domain. The standard is
now called: Global Perspective and Identity Development.

■Standards promote equity, reduce harm, and improve access for all students.

=== Page 3 ===
ISCA INTERNATIONAL MODEL 3

■Standards reflect the ideas of the internationally recognized and evidence-based Social Emotional
Learning (SEL) competencies developed by the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional
Learning (CASEL).

■Standards reflect the most recent research and developments in the field of education.

■Standards better align with the practice of all academic subjects in our schools.

■Standards acknowledge the importance of social/emotional, global perspective and identity development; the domains have been reordered.

■To more clearly articulate the dispositions, knowledge, and skills that will prepare students for post secondary education, future careers, and global citizenship.
Why Are the ISCA Student Standards Important?
The ISCA Student Standards help school counselors to prioritize the content that is taught and assessed
within and across the school’s counseling curriculum. These standards are the foundation for classroom
lessons, small groups, and activities within a school counseling program. They directly reflect the coun seling program’s mission and goals.
Students learn best in environments that are validating, respectful, supportive, inclusive, and safe. Imple menting the ISCA Student Standards through the lens of equity and belonging is essential to improving
outcomes for all students and creating a safe school culture free of bias and oppression.
Consistent standards that are adopted by international schools around the world promote equity and
provide teachers, parents, and students with clear expectations to ensure that all students have the skills,
attitudes, and knowledge necessary to succeed in life upon graduation from high school, regardless of
where they received their Nursery–Grade 12 education.

you need to create a world class international school counseling program in your school.
