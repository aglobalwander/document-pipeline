## Chapter 11  Facilitating Data Teams

D ata have no meaning. Meaning emerges from collective sense-making by well-structured and skillfully facilitated collaborative groups. Working with data to improve practices and student learning outcomes is a common expectation for grade-level teams, departments, Professional Learning Communities (PLCs), and school leadership teams. Yet, many groups struggle with  this  essential  task.  Relational  tensions,  feelings  of  vulnerability  and  the cognitive demands of collective analysis, problem finding, and action planning often  overwhelm  groups.  Given  these  pressures  many  groups  stumble  toward the quick fix for the poorly defined dilemmas in front of them. Groups operating in this fashion lurch from problem to program, slapping remedial bandages on issues and concerns.

Thoughtfully  applying  many  of  the  concepts,  tools,  and  ideas  that  precede  this  chapter  helps  groups  avoid  the  pitfalls  mentioned above.  Seeing  the  system  that  is  producing learning  gaps  or  behavioral  issues  (chapters 1,  2,  and  9),  developing  group  member  capabilities, norms of collaboration, and two ways of  talking  (chapters  3  and  4),  and  conducting well-designed  and  skillfully  facilitated  meetings  (chapters  5,  6,  and  7)  all  contribute  to better run and more satisfying data team work. In  this  chapter  we  will  add  specific  protocols for structuring data-based collaborative inquiry along with tips and tools for facilitating these processes. Collective efficacy (chapter 10) increases  when  groups  learn  to  manage  their external and internal challenges as they come to trust the process and one another.

Districts, schools, and teams have to learn how to improve. This requires looking deeply at  the  systems  that  are  producing  any  performance  gaps  that  are  of  concern  to  staff  and community  members.  Anthony  Bryk  and  his colleagues  (2015)  offer  three  core  improvement questions:

- 1. What  specific  problem  are  we  trying  to solve?
- 2. What  changes  might  we  introduce  and why?
- 3. How will  we  know  whether  the  changes are actually improvements?

Problem finding is an essential capacity for data teams. Two potential pathways guide teams in this endeavor. One is to start with an issue or concern expressed by some group or other member of the school community and frame this topic in wording that leads to purposeful data gathering. The other approach is to start with available data and query it for the stories they might tell. Both pathways are equally productive.

## Starting with an issue or concern

Problem  finding  exercises  sometimes  develop  into  'Reality  Wars'  (Lipton  and  Well-

man,  2012).  These  occur  when  participants have conflicting mental maps of their worlds. These  maps  influence  what  we  see,  how  we see,  and  how  we  interpret  information  in  our environment.  Since  all  data  are  subject  to interpretation,  the  same  information  that  engages some group members may be dismissed, diminished, or denied by others depending on their frames of reference.

Starting  with  an  issue  calls  for  careful framing.  This  requires  skillful  facilitation  and thoughtful  process  design.  Public  recording (chapter 6) is a vital part of the process. There are three basic ways of framing an issue (Lipton and Wellman, 2012). These are (1) constructing a problem statement; (2) crafting an inquiry; and (3) generating a hypothesis. The context, group resourcefulness,  and  the  nature  of  the  specific issue at hand are some of the factors that influence the final choice of the problem frame. It is important that the facilitator avoid imposing his or her preferred frame on the group.

## Constructing a problem statement

Constructing  shared  problem  definitions is crucial to success. The patterns of both dialogue and discussion support groups in generating and honing thoughtful problem statements. Without  these  processes  problem  definitions can be challenging to develop. Completing the stem 'The problem is\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_' seems deceptively simple on the surface, but in reality this requires precise thinking and attention to specificity in language. We've had the experience, on  more  than  one  occasion,  of  spending  forty-five minutes to an hour helping groups sort through their perspectives and coalesce around a statement that all could agree to. This is time well spent since the problem statement greatly influences the data quest. There is a significant difference between 'The problem is that many students  are  floundering  when  presented  with nonfiction texts in the content areas.' And 'The problem is that many of our students lack the technical reading skills for comprehending and analyzing nonfiction texts in the content areas.' The first problem statement leads the group to focusing on student performance in the content area. The second problem statement leads to an exploration  of  the  specific  skills  that  students need for grappling with the assigned texts and to the teaching repertoire teachers need to learn to develop these skills. It might also lead to an exploration of successful students and the ways in  which  they  have  acquired  these  essential reading skills.

## Crafting an Inquiry

Framing  concerns,  anecdotes,  and  observations as inquiries opens thinking and widens the  potential  solution  set.  The  trick  here  is  to avoid  either/or  thinking  and  craft  open-ended questions  that  have  multiple  appropriate  answers. A variety of question-generating strategies might be used (see appendix A for examples).  Some  typical  questions  include:  'What are some essential differences between . . . and . . . ?' 'How are we doing with . . . ?' 'What are some of the reasons for . . . ?' and 'What are the most productive ways to . . . ?' In the reading example shared above, a driving question might be, 'What are the essential reading skills that students need to successfully engage with content reading?'

## Generating a Hypothesis

Anecdotes and observations often lead to proposals for solutions. In the worst cases, this develops into a competition between advocates causing  group  members  to  struggle  with  one another  in  unproductive  conversations.  Framing  these  proposed  solutions  as  hypotheses opens pathways to problem solving. The very construction  and  labeling  of  these  ideas  as hypotheses often reduces tension in the group and invites group members to embrace a spirit of inquiry and discovery. Hypotheses typically follow  an  if/then  format.  In  our  example  this might sound like, 'If we directly taught reading comprehension and textual analysis skills in the content areas then more students would master the course material.'

Many groups find that framing their issues with all three approaches is helpful. By crafting inquiries  and  generating  hypotheses  they  frequently discover that they need to refine their problem statement. Also, offering a group three different ways of framing an issue offers choice that  leads  to  greater  ownership  and  deeper commitment to problem solving

## Starting with the Data

Starting with the data requires a thoughtful survey of the hard and soft data available in the school  (James-Ward  et  al.,  2013).  (See  table 11.1 for examples of hard and soft data.) Hard data are data that are quantifiable and expressed in numbers and percentages. These data types lend themselves to statistical analysis. Soft data are  qualitative  and  anecdotal  resulting  from surveys, questionnaires, and observations. The goal is to gather relevant information to triangulate  the  issues  of  concern.  Once  sufficient data  have  been  gathered,  groups  search  for patterns of both strengths and needs. This leads to  developing  theories  of  causation  and  when these are confirmed, clarified, or disconfirmed the group can then move on to crafting theories of action and action planning. The Collaborative  Learning  Cycle described  next  elaborates specific steps in this process.

Productive  data-driven  inquiry  requires structure  and  attention  to  process.  'Thoughtfully  designed  processes  increase  focus,  minimize distractions, and deepen exploration and analysis of data' (Lipton and Wellman, 2012). Group members that lack process attention and process  monitoring  habits  get  lost  in  storytelling,  side-talk,  and  jump  quickly  to  selling solutions to one another.

The Collaborative  Learning  Cycle establishes  a  forum  for  collective  exploration of  data.  By  embracing  a  learning  orientation within carefully applied protocols, group members engage in collaborative inquiry that leads to  problem  finding,  problem-solving  and  focused planning for action.

Each phase of the Collaborative Learning Cycle is driven by questions that organize and direct  specific  cognitive  processes.  The  first phase,  'Activating  and  Engaging'  surfaces prior experiences, background knowledge, and frames  of  reference  for  thinking  about  the issues  at  hand.  The  second  phase,  'Exploring  and  Discovering'  structures  the  group's inquiry  into  the  data  in  a  search  for  pop-outs and patterns that will then influence the search for deeper causations. The third phase, 'Organizing and Integrating' is a two-stage process with an initial drafting of theories of causation and a search for confirming and clarifying data.

When the group is confident it is on the right track  they  move  to  the  final  stage  of  drafting theories  of  action  and  identifying  processes, plans, goals, and monitoring systems for moving ahead. Continuous improvement is a cyclical  process  so  as  new  data  emerge  the  group then applies the Collaborative Learning Cycle to this information.

## Phase 1: Activating and Engaging

A  central  intention  of  the Collaborative Learning Cycle is to develop a stance of shared curiosity  that  avoids  premature  certainty  and locking  in  on  the  first  proposed  course  of action.  This  initial  phase,  Activating  and  Engaging,  sets  the  scene  for  exploring  the  data without the data being present. It starts with dialogue about what group members predict that data will look like and a sharing of assumptions about  why  people  think  these  predictions  are likely.  The  norms  of  collaboration  (chapter 4)  are  a  vital  resource  during  this  phase.  The goal  is  to  establish  conditions  of  low  threat and  full  participation  so  that  all  group  members  feel  free  to  contribute  their  thinking  and ideas. When done well, this creates conditions of  psychological  safety  for  group  members, especially if they are uncertain about the content, the data, or the group processes of inquiry. Psychological  safety  ultimately  means  that individuals feel safe enough not to know in the presence of their peers.

When the data to be explored will be presented as tables of graphs the facilitator offers blank copies of the graphic forms upon which to  record  predictions.  These  predictions  are what  people  think  the  data  will  look  likespecifically  how  high  the  bars  on  the  graph will  reach  for  specific  standards  or  specific subgroups or what data they think will appear in the cells of the table. As predictions emerge, the facilitator pushes group members to name the  assumptions  that  are  informing  these  predictions.  Working  with  the  blank  templates also orients group members to the actual data displays they will be working with during the next  phase.  At  times,  group  members  have similar  predictions  and  different  assumptions. At  other  times,  group  members  have  similar assumptions but varying predictions based on those same assumptions.

Individuals  surface  their  frames  of  reference  by  articulating  their  predictions  and assumptions.  These  interactions  help  group members to better understand the mental models that are guiding the teaching practices and instructional thinking of their colleagues.

Distinguishing  between  assumptions  and predictions is difficult for some group members and it can take up to three experiences with the Collaborative  Learning  Cycle for  participants to appreciate the value and importance of this phase. For example, a team member might say, 'My prediction is that there will be a 40 percent difference  on  the  writing  assessment  between the  girls  and  the  boys.  This  is  driven  by  my assumption  that  the  girls  are  better  readers than  the  boys  which  shows  in  their  writing.' Activating  and  Engaging  provides  the  safety of  dialogue to encourage participation in data tasks that might be intimidating for some group members. This phase fans the flame of curiosity so that group members want to look at the data and are ready to do so knowing in advance how their  colleagues  are  thinking  about  the  issues involved in a specific inquiry cycle.

## Facilitation Tips for Success

- · Listen  for  ways  that  group  members  are distinguishing between predictions and assumptions. Paraphrase and label predictions as they occur and inquire for the underlying assumptions if they are not provided. Paraphrase  and  label  assumptions  and  inquire for  the  specific  predictions  that  these  assumptions might produce in the data.
- · Use  public  recording  to  capture  predictions and their related assumptions for all to  see.  Use  separate  recording  sheets  or charts for this purpose.
- · Publicly record predictions on a facsimile of  the  data  display.  Use  a  graph  or  chart that  reflects  the  actual  format  of  the  data display. This serves as an advanced orga-

- nizer and orients the group for viewing the data at the next phase.
- · Record more than one set of predictions and their  related  assumptions. The  goal  during this  phase  is  to  seek  to  understand,  not  to persuade. When members struggle for consensus or think they need consensus, group work  bogs  down.  Recording  the  diversity of predictions increases curiosity, especially when the facilitator encourages clarification of the different driving assumptions that are informing the predictions.

## Phase 2: Exploring and Discovering

This  phase  is  the  heart  of  collaborative inquiry. Productive Exploring and Discovering require collective focus, discipline, and group members who are as interested in the observations of others as they are in their own observations. The goal is to create a shared learning experience in which group members can learn from the data and from one another. In many ways  this  is  a  special  form  of  dialogue  with data at the center.

Skillful facilitators promote  a  spirit  of purposeful  uncertainty  during  this  phase.  The goal  here  is  to  help  group  members  remain open  to  possibilities  and  multiple  viewpoints. By  exploring  several  storylines  in  the  data, group  members  discover  patterns  and  trends that might otherwise remain hidden from view. Cognitively, this is the phase of observing, noticing, distinguishing, sorting, comparing, and contrasting.

Managing  working  group  size  is  an  important  consideration.  Group  sizes  of  three  to four work best. Each data team needs a shared data  display  and  recording  materials.  This is  an  essential  third  point  for  structuring  the exploration  (see  chapter  4).  The  data  display establishes the third point with group members and the facilitator forming the other two points. When  working  groups  are  too  large,  participants may disengage; this occurs when the data display is difficult to see or there are too many voices in the crowd for shyer members to cut through. An additional barrier to success in this phase occurs when there is too much data present. This  leads  to  overload  and  fragmentation of group energy.

## Facilitation Tips for Success

- · Provide time to orient to the data displays before  encouraging  group  members  to share  their  initial  observations.  Two  to three minutes of silence allows individual group  members  to  orient  to  the  data  displays and provides a space for the varying processing  needs  of  individuals  in  the group.  This  leads  to  fuller  participation and  increased  confidence  on  the  part  of group  members. This  is  especially  so  for the 'data shy.' The purposeful pause also slows  down  the  'data  enthusiasts'  who may  inhibit  or  intimidate  others  in  the group. One way to do this is to provide individual thinking and writing time before people start talking to ensure opportunity for each group member.
- · Propose a sequence for exploring the data and designate a starting point. Agreement on  initial  talking  points  saves  time  and energy and establishes focus. This is especially important when multiple data sets or complex displays are on view.
- · Apply structures and protocols to balance participation. Structuring group work increases engagement, increases focus, and increases  time  efficiency.  Some  possible group  member  roles  include:  recorder, process  checker,  materials  manager,  and timekeeper.
- · Use  public  recording.  Create  common charts or recording space for observations. Keep  a  separate  chart  for  questions  or comments that are 'outside the phase.' For example,  should  conclusions  or  explanations emerge, it is helpful to record them and set these aside, rather than debate them in that moment. This recording and setting

- aside process is also effective for questions that are not directly relevant to the data.
- · Chart  observations  in  language  that  is concise, specific, and quantified. Each observation statement should communicate a single idea clearly and numerically. These statements  should  focus  only  on  observable  facts  contained  in  the  data  without interpretation or inference. Less and more, greater than, and smaller than are concepts. Quantifying these observations reveals the magnitude  of  differences.  Using  relevant data  terminology,  such  as  mean,  median, mode, range, and distribution increases the precision of observations.

## Phase 3: Organizing and Integrating

The  third  phase  of  the Collaborative Learning  Cycle  Organizing  and  Integrating guides the transition to formal problem finding  and  problem  solving  that  establishes  a foundation  for  thoughtful  and  detailed  planning processes. During this phase, the group makes the transition from dialogue to discussion to decision making.

This  phase  is  divided  into  two  stages: causation and action. Here the facilitator guides the group in the transition from observing to understanding and then to action planning. During the  causal  stage  of  thinking,  group  members generate  multiple  interpretations  for  why  the data  look  the  way  they  do.  Generating  these theories  of  causation  and  then  deciding  on  the most likely avenues of inquiry marks the transition  from  dialogue  to  discussion.  Here  again skillful application for the Norms of Collaboration (chapter 4) supports the group in this quest. Paraphrasing and posing questions for specificity are especially important during this process.

Issues  tend  to  fall  within  one  or  more  of five  causal  categories  (Lipton  and  Wellman, 2012). These are:

- 1. Curriculum: The design and implementation of units of study.
- 2. Instruction:  Teaching  methods  and  materials.
- 3. Teachers:  Knowledge,  skills,  and  dispositions.
- 4. Students:  Knowledge,  skills,  and  dispositions.
- 5. Infrastructure:  Schedules,  programming, space, and resources.

Most data sets are incomplete and do not tell the full story. This stage of the Organizing and  Integrating phase  includes  the  collection of additional data that may be indicated by the theories  of  causation  that  emerge.  By  using these new data to confirm, disconfirm, or clarify the selected causal theories, group members increase  their understanding  of  the  deeper causal  factors  underlying  the  issue  they  are exploring. This increases confidence and commitment to any ultimate implementation plans.

When groups have sufficient confirming or clarifying data they then make the shift to developing theories of action. This stage embeds the use of skillful discussion and decision-making language tools and protocols. 'Theories of action  lead  to  problem-solving,  planning  and action  research  guided  by  the  ongoing  use  of formal and informal data, thus continuing the learning cycle started by a given round of data-driven collaborative inquiry' (Wellman and Lipton, 2004, p. 49).

Confident  facilitation  of  the  Organizing and  Integrating  phase  of  the Collaborative Learning  Cycle helps  groups  own  their  challenges  and  increases  collective  responsibility for  student  learning.  Effective  plans  require specific outcomes, clear criteria for measuring progress  and  success,  necessary  action  steps, monitoring strategies for determining progress and goal achievement, assignment of responsibilities, and projected timelines.

## PART V

## CONFLICT, CHANGE, AND COMMUNITY

Leadership is a function, not a role. Adaptive  leaders  orchestrate  conflict  by  initiating conversations  about  hard  to  talk  about  topics central  to  student  success.  Conflict  is  'good' when it centers on ideas, values, and ways of doing things. It is 'bad' when it swims in seas of  emotion,  distrust,  and  personalization.  We present  practical  tools  for  dealing  constructively  with  conflict,  offer  ways  of  insulating yourself  from  negative  energies,  and  suggest methods for teaching staffs and teams ways to disagree with grace and respect.

This  section  frames  six  capacities  for  organizational development and six capacities for professional development as lenses for analysis and intervention. We also explore ways to address wicked problems-those that seem to be ongoing,  complex,  and  for  which  there  seem to be no easy, or in some cases good, answers. Finally, we return to the finding that interaction among  teachers  and  administrators  that  focus on  student  learning  makes  large  and  measurable  differences  in  student  achievement  and reveals  practical  methods  for  energizing  and supporting such communities.

And in conclusion, we note that community  does  not  last  forever.  Yet  communities do recover, clarify values, and reengage in the quest for continuing student improvement. We close  with  a  metaphor  intended  to  help  each group find their own beat, their own rhythm in the continuing quest for joy in serving others.
