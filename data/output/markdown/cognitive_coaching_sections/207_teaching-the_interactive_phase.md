## Teaching-The Interactive Phase

Teachers are constantly interacting with students in an environment of uncertainty (Harvey 1966). Teachers are constantly making decisions that may be subconscious, spontaneous, planned, or some mixture of these. Teachers' in-the-moment decisions are probably modifications of decisions made during the planning phase, but changes made during the fast-paced interaction of the classroom are probably not as well defined or

as thoroughly considered as the decisions made during the calmer stage of planning. In-the-moment decisions are spontaneously influenced by teacher information, mental processes, student cues, and automated psychomotor processes. Once a lesson begins, teachers have little time to consider alternative teaching strategies and the consequences of each.

Six kinds of temporal dimensions interact constantly with teachers' other thoughts and values to influence their daily decisions. Two of these time dimensions are sequence and simultaneity. Sequence refers to ordering instructional events within a lesson. Simultaneity refers to the capacity to operate under multiple classification systems at the same time. This means that an instructor can teach toward multiple objectives, coordinate numerous and varied classroom activities at the same time, plan a lesson incorporating several learning modalities, and think about multiple time frames. In addition, teachers plan within a variety of time horizons-daily, weekly, long range, yearly, and the school term. Effective teachers relate information from all those time frames as they prepare daily lessons (Yinger 1977

Keeping the standard of learning and the planned strategy in mind while teaching provides the teacher with a backdrop against which to make new decisions. During the beginning of a lesson, for example, the teacher may emphasize structuring the task and motivating students to become curious, involved, and focused. Later in the sequence, the teacher may use recall types of questions to cue students' review of previously learned information and to gather data to be considered later. Further into the lesson, the teacher may invite students' higher-level thinking and, finally, provide tasks for transference and application.

Clark and Peterson (1986) describe teacher thinking related to changing planned content during teaching. They examined influences on those decisions; cues that teachers read in order to make decisions; and the relationships between and among teachers' interactive decisions, teachers' behaviors, and, ultimately, student outcomes. A relatively small portion of teachers' interactive thought deals with instructional objectives. A greater percentage of teachers' interactive thought deals with the content or subject matter. A still greater percentage of interactive thought deals with the instructional process. The largest percentage of teachers' interactive thought concerns learning and the learner.

One of the great mental skills of teaching is simply the teacher's ability to remember the lesson plan during the pressure of interaction. Teachers often suffer cognitive overload-too many things going on all at the same time. Yet skillful teachers respond immediately, intuitively, and

spontaneously to how the lesson plan is playing out. Highly conscious teachers are alert to what is going on in the classroom; less conscious teachers continue their lessons regardless of what occurs among students.

For example, alert teachers search for clues that students are prepared. Have the students acted on the information, digested it, and made meaning out of it or used it? Are students staring vacantly, or do body language and facial cues indicate attention? The alert teacher constantly observes, questions, clarifies, and interprets students' behaviors to make decisions about moving ahead in the sequence or remaining at the present step longer.

Metacognition refers to teachers' critically important capacities to consciously 'stand outside themselves' and reflect on themselves as they manage instruction-to be spectators of their own thinking actions and beliefs; to examine their own reasoning. to monitor their own assumptions and mental models. (See also chapter 9, Domains of Inquiry.) During a lesson, teachers may ask themselves such managerial questions as: 'Are my directions clear? Can students see the smartboard? Am I using precise words to make sure that the students understand? Should I speed up?' (What Factors Maximize Learning?). They also are aware of their dispositional concerns: What am I learning about myself? (Selfknowledge) Where is this lesson leading? How are my students gaining a better appreciation of beauty, fairness, justice and kindness? (What's worth learning?) Such internal dialogue means the teacher is constantly monitoring his/her own and students' learning behaviors during instruction.

Metacognition is also the ability to know what we know and what we don't know. It is the ability to plan a strategy for producing needed information, to be conscious of steps and strategies, and to reflect on and evaluate the productivity of thinking. David Perkins (1983) has elaborated four increasingly complex levels of metacognition:

- The tacit level, being unaware of our metacognitive knowledge
- The awareness level, knowing about some of the kinds of thinking we do (generating ideas, finding evidence) but not being strategic
- The strategic level, organizing our thinking by using problem solving, decision making, evidence seeking, and other techniques
- The reflective level, not only being strategic but reflecting on our thinking in progress, pondering strategies, and revising them accordingly

The metacognitive skills necessary to successful teaching, which a Coach may want to be alert for, include the following:

- Keeping place in a long sequence of operations
- Knowing that a subgoal has been attained
- Detecting errors and recovering from them by making a quick fix or retreating to the last known correct operation

This kind of monitoring involves both looking ahead and looking back. Looking ahead includes the following:

- Learning the structure of a sequence of operations and identifying areas where errors are likely
- Choosing a strategy that will reduce the possibility of error and will provide easy recovery
- Identifying the kinds of feedback that will be available at various points and evaluating the usefulness of that feedback

Looking back includes the following:

- Detecting errors previously made
- Keeping a history of what has been done until the present and thereby determining what should come next
- Assessing the reasonableness of the present and the immediate outcome of task performance

Teachers monitor the classroom for conscious and subconscious cues, and sometimes the cues build up so much they disrupt conscious information processing. Flexible teachers manage their impulsivity by avoiding strong emotional reactions to classroom events. This is an efficient strategy to reserve the limited capacity for conscious processing of immediate classroom decisions: being inclined to find humor, for example, in their errors rather than becoming defensive.

Flexible teachers have a vast repertoire of instructional strategies and techniques, and they call forth alternative strategies as needed. They are aware that in a math lesson, for example, Sam obviously isn't getting the concept of sequence. Sensing that Sam is a kinesthetic learner, they give Sam a set of blocks and ask him to put them in order.

Many classes are filled with students with a heterogeneous array of languages, cultures, interests, and learning styles. Teachers may have one

or more students, or even whole groups, who are Hmong, Vietnamese, Arab, East Indian, and Latino, all in the same classroom. Each must be dealt with employing different strategies, cultural experiences, vocabulary, examples, and techniques. Efficacious and flexible teachers continually cast about in their vast repertoire for, or invent, strategies that may prove effective.

Routines are also helpful in dealing with the multidimensionality of information-processing demands in the classroom. Routines reduce the need to attend to the abundance of simultaneous cues from the environment. Efficacious teachers develop a repertoire of routine systems for dealing with classroom management functions (taking roll, distributing papers and books). They also have systematic lesson designs (e.g., spelling and math drills) and teaching strategies (e.g., questioning sequences and structuring). Efficacious teachers are more effective scanners of classroom behavior, make greater references to the language of instruction and learning of students, whereas less efficacious teachers concentrate more on what the teacher is doing and saying to the class and concentrate more on student behavior.
