This chapter introduced the basic structures and variations of the Cognitive Coaching model. Two of the four mental maps that guide a coach's interactions, along with video examples of conversations intended to illustrate the process in action, were presented.

Skillful coaches are consistently conscious of their intention, which is self-directed learning. Mediating reflection on the planning and reflecting conversations brings the entire process to the colleague's conscious level with the intent of habituating (interiorizing) the cognitive processes of the coaching/learning cycle. It means 'I will increasingly coach myself' (Feuerstein et al. 2015, 45).
