## How Do I Know When I Am Finished?

Conversation does not have to reach conclusions in order to be of value.

-Parker Palmer

New connections are not always consciously formed. Many insights involve unconscious processing (Rock 2009). Think of times when you have a new way of approaching a problem suddenly come to you in the middle of the night. One thing a coach can do is to pose questions to think about at the end of a conversation, not asking for an immediate response. Some examples might be: 'What are some questions you are still asking yourself?' or 'What are some of the variables still in your control?' Pondering those 'walk-away' questions assumes the person has the capacity to make advances in his/her thinking, which has a very different effect than making a suggestion or offering your own personal observations.

The problem-resolving conversation releases a person from the trap of impotency about how to approach a problem. This is accomplished by accessing and amplifying the internal resources necessary for clarity, courage, and right action. Most often these require amplifying states of mind, as depicted in figure 12.3. In consulting conversations, where the goal is to solve problems, you know you are finished when the person has articulated a plan of action. When the goal, however, is to liberate sufficient internal resources to restore states of mind, different indicators of completion are needed.

Observations of physiological changes provide cues as to when a cognitive shift has occurred, signaling internal resolution, insight, fresh determination, or an 'Aha!' moment. These shifts occur in systems outside the coachee's control; breathing, postural changes, gestures, voice qualities, and blushing are some examples. Our sense is that these physical alterations may mark abrupt changes in mental functioning, perhaps activating portions of the mind not previously engaged. An observant coach sees and hears and infers meaning about these BMIRS.

During pacing they may be interpreted as movement from distress to eustress. During the leading portion of the conversation, the coach takes these as signals that the internal work has been done and the coachee is in touch with the necessary interior resources. Emotions play a commanding role in being stuck or becoming resourceful and are registered in the body. Behavioral manifestations of internal resource states (BMIRS) will appear involuntarily as they are informed by chemical shifts affecting the autonomic (self-regulating) system.

To observe a cognitive shift (BMIRS), please access two videos: www.thinkingcollaborative.com/support-audio-videos/12-1/ and www.thinkingcollaborative.com/video-12-2/. In the first video, Jane, the coach, paraphrases Dana. Watch Dana's response, noting ways her behaviors reveal what is happening internally. In the second video, Carolee asks a question that triggers an observable cognitive shift in Ochan.
