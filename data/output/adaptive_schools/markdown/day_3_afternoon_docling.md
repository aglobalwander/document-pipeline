## ACTIVATOR WHAT?

A sponge allows presenter to start on time, and provides an opportunity for those not present to join when they arrive. Originally a term used by Madeline Hunter, a sponge strategy is meant to 'soak up' transitional minutes with meaningful engagement.

## WHY?

It is important to start and end on time.

If start times are not honored, participants who come late don't feel it is necessary to arrive on time.

This respects those who arrive on time, and respectfully allows those who are not on time to join in.

## Road Sign Synectics

Suggested Language:

Synectics is a technique used by George Gordon and William Prince to kick-start the creative side of our brains to aide in problem-solving. It invites analogical thinking.

## Road Sign Synectic

<!-- image -->

Can use same strategy with smaller group by adding manipulatives (pictures) -&gt; Increase degree of structure and increase attention

- B) Option: Four-Box Synectics
- 1.Draw 2X2 box
- 2.Elicit four objects from group (e.g., objects found in a kitchen
- 3.Table groups brainstorm: Productive Meetings are like each of the objects because...
- 4.Table spokespersons share 1 favorite with whole group.

Show slide with a variety of road signs, and directions.

Ask tables to brainstorm ways in which meetings are like road signs.

Ask one person from each table to report out, saying, 'Meetings are like road signs, because…'

WHAT?

Station Naming on the Agenda Chart

## WHY?

Provides a model of how to utilize a public agenda

## HOW?

Move to agenda and reference current topic placement.

Brief overview 'structures'

<!-- image -->

- -system of order / organization.
- -honor dynamic relationship of parts-&gt;workable whole.
- -potential for chaos exists-&gt;structures permits expressions of perspectives in useful, safe manner

## 3 structures for successful meetings

## WHY?

Every group brings a variety of ideas, styles, personal histories and individual agendas to its work, so the potential for chaotic interaction always exists.

## HOW?

Using the slide, name and give a brief explanation of each. More detail will be provided with strategies that follow.

## Suggested Language:

Now we are going to explore some specific structures. The term 'structure' is used to describe a system of order and organization. Certain meeting structures have been found to correlate highly with productive meetings. These structures will result in people leaving meetings with a maximum amount of work done...in a minimum amount of time...with a maximum amount of satisfaction.

## TRAINERS' NOTE:

Consider presenting this operational definition of a 'successful' meeting using Visual Paragraph.

These organizers are found under the heading of 'Structures for Successful Meetings,' on page 68.

In the Adaptive Schools Foundation Seminar, three structures for successful meetings are offered:

- 1) Decide on Decision Making offers us key guiding questions about who decides and which topics are ours.
- 3 structures for successful meetings.

Questions to be answered before discussion

-What topics are ours?

-Who decides?

-Who are we in decision-making process?

<!-- image -->

Suggested Language:

This is the first structure that you will be unpacking.

WHAT: Text on Decide on Decision-Making

<!-- image -->

## WHY: Gets groups in trouble

Clarity helps groups avoid major problems

DECIDE ON DECISION-MAKING

LG, p. 69-71

WHAT?

DECIDE ON DECISION MAKING is the first Structure for Successful Meetings.

## WHY?

Suggested Language:

DECIDE ON DECISION MAKING is an important structure for three reasons:

- 1) groups will put energy into the wrong issues when this is not clear;
- 2) confusion about decision-making authority generally creates morale problems;
- 3) when decision-making processes are unclear, those who do not like the decision, attack the process.

## HOW?

Use Clock Partners for Paired Reading.

## TRAINERS NOTE:

You may choose to have an intact team read this section as a whole rather than divide into pairs.

<!-- image -->

## DEBRIEF:

IF not clear:

1.energy-&gt;wrong issues

2.confusion-&gt;morale problems

3.not like the decision-&gt;attack / sabotage

## will challenge:

1.whose Authority it is to make decisions 2.the process - What processes should be used (and understood) for decision-making?

3.role group plays in decision process emphasize importance of over-communicating decision-making process Communicate four times:

1.At the beginning of the topic

2.In the middle - during the heat of discussion

3.At the conclusion of the topic/decision

4.Any written minutes or memos

## Why? Forget where are / who are in decision-making processes.

Use diagram, 'Decide on Decision-Making,' in Learning Guide to debrief reading. Consider using the sample text below to answer questions and comment after pairs have done the Reading strategy above.

## Suggested Language:

It is important to over-communicate decision-making process. Communicate the process four times:

- 1. At the beginning of the topic
- 2. In the middle - during the heat of discussion
- 3. At the conclusion of the topic/decision
- 4. Any written minutes or memos

Why is this important? People tend to forget who they are and where they are in decisionmaking processes. If they end up not liking the decision, there is a tendency to attack the process. Over communicating process minimizes this likelihood.

## Structures for Successful Meetings,

Decide on Decision Making, p. 72

## Naive Questions

- 1.Who is making this decision?
- 2.What is the process for making this decision?
- 3.What parts of this issue live in our sandbox?

Gentle nudge to get back on track

Pluralistic ignorance -&gt;'emperor's new clothes'

when group's majority privately believes one thing and mistakenly assumes that most others believe opposite

## NAIVE QUESTIONS

LG, p. 72

WHAT?

Naïve questions

## WHY?

Suggested Language:

Naïve questions-asked with innocence, a desire to know, and in a melodic, approachable voice -- is one strategy for facilitators and group members to use in deciding on decisionmaking.

## HOW?

Model asking the questions on the screen for the group using elements of approachability.

## Structures for Successful Meetings, Decide on Decision Making, p. 72

If you could select only two of these questions that would be most valuable for a group with whom you are working, which ones might you choose?

HOW?

<!-- image -->

Pairs scan sample questions on page.

## Suggested Language:

Recall the work you did today, on the Norm of Collaboration Posing Questions (LG p. 56). One of the elements that increases the probability of a question being received as invitational is the use of 'Approachable Voice.' You will remember that an approachable intonation is well-modulated and tends to conclude on an up note.

Read the prompt on the screen and share your choices and your rationale.

## DECIDE ON DECISION MAKING STRATEGIES

LG, pp. 73-76

WHAT?

'Decide on Decision Making Strategies,' is an opportunity to review options available to a facilitator and group members when the conversation moves from dialogue to discussion.

## WHY?

Give structure/scaffold to decision making discussions

Support groups in selecting from a repertoire of potential strategies

## HOW?

Using the arrow illustration on LG p. 71, highlight the guiding question 'Which decisionmaking process will be used?'

## Suggested Language:

The Adaptive Schools offers groups over 150 strategies and moves to support collaborative work, many of them scaffolds for decision making. The directions for each of these can be kept 'on hand' with the free Adaptive Schools App. You are about to have an opportunity to explore some of those strategies.

## Decide on Decision-Making, pp. 73-75

Groups of 5:

- 1. Brainstorm additional decisions that you might make and decide on one.
- 2. Number off 1-5.
- 3. Silently, read your assigned strategy.
- 4. #1 offers a brief summary of the strategy.
- 5. The group determines whether this first strategy would be a good protocol to use to make a decision.
- · Include your rationale.
- 6.Continue the process with #2, etc.

Suggested Language:

Collaborative groups sometimes face decisions such as 'Which textbook should we select?' 'What Professional Development should be offered?' 'Which math/reading series should we select?' 'What venue should we use for the prom (or other event)?'

In your team of six, brainstorm 2-3 additional decisions that a group that you are part of might have to make, and jot them down.

Allow time for a brief brainstorm.

Each of you will read the strategy and directions on your card. When group members are ready, each of you will report to your group in round-robin fashion:

a brief summary of your strategy one or more decisions from your brainstormed list that your strategy might support, with your rationale.

Respond to any clarifying questions, and have the groups begin.
