The Diploma Programme is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16-19 age
range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgable and
inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging students to
develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The Diploma Programme model
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core (see figure 1). It encourages the
concurrent study of a broad range of academic areas. Students study two modern languages (or a modern
language and a classical language), a humanities or social science subject, an experimental science,
mathematics and one of the creative arts. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma
Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare students effectively for university entrance.
In each of the academic areas students have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can
choose subjects that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.
Figure 1

Introduction
The Diploma Programme 2
Mathematics: applications and interpretation guide

=== Page 9 ===
Choosing the right combination
Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic areas, although they can,
instead of an arts subject, choose two subjects from another area. Normally, three subjects (and not more
than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends
240 teaching hours for HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than at SL.
At both levels many skills are developed, especially those of critical thinking and analysis. At the end of the
course, students’ abilities are measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some element of coursework assessed by teachers.
The core of the Diploma Programme model
All Diploma Programme (DP) students participate in the three course elements that make up the core of the model.
Theory of knowledge (TOK) is a course that is fundamentally about critical thinking and inquiry into the
process of knowing rather than about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines the
nature of knowledge and how we know what we claim to know. It does this by encouraging students to
analyse knowledge claims and explore questions about the construction of knowledge. The task of TOK is
to emphasize connections between areas of shared knowledge and link them to personal knowledge in
such a way that an individual becomes more aware of his or her own perspectives and how they might differ from others.
Creativity, activity, service (CAS) is at the heart of the Diploma Programme. The emphasis in CAS is on
helping students to develop their own identities, in accordance with the ethical principles embodied in the
IB mission statement and the IB learner profile. It involves students in a range of activities alongside their
academic studies throughout the Diploma Programme. The three strands of CAS are creativity (arts, and
other experiences that involve creative thinking), activity (physical exertion contributing to a healthy
lifestyle) and service (an unpaid and voluntary exchange that has a learning benefit for the student).
Possibly, more than any other component in the Diploma Programme, CAS contributes to the IB’s mission
to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect.
The extended essay, including the world studies extended essay, offers the opportunity for IB students to
investigate a topic of special interest, in the form of a 4,000-word piece of independent research. The area
of research undertaken is chosen from one of the students’ six Diploma Programme subjects, or in the case
of the inter-disciplinary World Studies essay, two subjects, and acquaints them with the independent
research and writing skills expected at university. This leads to a major piece of formally-presented,
structured writing, in which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent manner,
appropriate to the subject or subjects chosen. It is intended to promote high-level research and writing
skills, intellectual discovery and creativity. An authentic learning experience, it provides students with an
opportunity to engage in personal research on a topic of choice, under the guidance of a supervisor.
Approaches to teaching and approaches to learning
Approaches to teaching and learning across the Diploma Programme refers to deliberate strategies, skills
and attitudes which permeate the teaching and learning environment. These approaches and tools,
intrinsically linked with the learner profile attributes, enhance student learning and assist student
preparation for the Diploma Programme assessment and beyond. The aims of approaches to teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme are to:
•
empower teachers as teachers of learners as well as teachers of content •
empower teachers to create clearer strategies for facilitating learning experiences in which students
are more meaningfully engaged in structured inquiry and greater critical and creative thinking
The Diploma Programme 3
Mathematics: applications and interpretation guide

=== Page 10 ===
•
promote both the aims of individual subjects (making them more than course aspirations) and linking
previously isolated knowledge (concurrency of learning) •
encourage students to develop an explicit variety of skills that will equip them to continue to be
actively engaged in learning after they leave school, and to help them not only obtain university
admission through better grades but also prepare for success during tertiary education and beyond •
enhance further the coherence and relevance of the students’ Diploma Programme experience •
allow schools to identify the distinctive nature of an IB Diploma Programme education, with its blend of idealism and practicality.
The five approaches to learning (developing thinking skills, social skills, communication skills, self management skills and research skills) along with the six approaches to teaching (teaching that is inquiry based, conceptually-focused, contextualized, collaborative, differentiated and informed by assessment)
encompass the key values and principles that underpin IB pedagogy.
The IB mission statement and the IB learner profile
The Diploma Programme aims to develop in students the knowledge, skills and attitudes they will need to
fulfill the aims of the IB, as expressed in the organization’s mission statement and the learner profile.
Teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme represent the reality in daily practice of the organization’s educational philosophy.
Academic honesty
Academic honesty in the Diploma Programme is a set of values and behaviours informed by the attributes
of the learner profile. In teaching, learning and assessment, academic honesty serves to promote personal
integrity, engender respect for the integrity of others and their work, and ensure that all students have an
equal opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquire during their studies.
All coursework—including work submitted for assessment—is to be authentic, based on the student’s
individual and original ideas with the ideas and work of others fully acknowledged. Assessment tasks that
require teachers to provide guidance to students or that require students to work collaboratively must be
completed in full compliance with the detailed guidelines provided by the IB for the relevant subjects.
For further information on academic honesty in the IB and the Diploma Programme, please consult the IB
publications Academic honesty in the IB educational context, Effective citing and referencing, The Diploma
Programme: From principles into practice and General regulations: Diploma Programme. Specific information
regarding academic honesty as it pertains to external and internal assessment components of this Diploma
Programme subject can be found in this guide.
Acknowledging the ideas or work of another person
Coordinators and teachers are reminded that candidates must acknowledge all sources used in work
submitted for assessment. The following is intended as a clarification of this requirement.
Diploma Programme candidates submit work for assessment in a variety of media that may include audio visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data published in print or electronic sources. If a candidate uses
the work or ideas of another person, the candidate must acknowledge the source using a standard style of
referencing in a consistent manner. A candidate’s failure to acknowledge a source will be investigated by
the IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty imposed by the IB final award committee.
The IB does not prescribe which style(s) of referencing or in-text citation should be used by candidates; this
is left to the discretion of appropriate faculty/staff in the candidate’s school. The wide range of subjects,
three response languages and the diversity of referencing styles make it impractical and restrictive to insist
on particular styles. In practice, certain styles may prove most commonly used, but schools are free to The Diploma Programme 4
Mathematics: applications and interpretation guide

=== Page 11 ===
choose a style that is appropriate for the subject concerned and the language in which candidates’ work is
written. Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a given subject, it is expected that the
minimum information given includes: name of author, date of publication, title of source, and page numbers as applicable.
Candidates are expected to use a standard style and use it consistently so that credit is given to all sources
used, including sources that have been paraphrased or summarized. When writing text, candidates must
clearly distinguish between their words and those of others by the use of quotation marks (or other
method, such as indentation) followed by an appropriate citation that denotes an entry in the bibliography.
If an electronic source is cited, the date of access must be indicated. Candidates are not expected to show
faultless expertise in referencing, but are expected to demonstrate that all sources have been
acknowledged. Candidates must be advised that audio-visual material, text, graphs, images and/or data
published in print or in electronic sources that is not their own must also attribute the source. Again, an
appropriate style of referencing/citation must be used.
Learning diversity and learning support requirements
Schools must ensure that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are provided to
candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Access and inclusion
policy and Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes.
The documents Meeting student learning diversity in the classroom and The IB guide to inclusive education: a
resource for whole school development are available to support schools in the ongoing process of increasing
access and engagement by removing barriers to learning.

Introduction
Mathematics has been described as the study of structure, order and relation that has evolved from the
practices of counting, measuring and describing objects. Mathematics provides a unique language to
describe, explore and communicate the nature of the world we live in as well as being a constantly building
body of knowledge and truth in itself that is distinctive in its certainty. These two aspects of mathematics, a
discipline that is studied for its intrinsic pleasure and a means to explore and understand the world we live in, are both separate yet closely linked.
Mathematics is driven by abstract concepts and generalization. This mathematics is drawn out of ideas, and
develops through linking these ideas and developing new ones. These mathematical ideas may have no
immediate practical application. Doing such mathematics is about digging deeper to increase
mathematical knowledge and truth. The new knowledge is presented in the form of theorems that have
been built from axioms and logical mathematical arguments and a theorem is only accepted as true when it
has been proven. The body of knowledge that makes up mathematics is not fixed; it has grown during
human history and is growing at an increasing rate.
The side of mathematics that is based on describing our world and solving practical problems is often
carried out in the context of another area of study. Mathematics is used in a diverse range of disciplines as
both a language and a tool to explore the universe; alongside this its applications include analyzing trends,
making predictions, quantifying risk, exploring relationships and interdependence.
While these two different facets of mathematics may seem separate, they are often deeply connected.
When mathematics is developed, history has taught us that a seemingly obscure, abstract mathematical
theorem or fact may in time be highly significant. On the other hand, much mathematics is developed in response to the needs of other disciplines.
The two mathematics courses available to Diploma Programme (DP) students express both the differences
that exist in mathematics described above and the connections between them. These two courses might
approach mathematics from different perspectives, but they are connected by the same mathematical
body of knowledge, ways of thinking and approaches to problems. The differences in the courses may also
be related to the types of tools, for instance technology, that are used to solve abstract or practical
problems. The next section will describe in more detail the two available courses.
Summary of courses available
Individual students have different needs, aspirations, interests and abilities. For this reason there are two
different subjects in mathematics, each available at SL and HL These courses are designed for different
types of students: those who wish to study mathematics as a subject in its own right or to pursue their
interests in areas related to mathematics, and those who wish to gain understanding and competence in
how mathematics relates to the real world and to other subjects. Each course is designed to meet the needs
of a particular group of students. Mathematics: analysis and approaches and Mathematics: applications and
interpretation are both offered at SL and HL. Therefore, great care should be taken to select the course and
level that is most appropriate for an individual student.
In making this selection, individual students should be advised to take into account the following factors:
•
their own abilities in mathematics and the type of mathematics in which they can be successful •
their own interest in mathematics and those particular areas of the subject that may hold the most interest for them •
their other choices of subjects within the framework of the DP or Career-related Programme (CP)
Introduction
Nature of Mathematics 6

=== Page 13 ===
•
their academic plans, in particular the subjects they wish to study in the future • their choice of career.
Teachers are expected to assist with the selection process and to offer advice to students.
The nature of IB mathematics courses
Figure 2
The mathematics model
The structure of IB DP mathematics courses, with two different routes to choose from, recognizes the two
different aspects of mathematics discussed in the introduction.
Mathematics: analysis and approaches is for students who enjoy developing their mathematics to become
fluent in the construction of mathematical arguments and develop strong skills in mathematical thinking.
They will also be fascinated by exploring real and abstract applications of these ideas, with and without
technology. Students who take Mathematics: analysis and approaches will be those who enjoy the thrill of mathematical problem solving and generalization.
Mathematics: applications and interpretation is for students who are interested in developing their
mathematics for describing our world and solving practical problems. They will also be interested in
harnessing the power of technology alongside exploring mathematical models. Students who take
Mathematics: applications and interpretation will be those who enjoy mathematics best when seen in a practical context.
Both subjects are offered at higher level and SL. There are many elements common to both subjects
although the approaches may be different. Both subjects will prepare students with the mathematics
needed for a range of further educational courses corresponding to the two approaches to mathematics set out above.
Nature of Mathematics 7
Mathematics: applications and interpretation guide

=== Page 14 ===
Mathematics: analysis and approaches
This course recognizes the need for analytical expertise in a world where innovation is increasingly
dependent on a deep understanding of mathematics. This course includes topics that are both traditionally
part of a pre-university mathematics course (for example, functions, trigonometry, calculus) as well as topics
that are amenable to investigation, conjecture and proof, for instance the study of sequences and series at both SL and HL, and proof by induction at HL.
The course allows the use of technology, as fluency in relevant mathematical software and hand-held
technology is important regardless of choice of course. However, Mathematics: analysis and approaches
has a strong emphasis on the ability to construct, communicate and justify correct mathematical arguments.
Mathematics: analysis and approaches: Distinction between SL and
HL
Students who choose Mathematics: analysis and approaches at SL or HL should be comfortable in the
manipulation of algebraic expressions and enjoy the recognition of patterns and understand the
mathematical generalization of these patterns. Students who wish to take Mathematics: analysis and
approaches at higher level will have strong algebraic skills and the ability to understand simple proof. They
will be students who enjoy spending time with problems and get pleasure and satisfaction from solving challenging problems.
Mathematics: applications and interpretation
This course recognizes the increasing role that mathematics and technology play in a diverse range of fields
in a data-rich world. As such, it emphasizes the meaning of mathematics in context by focusing on topics
that are often used as applications or in mathematical modelling. To give this understanding a firm base,
this course also includes topics that are traditionally part of a pre-university mathematics course such as calculus and statistics.
The course makes extensive use of technology to allow students to explore and construct mathematical
models. Mathematics: applications and interpretation will develop mathematical thinking, often in the
context of a practical problem and using technology to justify conjectures.
Mathematics: applications and interpretation: Distinction between
SL and HL
Students who choose Mathematics: applications and interpretation at SL or HL should enjoy seeing
mathematics used in real-world contexts and to solve real-world problems. Students who wish to take
Mathematics: applications and interpretation at higher level will have good algebraic skills and experience
of solving real-world problems. They will be students who get pleasure and satisfaction when exploring
challenging problems and who are comfortable to undertake this exploration using technology.
Mathematics and theory of knowledge
The relationship between each subject and theory of knowledge (TOK) is important and fundamental to the
DP. The theory of knowledge course provides an opportunity for students to reflect on questions about
how knowledge is produced and shared, both in mathematics and also across different areas of knowledge.
It encourages students to reflect on their assumptions and biases, helping them to become more aware of
their own perspective and the perspectives of others and to become “inquiring, knowledgeable and caring young people” (IB mission statement).
As part of their theory of knowledge course, students are encouraged to explore tensions relating to
knowledge in mathematics. As an area of knowledge, mathematics seems to supply a certainty perhaps
impossible in other disciplines and in many instances provides us with tools to debate these certainties.
This may be related to the “purity” of the subject, something that can sometimes make it seem divorced
Nature of Mathematics 8
Mathematics: applications and interpretation guide

=== Page 15 ===
from reality. Yet mathematics has also provided important knowledge about the world and the use of
mathematics in science and technology has been one of the driving forces for scientific advances.
Despite all its undoubted power for understanding and change, mathematics is in the end a puzzling
phenomenon. A fundamental question for all knowers is whether mathematical knowledge really exists
independently of our thinking about it. Is it there, “waiting to be discovered”, or is it a human creation?
Indeed, the philosophy of mathematics is an area of study in its own right.
Students’ attention should be drawn to questions relating theory of knowledge (TOK) and mathematics,
and they should also be encouraged to raise such questions themselves in both their mathematics and TOK
classes. Examples of issues relating to TOK are given in the “Connections” sections of the syllabus. Further
suggestions for making links to TOK can also be found in the mathematics section of the Theory of knowledge guide.
Mathematics and international-mindedness
International-mindedness is a complex and multi-faceted concept that refers to a way of thinking, being
and acting characterized by an openness to the world and a recognition of our deep interconnectedness to others.
Despite recent advances in the development of information and communication technologies, the global
exchange of mathematical information and ideas is not a new phenomenon and has been essential to the
progress of mathematics. Indeed, many of the foundations of modern mathematics were laid many
centuries ago by diverse civilisations – Arabic, Greek, Indian and Chinese among others.
Mathematics can in some ways be seen as an international language and, apart from slightly differing
notation, mathematicians from around the world can communicate effectively within their field.
Mathematics can transcend politics, religion and nationality, and throughout history great civilizations have
owed their success in part to their mathematicians being able to create and maintain complex social and
architectural structures. Politics has dominated the development of mathematics, to develop ballistics,
navigation and trade, and land ownership, often influenced by governments and leaders. Many early
mathematicians were political and military advisers and today mathematicians are integral members of
teams who advise governments on where money and resources should be allocated.
Science and technology are of significant importance in today’s world. As the language of science,
mathematics is an essential component of most technological innovation and underpins developments in
science and technology, although the contribution of mathematics may not always be visible. Examples of
this include the role of the binary number system, matrix algebra, network theory and probability theory in
the digital revolution, or the use of mathematical simulations to predict future climate change or spread of
disease. These examples highlight the key role mathematics can play in transforming the world around us.
One way of fostering international-mindedness is to provide opportunities for inquiry into a range of local
and global issues and ideas. Many international organisations and bodies now exist to promote
mathematics, and students are encouraged to access the resources and often-extensive websites of such
mathematical organisations. This can enhance their appreciation of the international dimension of
mathematics, as well as providing opportunities to engage with global issues surrounding the subject.
Examples of links relating to international-mindedness are given in the “Connections” sections of the syllabus.
Mathematics and creativity, activity, service
CAS experiences can be associated with each of the subject groups of the DP.
CAS and mathematics can complement each other in a number of ways. Mathematical knowledge provides
an important key to understanding the world in which we live, and the mathematical skills and techniques
students learn in the mathematics courses will allow them to evaluate the world around them which will
help them to develop, plan and deliver CAS experiences or projects.
An important aspect of the mathematics courses is that students develop the ability to systematically
analyse situations and can recognize the impact that mathematics can have on the world around them. An
Nature of Mathematics 9
Mathematics: applications and interpretation guide

=== Page 16 ===
awareness of how mathematics can be used to represent the truth enables students to reflect critically on
the information that societies are given or generate, and how this influences the allocation of resources or
the choices that people make. This systematic analysis and critical reflection when problem solving may be inspiring springboards for CAS projects.
Students may also draw on their CAS experiences to enrich their involvement in mathematics both within
and outside the classroom, and mathematics teachers can assist students in making links between their
subjects and students’ CAS experiences where appropriate. Purposeful discussion about real CAS
experiences and projects will help students to make these links.
The challenge and enjoyment of CAS can often have a profound effect on mathematics students, who
might choose, for example, to engage with CAS in the following ways:
•
plan, write and implement a “mathematics scavenger hunt” where younger students tour the school
answering interesting mathematics questions as part of their introduction to a new school •
as a CAS project students could plan and carry out a survey, create a database and analyse the results,
and make suggestions to resolve a problem in the students’ local area. This might be, for example,
surveying the availability of fresh fruit and vegetables within a community, preparing an action plan
with suggestions of how to increase availability or access, and presenting this to a local charity or community group •
taking an element of world culture that interests students and designing a miniature Earth (if the
world were 100 people) to express the trend(s) numerically.
It is important to note that a CAS experience can be a single event or may be an extended series of events.
However, CAS experiences must be distinct from, and may not be included or used in, the student’s
Diploma course requirements.
Additional suggestions on the links between DP subjects and CAS can be found in the Creativity, activity, service teacher support material.
Prior learning
It is expected that most students embarking on a DP mathematics course will have studied mathematics for
at least 10 years. There will be a great variety of topics studied, and differing approaches to teaching and
learning. Thus, students will have a wide variety of skills and knowledge when they start their mathematics
course. Most will have some background in arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, probability and
statistics. Some will be familiar with an inquiry approach, and may have had an opportunity to complete an extended piece of work in mathematics.
At the beginning of the syllabus section there is a list of topics that are considered to be prior learning for
the mathematics courses. It is recognized that this may contain topics that are unfamiliar to some students,
but it is anticipated that there may be other topics in the syllabus itself which these students have already
encountered. Teachers should be informed by their assessment of students’ prior learning to help plan their
teaching so that topics mentioned that are unfamiliar to their students can be incorporated.
Links to the Middle Years Programme
The MYP mathematics framework is designed to prepare students for the study of DP mathematics courses.
As students progress from the MYP to the DP or the Career-related Programme (CP) they continue to
develop their mathematics skills and knowledge, which will then allow them to go on to study a wide range
of topics. Inquiry-based learning is central to mathematics courses in both MYP and the DP, providing
students with opportunities to independently and collaboratively investigate, problem solve and
communicate their mathematics with an increasing level of sophistication.
MYP mathematics courses are concept-driven, aimed at helping the learner to construct meaning through
improved critical thinking and the transfer of knowledge. The MYP courses use a framework of key concepts
with which the concepts in the DP mathematics courses are aligned. These concepts are broad, organizing,
powerful ideas that have relevance within the subject but also transcend it, having relevance in other
Nature of Mathematics 10
Mathematics: applications and interpretation guide

=== Page 17 ===
subject groups. The fundamental concepts of MYP mathematics provide a very useful foundation for students following DP mathematics courses.
The aims of the MYP mathematics courses align very closely with those of the DP mathematics courses. The
prior learning topics for the DP mathematics courses have been written in conjunction with the MYP mathematics guide.
The MYP mathematics assessment objectives and criteria have been developed with both the internal and
external assessment requirements of the DP in mind. MYP mathematics students are required to practise
and develop their investigation skills, one of the MYP four assessment objectives, giving an important
foundation for the internal assessment component of the DP mathematics courses. The MYP assessment
objective of thinking critically also corresponds to the higher-order assessment objectives of
communication and interpretation, and of reasoning that are expected from a DP mathematics student.
MYP and DP mathematics courses emphasized the use of technology as a powerful tool for learning, applying and communicating mathematics.
Where students in the MYP may select either standard or extended mathematics, at DP there are two
mathematics subjects both available at SL and HL. MYP students enrolled in extended mathematics
generally elect to take one of the HL mathematics courses in the DP. Students in MYP standard
mathematics should seek the recommendation of their teacher when deciding which SL or HL course they are best suited to pursue.
Figure 3
The IB continuum pathways to DP courses in mathematics
Links to the Career-related Programme
In the IB Career-related Programme (CP) students study at least two DP subjects, a core consisting of four
components and a career-related study, which is determined by the local context and aligned with student
needs. The CP has been designed to add value to the student’s career-related studies. This provides the
context for the choice of DP courses. Courses can be chosen from any group of the DP. It is also possible to
study more than one course from the same group (for example, visual arts and film).
Nature of Mathematics 11
Mathematics: applications and interpretation guide

=== Page 18 ===
Mathematics may be a beneficial choice for CP students considering careers in, for example, finance,
planning, healthcare systems or coding, tourism industries, the technology industry, social informatics, or
urban planning. Mathematics helps students to understand the value of systematic approaches, how to
analyse complex real-world contexts, how to communicate this concisely and precisely and understand the implications of conclusions.
Mathematics encourages the development of strong written, verbal, and graphical communication skills;
critical and complex thinking; and moral and ethical considerations influenced by mathematics that will
assist students in preparing for the future global workplace. This in turn fosters the IB learner profile
attributes that are transferable to the entire CP, providing relevance and support for the student’s learning.
For the CP students, DP courses can be studied at SL or HL. Schools can explore opportunities to integrate
CP students with DP students.

Conceptual understanding
Concepts are broad, powerful, organizing ideas, the significance of which goes beyond particular origins,
subject matter or place in time. Concepts represent the vehicle for students’ inquiry into issues and ideas of
personal, local and global significance, providing the means by which they can explore the essence of mathematics.
Concepts play an important role in mathematics, helping students and teachers to think with increasing
complexity as they organize and relate facts and topics. Students use conceptual understandings as they
solve problems, analyse issues and evaluate decisions that can have an impact on themselves, their communities and the wider world.
In DP mathematics courses, conceptual understandings are key to promoting deep learning. The course
identifies twelve fundamental concepts which relate with varying emphasis to each of the five topics.
Teachers may identify and develop additional concepts to meet local circumstances and national or state
curriculum requirements. Teachers can use these concepts to develop connections throughout the curriculum.
Each topic in this guide begins by stating the essential understanding of the topic and highlighting relevant
concepts fundamental to the topic. This is followed by suggested conceptual understandings relevant to
the content within the topic, although this list is not intended to be prescriptive or exhaustive.
The concepts
Concepts promote the development of a broad, balanced, conceptual and connected curriculum. They
represent big ideas that are relevant and facilitate connections within topics, across topics and also to other subjects within the DP.
The twelve concepts identified below support conceptual understanding, can inform units of work and can
help to organize teaching and learning. Explanations of each of these concepts in a mathematical context have also been provided.
Approximation
This concept refers to a quantity or a representation which is nearly but not exactly correct.
Change
This concept refers to a variation in size, amount or behaviour.
Equivalence
This concept refers to the state of being identically equal or interchangeable, applied to statements, quantities or expressions.
Generalization
This concept refers to a general statement made on the basis of specific examples.
Modelling
This concept refers to the way in which mathematics can be used to represent the real world.
Patterns
This concept refers to the underlying order, regularity or predictability of the elements of a mathematical system.
Quantity
This concept refers to an amount or number.
Relationships
This concept refers to the connection between quantities, properties or concepts;
these connections may be expressed as models, rules or statements. Relationships
provide opportunities for students to explore patterns in the world around them.

Representation
This concept refers to using words, formulae, diagrams, tables, charts, graphs and models to represent mathematical information.
Space
This concept refers to the frame of geometrical dimensions describing an entity.
Systems
This concept refers to groups of interrelated elements.
Validity
This concept refers to using well-founded, logical mathematics to come to a true and
accurate conclusion or a reasonable interpretation of results.
Mathematical inquiry
Approaches to teaching and learning in the DP refer to deliberate strategies, skills and attitudes that
permeate the teaching and learning environment. These approaches and tools are intrinsically linked to the
IB learner profile, which encourages learning by experimentation, questioning and discovery.
In the IB classroom, students should regularly learn mathematics by being active participants in learning
activities. Teachers should therefore provide students with regular opportunities to learn through
mathematical inquiry, by making frequent use of strategies which stimulate students’ critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

Mathematical modelling
Mathematical modelling is an important technique used in problem solving, to make sense of the real
world. It is often used to help us better understand a situation, to check the effects of change or to inform
decision-making. Engaging students in the mathematical modelling process provides them with such
opportunities. It is one of the most useful mathematical skills that students will need to be successful in
many non-mathematical as well as mathematical courses and careers.
The mathematical modelling process begins with consideration of a situation that exists in the real world
and is not usually artificially created. At this stage assumptions sometimes have to be made in order to
simplify the situation to allow modelling to take place. There is often a fine balance needed between the simplicity and the accuracy of the model.
The first stage involves choosing or fitting a suitable mathematical representation to the context. This
representation is tested to evaluate whether or not it returns expected results. The testing stage allows the
results returned by the model to be reflected upon and adaptations to be made to the model if necessary.
Once a satisfactory model is established it can be applied or used to explain a situation, check the effects of change or to inform decision-making.
The process of mathematical modelling requires critical reflection throughout the process.
More advice and guidance on the process of mathematical modelling is given in the teacher support
material. The cycle of mathematical modelling is illustrated below.

Use of technology
The use of technology is an integral part of DP mathematics courses. Developing an appreciation of how
developments in technology and mathematics have influenced each other is one of the aims of the courses
and using technology accurately, appropriately and efficiently both to explore new ideas and to solve
problems is one of the assessment objectives. Learning how to use different forms of technology is an
important skill in mathematics and time has been allowed in each topic of the syllabus and through the “toolkit” in order to do this.
Technology is a powerful tool in mathematics and in recent years increased student and teacher access to
this technology has supported and advanced the teaching and learning of mathematics. Discerning use of
technology can make more mathematics accessible and motivating to a greater number of students.
Teachers can use technology to support and enhance student understanding in many ways including:
• to bring out teaching points • to address misconceptions • to aid visualization •
to enhance understanding of concepts that would otherwise be restricted by lengthy numerical calculations or algebraic manipulation •
to support students in making conjectures and checking generalizations •
to explicitly make the links between different mathematical representations or approaches.
Students can also use technology to engage with the learning process in many ways including the
following:
•
to develop and enhance their own personal conceptual understanding • to search for patterns • to test conjectures or generalizations • to justify interpretations • to collaborate on project based work • to help organize and analyse data.
In the classroom teachers and students can use technology, working individually or collaboratively, to
explore mathematical concepts. The key to successful learning of mathematics with technology is the fine
balance between the teacher and student use of technology, with carefully chosen use of technology to
support the understanding and the communication of the mathematics itself.
Many topics within the DP mathematics courses lend themselves to the use of technology. Graphical
calculators, dynamic graphing software, spreadsheets, simulations, apps, dynamic geometry software and
interactive whiteboard software are just a few of the many kinds of technology available to support the teaching and learning of mathematics.
Within the guide the term “technology” is used for any form of calculator, hardware or software that may be
available in the classroom. The terms “analysis” and “analytic approach” are generally used in the guide to
indicate an algebraic approach that may not require the use of technology. It is important to note there will
be restrictions on which technology may be used in examinations, which will be detailed in relevant documents.
As teachers tie together the unifying themes of mathematical inquiry, mathematical modelling and the
use of technology, they should begin by providing substantial guidance and then gradually encourage
students to become more independent as inquirers and thinkers. DP students should learn to become
strong communicators through the language of mathematics. Teachers should create a learning
environment in which students are comfortable as risk takers and inquiry, conceptual understanding,
collaboration and use of technology feature prominently.

resources can be found on the programme resource centre and details of workshops for professional development are available on the public website.
Format of the syllabus
The format of the syllabus section of the mathematics guides is the same for each subject and each level.
This structure gives prominence and focus to the aspects of teaching and learning, including conceptual understandings, content and enrichment.
There are five topics and within these topics there are sub-topics. The five topics are:
• number and algebra • functions • geometry and trigonometry • probability and statistics • calculus
Each topic begins with a section on conceptual understandings. Details are given of which of the twelve key
concepts could be used to relate to the topic. Essential understandings give details of the overall aims of
the topic and then content-specific conceptual understandings give specific details of the aims and purpose of the topic and sub-topics.
Each topic begins with SL content which is common to both Mathematics: analysis and approaches and to
Mathematics: applications and interpretation.
Each topic has SL content followed by additional higher level (AHL) content. Teachers should ensure that
they cover all SL content with SL students, and all SL and AHL content with HL students. The topics are
structured so that an informal introduction in the common content may be formalized in the SL content
and then extended further in the AHL content. For example the extension of the set of numbers for which
something is defined could be integers in the common content, positive real numbers in the SL content
and all real and complex numbers in the AHL content.
The content of all five topics at the appropriate level must be taught, however not necessarily in the order
in which they appear in the guide. Teachers are expected to construct a course of study that addresses the
needs of their students and includes, where necessary, the topics noted in prior learning. Guidance on
structuring a course is given in the teacher support material.
Each topic has three sections:
Content: The column on the left contains details of the sub-topics to be covered.
Guidance, clarification and syllabus links: The column on the right contains more detailed information
on specific sub-topics listed in the content column. This clarifies the content for the examination and
highlights where sub-topics relate to other sub-topics within the syllabus.
Connections: Each topic also contains a short section that provides suggestions for further discussion,
including real-life examples and ideas for further investigation.
These suggestions are only a guide and are not exhaustive. A downloadable version of these sections is also
available, so that additional connections can be added to the ones already suggested by the IB. Potential areas for connections include:
•
Other contexts: Real-life examples •
Links to other subjects: Suggested links to other subjects within the DP. Note that these are correct
for the current (2019) published versions of the guides •
Aim: Links to the aims of the course •
International-mindedness: Suggestions for discussions •
TOK: Suggestions for discussions •

Enrichment: Suggestions for further discussions that may reinforce understanding.
Planning your course
The syllabus as provided in the subject guide is not intended to be a teaching order. Instead it provides
detail of what must be covered by the end of the course. A school should develop a scheme of work that
best works for its own students. For example, the scheme of work could be developed to match available
resources, to take into account prior learning and experience, or in conjunction with other local requirements.
HL teachers may choose to teach the SL content and AHL content at the same time or teach them in a spiral
fashion, by teaching the SL content first and revisiting these topics through the delivery of the AHL topics after this.
However the course is planned, adequate time must be provided for examination revision. Time must also
be given to students to reflect on their learning experience and their growth as learners.
Time allocation
The recommended teaching time for HL courses is 240 hours and for SL courses is 150 hours. For
mathematics courses at both SL and HL, it is expected that 30 hours will be spent on developing inquiry,
modelling and investigation skills. This includes up to 15 hours for work on the internal assessment which is
called the exploration. The time allocations given in this guide are approximate, and are intended to
suggest how the remaining 210 hours for HL and 120 hours for SL allowed for the teaching of the syllabus
might be allocated. The exact time spent on each topic depends on a number of factors, including the
background knowledge and level of preparedness of each student. Teachers should therefore adjust these
timings to correspond to the needs of their students.
The Toolkit
Time has been allocated within the teaching hours for students to undertake the types of activities that
mathematicians in the real world undertake and to allow students time to develop the skill of thinking like a
mathematician–in other words providing students with a mathematical toolkit which will allow them to
approach any type of mathematical problem. Underpinning this are the six pedagogical approaches to
teaching and the five approaches to learning which support all IB programmes. This time gives students
opportunities in the classroom for undertaking an inquiry-based approach and focusing on conceptual
understanding of the content, developing their awareness of mathematics in local and global contexts,
gives them opportunities for teamwork and collaboration as well as time to reflect upon their own learning of mathematics.
Students should be encouraged to actively identify skills that they might add to their personal mathematics
toolkit. Teachers are encouraged to make explicit where these skills might transfer across areas of
mathematics content and allow students to reflect upon where these skills transfer to other subjects the student is studying.
The teacher support material (TSM) contains a section referred to as the “toolkit”. This section contains ideas
and resources that teachers can use with their students to encourage the development of mathematical
thinking skills. These resources have been developed by teachers for use in their own classrooms and are not exhaustive.

Formulae and the formula booklet
Formulae are only included in this guide document where there may be some ambiguity. All formulae
required for the course are in the mathematics formula booklet.
From the beginning of the course it is recommended that teachers ensure students are familiar with the
contents of the formula booklet by either giving students a printed copy or making an electronic copy available to them.
Each student is required to have access to a clean copy of the formula booklet during the examination. For
each examination, it is the responsibility of the school to download a copy of the formula booklet from IBIS
or the programme resource centre, check that there are no printing errors, and ensure that there are sufficient copies available for all students.
Command terms and notation list
Teachers and students need to be familiar with the IB notation list and the command terms, as these will be
used without explanation in the examination papers. The “Glossary of command terms” and “Notation list” appear as appendices in this guide.

Prior to starting a DP mathematics course students have extensive previous mathematical experiences, but
these will vary. It is expected that mathematics students will be familiar with the following topics before
they take the examinations because questions assume knowledge of them. Teachers must therefore ensure
that any topics listed here that are unknown to their students at the start of the course are included at an
early stage. Teachers should also take into account the existing mathematical knowledge of their students
to design an appropriate course of study for mathematics. This table lists the knowledge, together with the

Topic 2: Functions
Concepts
Essential understandings:
Models are depictions of real-life events using expressions, equations or graphs while a function is defined
as a relation or expression involving one or more variable. Creating different representations of functions to
model the relationships between variables, visually and symbolically as graphs, equations and/or tables
represents different ways to communicate mathematical ideas.
Suggested concepts embedded in this topic:
Representation, relationships, space, modelling, change.
AHL: Generalization, validity.
Content-specific conceptual understandings:
•
Different representations of functions, symbolically and visually as graphs, equations and tables
provide different ways to communicate mathematical relationships.
•
The parameters in a function or equation may correspond to notable geometrical features of a graph
and can represent physical quantities in spatial dimensions.
•
Moving between different forms to represent functions allows for deeper understanding and provides different approaches to problem solving.
•
Our spatial frame of reference affects the visible part of a function and by changing this “window” can
show more or less of the function to best suit our needs.
•
Changing the parameters of a trigonometric function changes the position, orientation and shape of the corresponding graph.
•
Different representations facilitate modelling and interpretation of physical, social, economic and
mathematical phenomena, which support solving real-life problems.
•
Technology plays a key role in allowing humans to represent the real world as a model and to quantify the appropriateness of the model.
AHL •
Extending results from a specific case to a general form and making connections between related
functions allows us to better understand physical phenomena.
•
Generalization provides an insight into variation and allows us to access ideas such as half-life and
scaling logarithmically to adapt theoretical models and solve complex real-life problems.
•
Considering the reasonableness and validity of results helps us to make informed, unbiased decisions.

Topic 4: Statistics and probability
Concepts
Essential understandings:
Statistics is concerned with the collection, analysis and interpretation of quantitative data and uses the
theory of probability to estimate parameters, discover empirical laws, test hypotheses and predict the
occurrence of events. Statistical representations and measures allow us to represent data in many different forms to aid interpretation.
Probability enables us to quantify the likelihood of events occurring and so evaluate risk. Both statistics and
probability provide important representations which enable us to make predictions, valid comparisons and
informed decisions. These fields have power and limitations and should be applied with care and critically
questioned, in detail, to differentiate between the theoretical and the empirical/observed. Probability
theory allows us to make informed choices, to evaluate risk and to make predictions about seemingly random events.
Suggested concepts embedded in this topic:
Quantity, validity, approximation, modelling, relationships, patterns.
AHL: Systems, representation.
Content-specific conceptual understandings:
•
Organizing, representing, analysing and interpreting data, and utilizing different statistical tools
facilitates prediction and drawing of conclusions.
•
Different statistical techniques require justification and the identification of their limitations and validity.
•
Approximation in data can approach the truth but may not always achieve it.
•
Correlation and regression are powerful tools for identifying patterns and equivalence of systems.
Syllabus content 50
Mathematics: applications and interpretation guide

=== Page 57 ===
•
Modelling and finding structure in seemingly random events facilitates prediction.
•
Different probability distributions provide a representation of the relationship between the theory and
reality, allowing us to make predictions about what might happen.
AHL •
Statistical literacy involves identifying reliability and validity of samples and whole populations in a closed system.
•
A systematic approach to hypothesis testing allows statistical inferences to be tested for validity.
•
Representation of probabilities using transition matrices enables us to efficiently predict long-term behaviour and outcomes.
SL content
Recommended teaching hours: 36
The aim of the standard level content in the statistics and probability topic is to introduce students to
important concepts, techniques and representations used in statistics and probability and their meaningful
application in the real world. Students should be given the opportunity to approach this topic in a practical
way, to understand why certain techniques are used and to interpret the results. The use of technology
such as simulations, spreadsheets, statistics software and statistics apps can greatly enhance this topic.
It is expected that most of the calculations required will be carried out using technology, but explanations
of calculations by hand may enhance understanding. The emphasis is on choosing the most appropriate
technique, and understanding and interpreting the results obtained in context.
In examinations students should be familiar with how to use the statistics functionality of allowed technology.

Topic 5: Calculus
Concepts
Essential understandings:
Calculus describes rates of change between two variables and the accumulation of limiting areas.
Understanding these rates of change allows us to model, interpret and analyze real-world problems and
situations. Calculus helps us understand the behaviour of functions and allows us to interpret the features of their graphs.
Suggested concepts embedded in this topic:
Change, patterns, relationships, approximation, space, generalization.
AHL: Systems, quantity.
Content-specific conceptual understandings:
•
Students will understand the links between the derivative and the rate of change and interpret the meaning of this in context.
•
Students will understand the relationship between the integral and area and interpret the meaning of this in context.
•
Finding patterns in the derivatives of polynomials and their behavior, such as increasing or decreasing,
allows a deeper appreciation of the properties of the function at any given point or instant.
•
Calculus is a concise form of communication used to approximate nature.
•
Numerical integration can be used to approximate areas in the physical world.
•
Optimization of a function allows us to find the largest or smallest value that a function can take in
general and can be applied to a specific set of conditions to solve problems.
•
Maximum and minimum points help to solve optimization problems.
•
The area under a function on a graph has a meaning and has applications in space and time.
AHL •
Kinematics allows us to describe the motion and direction of objects in closed systems in terms of displacement, velocity, and acceleration.
•
Many physical phenomena can be modelled using differential equations and analytic and numeric
methods can be used to calculate optimum quantities.

General
Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most important aim of assessment in the DP is
that it should support curricular goals and encourage appropriate student learning. Both external and
internal assessments are used in the DP. IB examiners mark work produced for external assessment, while
work produced for internal assessment is marked by teachers and externally moderated by the IB.
There are two types of assessment identified by the IB.
Formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is concerned with providing accurate and
helpful feedback to students and teachers on the kind of learning taking place and the nature of students’
strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop students’ understanding and capabilities. Formative
assessment can also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide information to monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives.
Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is concerned with measuring student achievement.
The DP primarily focuses on summative assessment designed to record student achievement at, or towards
the end of, the course of study. However, many of the assessment instruments can also be used formatively
during the course of teaching and learning, and teachers are encouraged to do this. A comprehensive
assessment plan is viewed as being integral with teaching, learning and course organization. For further
information, see the IB Programme standards and practices document.
The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not norm-referenced. This approach to
assessment judges students’ work by their performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, and
not in relation to the work of other students. For further information on assessment within the DP please
refer to the publication DP assessment: Principles and practice.
To support teachers in the planning, delivery and assessment of the DP courses, a variety of resources can
be found on the programme resource centre or purchased from the IB store (store.ibo.org). Additional
publications such as specimen papers and markschemes, teacher support materials, subject reports and
grade descriptors can also be found on the programme resource centre. Past examination papers as well as markschemes can be purchased from the IB store.
Methods of assessment
The IB uses several methods to assess work produced by students.
Assessment criteria
Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended. Each criterion concentrates on a
particular skill that students are expected to demonstrate. An assessment objective describes what
students should be able to do, and assessment criteria describe how well they should be able to do it. Using
assessment criteria allows discrimination between different answers and encourages a variety of responses.
Each criterion comprises a set of hierarchically-ordered level descriptors. Each level descriptor is worth one
or more marks. Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The maximum marks for each
criterion may differ according to the criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are added
together to give the total mark for the piece of work.
Assessment
Assessment in the Diploma Programme 72
Mathematics: applications and interpretation guide

=== Page 79 ===
Markbands
Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance against which responses are judged.
They represent a single holistic criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor corresponds to
a range of marks to differentiate student performance. A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which
particular mark to use from the possible range for each level descriptor.
Analytic markschemes
Analytic markschemes are prepared for those examination questions that expect a particular kind of
response and/or a given final answer from students. They give detailed instructions to examiners on how to
break down the total mark for each question for different parts of the response.
Marking notes
For some assessment components marked using assessment criteria, marking notes are provided. Marking
notes give guidance on how to apply assessment criteria to the particular requirements of a question.
Inclusive assessment arrangements
Inclusive assessment arrangements are available for candidates with assessment access requirements.
These arrangements enable candidates with diverse needs to access the examinations and demonstrate
their knowledge and understanding of the constructs being assessed.
The IB’s Access and inclusion policy provides details on all the inclusive assessment arrangements available
to candidates with learning support requirements. The IB document Learning diversity and inclusion in the IB
programmes outlines the position of the IB with regard to candidates with diverse learning needs in the IB
programmes. For candidates affected by adverse circumstances, the IB documents General regulations:
Diploma Programme and Diploma Programme Assessment procedures provide details on access consideration.
Responsibilities of the school
The school is required to ensure that that equal access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are
provided to candidates with learning support requirements that are in line with the IB documents Access
and inclusion policy and Learning diversity and inclusion in the IB programmes.

Papers 1 and 2 will contain some questions, or parts of questions, which are common with SL.
Calculators
For all three examination papers, students must have access to a GDC at all times. Regulations covering the
types of GDC allowed are provided in Diploma Programme Assessment procedures.
Formula booklet
Each student must have access to a clean copy of the formula booklet during the examination. It is the
responsibility of the school to download a copy from IBIS or the programme resource centre and to ensure
that there are sufficient copies available for all students.
Awarding of marks
Marks are awarded for method, accuracy, answers and reasoning, including interpretation.
In papers 1, 2 and 3, full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Where an
answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for correct method, provided this is shown by written
working. All students should therefore be advised to show their working.

Purpose of internal assessment
Internal assessment is an integral part of the course and is compulsory for both SL and HL students. It
enables students to demonstrate the application of their skills and knowledge and to pursue their personal
interests without the time limitations and other constraints that are associated with written examinations.
The internal assessment should, as far as possible, be woven into normal classroom teaching and not be a
separate activity conducted after a course has been taught.
The internal assessment requirements at SL and at HL is an individual exploration. This is a piece of written
work that involves investigating an area of mathematics. It is marked according to five assessment criteria.
Guidance and authenticity
The exploration submitted for internal assessment must be the student’s own work. However, it is not the
intention that students should decide upon a title or topic and be left to work on the internal assessment
component without any further support from the teacher. The teacher should play an important role during
both the planning stage and the period when the student is working on the exploration.
It is the responsibility of the teacher to ensure that students are familiar with:
•
the requirements of the type of work to be internally assessed •
the IB academic honesty policy available on the programme resource centre •
the assessment criteria; students must understand that the work submitted for assessment must address these criteria effectively.
Teachers and students must discuss the exploration. Students should be encouraged to initiate discussions
with the teacher to obtain advice and information, and students must not be penalized for seeking
guidance. As part of the learning process, teachers should read and give advice to students on one draft of
the work. The teacher should provide oral or written advice on how the work could be improved, but not
edit the draft. The next version handed to the teacher must be the final version for submission.
It is the responsibility of teachers to ensure that all students understand the basic meaning and significance
of concepts that relate to academic honesty, especially authenticity and intellectual property. Teachers
must ensure that all student work for assessment is prepared according to requirements and must explain
clearly to students that the internally assessed work must be entirely their own.
All work submitted to the IB for moderation or assessment must be authenticated by a teacher, and must
not include any known instances of suspected or confirmed malpractice. Each student must confirm that
the work is his or her authentic work and constitutes the final version of that work. Once a student has
officially submitted the final version of the work it cannot be retracted. The requirement to confirm the
authenticity of work applies to the work of all students, not just the sample work that will be submitted to
the IB for the purpose of moderation. For further details refer to the IB publication Academic honesty in the IB
educational context, The Diploma Programme: From principles into practice and the relevant articles in General
regulations: Diploma Programme.
Authenticity may be checked by discussion with the student on the content of the work, and scrutiny of one or more of the following:
• the student’s initial proposal • the draft of the written work • the references cited •
the style of writing compared with work known to be that of the student
Assessment
Internal assessment 81
Mathematics: applications and interpretation guide

=== Page 88 ===
•
the analysis of the work by a web-based plagiarism detection service such as www.turnitin.com.
The same piece of work cannot be submitted to meet the requirements of both the internal assessment and the extended essay.
Collaboration and teamwork
Collaboration and teamwork are a key focus of the approaches to teaching in the DP. It is advisable that the
teacher uses the available class time to manage student collaboration. While working on their exploration
students should be encouraged to work collaboratively in the various phases of the process, for example:
• generating ideas • selecting the topic for their exploration • sharing research sources •
acquiring the necessary knowledge, skills and understanding • seeking peer feedback on their writing.
The Approaches to teaching and learning (ATL) website on the programme resource centre provides an
excellent source for developing collaborative skills in students.
While students should be encouraged to talk through their ideas with others, it is not appropriate to work
together on a single exploration. It is important that students demonstrate how they incorporated sources
and collaborative ideas into their work and that they always show their understanding and engagement in
the work as described in the assessment criteria. Marks are awarded for the student’s development and
contribution to their exploration, not for work found in literature or carried out by others either individually or collaboratively.
It is imperative that students understand that the writing and calculations they do in their work must
always be their own. This means that the argument they make and the ideas they rely on to make it, should
either be their own or they should give credit to the source of those ideas. Any sources must be cited
accordingly. This includes pictures, diagrams, graphs, formulae, etc.
In the specific cases of collecting information, data or measurements it is imperative that each student
collects their own data, even in a case where collection of measurements is made from a group experiment.
Group data or measurements can be combined to provide enough information for individual analysis and
this should be clearly described in the written exploration.
Time allocation
Internal assessment is an integral part of the mathematics courses, contributing 20% to the final assessment
in the SL and the HL courses. This weighting should be reflected in the time that is allocated to teaching the
knowledge, skills and understanding required to undertake the work, as well as the total time allocated to carry out the work.
It is recommended that a total of approximately 10-15 hours of teaching time should be allocated to the work. This should include:
•
time for the teacher to explain to students the requirements of the exploration •
class time for students to work on the exploration and ask questions •
time for consultation between the teacher and each student •
time to review and monitor progress, and to check authenticity.
Requirements and recommendations
Students can choose from a wide variety of activities: for example, modelling, investigations and
applications of mathematics. To assist teachers and students in the choice of a topic, a list of stimuli is
available in the teacher support material. However, students are not restricted to this list.
Internal assessment 82
Mathematics: applications and interpretation guide

=== Page 89 ===
The exploration should be approximately 12-20 pages long with double line spacing, including diagrams
and graphs, but excluding the bibliography. However, it is the quality of the mathematical writing that is important, not the length.
The teacher is expected to give appropriate guidance at all stages of the exploration by, for example,
directing students into more productive routes of inquiry, making suggestions for suitable sources of
information, and providing advice on the content and clarity of the exploration in the writing-up stage.
Teachers are responsible for indicating to students the existence of errors but should not explicitly correct
these errors. It must be emphasized that students are expected to consult the teacher throughout the process.
All students should be familiar with the requirements of the exploration and the criteria by which it is
assessed. Students need to start planning their explorations as early as possible in the course. Deadlines
should be firmly established and adhered to. There should be a date for submission of the exploration topic
and a brief outline description, a date for the submission of the draft and, of course, a date for completion.
In developing their explorations, students should aim to make use of mathematics learned as part of the
course. The mathematics used should be commensurate with the level of the course–that is, it should be
similar to that suggested in the syllabus. It is not expected that students produce work that is outside the syllabus–however, this will not be penalized.
Ethical guidelines should be adhered to throughout the planning and conducting of the exploration.
Further details are given in the Ethical practice in the Diploma Programme poster on the programme resource centre.
Presentation
The following details should be stated on the cover page of the exploration:
• title of the exploration • number of pages.
The references are not assessed. However, if they are not included in the final report it may be flagged in terms of academic honesty.
Using assessment criteria for internal assessment
For internal assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion
has level descriptors describing specific achievement levels, together with an appropriate range of marks.
The level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure to achieve may be included in the description.
Teachers must judge the internally assessed work at SL and at HL against the criteria using the level descriptors.
The assessment criteria A to D are the same for both SL and HL. Criterion E “Use of mathematics” is different for SL and HL.
The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by the
student, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be made when a
piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark awarded should be one
that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is not necessary for every single
aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.
When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level descriptors for each criterion until they
reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a piece of work
seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the one that more
appropriately describes the student’s work should be chosen.
Where there are two or more marks available within a level, teachers should award the upper marks if the
student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent; the work may be close to achieving
Internal assessment 83
Mathematics: applications and interpretation guide

=== Page 90 ===
marks in the level above. Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work demonstrates the
qualities described to a lesser extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in the level below.
Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks, (fractions or decimals) are not acceptable.
Teachers should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying the
appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.
The highest-level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by a student.
Teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of the work being assessed.
A student who attains a high achievement level in relation to one criterion will not necessarily attain high
achievement levels in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a student who attains a low achievement level
for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the other criteria. Teachers should not
assume that the overall assessment of the students will produce any particular distribution of marks.
It is recommended that the assessment criteria be made available to students.
Internal assessment details
Mathematical exploration
Duration: 10 to 15 hours
Weighting: 20%
Introduction
The internally-assessed component in this course is a mathematical exploration. This is a short report
written by the student based on a topic chosen by him or her, and it should focus on the mathematics of
that particular area. The emphasis is on mathematical communication (including formulae, diagrams,
graphs, tables and so on), with his or her own focus, with the teacher providing feedback via, for example,
discussion and interview. This will allow the students to develop areas of interest to them without a time
constraint as in an examination, and allow all students to experience a feeling of success.
The final report should be approximately 12-20 pages long with double line spacing. It can be either word
processed or handwritten. Students should be able to explain all stages of their work in such a way that
demonstrates clear understanding. While there is no requirement that students present their work in class,
it should be written in such a way that their peers would be able to follow it fairly easily. The report should
include a detailed bibliography, and sources need to be referenced in line with the IB academic honesty policy. Direct quotes must be acknowledged.
The purpose of the exploration
The aims of the Mathematics: analysis and approaches and Mathematics: applications and interpretation
courses at both SL and HL are carried through into the objectives that are formally assessed as part of the
course, through either written examination papers or the exploration, or both. In addition to testing the
objectives of the course, the exploration is intended to provide students with opportunities to increase
their understanding of mathematical concepts and processes, and to develop a wider appreciation of
mathematics. These are noted in the aims of the course. It is intended that, by doing the exploration,
students benefit from the mathematical activities undertaken and find them both stimulating and
rewarding. It will enable students to acquire the attributes of the IB learner profile.
The specific purposes of the exploration are to:
•
develop students’ personal insight into the nature of mathematics and to develop their ability to ask their own questions about mathematics •
provide opportunities for students to complete a piece of mathematical work over an extended period of time •
enable students to experience the satisfaction of applying mathematical processes independently
Internal assessment 84
Mathematics: applications and interpretation guide

=== Page 91 ===
•
provide students with the opportunity to experience for themselves the beauty, power and usefulness of mathematics •
encourage students, where appropriate, to discover, use and appreciate the power of technology as a mathematical tool •
enable students to develop the qualities of patience and persistence, and to reflect on the significance of their work •
provide opportunities for students to show, with confidence, how they have developed mathematically.
Management of the exploration
Work on the exploration should be incorporated into the course so that students are given the opportunity
to learn the skills needed. Time in class can therefore be used for general discussion of areas of study, as
well as familiarizing students with the criteria. Further details on the development of the exploration are included in the teacher support material.
Internal assessment criteria—SL and HL
The exploration is internally assessed by the teacher and externally moderated by the IB using assessment
criteria that relate to the objectives for mathematics.
Each exploration is assessed against the following five criteria. The final mark for each exploration is the
sum of the scores for each criterion. The maximum possible final mark is 20.
Students will not receive a grade for their mathematics course if they have not submitted an exploration.
Criterion A
Presentation
Criterion B
Mathematical communication
Criterion C
Personal engagement
Criterion D
Reflection
Criterion E
Use of mathematics
Criterion A: Presentation
Achievement level Descriptor 0
The exploration does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.
1
The exploration has some coherence or some organization.
2
The exploration has some coherence and shows some organization.
3
The exploration is coherent and well organized.
4
The exploration is coherent, well organized, and concise.
The “presentation” criterion assesses the organization and coherence of the exploration.
A coherent exploration is logically developed, easy to follow and meets its aim. This refers to the overall
structure or framework, including introduction, body, conclusion and how well the different parts link to each other.
A well-organized exploration includes an introduction, describes the aim of the exploration and has a
conclusion. Relevant graphs, tables and diagrams should accompany the work in the appropriate place and
not be attached as appendices to the document. Appendices should be used to include information on
large data sets, additional graphs, diagrams and tables.
Internal assessment 85
Mathematics: applications and interpretation guide

=== Page 92 ===
A concise exploration does not show irrelevant or unnecessary repetitive calculations, graphs or descriptions.
The use of technology is not required but encouraged where appropriate. However, the use of analytic
approaches rather than technological ones does not necessarily mean lack of conciseness, and should not
be penalized. This does not mean that repetitive calculations are condoned.
Criterion B: Mathematical communication
Achievement level
Descriptor 0
The exploration does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.
1
The exploration contains some relevant mathematical communication which is partially appropriate.
2
The exploration contains some relevant appropriate mathematical communication.
3
The mathematical communication is relevant, appropriate and is mostly consistent.
4
The mathematical communication is relevant, appropriate and consistent throughout.
The “mathematical communication” criterion assesses to what extent the student has:
•
used appropriate mathematical language (notation, symbols, terminology). Calculator and
computer notation is acceptable only if it is software generated. Otherwise it is expected that students
use appropriate mathematical notation in their work • defined key terms and variables, where required •
used multiple forms of mathematical representation, such as formulae, diagrams, tables, charts, graphs and models, where appropriate •
used a deductive method and set out proofs logically where appropriate
Examples of level 1 can include graphs not being labelled, consistent use of computer notation with no
other forms of correct mathematical communication.
Level 4 can be achieved by using only one form of mathematical representation as long as this is
appropriate to the topic being explored. For level 4, any minor errors that do not impair clear communication should not be penalized.
Criterion C: Personal engagement
Achievement level
Descriptor 0
The exploration does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.
1
There is evidence of some personal engagement.
2
There is evidence of significant personal engagement.
3
There is evidence of outstanding personal engagement.
The “personal engagement” criterion assesses the extent to which the student engages with the topic by
exploring the mathematics and making it their own. It is not a measure of effort.
Personal engagement may be recognized in different ways. These include thinking independently or
creatively, presenting mathematical ideas in their own way, exploring the topic from different perspectives,
making and testing predictions. Further (but not exhaustive) examples of personal engagement at different
levels are given in the teacher support material (TSM).
Internal assessment 86
Mathematics: applications and interpretation guide

=== Page 93 ===
There must be evidence of personal engagement demonstrated in the student’s work. It is not sufficient
that a teacher comments that a student was highly engaged.
Textbook style explorations or reproduction of readily available mathematics without the candidate’s own
perspective are unlikely to achieve the higher levels.
Significant: The student demonstrates authentic personal engagement in the exploration on a few
occasions and it is evident that these drive the exploration forward and help the reader to better understand the writer’s intentions.
Outstanding: The student demonstrates authentic personal engagement in the exploration in numerous
instances and they are of a high quality. It is evident that these drive the exploration forward in a creative
way. It leaves the impression that the student has developed, through their approach, a complete
understanding of the context of the exploration topic and the reader better understands the writer’s intentions.
Criterion D: Reflection
Achievement level
Descriptor 0
The exploration does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.
1
There is evidence of limited reflection.
2
There is evidence of meaningful reflection.
3
There is substantial evidence of critical reflection.
The “reflection” criterion assesses how the student reviews, analyses and evaluates the exploration.
Although reflection may be seen in the conclusion to the exploration, it may also be found throughout the exploration.
Simply describing results represents limited reflection. Further consideration is required to achieve the higher levels.
Some ways of showing meaningful reflection are: linking to the aims of the exploration, commenting on
what they have learned, considering some limitation or comparing different mathematical approaches.
Critical reflection is reflection that is crucial, deciding or deeply insightful. It will often develop the
exploration by addressing the mathematical results and their impact on the student’s understanding of the
topic. Some ways of showing critical reflection are: considering what next, discussing implications of results,
discussing strengths and weaknesses of approaches, and considering different perspectives.
Substantial evidence means that the critical reflection is present throughout the exploration. If it appears
at the end of the exploration it must be of high quality and demonstrate how it developed the exploration in order to achieve a level 3.
Further (but not exhaustive) examples of reflection at different levels are given in the teacher support material (TSM).
Criterion E: Use of mathematics—SL
Achievement level
Descriptor 0
The exploration does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.
1
Some relevant mathematics is used.
2
Some relevant mathematics is used. Limited understanding is demonstrated.
3
Relevant mathematics commensurate with the level of the course is used. Limited understanding is demonstrated.
Internal assessment 87
Mathematics: applications and interpretation guide

=== Page 94 ===
Achievement level
Descriptor 4
Relevant mathematics commensurate with the level of the course is used. The
mathematics explored is partially correct. Some knowledge and understanding are demonstrated.
5
Relevant mathematics commensurate with the level of the course is used. The
mathematics explored is mostly correct. Good knowledge and understanding are demonstrated.
6
Relevant mathematics commensurate with the level of the course is used. The
mathematics explored is correct. Thorough knowledge and understanding are demonstrated.
The “Use of mathematics” SL criterion assesses to what extent students use mathematics that is relevant to the exploration.
Relevant refers to mathematics that supports the development of the exploration towards the completion
of its aim. Overly complicated mathematics where simple mathematics would suffice is not relevant.
Students are expected to produce work that is commensurate with the level of the course, which means it
should not be completely based on mathematics listed in the prior learning. The mathematics explored
should either be part of the syllabus, or at a similar level.
A key word in the descriptor is demonstrated. The command term demonstrate means “to make clear by
reasoning or evidence, illustrating with examples or practical application”. Obtaining the correct answer is
not sufficient to demonstrate understanding (even some understanding) in order to achieve level 2 or higher.
For knowledge and understanding to be thorough it must be demonstrated throughout.
The mathematics can be regarded as correct even if there are occasional minor errors as long as they do
not detract from the flow of the mathematics or lead to an unreasonable outcome.
Students are encouraged to use technology to obtain results where appropriate, but understanding must
be demonstrated in order for the student to achieve higher than level 1, for example merely substituting
values into a formula does not necessarily demonstrate understanding of the results.
The mathematics only needs to be what is required to support the development of the exploration. This
could be a few small elements of mathematics or even a single topic (or sub-topic) from the syllabus. It is
better to do a few things well than a lot of things not so well. If the mathematics used is relevant to the
topic being explored, commensurate with the level of the course and understood by the student, then it can achieve a high level in this criterion.
Criterion E: Use of mathematics—HL
Achievement level
Descriptor 0
The exploration does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.
1
Some relevant mathematics is used. Limited understanding is demonstrated.
2
Some relevant mathematics is used. The mathematics explored is partially correct.
Some knowledge and understanding is demonstrated.
3
Relevant mathematics commensurate with the level of the course is used. The
mathematics explored is correct. Some knowledge and understanding are demonstrated.
Internal assessment 88

Achievement level
Descriptor 4
Relevant mathematics commensurate with the level of the course is used. The
mathematics explored is correct. Good knowledge and understanding are demonstrated.
5
Relevant mathematics commensurate with the level of the course is used. The
mathematics explored is correct and demonstrates sophistication or rigour. Thorough knowledge and understanding are demonstrated.
6
Relevant mathematics commensurate with the level of the course is used. The
mathematics explored is precise and demonstrates sophistication and rigour.
Thorough knowledge and understanding are demonstrated.
The “Use of mathematics” HL criterion assesses to what extent students use relevant mathematics in the exploration.
Students are expected to produce work that is commensurate with the level of the course, which means it
should not be completely based on mathematics listed in the prior learning. The mathematics explored
should either be part of the syllabus, at a similar level or slightly beyond. However, mathematics of a level
slightly beyond the syllabus is not required to achieve the highest levels.
A key word in the descriptor is demonstrated. The command term demonstrate means to make clear by
reasoning or evidence, illustrating with examples or practical application. Obtaining the correct answer is
not sufficient to demonstrate understanding (even some understanding) in order to achieve level 2 or higher.
For knowledge and understanding to be thorough it must be demonstrated throughout. Lines of reasoning
must be shown to justify steps in the mathematical development of the exploration.
Relevant refers to mathematics that supports the development of the exploration towards the completion
of its aim. Overly complicated mathematics where simple mathematics would suffice is not relevant.
The mathematics can be regarded as correct even if there are occasional minor errors as long as they do
not detract from the flow of the mathematics or lead to an unreasonable outcome. Precise mathematics is
error-free and uses an appropriate level of accuracy at all times.
Sophistication: To be considered as sophisticated the mathematics used should be commensurate with
the HL syllabus or, if contained in the SL syllabus, the mathematics has been used in a complex way that is
beyond what could reasonably be expected of an SL student. Sophistication in mathematics may include
understanding and using challenging mathematical concepts, looking at a problem from different
perspectives and seeing underlying structures to link different areas of mathematics.
Rigour involves clarity of logic and language when making mathematical arguments and calculations.
Mathematical claims relevant to the development of the exploration must be justified or proven.
Students are encouraged to use technology to obtain results where appropriate, but understanding must
be demonstrated in order for the student to achieve level 1 or higher, for example merely substituting
values into a formula does not necessarily demonstrate understanding of the results.
The mathematics only needs to be what is required to support the development of the exploration. This
could be a few small elements of mathematics or even a single topic (or sub-topic) from the syllabus. It is
better to do a few things well than a lot of things not so well. If the mathematics used is relevant to the
topic being explored, commensurate with the level of the course and understood by the student, then it can achieve a high level in this criterion.

There are various systems of notation in use, and the IB has chosen to adopt a system of notation based on

the examination papers for this course without explanation. If forms of notation other than those listed in
this guide are used on a particular examination paper, they are defined within the question in which they appear.
Because students are required to recognize, though not necessarily use, IB notation in examinations, it is
recommended that teachers introduce students to this notation at the earliest opportunity. Students are
not allowed access to information about this notation in the examinations.
Students must always use correct mathematical notation, not calculator notation.
