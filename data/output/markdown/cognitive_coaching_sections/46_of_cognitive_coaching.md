## OF COGNITIVE COACHING

I n this introductory section, we explore the unique attributes of Cognitive Coaching. Although many models of coaching focus on the behaviors of teaching, here you will also find rationale and processes for enhancing teachers' cognitive capacities that relate directly to professional performance.

Cognitive Coaching is about producing self-directed learners and leaders with the disposition for continuous, lifelong learning, perhaps at no time more necessary than at the present in an increasingly complex and interconnected world. The model is described as a nonjudgmental, developmental, reflective model. It is informed by current work in brain research and focuses on the practitioner's cognitive development, which by association cannot ignore parallel learning in the affective and social domains.

Cognitive Coaches develop identities as mediators, committed to serving others in acquiring the dispositions and capacities of self-directed learners. The verbal and nonverbal skills sets designed to help transform and empower the cognitive functioning of others are introduced. Although these skills are presented in the context of Cognitive Coaching, they are useful in any dialogue between two human beings desiring to grow together, to plan, to reflect, to solve problems together, and to create deeper meaning and understanding. Drawing on the most recent work of Reuven Feuerstein, new information on mediation, not present in previous editions, is introduced.

The concepts in these chapters invite a shift from present paradigms. For many educators, a dominant sense of satisfaction has come from their expertise as problem solvers. The shift to a meditational identity creates a feeling of being rewarded by facilitating others to solve their own problems. The shift is from teaching others to helping others learn from situations; from holding power to empowering others; from telling to inquiring; and from finding strength in holding on to finding strength in

letting go. A mediator refrains from giving advice, believing in what

Cicero stated: 'Nobody can give you wiser advice than yourself.' Changing one's identity requires patience, stamina, and courage

For some, the behaviors described in these chapters come naturally. For others, it will take time and practice to become proficient and comfortable using these tools. We recommend that coaches isolate certain skills and consciously practice them rather than attempt to learn them all at once.
