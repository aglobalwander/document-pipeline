## Navigating within and between the Coaching Maps

The mental maps of cognitive coaching are not necessarily intended to be used separately. As the coach interacts with a colleague, the coach may detect that it is an opportunity to switch from a reflecting mode to a planning conversation. For example, in the reflecting conversation with Raul, the coach might seize the opportunity to begin planning: 'So, Raul, you'd like to implement project-based learning with your primary students. What might you do to get started?' Or, during a planning conversation, the vigilant coach might, based on the comments of the planner, find it profitable to switch to a reflecting conversation: 'What was it about some of those projects you saw that you might use in your planning for your students?'

By knowing these mental maps deeply, skillful coaches have the flexibility to maneuver within each map and to draw forth components of each of the maps as the situation demands.
