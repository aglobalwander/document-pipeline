## The Structure and Skills of Leading

If pacing is paraphrasing, then leading is questioning. When pacing is complete, questioning begins. Your partner has indicated, often through the autonomic nervous system, that the stated goal is indeed congruent with his or her desires. One cue relatively easy to detect is the slowing and deepening of breathing. Now the coach has tacit permission to inquire (Zoller 2007).

Since leading another to essential internal resources required for problem resolving is as much art as science, there can be no prescription for how a Cognitive Coach achieves this.There however, seem to be at least three stages in the conversation with touch points as follows. do,

Questions become the coach's primary language tool, supported by paraphrasing and pausing. The map for leading a colleague to internal resources is less clear and less standard than the map for pacing.

The pathway completes the pace and is an on ramp to the lead: 'So you are looking for a way to do that.' Now the coach enters more uncharted water, guided by three overarching questions and the moment-to-moment verbal and nonverbal responses of the person being coached, as shown in table 12.3. These questions are: Where do I start the lead? Where do I go from there? How do I know I am done?

Since leading another to essential internal resources required for problem resolving is as much art as science, there can be no prescription for how a Cognitive Coach achieves this. There do, however, seem to be at least three stages in the conversation, beginning with 'Where do I start?'

- Initiate a lead question intended to access and illuminate a state of mind described in chapter 7.
- Emphasize questions that liberate internal resources-feelings, values, subgoals.
- Observe major and sudden shifts in voice qualities, posture, breathing, gesture, muscular tone, and/or skin tone.
- If the first question is unproductive, explore other states of mind.
- Ask questions to create better goal specificity, if necessary.

- Detect congruence between speech content and nonverbal messages.
- Continue questioning guided by the colleague's responses.
- Use abstracting paraphrases to shift conceptual levels.
- Observe manifestation of cognitive dissonance, as in shifts from certainty to uncertainty or sudden insights.
- Maintain empathy and rapport.
- Ask questions that shift the focus from a third party to the person being coached.
