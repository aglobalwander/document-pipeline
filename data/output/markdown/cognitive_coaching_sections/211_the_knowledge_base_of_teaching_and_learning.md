## The Knowledge Base of Teaching and Learning

Teaching is one of the most complex human endeavors imaginable.

-Saphier, Haley-Spica, and Gower (2008, 1)

T he process of teaching is like the flow of busy traffic at an unmarked intersection in Istanbul: Only resident drivers know the unstated rules of the road. Similarly, only accomplished teachers know the unspoken knowledge and perceptions that guide their work in the classroom. Cognitive Coaching draws upon that knowledge and mediates it to inform teacher practice. Knowing the knowledge base of teaching is a fundamental mission of each school and is achieved through multiple approaches. Continual inquiry into the knowledge base of teaching and learning is important to persons providing support to teachers. In all forms of professional development and in performing the functions of collaborating or consulting (see chapter 5), such knowledge is essential to sound guidance. It is also important in coaching, for through these interactions teachers clarify theories of learning and integrate their knowledge of content, pedagogy, and information about students and themselves into a coherent whole. This depth of learning is available nowhere else-not in universities, in books, or from co-workers.

We are often asked if coaches need to know the subject matter that the coachee teaches-that is, for example, if the coach knows the content of physics to better coach a physics teacher. We find that it is both a help and

a hindrance. It may be helpful in that the coach and the teacher 'share a common conceptual language.' On the other hand, not knowing the content allows both the teacher and the coach to focus on the process of teaching rather than on the content. It promotes the coach as a co-learner along with the teacher in that it provides an opportunity for the coach to learn more about physics, for example. Furthermore, when the coach is very familiar with the content, there is a tendency to presume one has common understanding of discipline-related terms when that may not be the case, or to be evaluative-'That's not the way I'd teach it.'

In schools that value transdisciplinary learning, when a teacher from one department or grade level coaches another teacher from a different department or grade level, there is a great possibility that they both find a common ground beyond the content. For example, the physics teacher has a larger goal of not only teaching physics principles but also teaching students to 'think like a scientist.' The coach, a 'health and well-being' teacher from a lower grade level, finds that 'thinking like a scientist' is her main goal as well. They decide to share some resources and have the upper-grade physics students visit the lower-grade health class to explore their understanding of what it means to think like a scientist.

In the following section, we define teaching as a complex, nonlinear form of inquiry drawn upon a rich knowledge base about instruction and learning. We think of it as a form of inquiry rather than a body of knowledge. 'Inquiry' suggests a constant, dynamical process of ongoing, creative problem solving, questioning, and experimentation leading to continuous spirals of learning, whereas a 'body of knowledge' suggests fixed content that experienced educators will know and draw upon. Cognitive Coaching mediates, integrates, and extends this knowledge base by focusing on teacher decisions, knowledge, perceptions, beliefs, and values. In this chapter, we specifically consider six essential questions (figure 9.1) that provide the basis for continuous learning, research, and problem solving in education. Those domains for inquiry include:

- 1.  What's worth learning? (Content knowledge)
- 2.  What works in teaching? (Pedagogy)
- 3.  What factors influence student learning? (Knowledge of students and how they learn)
- 4.  Who am I and who am I becoming? (Self-knowledge)
- 5.  How might I stretch to higher levels of cognitive complexity? (Knowledge of cognitive processes of instruction)
- 6.  How might collegial interactions be continually strengthened and

enhanced? (Knowledge of collegial interactions)
