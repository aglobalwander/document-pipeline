## Values/Beliefs

Values are our internal guidelines for what is good or bad, worthy or unworthy. Beliefs are ideas or concepts that we hold to be true. Values are absolute or relative ethical beliefs, the assumption of which can be the basis for ethical action. Values can be defined as broad preferences concerning appropriate courses of action or outcomes. As such, values reflect an individual's sense of right and wrong or what 'ought' to be. Cognitive Coaches have faith that all human beings have the capacity to continue developing their intellect throughout their lifetimes. This and 'We are all autonomous individuals and simultaneously interdependent members of communities' are representative of values of a Cognitive Coach.

Beliefs are what an individual has emotional investment in, based on assumptions and convictions that the person holds to be true regarding people, concepts, or things. Teachers who believe that they are more effective are likely to be more effective. Mediators who believe that behaviors are motivated by positive intentions will set aside judgmental attitudes and language. Cognitive Coaches believe that the resources for self-development lie within an individual and will behave accordingly, asking instead of telling, inquiring instead of showing. The mediator possesses a belief in his/her capacity to serve as an empowering catalyst for the growth of others.
