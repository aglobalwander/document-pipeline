## RACE, ETHNICITY, NATIONALITY, AND CULTURE

The shoe that fits one person pinches another; there is no recipe for living that fits all cases.

-Carl C. Jung

The culture in which each of us is socialized influences the way we communicate. For each of us, there are human qualities that are different from our own that belong to groups to which we do not belong. It is not the purpose of this section, nor would it be possible in the space provided, nor are we knowledgeable enough, to describe how to effectively communicate with the many cultures educators are increasingly encountering. It is, however, our intention to emphasize that awareness of groups other than one's own, appreciation of differences we may not

understand, valuing human uniqueness, and learning to negotiate diversity are essential traits of a person embracing interdependence. Wherever one lives, even in a seemingly homogenous group, differences abound. Dimensions of otherness always exist and affect a sense of belonging, motivation, success, and communications, even though we may not be overtly conscious of their existence. Race, age, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and nationality are usually noticed. What may not be noticed but yet can affect comfort, connection, and understanding are the influences of heritage, mental or physical abilities, being a single parent, a newlywed, an adult whose worldview was shaped by being an orphan, a struggling teacher, a person grieving for fading parents, or those with distinctive work roles, religious convictions, or unstated sexual orientation.
