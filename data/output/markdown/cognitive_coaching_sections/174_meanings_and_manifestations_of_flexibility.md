## Meanings and Manifestations of Flexibility

Because flexible thinkers are able to see through the diverse perspectives of others, they are considered empathic. They are open and comfortable with ambiguity. They create and seek novel approaches and have a well-developed sense of humor. They envision a range of alternative consequences. They are open-minded, having the capacity to change their minds as they receive additional data. They engage in multiple and simultaneous outcomes and activities. They draw on a repertoire of problem-solving strategies.

Flexible thinkers understand causal relationships, allowing them to work within a rule-bound structure to reengineer rules to help, rather than hinder, their work. They understand not only immediate reactions but are also able to perceive the bigger purposes. Like the queen in the game of chess, the most flexible person is the one with the greatest number of choices and alternatives. Recognizing options and willingness to test them is the hallmark of flexibility.

The peak performers that Garfield (1986) studied had a quality of flexible attention, which he called 'micro/macro attention.' Microthinking involves logical, analytical computation and seeing cause and effect in methodical steps. This mode is important in the task analysis portion of planning a lesson or a curriculum. It encompasses attention to detail, precision, and orderly progression.

The macro mode is particularly useful for discerning themes and patterns from assortments of information. It is intuitive, holistic, and conceptual. Macrothinking is good for bridging gaps and enables us to perceive a pattern even when some of the pieces are missing. It is useful in searching for patterns in a lesson or in a week of lessons.

As noted in Garfield's (1986) study of peak performers, they practice style flexibility, knowing when it is appropriate to be broad and global in their thinking and when a situation requires detailed precision. Peak performers also trust their intuition, honoring the mind-body relationship. They tolerate confusion and ambiguity up to a point, and they are willing to let go of a problem, trusting that their creative unconscious will work productively (Poole and Okeafor 1989).

Flexible people can live with ambiguity and doubt because they have a great capacity to look upon life as a series of problems to be solved. They

enjoy problem solving because it's a challenge. Flexibility, like efficacy, is related to risk taking. David Perkins (1983) describes creative people as 'living on the edge.' They are not satisfied with living in the middle; they are always pushing the frontier. They generate new knowledge, experiment with new ways, and constantly stretch themselves to grow into new abilities.
