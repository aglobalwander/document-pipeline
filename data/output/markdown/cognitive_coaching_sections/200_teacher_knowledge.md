## TEACHER KNOWLEDGE

Marzano (1998) explains that knowledge is composed of information, mental processes, and psychomotor experience. A Cognitive Coach elicits a variety of information in all these areas: subject matter, pedagogy,

students, or the teacher herself. The teacher then represents the information linguistically as declarative propositional networks. These facts, time sequences, episodes, vocabulary, generalizations, principles, and concepts usually also have strong nonlinguistic representations. Rarely, however, will craft information have strong affective representations. Through mediational conversations, such information can be integrated and refined.
