## Applying: The Projective Phase

We do not learn from experience . . . we learn from reflecting on experience.

-John Dewey, 1938

At the projective stage, the teacher takes the new knowledge constructed through analysis and applies that knowledge to future instructional situations or content. Experience can bring change, but experience alone is not enough. Experience is actually constructed: compared, differentiated, categorized, and labeled. This allows the teacher to recognize and interpret classroom events, departures from routines, and novel occurrences. Thus, the teacher can predict the consequences of possible alternatives and activities. Without this conceptual system, the teacher's perception of the classroom remains chaotic.

As continuous learners, self-directed teachers consciously reflect upon,

conceptualize, and apply understandings from one classroom experience to the next. As a result of this analysis and reflection, the teachers synthesize new knowledge about teaching and learning. As experiences with teaching and learning accumulate, concepts are derived and constructed. Teachers' practice thus becomes more routinized, particularized, and refined. They are capable of predicting consequences of their decisions, and they experiment more often and take more risks. They expand their repertoire of techniques and strategies to be used in different settings with varying content and unique situations. Richard Shavelson (1976) states, 'Any teaching act is the result of a decision, whether conscious or unconscious, that the teacher makes after the complex cognitive processing of available information. This reasoning leads us to the hypothesis that the basic teaching skill is decision making .'
