## Analyzing and Evaluating: The Reflective Phase

Memories are not stored by facts but by the emotions attached to the facts. When accessing the corresponding emotion, the brain reconstructs the memory that is stored as an image from its dispositional representations. Therefore, remembering is first and foremost a matter of accessing the correct emotion.

-Ronald Kotulak (1997)

After teaching the lesson, the teacher now has two sources of information: the lesson that was envisioned during planning and the actual lesson as performed during teaching. Analyzing involves collecting and using understandings derived from the comparison between actual and intended outcomes. If the teacher finds a great similarity between the two, there is a match. A discrepancy exists when there is a mismatch between what was observed and what was planned. Teachers generate reasons to explain the discrepancy or cause-and-effect relationships between instructional situations and behavioral outcomes.

Teachers can either assume responsibility for their own actions or they

can place the blame on external forces. Teachers with an external locus of control tend to misplace responsibility or situations or persons beyond their control. For example: 'How can I teach these kids anything? Look at the home backgrounds they come from. Their parents just don't prepare them to learn.'

Efficacious teachers have an internal locus of control. They assume responsibility for their own successes or failures: 'Of course the students were confused. Did you hear my directions? They were all garbled. I've got to give more precise directions.' Seligman (1990) suggests that persons develop 'explanatory styles' with which they subconsciously form internal hypotheses or rationalizations to explain to themselves good and bad events in their environment. Hartoonian and Yarger (1981) found that some teachers might dismiss or distort information that indicates that students did not learn as a result of their teaching strategy. Less efficacious teachers may give themselves credit for student improvement but misplace blame when performance is inadequate.

Even with this analysis, the cycle of instructional decision making is not yet complete. The learnings must be constructed, synthesized, and applied or transferred to other learning contexts, content areas, or life situations. Commitments must be made to take action applying the learnings to future situations.
