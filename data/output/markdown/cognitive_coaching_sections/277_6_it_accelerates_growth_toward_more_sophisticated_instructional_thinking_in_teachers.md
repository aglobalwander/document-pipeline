## 6. It Accelerates Growth toward More Sophisticated Instructional Thinking in Teachers

Novice teachers tend to focus on the event. As teachers become more experienced, they tend to focus on goals and success indicators. (We have heard of teachers who, when being evaluated, asked their principal what indicators supported their conclusions about their performance!)

The coach also invites the teacher to describe which strategies will be used to accomplish the goals. The coach leads the teacher to anticipate what students will be doing if they are, indeed, successfully performing the goals and objectives of the lesson. The coach helps the teacher to specify what will be seen or heard within or by the end of the lesson to indicate student learning. Throughout the conversation, the coach clarifies her role in the process, the kind of data she is to collect, and the format of data collection.

We have found that in addition to the items previously listed for a planning conversation, there are two other areas of a planning conversation that are most frequently useful to a coach or a teacher: (1) information

regarding the relationship of this lesson to the broader curriculum picture for the class, and (2) information about teacher concerns. The coach may ask the teacher, 'Any concerns?' This question allows teachers to say no or to discuss anything that might be troubling them. Even though the description of the planning conversation described above appears to be focused on the lesson, the Cognitive Coach is actually focused on more long-range outcomes: developing and automating these intellectual patterns of effective instruction.

| Raul  | Well, it went pretty well. Our task was to review and adopt standards of learning tor our primary social studies curriculum. We made a lot of progress. grade                                                         |                                                                                        |

A tip: Don't ask teachers to bring a written response to planning conversation. For busy teachers, this often feels like one more burden, and it robs both of you of the spontaneity related to deepening thought as you talk.
