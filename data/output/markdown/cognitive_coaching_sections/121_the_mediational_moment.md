## The Mediational Moment

We all have many opportunities to engage others in problem solving. The challenge, however, is in deciding among these three questions:

- Can I, do I wish to, and should I provide someone with solutions?
- Can I, do I wish to, and should I collaborate and assist others with ideas or information?
- Can I, do I wish to, and should I assist others in learning how to better solve their problems themselves?

For example, it is not a mediational moment if a teacher has a problem with a leak in the classroom ceiling; the principal should arrange for the appropriate maintenance personnel to take care of the problem. If, on the other hand, the teacher's challenge has to do with implementing a new teaching strategy, determining a more effective behavior management technique, devising an innovative way to deal with student diversity, or optimizing the use of a new technological tool, mediation would be a better way to help the teacher generate ideas for planning, implementing, and resolving the challenge.

Many people are not accustomed to seeing themselves as mediators.

Because they may have been hired because of their history of problemsolving prowess, they may try to solve others' problems instead of facilitating the problem-solving process. They may give advice instead of helping others to self-prescribe. They may evaluate rather than help a person to self-evaluate.

There are advantages and disadvantages to performing as an advisor for others. Some advantages are the following:

- The problem will be solved (or appear to be solved) swiftly and efficiently.
- The solution will be congruent with your beliefs and values.
- You may feel satisfaction for having been of help.
- Others may perceive you as an effective leader.
- You will learn more about the process of problem solving.

There are also some disadvantages to acting as an advisor:

- The problem you have 'solved' may be a surface manifestation of deeper issues that have not been resolved.
- The other person may become dependent on you to solve future problems or blame you if a satisfactory resolution is not achieved.
- The other person will have learned little about problem-solving processes.
- The other person may not take (or actually undermine) your suggestions for solving the problem.
- The other person may build resentment because he views himself as inadequate and helpless.
- The other person will be robbed of the joy of experiencing the 'Aha!' moment (Treadwell 2014).
- You will miss the opportunity for developing another's capacities for self-directedness.
