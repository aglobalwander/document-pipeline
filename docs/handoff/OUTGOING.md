# Outgoing Notes from Pipeline Documents

Notes this repo is sending to other repos.

Entry format (matches the ecosystem convention used by `flow`, `knowledge-management` and
`master_data_model_drupal`):

This repo owns extraction and transformation. It does not rule editions, canonize, crosswalk, or
promote its artifacts into canon rows, and an extraction is evidence rather than a canon row.

## [FROM: pipeline-documents] [TO: knowledge-management] [DATE: 2026-09-16] [STATUS: accepted — three IB runs queued, sources not yet held]
### Type: extraction-re-run
### Priority: next-session

**Subject: We accept the three IB guide re-runs and both sweep-label corrections; we need the three source PDFs before extraction.**

Request received (their OUTGOING, 2026-09-16): economics skeleton **and** depth re-run on the
first-assessment-2024 guide, plus depth for `visual_arts` and `theory_of_knowledge`, plus correction
of two edition labels in `SWEEP_REPORT.md`. We accept all of it. Nothing is extracted yet.

**Our side's independent check of the label corrections agrees with KM's, from the documents
themselves** (this repo's converted markdown, not filenames):

- `dance` — guide `ib_guides/dance_2013.md` lines 2/9/166 read *"First examinations 2013"*; the
  briefs read *"First assessments 2014"*. KM rules 2013 from the guide. Our column currently says
  **2015**.
- `film` — guide `ib_guides/film_2023.md` lines 2/7 read *"first assessment 2023"*; the brief reads
  *"First assessments 2019"*. KM rules 2023 from the guide. Our column currently says **2019**.

So the brief and the guide disagree in both cases. We will record the marker **per source document**
and let the guide's marker govern the `edition` field, rather than collapsing the two into one value.

**A third defect KM did not raise, found while checking this:** `ib_brief_sweep.py` hard-codes a
special case for economics (~lines 252–254) and skips it, printing a row that describes the Hub
(*"PILOT (full skeleton+depth in Hub)"*) rather than our artifacts. The sweep therefore never
regenerates economics, and its report title date is hard-coded to `(2026-06-10)`. Both go away in
this work.

**Blocked on inputs.** None of the three requested guides is held in this repo's working copy:
`data/input/pdfs/ib/DP Subject Guides/` contains only `Economics (2022).pdf` and
`Visual Arts (2017).pdf`, and `data/input/**` is gitignored, so none is on the public remote either.
We need `Economics_2024_official_f527c535.pdf` (84 pp), the **Visual Arts 2027 guide** (the 2017
guide stays excluded as superseded) and `TOK (2022).pdf` / `Theory of Knowledge (2022).pdf` (58 pp),
each with its sha256 against KM's `MANIFEST.csv` so we can verify the bytes before reading them.

**On the provenance requirement:** every artifact we write — skeleton and depth — will carry the
source PDF's `pdf_sha256` and the **first-assessment marker read from the document**, plus the
markdown sha it was parsed from, with `marker_resolution_state` recording a hold when a marker is
missing or ambiguous. Field names follow our existing AP precedent (`ap_editions.json`) so the AP
and IB families stay comparable. We take the point that this matters: KM's index reports the archive
copy named `Economics (2022).pdf` as byte-identical to the copy named
`Economics_2024_official_f527c535.pdf`, which is exactly why the edition must be read from bytes and
marker text rather than a filename or a container title.

**Three questions for KM** (details in the full text): whether the 2024 Economics **briefs** are
also revised (the skeleton step needs brief inputs whose markers agree with the guide), whether KM
supplies the Visual Arts **2027 guide** as a conversion-ready PDF, and which artifact shape KM wants
for ToK (generic theme/topic/understanding depth, or a core-specific shape with knowledge questions
and no AOs).

### Action Required

- [ ] KM: place the three PDFs where this repo can read them, with sha256 from `MANIFEST.csv`.
- [ ] KM: answer the three open questions above.
- [ ] pipeline-documents: convert with the local Docling path and record PDF sha + marker per guide.
- [ ] pipeline-documents: regenerate the sweep with `dance` = 2013 and `film` = 2023, and remove the
      hard-coded economics skip.
- [ ] pipeline-documents: Economics 2024 skeleton + depth; Visual Arts and ToK depth.
- [ ] pipeline-documents: report KM's structural measurement (84→84 pp, 73/84 pages text-identical,
      27 numeric codes with none added or removed) as reproduced or not, with the code-set diff.
