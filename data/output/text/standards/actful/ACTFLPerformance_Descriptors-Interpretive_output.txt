Language
Control
Primarily relies on vocabulary to derive meaning from texts.
May derive meaning by recognizing structural patterns that have been used in familiar and some new contexts.
Sufficient control of language (vocabulary, structures, conventions of spoken and written language, etc.) to understand fully and with ease short, non-complex texts on familiar topics; limited control of language to understand some more complex texts.
May derive meaning by:
• Comparing target language structures with those of the native language • Recognizing parallels in structure between new and familiar language
Sufficient control of language (vocabulary, structures, conventions of spoken and written language, etc.) to understand fully and with ease more complex and descriptive texts with connected language and cohesive devices.
Derives meaning by:
• Understanding sequencing, time frames, and chronology • Classifying words or concepts according to word order or grammatical use
Vocabulary
Comprehends some, but not all of the time, highly predictable vocabulary, a limited number of words related to familiar topics, and formulaic expressions.
Comprehends high frequency vocabulary related to everyday topics and high frequency idiomatic expressions.
Comprehends generic and some specific vocabulary and structures, specialized and precise vocabulary on topics related to one’s experience, and an expanding number of idiomatic expressions.
Communication
Strategies
May use some or all of the following strategies to comprehend texts, able to:
• Skim and scan • Rely on visual support and background knowledge • Predict meaning based on context, prior knowledge, and/or experience
For alphabetic languages:
• Reply on recognition of cognates • May recognize word family roots, prefixes and suffixes
May use some or all of the following strategies to comprehend texts, able to:
• Skim and scan • Use visual support and background knowledge • Predict meaning based on context, prior knowledge, and/or experience • Use context clues • Recognize word family roots, prefixes and suffixes
For non-alphabetic languages:
• Recognize radicals
Comprehends fully the intent of the message adapting strategies for one’s own purposes;
uses some or all of the following strategies,
able to:
• Skim and scan • Use visual support and background knowledge • Predict meaning based on context, prior knowledge, and/or experience • Use context clues • Use linguistic knowledge • Identify the organizing principle of the text • Create inferences • Differentiate main ideas from supporting details in order to verify
Cultural
Awareness
Uses own culture to derive meaning from texts that are heard, read, or viewed.
Generally relies heavily on knowledge of own culture with increasing knowledge of the target culture(s) to interpret texts that are heard, read, or viewed.
Uses knowledge of cultural differences between own culture and target culture(s) as well as increasing knowledge of the target culture(s) to interpret texts that are heard, read, or viewed.
