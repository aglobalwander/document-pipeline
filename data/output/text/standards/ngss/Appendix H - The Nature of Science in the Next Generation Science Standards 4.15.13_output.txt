APPENDIX H – Understanding the Scientific Enterprise: The Nature of Science in the Next Generation Science Standards

Scientists and science teachers agree that science is a way of explaining the
natural world. In common parlance, science is both a set of practices and the historical
accumulation of knowledge. An essential part of science education is learning science
and engineering practices and developing knowledge of the concepts that are
foundational to science disciplines. Further, students should develop an understanding of
the enterprise of science as a whole—the wondering, investigating, questioning, data
collecting and analyzing. This final statement establishes a connection between the Next
Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and the nature of science.  Public comments on
previous drafts of the NGSS called for more explicit discussion of how students can learn about the nature of science.

This chapter presents perspectives, a rationale and research supporting an
emphasis on the nature of science in the context of the NGSS. Additionally, eight
understandings with appropriate grade-level outcomes are included as extensions of the
science and engineering practices and crosscutting concepts, not as a fourth dimension of
standards. Finally, we discuss how to emphasize the nature of science in school programs.

The Framework for K-12 Science Education

A Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and
Core Ideas (NRC, 2012) acknowledged the importance of the nature of science in the
statement “…there is a strong consensus about characteristics of the scientific enterprise
that should be understood by an educated citizen” (NRC, 2012, page 78). The Framework
reflected on the practices of science and returned to the nature of science in the following
statement: “Epistemic knowledge is knowledge of the constructs and values that are
intrinsic to science. Students need to understand what is meant, for example, by an
observation, a hypothesis, an inference, a model, a theory, or a claim and be able to
distinguish among them” (NRC, 2012, page 79). This quotation presents a series of

concepts and activities important to understanding the nature of science as a complement
to the practices imbedded in investigations, field studies, and experiments.

Nature of Science: A Perspective for the NGSS

The integration of scientific and engineering practices, disciplinary core ideas,
and crosscutting concepts sets the stage for teaching and learning about the nature of
science. This said, learning about the nature of science requires more than engaging in activities and conducting investigations.

When the three dimensions of the science standards are combined, one can ask
what is central to the intersection of the scientific and engineering practices, disciplinary
core ideas, and crosscutting concepts? Or, what is the relationship among the three basic
elements of A Framework for K-12 Science Education? Humans have a need to know and
understand the world around them. And they have the need to change their environment
using technology in order to accommodate what they understand or desire. In some cases,
the need to know originates in satisfying basic needs in the face of potential dangers.
Sometimes it is a natural curiosity and, in other cases, the promise of a better, more
comfortable life. Science is the pursuit of explanations of the natural world, and
technology and engineering are means of accommodating human needs, intellectual curiosity and aspirations.

One fundamental goal for K-12 science education is a scientifically literate person
who can understand the nature of scientific knowledge. Indeed, the only consistent
characteristic of scientific knowledge across the disciplines is that scientific knowledge
itself is open to revision in light of new evidence.

In K-12 classrooms, the issue is how to explain both the natural world and what
constitutes the formation of adequate, evidence-based scientific explanations. To be clear,
this perspective complements but is distinct from students engaging in scientific and
engineering practices in order to enhance their knowledge and understanding of the natural world.

A Rationale and Research

Addressing the need for students to understand both the concepts and practices of
science and the nature of science is not new in American education. The writings of
James B. Conant in the 1940s and 50s, for example, argue for a greater understanding of
science by citizens (Conant, 1947). In Science and Common Senses (1951), Conant
discusses the “bewilderment of laymen” when it comes to understanding what science
can and cannot accomplish, both in the detailed context of investigations and larger
perspective of understanding science. Conant says: “…The remedy does not lie in a
greater dissemination of scientific information among nonscientists. Being well informed
about science is not the same thing as understanding science, though the two propositions
are not antithetical. What is needed is methods for importing some knowledge of the
tactics and strategy of science to those who are not scientists” (Conant, 1951, page 4). In
the context of the discussion here, tactics are analogous to science and engineering
practices, as well as to the nature of scientific explanations.

The present discussion recommends the aforementioned “tactics of science and
engineering practices and crosscutting concepts” to develop students’ understanding of
the larger strategies of the scientific enterprise—the nature of scientific explanations. One
should note that Conant and colleagues went on to develop Harvard Cases in History of
Science, a historical approach to understanding science. An extension of the nature of
science as a learning goal for education soon followed the original work at Harvard. In
the late 1950s, Leo Klopfer adapted the Harvard Cases for use in high schools (Klopfer
& Cooley, 1963). Work on the nature of science has continued with lines of research by
Lederman (1992), Lederman and colleagues (Lederman et al., 2002), and Duschl (1990;
2000; 2008). One should note that one aspect of this research base addresses the teaching
of the nature of science (see, e.g., Lederman & Lederman, 2004; Flick & Lederman,
2004; Duschl, 1990; McComas, 1998; Osborne et al., 2003; Duschl & Grandy, 2008).

Further support for teaching about the nature of science can be seen in 40 years of
Position Statements from the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA). In the late
1980s, Science for All Americans (Rutherford & Ahlgren, 1989), the 1990s policy
statement Benchmarks for Science Literacy (AAAS, 1993), and National Science

Education Standards (NRC, 1996) clearly set the understanding of the nature of science as a learning outcome in science education.

Recently, discussions of A Framework for K-12 Science Education (NRC, 2012)
and implications for teaching science have provided background for instructional
strategies that connect specific practices and the nature of scientific explanations (Duschl,
2012; Krajcik & Merritt, 2012; Reiser, Berland, & Kenyon, 2012).

The Nature of Science and NGSS

The nature of science is included in the Next Generation Science Standards. Here
we present the NOS Matrix. The basic understandings about the nature of science are:
 Scientific Investigations Use a Variety of Methods
 Scientific Knowledge is Based on Empirical Evidence
 Scientific Knowledge is Open to Revision in Light of New Evidence
 Scientific Models, Laws, Mechanisms, and Theories Explain Natural Phenomena  Science is a Way of Knowing
 Scientific Knowledge Assumes an Order and Consistency in Natural Systems  Science is a Human Endeavor
 Science Addresses Questions About the Natural and Material World

The first four of these understandings are closely associated with practices and the
second four with crosscutting concepts. The NOS Matrix presents specific content for K 2, 3-5, middle school and high school. Appropriate learning outcomes for the nature of
science are expressed in the performance expectations, and presented in either the
foundations column for practices or crosscutting concepts of the DCI standard pages.

Again, one should note that the inclusion of nature of science in NGSS does not
constitute a fourth dimension of standards. Rather, the grade level representations of the
eight understandings have been incorporated in the practices and crosscutting concepts,
as seen in the performance expectations and represented in the foundation boxes.

Implementing Instruction to Facilitate Understanding of the Nature of Science

Now, the science teacher’s question: How do I put the elements of practices and
crosscutting concepts together to help students understand the nature of science? Suppose
students observe the moon’s movements in the sky, changes in seasons, phase changes in water,
or life cycles of organisms. One can have them observe patterns and propose explanations of
cause-effect. Then, the students can develop a model of the system based on their proposed
explanation. Next, they design an investigation to test the model. In designing the investigation,
they have to gather data and analyze data. Next, they construct an explanation using an evidence based argument. These experiences allow students to use their knowledge of the practices and
crosscutting concepts to understand the nature of science. This is possible when students have
instruction that emphasizes why explanations are based on evidence, that the phenomena they
observe are consistent with the way the entire universe continues to operate, and that we can use multiple ways to investigate these phenomena.
The Framework emphasizes that students must have the opportunity to stand back and
reflect on how the practices contribute to the accumulation of scientific knowledge. This means,
for example, that when students carry out an investigation, develop models, articulate questions,
or engage in arguments, they should have opportunities to think about what they have done and
why. They should be given opportunities to compare their own approaches to those of other
students or professional scientists. Through this kind of reflection they can come to understand
the importance of each practice and develop a nuanced appreciation of the nature of science.

Using examples from the history of science is another method for presenting the nature of
science. It is one thing to develop the practices and crosscutting concepts in the context of core
disciplinary ideas; it is another aim to develop an understanding of the nature of science within
those contexts. The use of case studies from the history of science provides contexts in which to
develop students’ understanding of the nature of science. In the middle and high school grades,
for example, case studies on the following topics might be used to broaden and deepen understanding about the nature of science.
 Copernican Resolution  Newtonian Mechanics  Lyell’s Study of Patterns of Rocks and Fossils
 Progression from Continental Drift to Plate Tectonics

Page 8 of 10  Lavoisier/Dalton and Atomic Structure
 Darwin Theory of Biological Evolution and the Modern Synthesis  Pasteur and the Germ Theory of Disease
 James Watson and Francis Crick and the Molecular Model of Genetics

These explanations could be supplemented with other cases from history. The point is to
provide an instructional context that bridges tactics and strategies with practices and the nature of
science, through understanding the role of systems, models, patterns, cause and effect, the
analysis and interpretations of data, the importance of evidence with scientific arguments, and
the construction of scientific explanations of the natural world. Through the use of historical and
contemporary case studies, students can understand the nature of explanations in the larger
context of scientific models, laws, mechanisms, and theories.
In designing instruction, deliberate choices will need to be made about when it is
sufficient to build students’ understanding of the scientific enterprise through reflection on their
own investigations, and when it is necessary and productive to have students analyze historical case studies.

Conclusion

This discussion addressed how to support the development of an understanding of the
nature of science in the context of the Next Generation Science Standards. The approach
centered on eight understandings for the nature of science and the intersection of those
understandings with science and engineering practices, disciplinary core ideas, and crosscutting
concepts. The nature of the scientific explanations is an idea central to standards-based science
programs. Beginning with the practices, core ideas, and crosscutting concepts, science teachers
can progress to the regularities of laws, the importance of evidence, and the formulation of
theories in science. With the addition of historical examples, the nature of scientific explanations
assumes a human face and is recognized as an ever-changing enterprise.
