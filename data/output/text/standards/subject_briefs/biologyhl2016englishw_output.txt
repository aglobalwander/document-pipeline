The IB Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous, academically challenging and
balanced programme of education designed to prepare students aged 16 to 19
for success at university and life beyond. The DP aims to encourage students to be
knowledgeable, inquiring, caring and compassionate, and to develop intercultural
understanding, open-mindedness and the attitudes necessary to respect and evalu ate a range of viewpoints. Approaches to teaching and learning (ATL) within the DP
are deliberate strategies, skills and attitudes that permeate the teaching and learning
environment. In the DP students develop skills from five ATL categories: thinking,
research, social, self-management and communication.
To ensure both breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding, students must
choose at least one subject from five groups: 1) their best language, 2) additional lan guage(s), 3) social sciences, 4) experimental sciences, and 5) mathematics. Students
may choose either an arts subject from group 6, or a second subject from groups
1 to 5. At least three and not more than four subjects are taken at higher level (240
recommended teaching hours), while the remaining are taken at standard level (150
recommended teaching hours). In addition, three core elements—the extended
essay, theory of knowledge and creativity, action, service—
are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.
These IB DP subject briefs illustrate four key course components.

I. Course description and aims
Biology is the study of life. The vast diversity of species makes biology
both an endless source of fascination and a considerable challenge.
Biologists attempt to understand the living world at all levels from the
micro to the macro using many different approaches and techniques.
Biology is still a young science and great progress is expected in the
21st century. This progress is important at a time of growing pressure on the human population and the environment.
By studying biology in the DP students should become aware of how
scientists work and communicate with each other. While the scientific
method may take on a wide variety of forms, it is the emphasis on
a practical approach through experimental work that characterizes
the sciences. Teachers provide students with opportunities to design
investigations, collect data, develop manipulative skills, analyse results,
collaborate with peers and evaluate and communicate their findings.
Through the overarching theme of the nature of science, the aims of the DP biology course are to enable students to:
1.	 appreciate scientific study and creativity within a global context through stimulating and challenging opportunities
2.	 acquire a body of knowledge, methods and techniques that char acterize science and technology
3.	 apply and use a body of knowledge, methods and techniques that characterize science and technology
4.	 develop an ability to analyse, evaluate and synthesize scientific in formation
5.	 develop a critical awareness of the need for, and the value of, effec tive collaboration and communication during scientific activities
6.	 develop experimental and investigative scientific skills including the use of current technologies
7.	 develop and apply 21st century communication skills in the study of science
8.	 become critically aware, as global citizens, of the ethical implica tions of using science and technology
9.	 develop an appreciation of the possibilities and limitations of sci ence and technology
10.	develop an understanding of the relationships between scientific
disciplines and their influence on other areas of knowledge.

The group 4 project
The group 4 project is a collaborative activity where students from dif ferent group 4 subjects, within or between schools, work together. It al lows for concepts and perceptions from across disciplines to be shared
while appreciating the environmental, social and ethical implications
of science and technology. It can be practically or theoretically based
and aims to develop an understanding of the relationships between
scientific disciplines and their influence on other areas. The emphasis is
on interdisciplinary cooperation and the scientific processes
III. Assessment model
It is the intention of this course that students are able to fulfill the follow ing assessment objectives:
1.	 Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of:
• facts, concepts, and terminology • methodologies and techniques • communicating scientific information.
2.	 Apply:
• facts, concepts, and terminology • methodologies and techniques
• methods of communicating scientific information.
3.	 Formulate, analyse and evaluate:
• hypotheses, research questions and predictions • methodologies and techniques • primary and secondary data • scientific explanations.
4.	 Demonstrate the appropriate research, experimental, and personal
skills necessary to carry out insightful and ethical investigations.
