## Appendix F The Responsibilities Dilemma of the Teacher-Facilitator Person

Teachers in school-based leadership positions whose responsibilities include facilitating school  improvement  efforts,  and  whose  roles have been determined in part by special funding  sources  or  district  policy,  often  face  the dilemma  of  having  to  sort  out  their  working relationship with the school principal or other administrators to whom they normally report.

This is complex for two reasons. First, any employee-supervisor  relationship  is  governed by  multiple  factors:  district  policy,  negotiated agreements  with  employee  organizations,  the management and leadership style of the principal, the work culture in the school, the style characteristics of the employee, and the interpersonal  relationship  of  the  principal  and  the teacher-leader.

Because informal personalized factors have a greater influence on working procedures than do the hypothetical relationships described in program descriptions, the actual relationship is negotiated between the two people.

However, becoming clear about the working relationship is further complicated, because knowing who is to be served in a support role is complex for even the most practiced consultant or facilitator.

Because one cannot serve two masters, an early  task  for  a  consultant  or  facilitator  is  to learn who the primary and ultimate clients are. It is these parties whom the resource person is committed to serve. Thus, besides the question of  the  teacher-principal  working  relationship, there are several other questions that the teacher-leader and the principal must address:

- 1. Because of the potential for having role requirements given to the teacher-leader from sources  beyond  the  principal,  who  exactly is the teacher-leader's primary and ultimate
- client,  and  what  are  the  teacher-leader's responsibilities to those clients?
- 2. Under what conditions can the principal be a primary client?
- 3. Under  what  conditions  can  a  working committee  of  the  entire  faculty  be  a  primary client?
- 4. What  are  the  core  values  that  will  guide this work?
- 5. Who is the client?

A contact client is a person who makes the initial contact with the teacher-leader. This establishes an expectation for serving a principal or a school according to the goals and descriptions  of  the  funding  program.  Sometimes  the contact comes from the following:

- · A personnel office;
- · A staff development office;
- · An administrator in charge of special programs.

An  intermediate  client  is  involved  in  the early  contracting  arrangements  between  the teacher-leader  and  the  school.  This  person is often  responsible  for  administrating  the districtwide program under which each teacher-leader  has  been  assigned.  The  intermediate  client  will  communicate  program  goals, procedures to follow, and job descriptions for the  teacher-leader.  These  guidelines  set  the parameters  within  which  the  principal  and teacher-leader are to work.

The  primary  client  is  the  group  with which the facilitator will work. Because specific  goals  and  working  procedures  can  be developed  only  with  the  primary  client,  the teacher-leader must be clear about who this is.

Three prerequisites for being successful as a primary client are as follows:

- · The  primary  client  has  made  a  free  and informed  choice  to  ask  the  facilitator  for services.
- · The  primary  client  has  accepted  responsibility for the problem being worked on.
- · The primary client has or can access the information necessary to develop solutions.

The ultimate  clients  are  the  stakeholders, whose  interests  should  be  protected  even  if they are not in direct contact with the meeting processes.  These  would  include  the  organization as a whole, students, parents, and community members.

The larger  the  school  system,  the  greater the  chance  that  communications  between  the support-role  person  and  the  contact,  intermediate,  and  primary  clients  will  be  incomplete, contradictory, or confusing. Large school systems,  even  with  the  best  of  intentions,  have communication  problems.  This  is  a  systems problem, not a people problem. The most effective level for aligning incongruent understandings  about  role  and  function  is  with  the  two people closest to the action, the teacher-leader and the principal. If necessary, the district resource teacher or the administrator who leads the program can help.

In some  situations,  the  primary  client might  also  be  the  contact  and  intermediate client. For example, a department chairperson asks  you  to  facilitate  a  meeting  to  develop faculty consensus on a set of educational values.  The  chairperson  then  works  with  you  to develop agreements on mutual responsibilities as well as the goals and agenda for this meeting. During the meeting that you facilitate, the chairperson is also a member of the group that is receiving your services.

A principal can be the primary client when he or she will receive, or be a member of the group  that  receives,  direct  services  from  the facilitator.  The  principal  will  be  an  effective primary client when he or she has met the three prerequisites listed above for being successful as a primary client.

A working committee of the entire faculty can be the primary client when it represents the full range of opinions of the faculty and when the same three conditions for success as a primary client have been met.

The ideas below are recommended as generic core values to guide all facilitation work.

What are the presenting problem, diagnosis, and plan? Facilitators should not assume that the client has accurately or inaccurately defined and diagnosed the problem. The confident client has already  defined  the  problem,  its  causes,  and  a method for solving it, and asks, 'Can you help me accomplish this?' The searching client has identified  the  problem  but  is  not  clear  about its  causes  or  the  methods to solve it, and asks, 'How can you help us with this problem?' The puzzled client has not yet identified the problem, and asks, 'Can you help us to figure out what is going on and what to do about it?' The reluctant client talks with a facilitator because job expectations require it; this person asks, 'What does the project want you to do?'

What  are  the  resources  and  motivation for  change?  Two  often  overlooked  resources for  change  are  the  group's  strengths  and  the critical voices of selected group members. Just because a group seeks help does not mean that it is interested in changing its behavior. Groups require  resources  to  change.  These  include time, information, skills, knowledge, and motivation. Motivation to change can result from the following forms of discomfort:

- · An internal dissatisfaction with the status quo;
- · Organizational pressure to improve;
- · An unachieved vision;
- · A drive toward craftsmanship and continual improvement.

What type of facilitation services are being requested? In basic facilitation, the group seeks  only  to  solve  a  substantive  problem. The group engages a facilitator to temporarily

improve  its  processes  in  order  to  work  on the  problem.  When  the  problem  is  resolved, the group's process knowledge and skills are relatively  unchanged. The  basic  facilitator  is like a mechanic who fixes the group's car well enough to get it to a destination. Facilitation and agenda development tend to be done by one or two individuals, and the group expects the facilitator to use whatever processes he or she considers effective.

In  developmental  facilitation,  the  group seeks  to  permanently  improve  its  processes while  solving  a  substantive  problem.  When the  problem  is  resolved,  the  group  will  also be more knowledgeable and skilled at solving future problems. The developmental facilitator is like a staff developer who leads the group in learning  how  to  monitor,  repair,  and  redesign its own car so it can use the vehicle to reach any destination  it  seeks.  Facilitation  and  agenda development are shared, and the group periodically reflects to learn from its experience.
