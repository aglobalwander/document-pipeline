AP Equity and Access Policy
College Board strongly encourages educators to make equitable access a guiding
principle for their AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared
students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination
of barriers that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and
socioeconomic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented. Schools
should make every effort to ensure their AP classes reflect the diversity of their
student population. College Board also believes that all students should have
access to academically challenging course work before they enroll in AP classes,
which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to
equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.

About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills
that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking AP
courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and AP
Exams are developed and scored by college faculty and
experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges and
universities in the United States grant credit, advanced
placement, or both on the basis of successful AP Exam
scores; more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the content
and skills that are the focus of the corresponding
college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also
organizes the content and skills into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many AP teachers have
told us they follow in order to focus their instruction.
The intention of this publication is to respect teachers’
time and expertise by providing a roadmap that they
can modify and adapt to their local priorities and
preferences. Moreover, by organizing the AP course
content and skills into units, the AP Program is able
to provide teachers and students with free formative assessments—Personal Progress Checks—that
teachers can assign throughout the year to measure
student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students: Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically challenging coursework before they enroll in AP
classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is
only through a commitment to equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
V.1
Offering AP Courses: The AP
Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP
courses must participate in the AP Course Audit, a
process through which AP teachers’ course materials
are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.

=== Page 9 ===
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the AP teacher and the school principal (or designated
administrator) to confirm awareness and understanding
of the curricular and resource requirements. A syllabus
or course outline, detailing how course requirements
are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The AP
Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor; all
AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision, piloting,
and analysis to ensure that questions are accurate, fair,
and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development, College
Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher education
institutions. This feedback is carefully considered to
ensure that AP courses and exams are able to provide
students with a college-level learning experience and
the opportunity to demonstrate their qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam development process, relies on the expertise of
both AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple choice questions are scored by machine, the free response questions and through-course performance
assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands
of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are
scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion
is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained,
and their work is monitored throughout the Reading
for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief
Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers
in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of
the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a curve.
Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which means that
every student who meets the criteria for an AP score of
2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no matter how many
students that is. The criteria for the number of points
students must earn on the AP Exam to receive scores
of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently
validates for credit and placement purposes—include:
Bullet The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
Bullet The number of points researchers have found to be predictive that an AP student will succeed when placed into a subsequent, higher-level college course.
Bullet Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP
scores as follows:

AP Score

College Grade
Equivalent 5
Extremely well qualified
A 4

While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for
scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and universities.
To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/placement
policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.org/ creditpolicies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for
seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score
the free-response sections of the AP Exams. Ninety eight percent of surveyed educators who took part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an AP
Reader, including opportunities to:
Bullet Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
§Bullet Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP
scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure to the quality and depth of the responses from the
entire pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
Bullet Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
Bullet Score from home: AP Readers have online distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects. Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
§Bullet Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs): AP
Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide suggests a
sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds skill instruction across units, organizes content
into topics, and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress
throughout the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with
content and skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress
over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course topics and skills, create
customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
Bullet Teachers and students sign in to or create their College Board accounts.
Bullet Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
Bullet Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
Bullet Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP Coordinator.
Bullet Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and AP
coordinators to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following
additional benefits:
Bullet Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.

Bullet
Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student
pack. The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

About the AP
Environmental
Science Course
The AP Environmental Science course is designed to engage students with the scientific
principles, concepts, and methodologies required to understand the interrelationships
within the natural world. The course requires that students identify and analyze natural and
human-made environmental problems, evaluate the relative risks associated with these
problems, and examine alternative solutions for resolving or preventing them. Environmental
science is interdisciplinary, embracing topics from geology, biology, environmental studies, environmental science, chemistry, and geography.
College Course Equivalent
The AP Environmental Science course is designed to be the equivalent of a one-semester,
introductory college course in environmental science.
Prerequisites
Students should have completed two years of high school laboratory science—one year of
life science and one year of physical science (e.g., a year of biology and a year of chemistry).
Due to the quantitative analysis required in the course, students should also have taken at
least one year of algebra. Also desirable (but not necessary) is a course in earth science.
V

.1  |
Lab Requirement
Although there are no specific AP Environmental Science labs or field investigations
required for the course, it is required that students have the opportunity to spend a
minimum of 25% of instructional time engaged in hands-on, inquiry-based laboratory and/or fieldwork investigations.

Introduction
The AP Environmental Science course outlined in this framework reflects
learning that analyzes environmental concepts and processes to achieve
understanding in order to propose and justify solutions to environmental
problems. The course teaches students how to apply science to the
solutions of important social problems. It also provides opportunities to
practice applying scientific methods to practical, real-life problems.
The AP Environmental Science course provides
students with the scientific principles, concepts, and methodologies required to understand the
interrelationships of the natural world. The course helps students identify and analyze natural and human-induced environmental problems. It enables
them to learn how to assess the risks associated with these problems and evaluate alternative solutions for resolving and preventing them. To accomplish this goal, the AP Environmental Science Course
and Exam Description defines concepts, skills, and
understandings required by representative colleges and
universities for granting college credit and placement.

Course Framework
Components
Overview
This course framework provides a clear and detailed description of the course requirements necessary for student success.
The course framework includes two essential components:
1
SCIENCE PRACTICES
The science practices are central to the study and practice of
environmental science. Students should develop and apply the
described practices on a regular basis over the span of the course.
2
COURSE CONTENT
The course content is organized into commonly taught units of
study that provide a suggested sequence for the course. These units
comprise the content and conceptual understandings that colleges and
universities typically expect students to master to qualify for college
credit and/or placement. This content is grounded in big ideas, which are
cross-cutting concepts that build conceptual understanding and spiral throughout the course.

Practices
The AP Environmental Science practices describe what a student should be able
to do while exploring course concepts. The table that follows presents these
practices, which students should develop during the AP Environmental Science
course. These practices are categorized into skills, which form the basis of the tasks on the AP Exam.
The unit guides later in this publication embed and spiral these skills throughout
the course, providing teachers with one way to integrate the skills in the course
content with sufficient repetition to prepare students to transfer those skills
when taking the AP Exam. Course content may be paired with a variety of skills on the AP Exam.

AP ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
Course
Content
Based on the Understanding by Design® (Wiggins and McTighe) model, this course
framework provides a clear and detailed description of the course requirements
necessary for student success. The framework specifies what students must know,
be able to do, and understand, with a focus on big ideas that encompass core
principles and theories of the discipline. The framework also encourages instruction
that prepares students for advanced environmental science coursework.
Big Ideas
The big ideas serve as the foundation of the course and allow students to create
meaningful connections among concepts. They are often overarching concepts
or themes that become threads that run throughout the course. Revisiting the
big ideas and applying them in a variety of contexts allows students to develop
deeper conceptual understanding. Below are the big ideas of the course and a brief description of each.
2
BIG IDEA 1: ENERGY TRANSFER (ENG)
Energy conversions underlie all ecological processes. Energy cannot be
created; it must come from somewhere. As energy flows through systems, at each step, more of it becomes unusable.
BIG IDEA 2: INTERACTIONS BETWEEN EARTH SYSTEMS (ERT)
The Earth is one interconnected system. Natural systems change over time and
space. Biogeochemical systems vary in ability to recover from disturbances.
BIG IDEA 3: INTERACTIONS BETWEEN DIFFERENT SPECIES
AND THE ENVIRONMENT (EIN)
Humans alter natural systems and have had an impact on the environment for
millions of years. Technology and population growth have enabled humans to
increase both the rate and scale of their impact on the environment.
BIG IDEA 4: SUSTAINABILITY (STB)
Human survival depends on developing practices that will achieve
sustainable systems. A suitable combination of conservation and
development is required. The management of resources is essential.
Understanding the role of cultural, social, and economic factors is vital to the development of solutions.

UNITS
The course content is organized into commonly
taught units. The units have been arranged in a logical sequence frequently found in many college courses and textbooks.
The nine units in AP Environmental Science, and their weighting on the multiple-choice section of the
AP Exam, are listed below.
Pacing recommendations at the unit level and on the
Course at a Glance provide suggestions for how to teach the required course content and administer the Personal Progress Checks. The suggested class
periods are based on a schedule in which the class meets five days a week for 45 minutes each day.
While these recommendations have been made to
aid planning, teachers should of course adjust the
pacing based on the needs of their students, alternate
schedules (e.g., block scheduling), or their school’s academic calendar.
TOPICS
Each unit is broken down into teachable segments
called topics. The topic pages (starting on page 36) contain the required content for each topic.

AP ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
Unit
Guides
Introduction
Designed with extensive input from the community of AP Environmental
Science educators, the unit guides offer teachers helpful guidance in
building students’ skills and knowledge. The suggested sequence was
identified through a thorough analysis of the syllabi of highly effective AP
teachers and the organization of typical college textbooks.
This unit structure respects new AP teachers’ time by providing one
possible sequence they can adopt or modify rather than having to build
from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units enable the AP
Program to provide interested teachers with formative assessments—the
Personal Progress Checks—that they can assign their students at the end
of each unit to gauge progress toward success on the AP Exam. However,
experienced AP teachers who are satisfied with their current course
organization and exam results should feel no pressure to adopt these
units, which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

The ability to describe environmental processes and relationships within an environment is central to this unit.
Students can practice this skill with visual representations and models, particularly those of biogeochemical cycles, food chains, food webs, and trophic diagrams. By the end of this unit, students should be able to use visual representations to describe the individual steps of the hydrologic, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles and then explain how each chemical is either stored or transferred throughout its cycle. Students should also be able to predict the effects of a change in one or more parts of a given cycle, including impacts to humans and the ecosystem at large.
In this unit, students should also develop a foundational understanding of biomes and describe how relationships between organisms are affected by environmental conditions.
They should develop the quantitative skills to calculate the decrease of energy as it passes through ecosystems and then explain the transfer of energy through ecosystems.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Exam, students must be able to apply environmental concepts and processes in real-world situations. This starts with the ability to identify and describe the biogeochemical cycles and then predict the effects of a change within a cycle. For example, while students can identify the biogeochemical cycle, they often struggle to describe each of the steps. Students also struggle to identify the reservoir portion of the cycle, which is the step that takes the longest to complete. To combat these challenges, providing visual representations of biogeochemical cycles can help students organize information. Students can also write step-by-step descriptions of the cycles, including characteristics and attributes.
Developing Understanding
The first unit sets the foundation for the course by examining the Earth as a system with
interdependent components, processes, and relationships. Students will examine the
distribution of resources in ecosystems and its influences on species interactions. There is a
global distribution of terrestrial and aquatic biomes—regional ecosystems—that each have
specific environmental features based on their shared climate. This distribution is dynamic,
and it has changed due to global climate change. Each ecosystem relies on biogeochemical
cycles for survival. These cycles facilitate the acquisition and transfer of energy into usable
forms, and they can be altered by human activities. In subsequent units, students will apply their
understanding of ecosystems to the living world and examine the importance of biodiversity.

Primary
Productivity
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
ENG-1.A
Explain how solar energy is acquired and transferred by living organisms.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
ENG-1.A.1
Primary productivity is the rate at which solar energy (sunlight) is converted into organic compounds via photosynthesis over a unit of time.
ENG-1.A.2
Gross primary productivity is the total rate of photosynthesis in a given area.
ENG-1.A.3
Net primary productivity is the rate of energy storage by photosynthesizers in a given area, after subtracting the energy lost to respiration.
ENG-1.A.4
Productivity is measured in units of energy per unit area per unit time (e.g., kcal/m2/yr).
ENG-1.A.5
Most red light is absorbed in the upper 1m of water, and blue light only penetrates deeper than 100m in the clearest water. This affects photosynthesis in aquatic ecosystems, whose photosynthesizers have adapted mechanisms to address the lack of visible light.

Data analysis is an important skill to begin developing at this point in the course.
Quantitative information about changes in populations or the environment due to human activities is often represented in tables and graphs. Students should understand that tables and graphs are important tools of communication used to identify patterns and trends that indicate environmental problems. Students will then learn to describe the characteristics of data in tables or graphs and identify patterns or trends.
In this unit, students should also be able to describe and explain the environmental concepts and processes of biodiversity.
It is important that they understand the differences between similar concepts and clearly articulate those differences in their written and verbal explanations. For example, they should be able to articulate the differences among species, genetic, and habitat diversity; between keystone and indicator species; and between ecosystem services and ecological services.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Exam, students must be able to explain environmental science concepts that are represented using tables, charts, and graphs. They must also be able to explain patterns and trends related to data. Additionally, they must be able to give several examples of ecosystems and ecological services. Students often confuse environmental science terminology, like ecological service and ecological function of an ecosystem, and biodiversity and genetic diversity. To combat this, students can explain environmental concepts in context, rather than memorizing textbook definitions without a full understanding of the context.
Students can benefit from practice providing ecological services for different ecosystems.
They should be able to indicate the direction of change to a species as a result of disruptions to the ecosystem based on data.
Students should also be able to describe whether or not a species can adapt to an environmental change.
Developing Understanding
Biodiversity, which includes genetic, species, and habitat diversity, is critically important to
ecosystems. Biodiversity in ecosystems is a key component to sustaining life within the living
world. Natural and human disruptions have short- and long-term impacts on ecosystems.
Ecological succession can occur in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in both developed
and developing areas. Organisms within ecosystems must adapt to the changes created by
these disruptions. In subsequent units, students will examine in greater detail how populations change over time.

ERT-2.I.1
There are two main types of ecological succession: primary and secondary succession.
ERT-2.I.2
A keystone species in an ecosystem is a species whose activities have a particularly significant role in determining community structure.
ERT-2.I.3
An indicator species is a plant or animal that, by its presence, abundance, scarcity, or chemical composition, demonstrates that some distinctive aspect of the character or quality of an ecosystem is present.
ERT-2.J.1
Pioneer members of an early successional species commonly move into unoccupied habitat and over time adapt to its particular conditions, which may result in the origin of new species.
ERT-2.J.2
Succession in a disturbed ecosystem will affect the total biomass, species richness, and net productivity over time.

Comparing trends and patterns in data helps students interpret experimental data in order to explain environmental changes that occur over time. These skills can help predict short and long-term changes in an environment.
As students build their skills in data analysis, they will learn how the data illustrate environmental concepts. It is also important that they learn to predict patterns and trends based on information provided in graphs and tables. Analyzing population growth, age structure diagrams, and survivorship curves can help students develop these skills.
While calculator use is permitted on the
AP Exam, students still have to show their work, including the numbered steps they used to obtain an answer, with appropriate units. Without the appropriate units, a calculation is meaningless, even with correct computation. In this unit, students may benefit from having multiple opportunities to practice calculations such as population growth and the application of the rule of 70.
Students can also practice selecting the appropriate calculation that is required in the analysis of a data set.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Exam, students must be able to explain trends in population data for organisms. To practice this, students can look at a variety of human population graphs from various countries and then explain the trends in the data to draw conclusions about changes in the populations. This is also an opportunity for students to explain population density and population growth.
Students can also practice interpreting population growth curves for other species.
When explaining the survival of a species, students should consider population size and emphasize problems associated with reduced genetic diversity. It is helpful for students to connect data represented by tables, charts, and graphs to real-life examples of population changes.
Developing Understanding
Populations within ecosystems change over time in response to a variety of factors. This unit
examines the relationship between the type of species and the changes in a habitat over time.
Specialist species are advantaged by habitats that remain constant, while generalist species
tend to be advantaged by habitats that are changing. Different reproductive patterns, including
those exhibited by K- and r-selected species, also impact changes to population. Population
growth is limited by environmental factors, especially by the availability of resources and space.
In subsequent units, students will explore how increases in populations affect earth systems
and resources, land and water use, and energy resources.

2.A
2.B
In this unit, students can practice analyzing and interpreting qualitative models and representations of environmental issues.
The ability to describe global maps and maps of plate boundaries is key to explaining the global changes that occur at plate boundaries. Climatograms may also be introduced in this unit. To develop an understanding of the relationship between the geography of the earth and climate, students may benefit from describing the impact of El Niño on marine food chains, and other specific examples.
Students should be able to identify and describe environmental processes displayed visually. They can also practice explaining the meaning of a diagram or infographic, ultimately building to the ability to explain the consequences of a change in an environmental process (i.e., “What would happen if …”) in later units. To help students build understanding in this area, it may be useful for them to perform a soil/water capacity lab.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Exam, students must be able to explain representations of convergent, divergent, and transform boundaries present on a global map. To practice this, students can examine global maps to identify the distribution of global plate boundaries. Students should also practice analyzing characteristics of soil. They can perform guided inquiry labs related to soil analysis and formation. Data show a strong correlation between the strength of students’ conceptual understanding and their experience performing hands-on labs.
Students can also practice identifying how climate factors influence the rate of soil formation. They should indicate if that factor speeds up or slows down the rate of formation. Students may benefit from connecting visual representations with explanations of the Earth’s atmosphere/ geography, climate, global wind patterns, solar radiation, and the Earth’s seasons.
Developing Understanding
This unit explores earth systems and its resources that support life. Geological changes that
occur to earth systems at convergent and divergent boundaries can result in the creation of
mountains, island arcs, earthquakes, volcanoes, and seafloor spreading. Soils are a resource,
formed when parent material is weathered, transported, and deposited. The atmosphere is
another resource, composed of certain percentages of major gases. Climate is influenced by
the sun’s energy, Earth’s geography, and the movement of air and water. In subsequent units,
students will examine how humans use natural resources and the impact on the environment.

In this unit, students can practice identifying environmental problems (e.g., pollution, depletion of the ozone layer, global climate change). They can also practice thinking critically about the problem, and when evaluating a given solution, articulating its benefits and drawbacks. The ability to describe and propose viable solutions for environmental problems is critical for this unit.
Students will benefit from opportunities to practice describing the development process for legislation enacted to mitigate environmental problems and the effects of the legislation on the various stakeholders.
Most importantly, students should have many opportunities to evaluate a proposed solution to an environmental problem and/ or the legislation that addresses it and then describe benefits and drawbacks to the solution.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Exam, students must be able to describe and explain concepts related to the tragedy of the commons, clearcutting, agricultural practices, and mining. To practice this, case studies that represent real-world examples of human activities can be helpful, focusing on understanding concepts within applied contexts. Case studies can also be used to help students practice proposing solutions to environmental problems and describing the benefits or disadvantages of those solutions.
Students may benefit from opportunities to analyze text-based resources about environmental issues and the impact of human activities on the environment.
Teachers can guide students in identifying the author’s claim, perspective, and/or assumptions. It may be especially helpful to utilize sources of information that have quantitative data so that students can provide explanations that both describe the data and connect the data to an environmental issue.
Developing Understanding
This unit explores human activities that disrupt ecosystems both positively and negatively
and the methods employed to reduce impact. It examines human use of natural resources
through many means, including mining and clearcutting, and the impacts on the environment.
Agricultural practices in particular can cause environmental disruption. For example, one
of the largest uses of freshwater is for irrigation. Every irrigation method employed for
agriculture has its own benefits and drawbacks. In subsequent units, students will examine
different types of energy resources, the consumption of these resources, and the impact on the environment.

EIN-2.F.1
Waterlogging occurs when too much water
is left to sit in the soil, which raises the water table of groundwater and inhibits plants’ ability to absorb oxygen through their roots.
EIN-2.F.2
Furrow irrigation involves cutting furrows between crop rows and filling them with water.
This system is inexpensive, but about 1/3 of the water is lost to evaporation and runoff.
EIN-2.F.3
Flood irrigation involves flooding an agricultural field with water. This system sees about 20% of the water lost to evaporation and runoff. This can also lead to waterlogging of the soil.

EIN-2.F.4
Spray irrigation involves pumping ground water into spray nozzles across an agricultural field.
This system is more efficient than flood and
furrow irrigation, with only 1/4 or less of the water lost to evaporation or runoff. However, spray systems are more expensive than flood and
furrow irrigation, and also requires energy to run.
EIN-2.F.5
Drip irrigation uses perforated hoses to release small amounts of water to plant roots. This system is the most efficient, with only about 5% of water lost to evaporation and runoff.
However, this system is expensive and so is not often used.
EIN-2.F.6
Salinization occurs when the salts in groundwater remain in the soil after the water evaporates. Over time, salinization can make soil toxic to plants.

EIN-2.I.1
Meat production is less efficient than agriculture; it takes approximately 20 times more land to produce the same amount of calories from meat as from plants.
EIN-2.1.2
Concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFOs) are used as a way to quickly get livestock ready for slaughter. They tend to be crowded, and animals are fed grains or feed that are not as suitable as grass. Additionally, feedlots generate a large amount of organic waste, which can contaminate ground and surface water. The use of feedlots are less expensive than other methods, which can keep costs to consumers down.

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
EIN-2.1.3
Free range grazing allows animals to graze on grass during their entire lifecycle. Meat from free range animals tends to be free from antibiotics and other chemicals used in feedlots. Organic waste from these animals acts as fertilizer. Free range grazing requires large areas of land and the meat produced is more expensive for consumers.
EIN-2.I.4
Overgrazing occurs when too many animals feed on a particular area of land. Overgrazing causes loss of vegetation, which leads to soil erosion.
EIN-2.I.5
Overgrazing can cause desertification.
Desertification is the degradation of low precipitation regions toward being increasingly arid until they become deserts.
EIN-2.I.6
Less consumption of meat could reduce CO2, methane, and N2O emissions; conserve water;
reduce the use of antibiotics and growth hormones; and improve topsoil.

Impacts of Mining

ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
EIN-2.K.1
As the more accessible ores are mined to depletion, mining operations are forced to access lower grade ores. Accessing these ores requires increased use of resources that can cause increased waste and pollution.
EIN-2.K.2
Surface mining is the removal of large portions of soil and rock, called overburden, in order to access the ore underneath. An example is strip mining, which removes the vegetation from an area, making the area more susceptible to erosion.
EIN-2.L
Describe ecological and economic impacts of natural resource extraction through mining.
EIN-2.L.1
Mining wastes include the soil and rocks that are moved to gain access to the ore and the waste, called slag and tailings that remain when the minerals have been removed from the ore. Mining helps to provide low cost energy and material necessary to make products. The mining of coal can destroy habitats, contaminate ground water, and release dust particles and methane.

UNIT 6
Building the Science
Practices
1.A
1.B
1.C
In this unit, students can practice identifying where natural energy resources occur (e.g., coal, crude oil, ores) on a global map. They can also practice describing other forms of energy and differentiating between nonrenewable and renewable forms of energy. Students may struggle with vocabulary related to this subject matter. Students also tend to misunderstand radioactivity and think that all radiation is bad.
Text analysis is also an important skill for students to build upon in this unit. When reading texts about topics in this unit, students can practice identifying the claims as well as describing the perspectives and assumptions of the author.

Preparing for the AP Exam

On the AP Exam, students must be able to explain concepts related to renewable and nonrenewable energy sources. They may benefit from in-class opportunities to practice comparing and contrasting different sources of fuel and how they are used, with an emphasis on the impacts of usage on the environment. Students often struggle with applying appropriate mathematical relationships to determine the amount of energy produced or used based on the given information. To combat this, teachers can provide multiple opportunities for students to manipulate formulae and use the data provided to solve a problem, especially problems that use dimensional analysis and multiple steps. They should provide a numerical answer and unit, if required.
Students will also need to explain environmental problems related to the use of different energy resources and propose solutions. To that end, students may benefit from multiple opportunities to propose realistic solutions to environmental problems related to the use of different energy sources.
Developing Understanding
This unit examines human use of renewable and nonrenewable sources of energy and its impact
on the environment. Energy consumption differs throughout the world and the availability
of natural energy resources depends on the region’s geologic history. Subsequent units will
examine the impact of human activity on the atmosphere, land, and water.

In this unit, students can practice comparing and predicting patterns and/or trends in a graph or table to explain how the data or representation illustrates environmental concepts. They can also practice drawing conclusions about an environmental concept based on a comparison of the patterns and trends in a graph or table.
Students can also practice proposing solutions to combat the effects of air pollution on human health and, most importantly, using data or evidence to support their solutions. In order to understand the implications of environmental legislation, it is important to know how environmental policies are applied and what the outcomes are in a variety of contexts.
With that knowledge, students can then explain why those outcomes occurred and how the policy affected the outcomes.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Exam, students must be able to describe or identify a research method used to understand air pollution. They will also have to explain the patterns and trends in data related to air pollution and describe the relationship among variables of data represented graphically. Students may benefit from time in class devoted to hands-on laboratory activities related to air pollution. Teachers can also provide students practice in identifying information from graphs, diagrams, or infographics related to air pollution. Students often struggle to identify specific air pollutants and related illnesses. To combat this, teacher can provide opportunities for students to identify air pollutants and their impacts on human health.
Building Understanding
Air pollution has many sources and effects, both indoors and outdoors. Air is a natural
resource that covers the Earth and crosses many system boundaries. Human activities
affect the quality of the air both indoors and outdoors. Through legislation, the Clean Air Act
regulates the emission of air pollutants that affect human health. The gases and particulates
in the atmosphere come from both natural and human sources; once air pollution sources
are identified, methods can be used to reduce it. Subsequent units will focus on pollution’s impacts to land and water.

Students should be able to think critically about an environmental problem and evaluate a given solution, articulating the benefits and drawbacks. Students should also be able to propose their own solutions to environmental problems. In order to understand the implications of environmental legislation, students need to see how policies are applied in different contexts. They also need to see the outcomes of those policies in context to fully address an environmental problem. Students should then be able to explain why those outcomes occurred and how the policy affected the outcomes.
Quantitative skills are also important in this unit and can be addressed by having students perform water quality or dissolved oxygen labs. This will give them the opportunity to perform calculations with their data. These lab experiences will also provide students contexts to evaluate environmental problems.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Exam, students must be able to explain concepts related to the different types of pollution that impact land and water.
Students often struggle with evaluating data related to pollution. To combat this, teachers can practice through hands-on laboratory activities related to pollution. Students can then discuss their observations and data. They may also benefit from multiple opportunities to analyze data by describing the relationships among the variables. They can explain the meaning of the data and the implications the data illustrate about pollution.
Students often struggle if problems on the
AP Exam require multiple steps to obtain an answer. Teachers can provide students with practice solving problems related to pollution using appropriate methods to calculate numerical answers, with appropriate units.
As students practice calculations, it is often helpful to emphasize a logical step-by-step method that shows how their problem solving ends with a numerical answer and appropriate units.
Developing Understanding
Pollution created by human activities directly impacts ecosystems in the air, on land, and in
water. The source of pollution can sometimes be easy to identify, but other times the source is
diffused. There are many human health issues that can be linked to pollution. Legislation has
been created to reduce discharges of pollution in water and regulate drinking water. Increases
in waste cause global concerns for organisms that live on land and in water. In the final unit,
students will explore how local and regional human activities can have a global impact.

ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
STB-3
Human activities, including the use of resources, have physical, chemical, and biological consequences for ecosystems.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
STB-3.F
Explain the environmental effects of excessive use of fertilizers and detergents on aquatic ecosystems.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
STB-3.F.1
Eutrophication occurs when a body of water is enriched in nutrients.
STB-3.F.2
The increase in nutrients in eutrophic aquatic environments causes an algal bloom. When the
algal bloom dies, microbes digest the algae, along
with the oxygen in the water, leading to a decrease in the dissolved oxygen levels in the water. The lack of dissolved oxygen can result in large die-offs of fish and other aquatic organisms.
STB-3.F.3
Hypoxic waterways are those bodies of water that are low in dissolved oxygen.
STB-3.F.4
Compared to eutrophic waterways, oligotrophic waterways have very low amounts of nutrients, stable algae populations, and high dissolved oxygen.
STB-3.F.5
Anthropogenic causes of eutrophication are agricultural runoff and wastewater release.

In this final unit, the goal is for students to describe and explain global changes in the environment, the causes of these changes, and their consequences. Students can build on their skills from previous units, where they described and evaluated solutions, to propose their own solutions as they learn about problems caused by global changes in the environment. They can practice using data as evidence to support their proposed solution or legislation. Students can also explain how the solution or legislation solves the problem in question.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Exam, students often struggle with discussing strategies that would prevent extinction. Students are able to identify a strategy, but they are not able to explain how the strategy could be implemented to prevent extinction. Students incorrectly imply that small populations are threatened populations.
To combat this, teachers can provide opportunities for students to read multiple sources that allow them to propose realistic solutions that would prevent the extinction of certain species. Students may benefit from opportunities to explain the advantages, disadvantages, or unintended consequences of efforts to prevent extinction.
Students also confuse the terms global climate change and ozone depletion.
Teachers can provide multiple opportunities to practice using scientific vocabulary in the proper context in verbal and written explanations of environmental concepts.
Diagrams and models that illustrate global climate change can also be helpful. Emphasis can be placed on the effects of global climate change with visual representations of changes over time. Students can then explain how the visual representation illustrates an environmental science concept or process.
Building Understanding
A central aspect of environmental science is to understand the global impact of local and
regional human activities. Humans can mitigate their impact through sustainable use of
resources. Human activities can cause ozone depletion in the stratosphere and increases in the
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Increases in greenhouse gases can cause human health
and environmental problems. These environmental problems include global climate change,
ocean warming, and endangered species. Overall, this course provides an opportunity to
examine the interrelationships among the natural world and challenges students to evaluate and
propose solutions to a variety of environmental problems.

UNIT 9
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
STB-4.F.5
Oceanic currents, or the ocean conveyor belt, carry heat throughout the world. When these currents change, it can have a big impact on global climate, especially in coastal regions.
STB-4.F.6
Climate change can affect soil through changes in temperature and rainfall, which can impact soil’s viability and potentially increase erosion.
STB-4.F.7
Earth’s polar regions are showing faster response times to global climate change because ice and snow in these regions reflect the most energy back out to space, leading to a positive feedback loop.
STB-4.F.8
As the Earth warms, this ice and snow melts, meaning less solar energy is radiated back into space and instead is absorbed by the Earth’s surface. This in turn causes more warming of the polar regions.
STB-4.F.9
Global climate change response time in the
Arctic is due to positive feedback loops involving melting sea ice and thawing tundra, and the subsequent release of greenhouse gases like methane.
STB-4.F.10
One consequence of the loss of ice and snow in polar regions is the effect on species that depend on the ice for habitat and food.

ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
STB-4
Local and regional human activities can have impacts at the global level.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
STB-4.H.1
Ocean acidification is the decrease in pH of
the oceans, primarily due to increasedcarbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, and can be expressed as chemical equations.
STB-4.H.2
As more carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, the oceans, which absorb a large part of that carbon dioxide, become more acidic.
STB-4.H.3
Anthropogenic activities that contribute to ocean acidification are those that lead to increasedcarbon dioxideconcentrations in the
atmosphere: burning of fossil fuels, vehicle emissions, and deforestation.
STB-4.H.4
Ocean acidification damages coral because acidification makes it difficult for them to form shells, due to the loss of calcium carbonate.

Lab Experience
The laboratory experience, when used effectively, should augment students’ understanding of content
and build skills in the science practices. Teachers
are expected to devote 25% of instructional time to
lab investigations. Student-directed, inquiry-based lab experiences support the AP Environmental
Science course and the AP Course Audit curricular requirements. These experiences also provide opportunities for students to design experiments,
collect data, apply mathematical routines and methods,
and refine testable explanations and predictions. An inquiry-based approach allows students to develop
and use investigations they design based on their own
experiences. In conducting lab investigations, students should be encouraged to:
Bullet Generate questions for investigation
Bullet Choose which variables to investigate
Bullet Design and conduct experiments
Bullet Design their own experimental procedures
Bullet Collect, analyze, interpret, and display data
Bullet Determine how to present their conclusions
Lab Manuals
While there is no formal lab manual for the course, many teachers use Environmental Science Lab and
Field Activities by the Environmental Science Literacy
Council as a guide for providing their students practical experiences.
Some textbook publishers may provide a lab manual that is ancillary to the textbook. Most science classroom supply companies also offer lab manuals. Teachers should consider the course
audit requirements, student needs, and cost before
purchasing or requiring students to purchase a lab manual.
Lab Notebooks and Student
Workbooks
Many publishers and science classroom material
distributors offer affordable lab notebooks and student workbooks with associated practice problems and
solutions. Students can use any type of notebook to
fulfill the lab notebook requirement, even an online
document. Teachers should consider their own needs
and those of their students when deciding what type of lab notebook to use.
Lab Materials
AP Environmental Science is a college-level course,
but the equipment and materials needed for the labs
are comparable to those required for a high-school level environmental science course. Most lab manuals
provide a list of materials and equipment needed for
each laboratory investigation. Teachers should consult
their lab manual and calculate how much of a particular
substance or material may be needed for the number of students they have before purchasing.
Students will need access to basic lab equipment
and glassware (e.g., beakers, petri dishes, rulers, and thermometers). Access to some specialized
equipment, such as pH meters, water and soil testing equipment, and aquariums, may be needed to
complete some investigations for this course. The use
of probes or computer sensors for data collection,
which are more expensive tools, is not required, though
they can be used if available. It is recommended that teachers have a computer and projector to show
computer-based animations and simulations for pre lab activities. However, a paper-based alternative can
easily be provided if the equipment is unavailable.
Students may use computers or graphing calculators
to analyze data and present their findings, but they do not need to do so.
There are avenues that teachers can explore as a means of obtaining access to more expensive equipment,
such as microscopes, test kits, and probes. Chemical
companies often have equipment that can be borrowed;
company representatives should have this information.
Alternatively, local colleges or universities may allow
high school students to complete a lab as a field trip on
their campus, or they may allow teachers to borrow their
equipment. They may even donate their old equipment.
Some schools have partnerships with local businesses
that can help with lab equipment and materials. There
are many grant programs that teachers can apply to for
funds to purchase equipment and supplies. Teachers
can also utilize online donation sites such as Donors
Choose and Adopt-A-Classroom.

Lab Time
It is critical that lab work is an important part of an AP Environmental Science course so that the course is comparable to a college-level course for Environmental Science majors. Data show that
increased lab time is correlated with higher AP scores.
Flexible or modular scheduling may be implemented in
order to meet the time requirements for lab and field
experiences. At a minimum, one double period a week
may be needed to allow adequate time for authentic lab experiences.
Recommended Experiments
student success. Selecting experiments that provide
students with the broadest lab experience possible is important when designing the course.
The AP Environmental Science Exam directly assesses the learning objectives of the course framework,
which means the inclusion of appropriate experiments
aligned with those learning objectives is important for Upon completion of the environmental science lab program, students should be able to describe how
to collect data, use data to form conclusions, and apply their conclusions to larger environmental
concepts. Students should report recorded data and quantitative conclusions drawn from the data with
appropriate precision. Students should also develop
an understanding of how changes in the design of the
experiments would impact the validity and accuracy
of their results. Many questions on the AP Exam are
written in an experimental context, so these skills will
prove invaluable for both concept comprehension and exam performance.

How to Set Up a Lab Program
Getting Students Started
There are no prescriptive “steps” to the iterative process of inquiry-based investigations. However,
there are some common characteristics of inquiry that
will support students in designing their investigations.
Often, this simply begins with using the learning objectives to craft a question for students to investigate. Teachers may choose to give students
a list of materials they are allowed to use in their
experimental design or require that students request
the equipment they feel they need to investigate the
question. Working with learning objectives to craft questions may include the following:
Bullet Selecting learning objectives from the course
framework that relate to the subject currently under
study, and which may set forth specific tasks, in the form of “Design an experiment to ”
Bullet Rephrasing or refining the learning objectives that
align to the unit of study to create an inquiry-based investigation for students
Students should be given latitude to make design modifications or ask for additional equipment
appropriate for their design. It is also helpful for
individual groups to share with the class their basic
design to elicit feedback on feasibility. During labs, students are encouraged to proceed independently, receiving only minor guidance from the teacher by the end of the course. Students should have many opportunities for post-lab reporting to share the
successes and challenges of individual lab designs.
Students need instruction and multiple opportunities
for practice with laboratory tools and techniques so
that they can become more proficient investigators.
Teachers can ensure that students understand how to
choose an instrument that will help them gather the observations or measurements required to answer a question. They can also ensure that students know
how to properly record, organize, display, and interpret
the measurements made via the chosen instrument in
order to support a conclusion or claim pertaining to a
particular question. If access to instrumentation is a
challenge, online and local university resources may be available.
the opportunity to practice lab skills and scientific
thinking. Pre-lab work that is acknowledged/checked
can help determine what gaps students may have prior
to engagement with the lab. Modeling lab skills and procedures is sometimes necessary for students to have a successful lab experience.
Prior to performing lab experiments and field experiences, teachers can provide meaning and purpose for these activities by giving students
At the conclusion of each experiment, students should
compose a lab report for which they receive feedback.
It is important to identify and address gaps in skills
or lab procedures. Conducting post-lab discussions
is an excellent strategy to ensure that students are
mastering laboratory and inquiry techniques and skills.
These discussions also help students connect the lab investigation to the big ideas.
The lab, as well as pre- and post-lab work, should be
extensions of student learning in the classroom rather
than discrete activities. Teachers can design pre-lab exercises and discussions that prepare students for each laboratory experience and then follow up each investigation with a post-lab discussion to
debrief procedures, errors, conclusions, and so forth.
Teachers can also test students’ understanding of
environmental science concepts by asking them “what if” questions, like, “Predict what will happen if ”, or “What should the next experiment be if ”
Observations and Data
Manipulation
Students should practice making careful observations and accurately recording what they observe. Too
frequently students confuse what they see with what they think they are supposed to see. They should be encouraged to be accurate reporters, even when
their findings seem to conflict with what they are led
to expect by the textbook or lab procedure. Proper interpretation of observations is also important.
Students should be able to find evidence of change (growth, color change, temperature change, gas
evolution, etc.) and its absence. Students should know
how to make and interpret quantitative measurements correctly. This includes knowing the appropriate instrument for making the measurement.
Teachers should emphasize analysis and interpretation
of quantitative data represented, for example, line and
bar graphs and dose response curves that will allow students to make connections between the raw data

Laboratory Investigations V.1 | 199

=== Page 207 ===
they obtain from their investigations and the ways they
communicate their results. Students should be able to
evaluate whether the data are graphed correctly and
appropriately for the investigation that was conducted.
It is important to consistently assess students’
understanding and skill with all aspects of creating a graph including correct scaling and units.
Communication and Group
Collaboration
Lab work is an excellent means through which students can develop and practice communication
skills. Success in subsequent work in the field of environmental science depends heavily on an ability to communicate about observations, ideas, and conclusions. Working in a truly collaborative manner to plan and execute experiments will help
students learn oral communication skills and practice teamwork. Students should be encouraged to take
individual responsibility for the success or failure of the collaboration.
After students are given a question for investigation,
they may report their findings to their teacher and/ or their peers for feedback. Students should be
encouraged to critique and challenge one another’s claims based on the evidence collected during the investigation.
Lab Safety
certain concerns regarding lab safety be addressed
in every environmental science course, including the
following:
A successful AP Environmental Science lab program
will instill in each student a lifelong “safety sense” that will ensure their safe transition into more
advanced work in college or university labs or into the
industrial workplace environment. It is important that
Bullet All facilities should conform to federal, state, and
local laws and guidelines pertaining to the safety of students and instructors.
Bullet Teachers with a limited background in environmental science should receive additional safety training specific to environmental science labs before teaching AP Environmental Science.
Bullet Lab experiments and demonstrations should not be carried out if they could expose students to unnecessary risks or hazards.
Bullet Students should be fully informed of potential lab
hazards relating to chemicals and equipment before performing specific experiments.
Bullet Storage and disposal of hazardous chemicals must be done in accordance with local regulations and policies. Teachers and students should know what these regulations are.
Basic laboratory safety instruction should be an
integral part of each lab experience. Topics that should be covered include the following:
Bullet Simple first aid for cuts and thermal and chemical burns
Bullet Use of safety goggles, eye washes, body showers, fire blankets, and fire extinguishers
Bullet Safe handling of glassware, hot plates, burners and other heating devices, and electrical equipment
Bullet Proper interpretation of material safety data sheets (MSDS) and hazard warning labels
Bullet Proper use and reuse practices (including proper
labeling of interim containers) for reagent bottles

Selecting and Using Course Materials
Textbooks
The AP Environmental Science course requires
the use of a college-level textbook. It is important
to select a textbook that covers the content in the
course framework. Regardless of the textbook chosen, teachers can supplement it with other primary and
secondary sources. Additionally, the textbook should
provide multiple opportunities for student practice
with data analysis in varying contexts. Ideally, the
textbook will use sufficient examples and approaches that enable students to make connections across
different domains within environmental science and
between environmental science and other social and natural sciences.
College Board provides a list of sample textbooks
that teachers may consult to help determine whether a text is considered acceptable in meeting the AP
Environmental Science Course Audit curricular
requirements. Lab materials are also essential for AP
Environmental Science and are detailed starting on page 197.
Primary Sources
source material, it is important to introduce students
to a wide variety of materials in order to provide
opportunities to analyze data from diverse sources.
These sources should include data tables, charts,
graphs, and diagrams. Teachers may also use ancillary materials and online resources that accompany
recently published textbooks to find quality materials to supplement classroom instruction.
Many teachers augment their courses with journal
articles and/or abstracts from scientific literature. While an increasing number of textbooks include primary

ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION
The AP Environmental Science course requires that students have an understanding of 10 pieces
of legislation and environmental policies. There are many environmental policies and legislation that
are important to the field of environmental science, including those that protect animals and regulate
clean water, clean air, and food sources. It is critical for
students to understand the impact of these policies and
legislation and why they are necessary. Understanding
of legislation and policies should focus on how they
were created as solutions to environmental problems.
The 10 required pieces of legislation and policy for AP
Environmental Science are listed on page 26.

Guided Inquiry in AP Environmental Science
The process of following an experimental procedure to confirm a known outcome can build basic
laboratory skills; however, authentic inquiry allows
students opportunities to develop and refine higher order scientific thinking skills. Inquiry skills are built through gradual release in lessons (scaffolding levels). Creating opportunities for open-ended
(inquiry-based) laboratory exercises allows students
to formulate questions, troubleshoot problems, and
make appropriate adjustments. The National Research
Council (2000) advises that students are engaged in
inquiry when they:
Bullet Are engaged with scientifically oriented questions.
Bullet Give priority to evidence.
Bullet Formulate evidence-based explanations.
Bullet Compare and evaluate the merit of explanations.
Bullet Communicate and justify explanations.

Students are assigned as “experts” on problems they have mastered; groups rotate through the expert stations to learn about problems they have not yet mastered.
Provides opportunities for students to share their knowledge and learn from one another.
Assign students as “experts” on environmental legislation.
Have students rotate through stations in groups, working with the station expert to complete a series of questions on the topic.
Construct an
Argument
Students use scientific reasoning to present assumptions about biological situations, support conjectures with

scientifically relevant and accurate data, and provide a logical progression of ideas leading to a conclusion that makes sense.
Helps develop the process of evaluating scientific information, developing reasoning skills, and enhancing communication skills in supporting conjectures and conclusions.
Present students with a written or visual scenario of the results of a laboratory investigation and then have them work together to draw conclusions about scientific investigations.
They can support their conclusions with data by having each student or group of students add a sentence to the conclusion. Once the conclusion is complete, read it (or show it on a screen) and then facilitate a class discussion.
Debate
Engaging in an informal or formal argumentation of an issue.
Provides an opportunity for students to collect and orally present evidence supporting the affirmative and negative arguments of a proposition or issue.
Have students debate realistic solutions to environmental problems. This can be more meaningful for students if the problem selected is specific to the school and students have the opportunity to present their solutions to school administrators.

Purpose
Example
Error Analysis
Students analyze an existing solution to determine whether (or where) errors have occurred.
Allows students to troubleshoot errors and focus on solutions that may arise when they do the same procedures themselves.
Have students analyze their work to determine whether their answer is realistic. For example, if they are working on an energy calculation, they can’t end up with more energy than they started with.
Fishbowl
Some students form an inner circle and model appropriate discussion techniques, while an outer circle of students listens, responds, and evaluates.
Provides students with an opportunity to engage in a formal discussion and to experience the roles of both participant and active listener; students also have the responsibility of supporting their opinions and responses using specific evidence.
Divide students into two groups and ask them to form two concentric circles. The inner circle can explain ecosystem services to the students in the outer circle, and the outer circle can explain ecological services to students in the inner circle. The circles rotate to enable students to share their knowledge and learn to communicate with their peers.
Graph and Switch
Generating a graph to represent data and then switch papers to review each other’s representations.
Allows students to practice creating different representations of data and both give and receive feedback on each other’s work.
Give students a data table and ask them to graph the data.
Then have them switch papers and offer one another feedback on whether they graphed the data appropriately. This can be scaffolded by distributing multiple data tables that require different types of graphs.
Idea Spinner
The teacher creates a spinner marked into four quadrants and labeled “Predict,” “Explain,” “Summarize,” and “Evaluate.” After new material is presented, the teacher spins the spinner and asks students to answer a question based on the location of the spinner.
For example, if the spinner lands in the “Summarize” quadrant, the teacher might say, “List the key concepts just presented.”
Functions as a formative assessment technique.
Present students with a written or visual scenario of the results of a laboratory investigation.
Using the spinner, ask students to predict what would happen if one of the experimental conditions changed, explain the results, summarize the results, and evaluate the methods used.

The misconception check can also be presented in the form of a multiple-choice or true or false quiz.
Functions as a formative assessment technique.
Provide students with a statement on the board, or on paper, such as, “Climate change and ozone depletion are the same.” Ask them whether the statement is true or false and then ask them to explain their reasoning. Address any misconceptions according to the answers they give.
One-Minute
Essay
A one-minute essay question (or a one-minute question) is a focused question with a specific goal that can, in fact, be answered within a minute or two.
Functions as a formative assessment technique.
Give students one minute to respond to a prompt, such as, “Explain the relationship between photosynthesis at the cellular level and environmental carbon cycling.”
Quickwrite
Writing for a short, specific amount of time about a designated topic related to a text.
Helps students generate multiple ideas in a quick fashion that could be turned into longer pieces of writing at a later time (may be considered as part of the drafting process).
Prior to teaching about endangered species, ask students to take a few minutes to explain whether the
Endangered Species Act is necessary. At the conclusion of the lesson, students can revisit their answer and revise it to reflect what they learned.

Developing the
Science Practices
Throughout the course, students will develop science practices that are fundamental to the discipline of environmental science.
The tables that follow provide sample activities and instructional strategies for incorporating the individual skills into the course.
Science Practice 1: Explain environmental concepts, processes, and models presented in written format
The ability to use verbal and/or written explanations that describe environmental processes is an important
learning outcome of the AP Environmental Science course. It is important to make clear the distinction between
memorizing details and demonstrating an integrated understanding of how a concept or process connects to the
overall function of the environment. Students should have a deep enough understanding of the overall processes to
predict the effect of environmental changes on those processes and justify their prediction.

iodine-131 and cesium-137, which has been connected to a variety of environmental problems in the 30 years following the disaster.
11.	 A meltdown in which of the following structures at a nuclear power plant, such
as Chernobyl, would most likely lead to the accidental release of radiation?
(A)	Cooling tower (B)	 Turbine (C)	 Generator (D)	Reactor core
12.	 Which of the following best describes the process of electricity generation at a nuclear power plant?
(A)	Nuclear power is generated through fission, which releases a large amount
of heat. The heat is used to generate steam, which turns a turbine that powers a generator.
(B)	 Nuclear power is generated when photons are converted to a direct current
using a semiconducting material such as silicon. An inverter is used to
convert the direct-current electricity into an alternating current.
(C)	 Nuclear power is generated from the thermal energy of Earth, which is a
result of radioactive decay. The water underground is turned to steam, which turns a turbine to produce electricity.
(D)	Nuclear power is generated from the combustion of mined uranium, which
provides enough heat to power a generator. The generator turns a turbine to create electricity.

Original Island
Group
Mainland
New Additional
Island

Based on the theory of island biogeography, which of the following best explains
how the scientists’ calculation of average number of species would change with the inclusion of this new island in their study?
(A)	The average would increase because more species would have migrated directly to the farther island.
(B)	 The average would decrease because fewer species would have migrated directly to the farther island.
(C)	 The average would not change because it is likely that the additional island
has about the same number of species that migrated as the original island group.
(D)	The average would not change because the island is approximately the same
size as those in the original group and therefore just as likely to recruit species from the mainland.

Accept any of the following justifications.
1 point
7.F
STB-4.H
Solution proposed in (d)(i)
Justification of how solutions will reduce greenhouse gas emissions
Use more energy efficient vehicles/decrease driving distances.
• Using more energy efficient vehicles or decreasing driving distances
will decrease the amount of fossil fuels burned, which will decrease the
amount of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, released into the atmosphere
Use less heat/less air conditioning to reduce amount of energy to heat/ cool home.
• Decreasing the use of electric heat/air conditioning will decrease the
amount of fossil fuels burned for electricity generation, which will
decrease the amount of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, released into the atmosphere
Decrease electricity use to decrease reliance on fossil fuels.
• Decreasing the use of electricity used will decrease the amount of
fossil fuels burned for electricity generation, which will decrease the
amount of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, released into the atmosphere
Switch from fossil fuel generated electricity to electricity generated from renewable sources
• Renewable sources, such as solar or wind power, do not release
greenhouse gases. Switching energy source will decrease the amount
of fossil fuels burned, which will decrease the amount of greenhouse
gases, such as carbon dioxide, released into the atmosphere
Harvest methane from landfills for energy generation
• The methane gas released from landfills can be collected and used for
energy generation, which reduces the amount of methane released to the atmosphere
Sequester carbon through planting vegetation/ reinjection
•  Trees and other plans absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis
which will decrease the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
•  Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, can
be captured and injected into geothermal reservoirs, reducing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
Decrease use of plastics/ fertilizers/products that require fossil fuels for production
•  Products such as plastics and fertilizers are made using fossil fuels so
reducing in purchasing these products will decrease the demand for
fossil fuels in production, which decreases the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere.
•  Plastics releases several greenhouse gases as they degrade.
Purchasing fewer plastics will decrease the amount of plastics in
landfills and decrease the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere during degradation.
Decrease purchasing of products with plastic packaging
• Plastics releases several greenhouse gases as they degrade.
Purchasing fewer plastics will decrease the amount of plastics in
landfills and decrease the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere during degradation.
Reduce meat consumption/ switch to a vegetarian or vegan diet
•  Raising livestock produce large amounts of greenhouse gas
emissions, specifically methane (from gut fermentation).
Decomposition of manure from these operations also releases large
amounts of CO2 and/or methane so a reduction in meat consumption
or switching to a vegetarian or vegan diet could significantly reduce
the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted into the atmosphere.
