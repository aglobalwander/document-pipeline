APPENDIX C – College and Career Readiness

Postsecondary education is now seen as critical to ensure the nation’s long-term economic
security, to respond to the transformation in both the nature and number of current and projected
jobs, and to enable social mobility. Yet, alarmingly, the United States has fallen from ranking 1st
among industrialized nations in both high school completion rates and the percentage of adults
with a 2- or 4-year degree, to 22nd in high school graduation and 14th in the percentage of 25- to
34-year-olds with a 2- or 4-year degree (OECD, 2012a, p. 26). On the 30th anniversary of the
Nation at Risk report, key indicators point to our nation being more at risk than ever (Kirwan,
2013):
 Sixty percent of U.S. jobs are predicted to require some form of postsecondary education
by the end of the decade (Georgetown University Center on Education and the
Workforce, 2013).
 The U.S. Department of Labor notes that companies have reported more than three
million job openings every month since February 2011 because of an absence of
applicants with the skills to fill these positions (Woellert, 2012). The National Science
Foundation also reports that there are currently between two and three million unfilled
positions in the STEM areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
 The shortfall in STEM employees is likely to increase. The Department of Commerce
shows that in the past 10 years, STEM jobs grew at three times the rate of non-STEM
jobs, a trend likely to continue and accelerate (Langdon et al., 2011).

Postsecondary education also increases an individual student’s chances for a decent, well-paying
job. The unemployment rate for recent high school graduates without a college degree was more
than 30 percent, while for recent college graduates, it was under 6 percent (Shierholtz et al.,
2012). And in terms of earnings, a holder of a bachelor’s degree is likely to realize a million
dollars more over a lifetime than an individual with only a high school diploma. More troubling
is a grim reality underlying these statistics: a child born into a family in the lowest quartile of
income has a less than 8 percent chance of earning a postsecondary degree. The Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) observes that children of less-educated
parents in the United States have a tougher time climbing the educational ladder than in almost
any other developed country (OECD, 2012a, p. 102). The American dream that one’s birth
circumstances do not control one’s destiny is fast slipping away.

The last decade has seen an emerging consensus that effective preparation for student success in
postsecondary education and careers includes a strong background in science. In particular, the
best science education seems to be one based on integrating rigorous content with the practices
that scientists and engineers routinely use in their work—including application of mathematics.
The larger context, and perhaps the primary impetus for this consensus, is the paradigm shift in
our worldview of educational priorities, a direct result of the advent of the information age and
global economy. To remain economically competitive, countries are pressed to substantially
increase the number of students who can put knowledge to use in the service of new frontiers—
discovering new knowledge, solving challenging problems, and generating innovations (NSF,
2012). Beyond the needs of the economy, an education grounded in acquiring and applying

knowledge positions students to improve their options in a rapidly changing menu of jobs, where
few students will stay in the same job throughout their working lives. In sum, today’s new reality
demands that science and engineering become accessible to the many, not the few. And because
the needed proficiencies are acquired over time, students must experience how science and
engineering are conducted in the workplace throughout their K–12 schooling (NRC, 2007).

Scientists and engineers have always integrated content and practices in their work, but that has
not been the case with science instruction. As former president of the National Academy of
Sciences, Bruce Alberts, stated, “rather than learning how to think scientifically, students are
generally being told about science and asked to remember facts” (Alberts, 2009). Traditional
instruction has emphasized lectures, note-taking, reading, and assessment that tested recall,
offering little opportunity for in-depth study or research (NRC, 2007). Laboratory activities,
when offered, generally consisted of cookbook or confirmatory experiences. Research indicates
that most lab experiences do not integrate well with other classroom instruction and infrequently
include teacher and student analysis and discussion, thereby making it difficult for students to
connect learning about science content with learning the processes of science (NRC, 2005). This
situation stands in stark contrast to the real work of science and engineering, where new
knowledge and innovation are prized. The shift in what the world needs and values requires that
K–12 science education undergo a huge transition, from a focus on knowledge itself to a focus
on putting that knowledge to use—a transition that in and of itself necessitates a corresponding
leap in rigor. Meeting this challenge head-on, the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)
constructed each performance expectation by linking concepts and practices that build coherently
over time throughout K–12, thereby helping to ensure that students who meet the NGSS will be
prepared to succeed in science courses in both 2- and 4-year institutions.

The first step in developing the NGSS was the development of A Framework for K–12 Science
Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas (Framework). The National
Research Council (NRC) led the undertaking in partnership with the American Association for
the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA), and
Achieve, Inc. The intent of the Framework was to describe a coherent vision of science
education by (1) viewing learning as a developmental progression; (2) focusing on a limited
number of core ideas to allow for in-depth learning (both cross-disciplinary concepts with
applicability across science and engineering and concepts central to each of the disciplines); and
(3) emphasizing that learning about science and engineering involves integration of content
knowledge and the practices needed to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering design
(NRC, 2012a, pp. 10–11). The NGSS kept the vision of the Framework intact by focusing on a
rigorous set of core concepts that are articulated for each grade band (K–2, 3–5, 6–8, 9–12) and
anchored to real-world science and engineering practices. This appendix reviews the evidence
for basing K–12 standards on rigorous content, science and engineering practices, mathematics,
and the benefits of integrating content with practices.

IMPORTANCE OF RIGOROUS CONTENT FOR COLLEGE AND CAREER
READINESS IN SCIENCE

The first challenge facing the developers of the Framework was to identify the core conceptual
knowledge that all students need to know and that also provides a foundation for those who will
become the scientists, engineers, technologists, and technicians of the future (NRC, 2012a). Not
all content is equally worth learning. Some science concepts deserve the lion’s share of
instruction because they have explanatory or predictive power or provide a framework that
facilitates learning and applying new knowledge. To that end, the NRC convened members of
the scientific community and engaged them in a rigorous, 2-year iterative process of formulating
and refining the document based on multiple, critical reviews involving key organizations,
distinguished scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and science educators, as well as the public.
The resulting Framework sets forth not only the core ideas in the major science disciplines (life,
physical, and earth and space sciences), but also the crosscutting concepts that have applicability
to most fields in science and engineering. In keeping with the idea that learning is a
developmental progression, the natural and cognitive scientists who developed the Framework
further articulated what students should know by the end of each grade band. Significantly, the
Framework also embraces the core concepts and essential practices of engineering, and in doing
so, opens a window of interest and career opportunities not previously available to most K–12 students.

Once the Framework was completed, the NGSS writing team used the content to construct the
NGSS performance expectations. Throughout the 2-year development process, the disciplinary
core ideas (DCIs), and the related learning progressions from the Framework, along with their
incorporation into the student performance expectations, were reviewed multiple times by a large
group of expert reviewers (including major science, engineering, and mathematics associations),
by the state teams in each of the 26 lead states as well as some additional states, and by the
general public. In addition, Achieve convened postsecondary faculty and business
representatives on two separate occasions to evaluate the content of the standards as being both
necessary and sufficient for college and career readiness for all students. The comprehensive
nature and thoroughness of the review process should ensure that the NGSS express the content
expectations that will allow all students to be successful in advanced science courses and postsecondary careers.

Both the Framework and the NGSS reflect current thinking about the need for greater depth and
rigor in K–12 science schooling. College Board, for example, has had a rich history in defining
college and career readiness. “In order for a student to be college-ready in science, he or she
must… have knowledge of the overarching ideas in the science disciplines (i.e., earth and space
science, life science, physical science, and engineering) and how the practices of science are
situated within this content…” (College Board, 2010, p. 3). The content represented in the
Framework is also in line with the content identified in the College Board Standards for College
Success (2009), which defines the rigorous knowledge and skills students need to develop and
master in order to be ready for college and 21st-century careers. These were developed to …
help students successfully transition into Advanced Placement (AP) and college-level courses.
College Board standards, like the Framework, are based on (1) overarching unifying concepts

=== Page 4 ===

Page 4 of 19
that are important across the science disciplines but also often apply to other fields such as
mathematics and technology, and (2) like the Framework, are based on the core ideas of each
science discipline (College Board, 2009). For students pursuing postsecondary coursework in
science, core content clearly plays a key role. By virtue of being based on the content from the
Framework, the NGSS provide a strong foundation for students to be successful in advanced science coursework.

ACT takes a similar, though not identical, stance as College Board with respect to core content.
The ACT assessment assumes “that students are in the process of taking the core science course
of study (three years or more of science in high school) that will prepare them for college-level
work, and have completed a course in Biology and a course in Physical Science and/or Earth
Science by the time they take the ACT” (ACT, 2011, p. 20). Based on their available data, ACT
builds the case that students are better prepared for postsecondary work when the practices are
used over 3 years of science in high school. ACT concludes: “Postsecondary expectations clearly
state the process and inquiry skill in science are critical as well as rigorous understanding of
fundamental (not advanced) science topics” (ACT, 2011, p. 9). However, while both ACT and
College Board argue for winnowing content, ACT goes further, making the case that studying
advanced content is not a quality predictor of postsecondary success. ACT goes on to state,
“Therefore, for example, including a great deal of advanced science topics among the Next
Generation standards would conflict with available empirical evidence” (ACT, 2011, p. 9).
Postsecondary faculty report that a firm grasp of core concepts is more important than a weak
grasp of advanced topics. Thus, a few components originally included in the Framework and
early drafts of the NGSS were eliminated over time, based on the reviews of faculty in 2- and 4 year institutions in NGSS lead states, as well as on the ACT research.

ACT is not alone in arguing for a more limited coverage of content. Recent research examining
the relationship between the performance of college students in introductory science courses and
the amount of content covered in their high school courses concluded that “students who
reported covering at least one major topic in depth, for a month or longer, in high school were
found to earn higher grades in college science than did students who reported no coverage in
depth. Students reporting breadth in their high school course, covering all major topics, did not
appear to have any advantage in Chemistry or Physics and a significant disadvantage in Biology”
(Schwartz et al., 2009, p. 1). Additional research supports limiting coverage, but offers little in
the way of advising standards or policy developers what content should be eliminated. In fact,
little empirical evidence exists on the content alignment between high school science and
postsecondary expectations beyond ACT’s data. Given the lack of empirical evidence in the
field, the most fruitful path to support college and career readiness in science is to involve
postsecondary faculty working with high school faculty to align content expectations.

From an international perspective, science content plays a prominent role in preparing K–12
students. In its international science benchmarking study of 10 countries (Canada [Ontario],
Chinese Taipei, England, Finland, Hong Kong, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, Singapore, and South
Korea) Achieve found evidence of strong science content, including far more attention to
physical science concepts in primary and lower secondary grades than is typical of most states in
the United States (Achieve, 2010, p. 59). However, the presentation of content is different than in
the United States. Standards in 7 of the 10 countries present integrated science content (content

drawn from the major disciplines) each year from primary through grade 10, allowing students to
specialize later in high school (Achieve, 2010, p. 42). These countries clearly see that a
minimum amount of science knowledge is necessary for all students to become scientifically
literate. Requiring that all students study integrated science content through grade 10 before
enrolling in discipline-specific courses is a significant departure from the current structures in
most U.S. states. Importantly, an integrated program through grade 10 also speaks to the
possibility of capitalizing on student interest. Students could choose to pursue a course of study
later in high school that fully prepares them for postsecondary careers, such as entry-level
positions in health-related fields. Singapore has pursued this approach to great advantage. In
making recommendations to the Carnegie’s Commission on Mathematics and Science
Education, mathematics expert Phillip Daro observed that Singapore’s educational system
“illustrates how it is possible to design multiple pathways to college entrance while still serving
more specialized interests in the student population” (Carnegie Corporation of New York, 2009, p. 25).

Students need to be able to make sense of the world and approach problems not previously
encountered—new situations, new phenomena, and new information. To achieve this level of
proficiency students need a solid grasp of key science concepts and the ability to relate that
knowledge across disciplines. Finally, as seen in the next section, students will need to be able to
apply and communicate that knowledge flexibly across various disciplines, proficiencies they
can acquire through the continual exploration of DCIs, science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts.

IMPORTANCE OF SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING PRACTICES IN COLLEGE AND
CAREER READINESS IN SCIENCE

Empirical data and related research show direct support for students engaging in, and being held
accountable for, proficiency in the science and engineering practices. The NRC has published a
great deal of research in the recent past that supports the need for students to engage in science
and engineering practices as they learn content. While no one document prior to the Framework
includes all eight of the science and engineering practices described in the Framework, they are
clear in the literature as a whole. Documents supporting the practices in the Framework include
Taking Science to School; Ready, Set, SCIENCE!; and America’s Lab Report. Findings from
Taking Science to School (NRC, 2007, p. 342) show that students learn science more effectively
when they actively engage in the practices of science. Linn and Hsi (2000) (as cited in the NRC’s
America’s Lab Report [2005]) found that a quality integrated experience with practice and
content led not only to greater mastery, but importantly, also more interest in science.

Streamlining the overwhelming amount of science content to target essential key ideas was the
first but not the only challenge in building the Framework. In identifying and characterizing
science and engineering practices, developers had to confront common classroom instructional
practices where students are told that there is “a scientific method,” typically presented as a fixed
linear sequence of steps that students apply in a superficial or scripted way.

This approach often obscures or distorts the processes of inquiry as they are
practiced by scientists. Practices, such as reasoning carefully about the implications

=== Page 6 ===

July 2013
NGSS Release
Page 6 of 19
of models and theories; framing questions and hypotheses so that they can be
productively investigated; systematically analyzing and integrating data to serve as
evidence to evaluate claims; and communicating and critiquing ideas in a scientific
community are vital parts of inquiry. However, they tend to be missed when students
are taught a scripted procedure designed to obtain a particular result in a
decontextualized investigation. Furthermore, these higher-level reasoning and
problem-solving practices require a reasonable depth of familiarity with the content
of a given scientific topic if students are to engage in them in a meaningful way.
Debates over content versus process are not in step with the current views of the
nature of science…. Science is seen as a fundamentally social enterprise that is
aimed at advancing knowledge through the development of theories and models that
have explanatory and predictive power and that are grounded in evidence. In practice
this means that content and process are deeply intertwined. (NRC, 2012b, p. 127)

Historically, College Board emphasized content in its advanced placement science examinations,
but is now giving increased attention to the practices that scientists routinely use. To wit:
“Central to science is the goal of establishing lines of evidence and using that evidence to
develop and refine testable explanations and make predictions about natural phenomena.
Standards documents must reflect this goal of science by focusing on developing, in all students,
the competencies necessary for constructing testable, evidence-based explanations and
predictions” (College Board, 2010, p. 4). The new Advanced Placement (AP) Biology Exam and
the relatively new Standards for College Success (SCS) reflect the new perspective in that both
utilize scientific practices extensively. Both the AP redesign and the SCS identify performance
expectations requiring practice and content to be in context of one another. Given the research
that led College Board to make these decisions, the NRC utilized these two projects as a basis for
the development of the Framework. College Board work and now the NGSS focus on
understanding rather than memorization because greater understanding has been found to
positively influence college performance (Tai et al., 2005, 2006). College Board states: “In order
for a student to be college-ready in science, he or she must: (1) have knowledge of the
overarching ideas in the science disciplines (i.e., earth and space science, life science, physical
science, and engineering) and how the practices of science are situated within this content; (2)
have a rich understanding of the nature and epistemology of science, scientific discourse, and the
integration of science, technology, and society; (3) have metacognitive skills and self-efficacy
related to the practices of science” (College Board, 2010, p. 3). This definition and the
underlying research leave no doubt as to science practices being a critical component of readiness.

ACT’s evidence for incorporating science practices derives from extensive years of collecting
and analyzing data with regard to judging the preparedness of high school graduates for
postsecondary science courses. ACT conducts a national curriculum survey every 3 years that
compares expectations of introductory level postsecondary instructors with what is actually
taught by middle and high school teachers and uses the results to update teacher information and
the ACT assessments. The past two surveys have shown that postsecondary instructors greatly
value the use of process or inquiry skills (science and engineering practices in the language of
NGSS), and, in fact, value these skills equally to content. ACT notes [sic]: “Postsecondary
expectations clearly state the process and inquiry skill in science are critical as well as rigorous

=== Page 7 ===

understanding of fundamental (not advanced) science topics” (ACT, 2011, p. 9). In their college
placement services ACT also uses empirical data derived from the performance of college
students to set the ACT College Readiness Benchmarks. Students who meet a benchmark on the
ACT test or ACT Compass have approximately a 50 percent chance of receiving a B or better in
their introductory level Biology course (ACT, 2013).

While ACT’s position on college and career readiness in science acknowledges the need for
students to pursue a rigorous program of science courses in high school, ACT also calls for
integrating practices, based on their survey results. Notably, the ACT assessment focuses more
on skill application than content. ACT (2011) states, “The Science Test, on the EXPLORE,
PLAN, and ACT tests, measures the student’s interpretation, analysis, evaluation, reasoning, and
problem-solving skills required in the natural sciences. The test assumes that students are in the
process of taking the core science course of study (three years or more of science in high school)
that will prepare them for college-level work, and have completed a course in Biology and a
course in Physical Science and/or Earth Science by the time they take the ACT” (p. 20). The
ACT’s WorkKeys Applied Technology Assessment also values these skills and empirically
affirms that knowledge and usage of these skills better prepares students for career options than content knowledge alone.

College Board’s and ACT’s position with regard to the critical role of practices in preparing
students for success in college-level science is echoed by David Conley in his book College
Knowledge (2005). He identified students’ ability to conduct meaningful research and use
practices that lead toward quality research as a college- and career-ready indicator, stating that
successful students:
 Formulate research questions and develop a plan for research.
 Use research to support and develop their own opinions.
 Identify claims in their work that require outside support or validation.

Science and engineering practices are also receiving increased attention in higher education. For
example, recent “studies are converging on a view of engineering education that not only
requires students to develop a grasp of traditional engineering fundamentals, such as mechanics,
dynamics, mathematics, and technology, but also to develop the skills associated with learning to
imbed this knowledge in real-world situations. This not only demands skills of creativity,
teamwork, and design, but in global collaboration, communication, management, economics, and
ethics. Furthermore, the rapid pace of change of technology seems fated to continue for many
decades to come. This will require the engineers we are training today to learn to be lifelong
learners and to learn to develop “adaptive expertise” (Hatano and Inagaki, 1986; Pellegrino, 2006; Redish and Smith, 2008, p. 2).
The AP science curricula, the AAAS publication Vision and Change, and the Scientific
Foundations for Future Physicians identify overlapping science practices that are in line with the
Framework. For example, the importance of modeling emerges in the life science documents and
is used as an exemplar in Redish and Smith’s (2008) work on skill development in engineering,
noted above. Modeling is also built into both the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for Mathematics and the Framework.

As noted earlier, making science accessible to a far greater number of students than is now the
case is a critical issue. A growing body of evidence suggests that student engagement in practices
helps reduce achievement gaps (Barton et al., 2008; Brotman and Moore, 2008; Enfield et al.,
2008; Lee et al., 2005; Page, 2007). Specifically, one study found no significant difference in
performance between subgroups (gender, ethnicity, or economically disadvantaged) when
inquiry was used in instruction, as opposed to traditional classroom instruction where a
significant achievement gap between subgroups of students was found (Wilson et al., 2010). In
addition, Lee and colleagues (2006) found that while student achievement increased overall with
inquiry-focused instruction, students from non-mainstreamed or less privileged backgrounds
showed much higher gains than their mainstreamed, more privileged counterparts (Lee et al., 2006).

From an international perspective, science and engineering practices are seen as necessary for
literacy as well as proficiency. The OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment
2015 Scientific Literacy Assessment Framework (2012) states that a scientifically literate person
is able to engage in discourse by explaining phenomena scientifically, evaluate and design
scientific enquiry, and interpret data and evidence scientifically. It is worth noting that in Japan,
a nation whose students outscore U.S. students on both PISA and TIMSS, classroom activity
patterns are quite different than those characteristic of U.S. classrooms. Japanese students
contribute their ideas in solving problems collectively and critically discuss alternative solutions
to problems. Students in classroom environments like these come to expect that these public,
social acts of reasoning and dialogue are a regular part of classroom life and learning across the
disciplines (Linn, 2000; Stigler and Hiebert, 1999).

At the other end of the educational spectrum, Coles conducted research on the science content
knowledge and skills necessary for both higher education and the workforce in the United
Kingdom by interviewing groups from each sector. He found that employers and higher
education professionals have more in common than not in their views of what science skills
makes one qualified for their specific sector, noting: “[t]he number of components common to
employers and higher education tutors is about twice the number of components specific to
employers and about twice the number of components specific to tutors in higher education.”
Young and Glanfield (1998) add support to this finding, stating, “under the impact of
information technology, the skills needed in different occupational sectors are converging as
more and more jobs demand generic and abstract rather than sector-specific skills” (p. 7).

Graduates of 2- and 4-year colleges have as their goal securing employment and being successful
on the job. Listening to what employers seek in candidates is critical because the skills
employers seek need to be learned over the course of a K-postsecondary education. A number of
recent reports point to gaps in preparation for work. One study earmarked five assets that are
important to employers but hardest to find in candidates: These, in rank order, are
Communication Skills, Positive Attitude, Adaptable to Change, Teamwork Skills, and Strategic
Thinking and Analytics (Millennial Branding and Experience Inc., 2012). Another study asked
employers to rate the importance of candidate skills/qualities. The results resonate with the
previous study as employers cited, in rank order, the following top five abilities: work in a team
structure, verbally communicate with persons inside and outside the organization, make
decisions and solve problems, obtain and process information, plan, and organize and prioritize

work (National Association of Colleges and Employers, 2012). Still another study found that 95
percent of all employers surveyed say they give hiring preference to graduates with skills that
will enable them to contribute to innovation in the workplace, reflecting concern for the nation’s
continuing ability to compete (The Association of American Colleges and Universities, 2013).
These skills are likely to be acquired when students engage in projects based on the science and
engineering practices and core content described in the Framework and prescribed in the performance expectations of the NGSS.

IMPORTANCE OF MATHEMATICS FOR COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS IN
SCIENCE

The Framework calls out mathematical thinking as a specific practice for good reason.
“Mathematics is the bedrock of science, engineering and technology—it is the ability to
quantitatively describe and measure objects, events, and processes that makes science so
powerful in extending human knowledge. Moreover, because of the rapid and almost
unimaginable increase in the power of computers, advances in science now depend routinely on
techniques of mathematical models, remote imaging, data mining, and probabilistic calculations
that were unthinkable a decade ago” (Achieve, 2010, p. 53).

Complementing the research supporting the integration of practices and disciplinary content in
science education, research on math education suggests that instruction should not only
emphasize core ideas, but also emphasize inquiry, relevance, and a multilayered vision of
proficiency (Carnegie Corporation of New York, 2009).

From the international perspective, the lack of inclusion of mathematics explicitly in science
standards was found to be a shortcoming in the countries studied (Achieve, 2010). In a review of
the top performing countries based on PISA, reviewers found that mathematics integration was
left to mathematics standards and curriculum documents. It is important to be aware that the
math-science connection is not obvious to students. How science standards address and
incorporate mathematics can make a difference in how easily students develop quantitative
habits of mind. As a result, in developing the NGSS, explicit steps were taken to include
mathematics in the development of the standards to help ensure students would receive a
coherent education in two mutually supportive content areas. In fact the NGSS identify related
Common Core State Standards for Mathematics for each science standard.

In addition to the inclusion of mathematics in the practices, there is evidence that mathematics is
a key predictor of success in college science. While there is limited empirical data about the
exact boundaries of college and career readiness in science, there has been data that supports a
direct correlation between mathematics and success in college course work, or even the
likelihood of successfully graduating with a 4-year degree. Proficiency in mathematics is a
critical component of high school preparation leading to college success: “the highest level of
mathematics reached in high school continues to be a key marker in precollegiate momentum,
with the tipping point of momentum toward a bachelor’s degree now firmly above Algebra 2” (Adelman, 2006, p. xix).

=== Page 10 ===

July 2013
NGSS Release
Page 10 of 19
Sadler and Tai (2007) found that the number of years of mathematics was a significant predictor
of college success across all college science subjects. Further, they found that more advanced
mathematics in high school was a “pillar” that supports success in college science coursework. In
like vein, Conley found college- and career-ready graduates had a firm grasp on mathematics and
the ability to apply it across other disciplines. In addition, he found in surveys with college
faculty that mathematics was considered an even better predictor of college science than high
school science courses. Beyond success in postsecondary science, “there is a strong correlation
between preparedness for college mathematics and the actual completion of a college degree.
Students who need remediation in mathematics are considered at risk for academic failure and
for retention and perseverance in their post-secondary education” (Ali and Jenkins, 2002, p. 11).
The combination of the CCSS and the NGSS provide all students the opportunity for advanced
studies in mathematics and science. The NGSS were developed specifically taking into account
the new mathematics expectations described in the CCSS.

Experts at home and abroad understand that mathematics is key to understanding and
communicating scientific ideas. In the words of mathematician and educator Sol Garfunkel on
the future of American students, “We know that their future will involve many different jobs and
the need to master current and future technologies. We know that they will need creativity,
independence, imagination, and problem-solving abilities in addition to skills proficiency. In
other words, students will increasingly need mathematical understanding and awareness of the
tools mathematics provides in order to achieve their career goals” (Garfunkel, 2009).

It is easy to see why mathematics is, and will continue to be, a quality indicator of success. If
there are any prerequisites to postsecondary science courses, it is usually a mathematics
requirement. Students who are prepared for postsecondary education will be able to exhibit
evidence of the effective transfer of mathematics and disciplinary literacy skills to science. As
the NGSS move into adoption and implementation, work to develop specific examples of the
further integration of mathematics and science will be critical.

INTEGRATION OF PRACTICE AND CORE IDEAS

Neither rigorous content nor science and engineering practices alone are sufficient for success in
postsecondary institutions and careers. Rather it is the wedding of the practices to core content
that increases student learning, as the Framework underscores: “Learning is defined as the
combination of both knowledge and practice, not separate content and process learning goals” (p.
254). Additional research backs up the NRC’s assertion. While practices are found in literature to
be important predictors of achievement in science (Conley, 2005; Redish and Smith, 2008; von
Secker, 2002; Wilson et al., 2010), it is also clear that students should use them in the context of quality and rigorous content.

One often overlooked aspect of combining demanding practices with strong content in standards
is the effect on rigor. Even the most demanding of content is diluted if the expected student
performance is basically dependent on rote memorization, i.e., calls for students to “describe,”
“identify,” “recall,” “define,” “state,” or “recognize.” It is also well to keep in mind that calling
for application of mathematics in a performance generally raises the level of rigor.

Kansas 2007 Science Education Standards, Grades 8–11, Chemistry, HS.2A.2.2
NGSS Physical Sciences Grades 9–12,
HS-PS1-1 ”The student understands the periodic table lists elements according to increasing atomic number.
This table organizes physical and chemical trends by groups, periods, and sub-categories.” ”Use the periodic table as a model to predict the relative properties of elements based on the patterns of electrons in the outermost energy level of atoms.”

While the organization of the periodic table is addressed by both sets of standards, it is clear that
the NGSS raise the level of rigor by calling for a more demanding performance than does this example from the 2007 Kansas standards.

Another illustration can be found in Kansas’s previous Biology standards:

Kansas 2007 Science Education Standards, Grades 8–11, Biology, HS.3.3.4
NGSS Life Sciences Grades 9–12,
HS-LS3-3 ”The student understands organisms vary widely within and between populations.  Variation allows for natural selection to occur.” ”Apply concepts of statistics and probability to explain the variation and distribution of expressed traits in a population.”

Calling for students to apply math concepts in explaining trait variation, as the NGSS do, bumps
up the rigor of the expected student performance. Incorporating practices with content seems to
have a positive effect on ensuring all students learn content at a deep level. Researchers found
that students in project-based science classrooms performed better than comparison students on
designing fair tests, justifying claims with evidence, and generating explanations. They also
exhibited more negotiation and collaboration in their group work and a greater tendency to
monitor and evaluate their work (Kolodner et al., 2003). In addition, von Secker (2002) found a
greater content mastery and retention when teachers use inquiry-oriented practices. Results from
the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in science corroborate the
positive effect on learning content when science practices are used in conjunction with content.
On the eighth-grade teacher questionnaire, teachers reported how often their students engaged in
hands-on activities or investigations in science by selecting one of four responses: “never or
hardly ever,” “once or twice month,” “once or twice a week,” or “every day or almost every
day.” Students who did hands-on projects every day or almost every day scored higher on
average than those who did hands-on projects less frequently (NCES, 2011, p. 10). Furthermore,
among higher-achieving grade 8 students who scored above the 75th percentile, 77 percent had
teachers who reported that their students engage in hands-on activities once a week or more (NCES, 2011, p. 11).

The research regarding the value of integrating practices with content is compelling:
preparedness for postsecondary work should be rooted in a student’s ability to use science and
engineering practices in the context of rigorous content. Using the practices in absence of content

is akin to asking students to learn the steps in the so-called scientific method. That will not result
in preparedness but rather is likely to result in students continuing to have a disjointed view of
science and a lack of ability to pursue their own interests or research today’s problems. Students
proficient in applying the practices in context will be able to apply a blend of science and
engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, and DCIs to make sense of the world and approach
problems not previously encountered, engage in self-directed planning, monitoring, and
evaluation, and employ valid and reliable research strategies.

Prior to the release of the NGSS, most U.S. states had standards that did not clearly integrate
inquiry and content. This integration of science process skills and domain-specific knowledge is
still often missing from the classroom. Many standards, curriculum documents, and textbooks
have separate sections on inquiry and science practices, and research indicates that many
teachers follow the lead of these resources by teaching practices separately from conceptual
content (NRC, 2007). Often, when students engage in science and engineering practices through
laboratory experiments, these experiences have been isolated from the flow of classroom
instruction and lacking in clear learning goals tied to content knowledge (NRC, 2005). Standards
that balance and integrate inquiry and content can enhance student learning and better prepare
them for success in postsecondary institutions and careers. As research has repeatedly shown that
standards can have a large influence on curriculum, instruction, and assessment (Berland and
McNeill, 2010; Krajcik et al., 2008; NRC, 2007), it is important for standards to specify the
learning outcomes we expect from students, including that they can use practices to demonstrate knowledge of core ideas.

CONCLUSION

Economic and education statistics make it clear that the United States is not educating enough
students who can succeed in a global information economy fueled by advances and innovation in
science, engineering, and technology. Research findings indicate that our current system of
science education, which places more value on science as a knowledge base than as a way of
thinking, is ineffective. Too few students are experiencing success in postsecondary institutions
and therefore lack the wherewithal to qualify for gainful employment, including STEM fields,
where the nation is seeing the most growth in jobs. They are, in effect, being closed out of
middle class opportunities. However, as the research studies referenced in this appendix indicate,
there is a more productive path to follow in science education that entails linking important core
content to the practices that scientists and engineers use as they go about their work. This shift in
emphasis requires that we control the amount and kind of content, giving priority to powerful
concepts that have currency because of their utility in explaining phenomena, predicting
outcomes or displaying broad applicability in many fields, and that we use the practices in
conjunction with core content throughout the grades.

The Framework identifies the content students are expected to know in order to be scientifically
literate and to have an adequate foundation for further study and that content was deemed
appropriate for success in college and career by science education experts and postsecondary
instructors and employers. The Framework also describes the practices that characterize science
and engineering work and explains what they look like in primary, upper elementary, and in middle and high school classrooms.

To reiterate, during the development of the NGSS, states remained focused on the vision of the
Framework from the NRC, staying true to the cornerstones of rigorous core content, science and
engineering practices, and links to mathematics. To ensure fidelity to that vision, teams of
postsecondary faculty and business professionals from across the 26 lead states were convened to
review the standards in terms of practice and content. Like the NRC, these groups confirmed that
the design and development of the NGSS were guided by the best available evidence to ensure
that students who meet the standards have the knowledge and skills to succeed in entry level
science courses in technical training programs and in 2- and 4-year colleges. The evidence
indicates this can best be accomplished through an approach that promotes in-depth
understanding of a focused set of core concepts and interdisciplinary ideas, integrated with the
regular application of those understandings through the practices of scientific inquiry.

Benchmarking has become a central concept in improving systems. And many countries are
looking to Singapore as a model. Singapore’s Educational System is recognized today as “world
class,” but that is a relatively recent turn of events. In just a slightly longer time period than it
took the United States to relinquish its leadership role in terms of percent of students earning
high school diplomas and postsecondary degrees, Singapore went from an impoverished nation
with a largely illiterate population to being a model in education, a major telecommunications
hub, and a leader in consumer electronics, pharmaceuticals, financial services, and information
technology.  Singapore’s metamorphosis is attributed to its exemplary program of ensuring that
most students are educated to take advantage of growing opportunities for employment in STEM
fields. Because of the differences in size, scope, and complexity, it is difficult to imagine the
United States fully implementing Singapore’s system. However, much of education in the United
States is controlled by states, and they could individually use Singapore’s model to good advantage.

It is worth noting that as part of the education policy shift, “the government developed in 2004
the ‘Teach Less, Learn More Initiative,’ which moved instruction further away from rote
memorization and repetitive tasks on which it had originally focused to deeper conceptual
understanding and problem-based learning” (CIEB, 2012). Instruction has shifted toward one
that includes active engagement with science practices (CIEB, 2012). This stance certainly
resonates with that taken by the Framework and the NGSS.

In closing, when it comes to developing standards, rigorous content is an important indicator of
student readiness for success in postsecondary education and careers, but it is not enough.
Proficiency with science and engineering practices is also an indicator of readiness, but it is not
sufficient in the absence of rigorous content. In the end, as the research shows, it is the science
and engineering practices learned in conjunction with rigorous content that best prepares students
for success in postsecondary education and careers. More research is needed around the
alignment of high school and postsecondary expectations, course pathways, and flexible options
that engage students’ interests and best prepare students for postsecondary and career opportunities.
