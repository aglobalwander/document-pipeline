## CONCLUSION

Chapter 1 opened with the quote from Brian Stetler (2014, 52), senior media correspondent for CNN and the host of Reliable Sources . He stated: 'Hypercomplexity-our world is changing at an unprecedented rate, becoming more complex and globally interactive. Clear-cut, unambiguous understandings are no longer an option.' Thus, we believe the capacity for self-directed and continuous learning has become the most important

capacity needed for survival in the future. Fortunately, the brain's adaptability supports our ability to change, to grow, and to continuously develop our intellectual capacities throughout a lifetime. And that's what Cognitive Coaching is all about: producing self-directed learners and leaders with the disposition for continuous, lifelong learning.

Technological/information age organizations are searching for ways to deal with the complexities, uncertainties, and rapidity of change of the 21st and 22nd centuries. Modern educational organizations are learning the virtues of agility. Agile organizations are inclusive, responsive, robust, innovative, flexible, and adaptive. Their leaders realize that these virtues are invested in the intellectual prowess of their employees. Therefore, they devote their human, material, and financial resources to protecting, enhancing, and liberating the intellectual capacities of their employees: creativity, imagination, collaboration, entrepreneurship, innovation, networking, and learning how to learn (Atkinson and Moffat 2007; Costa, Garmston, and Zimmerman 2014; Hargreaves and Fullan 2012).

The relationship presumed by Cognitive Coaching is that teaching is a professional act and that coaches support teachers in becoming more resourceful, informed, and skillful professionals. Cognitive Coaches do not work to change overt behaviors but rather attend to the internal thought processes of teaching as a way to improve instruction. Behaviors change as a result of refined perceptions and cognitive processes.

Agile organizations view:

- The human mind as having no limits except those in which we choose to believe
- Humans as makers of meaning, and knowledge as constructed, both consciously and unconsciously, from experience
- All people at all ages as having the capacity to continue to develop intellectually
- All members of the school community as continual and active learners
- Leadership as the mediation of both the individual's and the organization's capacity for self-renewal
- Organizations, treated as complex adaptive systems, as capable of organic growth

Agile schools acknowledge interdependent communities of autonomous human beings bound by core values, common goals, caring, respect for diversity, and the ability to struggle together. Its members are reflective,

examining their products and processes in a continuing climate of selfrenewal. Agile schools encourage the development and contribution of each person's unique personal and professional identities.

This requires an adaptive, rather than a technical, shift in mind-set, a global view of mission driven by uncompromising values and beliefs about a better world.
