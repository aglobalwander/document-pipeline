I. Course description and aims
The Diploma Programme Music course (for first teaching from
2020) has been designed to prepare the 21st century music student
for a world in which global musical cultures and industries are rapidly changing.
The course is grounded in the knowledge, skills and processes
associated with the study of music and offers a strengthened approach
to student creativity through practical, informed and purposeful
explorations of diverse musical forms, practices and contexts. The
course also ensures a holistic approach to learning, with the roles of
performer, creator and researcher afforded equal importance in all course components.
The aims of the music course are to enable students to:

z explore a range of musical contexts and make links to, and between,
different musical practices, conventions and forms of expression

z acquire, develop and experiment with musical competencies
through a range of musical practices, conventions and forms of
expression, both individually and in collaboration with others

z evaluate and develop critical perspectives on their own music and the work of others.
Alignment with DP arts courses
The curriculum moves into alignment with other DP arts courses,
through the clear articulation of the balance between the theoretical
and practical disciplines of music. A new set of assessment tasks that
link directly to the processes and roles experienced in the curriculum
have been developed. These robust tasks address the concept of
holistic musical development by removing optionality (and thereby
the possibility to specialize in one skill at the expense of others) and
incorporating practical music-making into all tasks. Assessment tasks
are now presented as coursework, balanced between internal and
external assessment. There are three common components at SL and
HL, with a discrete HL extension component which invites students
to work within the parameters of real-life music industry practices.
Engagement with diverse musical material
The new course seeks to be inclusive of students with wide-ranging
personal and cultural musical backgrounds. In place of prescribed
musical content, students and teachers in the new course have the
agency to personalise unique approaches to musical forms, genres and
pieces. The exploration of diverse musical material is focused through the lenses of four areas of inquiry.
z Music for sociocultural and political expression z Music for listening and performance,
z Music for dramatic impact, movement and entertainment
z Music technology in the electronic and digital age.

III. Assessment model
The Diploma Programme (DP) is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed for students in the 16 to
19 age range. It is a broad-based two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable
and inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on encouraging
students to develop intercultural understanding, open-mindedness, and the attitudes
necessary for them to respect and evaluate a range of points of view.
The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core. Students
study two modern languages (or a modern language and a classical language),
a ­humanities or social science subject, an experimental science, mathematics
and one of the creative arts. Instead of an arts subject, students can choose
two subjects from another area. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that
makes the Diploma Programme a demanding course of study designed to
prepare students effectively for university entrance. In each of the academic
areas students have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can
choose subjects that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.
Normally, three subjects (and not more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and
the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends 240 teaching hours for
HL subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth
than at SL. In addition, three core elements—the extended essay, theory of knowledge and
creativity, activity, service—are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.
These IB DP subject briefs illustrate the following key course components.

A framework for study and assessment
Engagement with these areas of inquiry takes place across three
contexts—personal, local and global. These contexts invite students
to move beyond familiar musical material (personal context), to
experience music from the culture or community around them
(local context), as well as engaging with previously unfamiliar music
(global context). Combined with the contexts, the areas of inquiry
offer a “matrix” onto which students can plot the variety of their
musical encounters.  This new flexibility is not only about choice in
the learning, teaching and assessment—it is also about forging deep,
life-long connections between students’ passions and interests and
the wider world of music and music-making. All musical encounters
are experienced in the roles of researcher, creator and performer,
and are related through teaching and assessment to the processes of
exploring, experimenting and presenting music. Academic rigour is
assured through the requirement for students to critically analyse the
music with which they engage, drawing information and conclusions
which they then apply to their own practical music making through creating and performing.
What do students do in a music classroom?
How are music students assessed?
Students at SL and HL submit the following common assessment tasks.
An exploration portfolio: Written work demonstrating engagement
with, and understanding of, diverse musical material, along with practical exercises in creating and performing
An experimentation report: Written work in the form of a rationale
and commentary that supports practical musical evidence of experi­ mentation in creating and performing
A musical presentation: Finished works in creating and performing, supported by programme notes.
In addition, HL students will submit the following project.
A collaborative project: A continuous multimedia presentation
documenting a real-life project, containing evidence of the project
proposal, the process and evaluation, and the realized project, or curated selections of it.
By the end of the course students will have:

z broadened their musical horizons through engagement with diverse musical material

z analysed a wide range of music

z engaged with music technology as a compulsory part of the course

z gained confidence in the essential processes associated with music-making

z developed as holistic musicians with experience as creators and performers
Engage with a diverse range of music that will
broaden their musical horizons and provide stimuli to expand their own music-making
Connect theoretical studies to practical work to gain a deeper understanding of the music they engage with.
Communicate and present music as researchers, creators and performers.

HL
Exploring music in context
Students will learn how to engage with a diverse range of music that will broaden their musical horizons and provide stimuli to expand their own music-making. They will demonstrate diversity and breadth in their exploration by engaging with music from the areas of inquiry in personal, local and global contexts.
45 45
Experimenting with music
Students connect theoretical studies to practical work and gain a deeper understanding of the music they engage with.
Through this theoretical and practical work as researchers, creators and performers, they will learn to experiment with a range of musical material and stimuli from the areas of inquiry across local and global contexts.
45 45
Presenting music
Students learn to practise and prepare finished pieces that will be performed or presented to an audience. In working towards completed musical works, they expand their musical identity, demonstrate their level of musicianship, and learn to share and communicate their music as researchers, creators and performers.
60 60
The contemporary music maker (HL only)
Music at higher level (HL) builds on the learning of musical competencies and challenges students to engage with the musical processes in settings of contemporary music-making. For the HL component, students plan and collaboratively create a project that draws on the competencies, skills and processes in all of the musical roles of the music course and is inspired by real-life practices of music-making.
