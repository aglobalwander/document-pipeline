Originally a term used by Madeline Hunter, a sponge strategy is meant to 'soak up' transitional minutes with meaningful engagement.\n\n## WHY?\n\nIt is important to start and end on time.\n\nIf start times are not honored, participants who come late don't feel it is necessary to arrive on time.\n\nThis respects those who arrive on time, and respectfully allows those who are not on time to join in.\n\nHOW?\n\n## Road Sign Synectics\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nSynectics is a technique used by George Gordon and William Prince to kick-start the creative side of our brains to aide in problem-solving. It invites analogical thinking.\n\n## Road Sign Synectic\n\nCan use same strategy with smaller group by adding manipulatives (pictures) -&gt; Increase degree of structure and increase attention\n\n- B) Option: Four-Box Synectics\n- 1.Draw 2X2 box\n- 2.Elicit four objects from group (e.g., objects found in a kitchen\n- 3.Table groups brainstorm: Productive Meetings are like each of the objects because...\n- 4.Table spokespersons share 1 favorite with whole group.\n\nShow slide with a variety of road signs, and directions.\n\nAsk tables to brainstorm ways in which meetings are like road signs.\n\nAsk one person from each table to report out, saying, 'Meetings are like road signs, because\u2026'\n\n## Posing Questions, p. 56\n\n- \u2022 Full attention\n- \u2022 Approachability: Verbals and Nonverbals\n- \u2022 Plural forms\n- \u2022 Tentative language\n- \u2022 Open-ended\n- \u2022 Positive presuppositions\n\n\u00a92025Adaptive Schools Seminars\n\n## WHAT?\n\nIntroduce the remaining elements of an invitation in mediational questions.\n\n## WHY?\n\nThe trainer provides the list as an overview and a precursor to the paired reading.\n\n## HOW?\n\nThe trainer reveals the elements one at a time.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nYou have experienced choosing voice and the need to fully attend to the speaker. There are several more elements of invitation that you will explore with your partner.\n\nHOW?\n\nRead the directions on the slide and clarify as needed.\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nWhat questions might you have about the reading and the elements of an invitation.\n\nWHAT:  identify elements of invitational question\n\nWHY:\n\n## WHAT?\n\nElements of invitation in mediational questions\n\n## WHY?\n\nApplication of reading to question samples\n\nTo ascertain participant understanding of content as a scaffold to crafting questions\n\n## HOW?\n\nPairs analyze question samples on LG page and identify elements of an invitation in a question.\n\nPinkCast 3 1/2 minutes Interviewing Ozan Varol Didn't do mic check\n\nINTERVENING WITH FIVE ENERGY SOURCES LG p. 66-67 WHAT?\n\nIntervening with Energy Sources by posing questions\n\n## WHY?\n\nCombine learning about the Energy Sources with the crafting questions to intervene when groups are struggling.\n\n## HOW?\n\nRead the directions from the slide.

(Like a train conductor naming the next stop, a trainer uses the agenda chart to update participants on where we are and where are going next in the training.)\n\nProvides a model of how to utilize a public agenda\n\n## HOW?\n\nMove to agenda and reference current topic placement.\n\n## WHAT?\n\n## Clock Partner\n\n## WHY?\n\nConstruct meaning from reading Gain another perspective\n\n## HOW?\n\nUse page 14 and directions on slide.\n\nBrief overview 'structures'\n\n- -system of order / organization.\n- -honor dynamic relationship of parts-&gt;workable whole.\n- -potential for chaos exists-&gt;structures permits expressions of perspectives in useful, safe manner\n\n## 3 structures for successful meetings\n\n## WHY?\n\nEvery group brings a variety of ideas, styles, personal histories and individual agendas to its work, so the potential for chaotic interaction always exists.\n\n## HOW?\n\nUsing the slide, name and give a brief explanation of each. More detail will be provided with strategies that follow.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nNow we are going to explore some specific structures. The term 'structure' is used to describe a system of order and organization. Certain meeting structures have been found to correlate highly with productive meetings. These structures will result in people leaving meetings with a maximum amount of work done...in a minimum amount of time...with a maximum amount of satisfaction.\n\n## TRAINERS' NOTE:\n\nConsider presenting this operational definition of a 'successful' meeting using Visual Paragraph.\n\nThese organizers are found under the heading of 'Structures for Successful Meetings,' on page 68.\n\nIn the Adaptive Schools Foundation Seminar, three structures for successful meetings are offered:\n\n- 1) Decide on Decision Making offers us key guiding questions about who decides and which topics are ours.\n- 3 structures for successful meetings.\n\nQuestions to be answered before discussion\n\n-What topics are ours?\n\n-Who decides?\n\n-Who are we in decision-making process?\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nThis is the first structure that you will be unpacking.\n\nWHAT: Text on Decide on Decision-Making\n\n## WHY: Gets groups in trouble\n\nClarity helps groups avoid major problems\n\nDECIDE ON DECISION-MAKING\n\nLG, p. 69-71\n\nWHAT?\n\nDECIDE ON DECISION MAKING is the first Structure for Successful Meetings.\n\n## WHY?\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nDECIDE ON DECISION MAKING is an important structure for three reasons:\n\n- 1) groups will put energy into the wrong issues when this is not clear;\n- 2) confusion about decision-making authority generally creates morale problems;\n- 3) when decision-making processes are unclear, those who do not like the decision, attack the process.\n\n## HOW?\n\nUse Clock Partners for Paired Reading.\n\n## TRAINERS NOTE:\n\nYou may choose to have an intact team read this section as a whole rather than divide into pairs.\n\n## DEBRIEF:\n\nIF not clear:\n\n1.energy-&gt;wrong issues\n\n2.confusion-&gt;morale problems\n\n3.not like the decision-&gt;attack / sabotage\n\n## will challenge:\n\n1.whose Authority it is to make decisions 2.the process - What processes should be used (and understood) for decision-making?\n\n3.role group plays in decision process emphasize importance of over-communicating decision-making process Communicate four times:\n\n1.At the beginning of the topic\n\n2.In the middle - during the heat of discussion\n\n3.At the conclusion of the topic/decision\n\n4.Any written minutes or memos\n\n## Why? Forget where are / who are in decision-making processes.\n\nUse diagram, 'Decide on Decision-Making,' in Learning Guide to debrief reading. Consider using the sample text below to answer questions and comment after pairs have done the Reading strategy above.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nIt is important to over-communicate decision-making process. Communicate the process four times:\n\n- 1. At the beginning of the topic\n- 2. In the middle - during the heat of discussion\n- 3. At the conclusion of the topic/decision\n- 4. Any written minutes or memos\n\nWhy is this important? People tend to forget who they are and where they are in decisionmaking processes. If they end up not liking the decision, there is a tendency to attack the process. Over communicating process minimizes this likelihood.\n\n## Structures for Successful Meetings,\n\nDecide on Decision Making, p. 72\n\n## Naive Questions\n\n- 1.Who is making this decision?\n- 2.What is the process for making this decision?\n- 3.What parts of this issue live in our sandbox?\n\nNa\u00efve questions-strategy facilitators / group members use in deciding on decision-making Asked with innocence, desire to know, in a melodic, approachable voice\n\nGentle nudge to get back on track\n\nPluralistic ignorance -&gt;'emperor's new clothes'\n\nwhen group's majority privately believes one thing and mistakenly assumes that most others believe opposite\n\n## NAIVE QUESTIONS\n\nLG, p. 72\n\nWHAT?\n\nNa\u00efve questions\n\n## WHY?\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nNa\u00efve questions-asked with innocence, a desire to know, and in a melodic, approachable voice -- is one strategy for facilitators and group members to use in deciding on decisionmaking.\n\n## HOW?\n\nModel asking the questions on the screen for the group using elements of approachability.\n\n## Structures for Successful Meetings, Decide on Decision Making, p. 72\n\nIf you could select only two of these questions that would be most valuable for a group with whom you are working, which ones might you choose?\n\nHOW?\n\nPairs scan sample questions on page.\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nRecall the work you did today, on the Norm of Collaboration Posing Questions (LG p. 56). One of the elements that increases the probability of a question being received as invitational is the use of 'Approachable Voice.' You will remember that an approachable intonation is well-modulated and tends to conclude on an up note.\n\nRead the prompt on the screen and share your choices and your rationale.\n\n## Structures for Successful Meetings, Decide on Decision Making, pp. 73-75\n\n## DECIDE ON DECISION MAKING STRATEGIES\n\nLG, pp. 73-76\n\nWHAT?\n\n'Decide on Decision Making Strategies,' is an opportunity to review options available to a facilitator and group members when the conversation moves from dialogue to discussion.\n\n## WHY?\n\nGive structure/scaffold to decision making discussions\n\nSupport groups in selecting from a repertoire of potential strategies\n\n## HOW?\n\nUsing the arrow illustration on LG p. 71, highlight the guiding question 'Which decisionmaking process will be used?'\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nThe Adaptive Schools offers groups over 150 strategies and moves to support collaborative work, many of them scaffolds for decision making. The directions for each of these can be kept 'on hand' with the free Adaptive Schools App. You are about to have an opportunity to explore some of those strategies.\n\ncomplex decision -&gt; long period of dialogue, whose consequences last for years / decades, do not rely on Pro/Con see current situation from new perspectives, imagine new possibilities, weigh options with sophistication\n\nno foolproof algorithm for life's difficult choices research shows we get better at selecting right algorithm to make better decision\n\nDECIDE ON DECISION-MAKING STRATEGIES Form groups of 5.\n\n## WHAT?\n\nDecide on Decision Strategies is an opportunity to review options available to a facilitator and group members when the conversation moves from dialogue to discussion.\n\n## WHY?\n\nGive structure/scaffold to decision making discussions\n\nSupport groups in selecting from a repertoire of potential strategies\n\n## HOW?\n\nUsing the arrow illustration on LG p. 71, highlight the guiding question 'Which decisionmaking process will be used?'\n\n## Suggested Language:\n\nThe Adaptive Schools offers groups over 150 strategies and moves to support collaborative work, many of them scaffolds for decision making.

'What Professional Development should be offered?' 'Which math/reading series should we select?' 'What venue should we use for the prom (or other event)?'\n\nIn your team of six, brainstorm 2-3 additional decisions that a group that you are part of might have to make, and jot them down.\n\nAllow time for a brief brainstorm.\n\nEach of you will read the strategy and directions on your card. When group members are ready, each of you will report to your group in round-robin fashion:\n\na brief summary of your strategy one or more decisions from your brainstormed list that your strategy might support, with your rationale.\n\nRespond to any clarifying questions, and have the groups begin.\n\n## Decide on Decision-Making, p. 125\n\n## Discourse\n\n\u00a92025 Adaptive Schools Seminars\n\n## Reminder\n\n## NORMS OF COLLABORATION REFLECTION\n\nWHAT?\n\nReflection on selected norm from beginning of the day\n\n## WHY?\n\nAn opportunity to reflect and self- asses on the Norm selected as a focus for the day.\n\n## HOW?\n\nSuggested Language:\n\nThis morning you began the day by setting a Norms of Collaboration goal for yourself.\n\nHow did you do?
