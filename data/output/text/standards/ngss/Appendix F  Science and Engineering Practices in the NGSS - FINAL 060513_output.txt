APPENDIX F – Science and Engineering Practices in the NGSS

A Science Framework for K-12 Science Education provides the blueprint for developing the Next
Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The Framework expresses a vision in science education that
requires students to operate at the nexus of three dimensions of learning:  Science and Engineering
Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Disciplinary Core Ideas. The Framework identified a small number
of disciplinary core ideas that all students should learn with increasing depth and sophistication, from
Kindergarten through grade twelve. Key to the vision expressed in the Framework is for students to learn
these disciplinary core ideas in the context of science and engineering practices. The importance of
combining science and engineering practices and disciplinary core ideas is stated in the Framework as
follows:
Standards and performance expectations that are aligned to the framework must take into
account that students cannot fully understand scientific and engineering ideas without
engaging in the practices of inquiry and the discourses by which such ideas are
developed and refined. At the same time, they cannot learn or show competence in
practices except in the context of specific content. (NRC Framework, 2012, p. 218)
The Framework specifies that each performance expectation must combine a relevant practice of science
or engineering, with a core disciplinary idea and crosscutting concept, appropriate for students of the
designated grade level. That guideline is perhaps the most significant way in which the NGSS differs
from prior standards documents. In the future, science assessments will not assess students’ understanding
of core ideas separately from their abilities to use the practices of science and engineering. They will be
assessed together, showing students not only “know” science concepts; but also, students can use their
understanding to investigate the natural world through the practices of science inquiry, or solve
meaningful problems through the practices of engineering design. The Framework uses the term
“practices,” rather than “science processes” or “inquiry” skills for a specific reason:
We use the term “practices” instead of a term such as “skills” to emphasize that
engaging in scientific investigation requires not only skill but also knowledge that is
specific to each practice. (NRC Framework, 2012, p. 30)
The eight practices of science and engineering that the Framework identifies as essential for all students
to learn and describes in detail are listed below:
1.  Asking questions (for science) and defining problems (for engineering)
2.  Developing and using models
3.  Planning and carrying out investigations
4.  Analyzing and interpreting data
5.  Using mathematics and computational thinking
6.  Constructing explanations (for science) and designing solutions (for engineering)
7.  Engaging in argument from evidence
8.  Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information

Rationale
Chapter 3 of the Framework describes each of the eight practices of science and engineering and presents
the following rationale for why they are essential.

Engaging in the practices of science helps students understand how scientific knowledge
develops; such direct involvement gives them an appreciation of the wide range of
approaches that are used to investigate, model, and explain the world. Engaging in the
practices of engineering likewise helps students understand the work of engineers, as
well as the links between engineering and science. Participation in these practices also

helps students form an understanding of the crosscutting concepts and disciplinary ideas
of science and engineering; moreover, it makes students’ knowledge more meaningful and embeds it more deeply into their worldview.
The actual doing of science or engineering can also pique students’ curiosity, capture
their interest, and motivate their continued study; the insights thus gained help them
recognize that the work of scientists and engineers is a creative endeavor—one that has
deeply affected the world they live in. Students may then recognize that science and
engineering can contribute to meeting many of the major challenges that confront society
today, such as generating sufficient energy, preventing and treating disease, maintaining
supplies of fresh water and food, and addressing climate change.
Any education that focuses predominantly on the detailed products of scientific labor—
the facts of science—without developing an understanding of how those facts were
established or that ignores the many important applications of science in the world
misrepresents science and marginalizes the importance of engineering. (NRC
Framework 2012, pp. 42-43)
As suggested in the rationale, above, Chapter 3 derives the eight practices based on an analysis of what
professional scientists and engineers do. It is recommended that users of the NGSS read that chapter
carefully, as it provides valuable insights into the nature of science and engineering, as well as the
connections between these two closely allied fields. The intent of this section of the NGSS appendices is
more limited—to describe what each of these eight practices implies about what students can do. Its
purpose is to enable readers to better understand the performance expectations. The “Practices Matrix” is
included, which lists the specific capabilities included in each practice for each grade band (K-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12).

Guiding Principles
The development process of the standards provided insights into science and engineering practices.
These insights are shared in the following guiding principles:
Students in grades K-12 should engage in all eight practices over each grade band. All eight
practices are accessible at some level to young children; students’ abilities to use the practices
grow over time. However, the NGSS only identifies the capabilities students are expected to
acquire by the end of each grade band (K-2, 3-5, 6-8, and 9-12). Curriculum developers and
teachers determine strategies that advance students’ abilities to use the practices.
Practices grow in complexity and sophistication across the grades. The Framework suggests
how students’ capabilities to use each of the practices should progress as they mature and engage
in science learning. For example, the practice of “planning and carrying out investigations”
begins at the kindergarten level with guided situations in which students have assistance in
identifying phenomena to be investigated, and how to observe, measure, and record outcomes. By
upper elementary school, students should be able to plan their own investigations. The nature of
investigations that students should be able to plan and carry out is also expected to increase as
students mature, including the complexity of questions to be studied, the ability to determine what
kind of investigation is needed to answer different kinds of questions, whether or not variables
need to be controlled and if so, which are most important, and at the high school level, how to
take measurement error into account. As listed in the tables in this chapter, each of the eight
practices has its own progression, from kindergarten to grade 12. While these progressions are
derived from Chapter 3 of the Framework, they are refined based on experiences in crafting the
NGSS and feedback received from reviewers.
Each practice may reflect science or engineering. Each of the eight practices can be used in the
service of scientific inquiry or engineering design. The best way to ensure a practice is being used

for science or engineering is to ask about the goal of the activity. Is the goal to answer a question?
If so, students are doing science. Is the purpose to define and solve a problem? If so, students are
doing engineering. Box 3-2 on pages 50-53 of the Framework provides a side-by-side comparison
of how scientists and engineers use these practices. This chapter briefly summarizes what it
“looks like” for a student to use each practice for science or engineering.
Practices represent what students are expected to do, and are not teaching methods or
curriculum. The Framework occasionally offers suggestions for instruction, such as how a
science unit might begin with a scientific investigation, which then leads to the solution of an
engineering problem. The NGSS avoids such suggestions since the goal is to describe what
students should be able to do, rather than how they should be taught. For example, it was
suggested for the NGSS to recommend certain teaching strategies such as using biomimicry—the
application of biological features to solve engineering design problems. Although instructional
units that make use of biomimicry seem well-aligned with the spirit of the Framework to
encourage integration of core ideas and practices, biomimicry and similar teaching approaches
are more closely related to curriculum and instruction than to assessment. Hence, the decision was made not to include biomimicry in the NGSS.
The eight practices are not separate; they intentionally overlap and interconnect. As
explained by Bell, et al. (2012), the eight practices do not operate in isolation. Rather, they tend to
unfold sequentially, and even overlap. For example, the practice of “asking questions” may lead
to the practice of “modeling” or “planning and carrying out an investigation,” which in turn may
lead to “analyzing and interpreting data.”  The practice of “mathematical and computational
thinking” may include some aspects of “analyzing and interpreting data.” Just as it is important
for students to carry out each of the individual practices, it is important for them to see the connections among the eight practices.
Performance expectations focus on some but not all capabilities associated with a practice.
The Framework identifies a number of features or components of each practice. The practices
matrix, described in this section, lists the components of each practice as a bulleted list within
each grade band. As the performance expectations were developed, it became clear that it’s too
much to expect each performance to reflect all components of a given practice. The most
appropriate aspect of the practice is identified for each performance expectation.
Engagement in practices is language intensive and requires students to participate in
classroom science discourse. The practices offer rich opportunities and demands for language
learning while advancing science learning for all students (Lee, Quinn, & Valdés, in press).
English language learners, students with disabilities that involve language processing, students
with limited literacy development, and students who are speakers of social or regional varieties of
English that are generally referred to as “non-Standard English” stand to gain from science
learning that involves language-intensive scientific and engineering practices. When supported
appropriately, these students are capable of learning science through their emerging language and
comprehending and carrying out sophisticated language functions (e.g., arguing from evidence,
providing explanations, developing models) using less-than-perfect English. By engaging in such
practices, moreover, they simultaneously build on their understanding of science and their
language proficiency (i.e., capacity to do more with language).
On the following pages, each of the eight practices is briefly described. Each description ends with a table
illustrating the components of the practice that students are expected to master at the end of each grade
band. All eight tables comprise the practices matrix. During development of the NGSS, the practices
matrix was revised several times to reflect improved understanding of how the practices connect with the disciplinary core ideas.

Practice 1  Asking Questions and Defining Problems
Students at any grade level should be able to ask questions of each other about the texts
they read, the features of the phenomena they observe, and the conclusions they draw
from their models or scientific investigations. For engineering, they should ask questions
to define the problem to be solved and to elicit ideas that lead to the constraints and
specifications for its solution. (NRC Framework 2012, p. 56)
Scientific questions arise in a variety of ways. They can be driven by curiosity about the world, inspired
by the predictions of a model, theory, or findings from previous investigations, or they can be stimulated
by the need to solve a problem. Scientific questions are distinguished from other types of questions in that
the answers lie in explanations supported by empirical evidence, including evidence gathered by others or through investigation.
While science begins with questions, engineering begins with defining a problem to solve. However,
engineering may also involve asking questions to define a problem, such as:  What is the need or desire
that underlies the problem? What are the criteria for a successful solution? Other questions arise when
generating ideas, or testing possible solutions, such as:  What are the possible trade-offs? What evidence is necessary to determine which solution is best?
Asking questions and defining problems also involves asking questions about data, claims that are made,
and proposed designs. It is important to realize that asking a question also leads to involvement in another
practice. A student can ask a question about data that will lead to further analysis and interpretation. Or a
student might ask a question that leads to planning and design, an investigation, or the refinement of a design.
Whether engaged in science or engineering, the ability to ask good questions and clearly define problems
is essential for everyone. The following progression of Practice 1 summarizes what students should be
able to do by the end of each grade band. Each of the examples of asking questions below leads to students engaging in other scientific practices.

Practice 2  Developing and Using Models
Modeling can begin in the earliest grades, with students’ models progressing from
concrete “pictures” and/or physical scale models (e.g., a toy car) to more abstract
representations of relevant relationships in later grades, such as a diagram representing
forces on a particular object in a system. (NRC Framework, 2012, p. 58)
Models include diagrams, physical replicas, mathematical representations, analogies, and computer
simulations. Although models do not correspond exactly to the real world, they bring certain features into
focus while obscuring others. All models contain approximations and assumptions that limit the range of
validity and predictive power, so it is important for students to recognize their limitations.
In science, models are used to represent a system (or parts of a system) under study, to aid in the
development of questions and explanations, to generate data that can be used to make predictions, and to
communicate ideas to others. Students can be expected to evaluate and refine models through an iterative
cycle of comparing their predictions with the real world and then adjusting them to gain insights into the
phenomenon being modeled. As such, models are based upon evidence. When new evidence is uncovered
that the models can’t explain, models are modified.
In engineering, models may be used to analyze a system to see where or under what conditions flaws
might develop, or to test possible solutions to a problem. Models can also be used to visualize and refine a
design, to communicate a design’s features to others, and as prototypes for testing design performance.

Grades K-2

Practice 3  Planning and Carrying Out Investigations
Students should have opportunities to plan and carry out several different kinds of
investigations during their K-12 years. At all levels, they should engage in investigations that
range from those structured by the teacher—in order to expose an issue or question that they
would be unlikely to explore on their own (e.g., measuring specific properties of materials)—
to those that emerge from students’ own questions. (NRC Framework, 2012, p. 61)
Scientific investigations may be undertaken to describe a phenomenon, or to test a theory or model for
how the world works. The purpose of engineering investigations might be to find out how to fix or
improve the functioning of a technological system or to compare different solutions to see which best
solves a problem. Whether students are doing science or engineering, it is always important for them to
state the goal of an investigation, predict outcomes, and plan a course of action that will provide the best
evidence to support their conclusions. Students should design investigations that generate data to provide
evidence to support claims they make about phenomena. Data aren’t evidence until used in the process of
supporting a claim. Students should use reasoning and scientific ideas, principles, and theories to show why data can be considered evidence.
Over time, students are expected to become more systematic and careful in their methods. In laboratory
experiments, students are expected to decide which variables should be treated as results or outputs,
which should be treated as inputs and intentionally varied from trial to trial, and which should be
controlled, or kept the same across trials. In the case of field observations, planning involves deciding
how to collect different samples of data under different conditions, even though not all conditions are
under the direct control of the investigator. Planning and carrying out investigations may include elements of all of the other practices.

Practice 4  Analyzing and Interpreting Data
Once collected, data must be presented in a form that can reveal any patterns and
relationships and that allows results to be communicated to others. Because raw data as
such have little meaning, a major practice of scientists is to organize and interpret data
through tabulating, graphing, or statistical analysis. Such analysis can bring out the
meaning of data—and their relevance—so that they may be used as evidence.
Engineers, too, make decisions based on evidence that a given design will work; they
rarely rely on trial and error. Engineers often analyze a design by creating a model or
prototype and collecting extensive data on how it performs, including under extreme
conditions. Analysis of this kind of data not only informs design decisions and enables the
prediction or assessment of performance but also helps define or clarify problems,
determine economic feasibility, evaluate alternatives, and investigate failures. (NRC
Framework, 2012, p. 61-62)
As students mature, they are expected to expand their capabilities to use a range of tools for tabulation,
graphical representation, visualization, and statistical analysis. Students are also expected to improve their
abilities to interpret data by identifying significant features and patterns, use mathematics to represent
relationships between variables, and take into account sources of error. When possible and feasible,
students should use digital tools to analyze and interpret data. Whether analyzing data for the purpose of
science or engineering, it is important students present data as evidence to support their conclusions.

Practice 5  Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking
Although there are differences in how mathematics and computational thinking are applied
in science and in engineering, mathematics often brings these two fields together by
enabling engineers to apply the mathematical form of scientific theories and by enabling
scientists to use powerful information technologies designed by engineers. Both kinds of
professionals can thereby accomplish investigations and analyses and build complex
models, which might otherwise be out of the question. (NRC Framework, 2012, p. 65)
Students are expected to use mathematics to represent physical variables and their relationships, and to
make quantitative predictions. Other applications of mathematics in science and engineering include
logic, geometry, and at the highest levels, calculus. Computers and digital tools can enhance the power of
mathematics by automating calculations, approximating solutions to problems that cannot be calculated
precisely, and analyzing large data sets available to identify meaningful patterns. Students are expected to
use laboratory tools connected to computers for observing, measuring, recording, and processing data.
Students are also expected to engage in computational thinking, which involves strategies for organizing
and searching data, creating sequences of steps called algorithms, and using and developing new
simulations of natural and designed systems. Mathematics is a tool that is key to understanding science.
As such, classroom instruction must include critical skills of mathematics. The NGSS displays many of
those skills through the performance expectations, but classroom instruction should enhance all of science
through the use of quality mathematical and computational thinking.

Practice 6  Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions
The goal of science is to construct explanations for the causes of phenomena. Students are
expected to construct their own explanations, as well as apply standard explanations they learn
about from their teachers or reading. The Framework states the following about explanation:
“The goal of science is the construction of theories that provide explanatory accounts of the
world. A theory becomes accepted when it has multiple lines of empirical evidence and greater
explanatory power of phenomena than previous theories.”(NRC Framework, 2012, p. 52)
An explanation includes a claim that relates how a variable or variables relate to another variable
or a set of variables. A claim is often made in response to a question and in the process of
answering the question, scientists often design investigations to generate data.
The goal of engineering is to solve problems. Designing solutions to problems is a systematic
process that involves defining the problem, then generating, testing, and improving solutions.
This practice is described in the Framework as follows.
Asking students to demonstrate their own understanding of the implications of a scientific idea
by developing their own explanations of phenomena, whether based on observations they have
made or models they have developed, engages them in an essential part of the process by which conceptual change can occur.
In engineering, the goal is a design rather than an explanation. The process of developing a
design is iterative and systematic, as is the process of developing an explanation or a theory in
science. Engineers’ activities, however, have elements that are distinct from those of scientists.
These elements include specifying constraints and criteria for desired qualities of the solution,
developing a design plan, producing and testing models or prototypes, selecting among
alternative design features to optimize the achievement of design criteria, and refining design
ideas based on the performance of a prototype or simulation. (NRC Framework, 2012, p. 68-69)

Practice 7  Engaging in Argument from Evidence
The study of science and engineering should produce a sense of the process of argument
necessary for advancing and defending a new idea or an explanation of a phenomenon and
the norms for conducting such arguments. In that spirit, students should argue for the
explanations they construct, defend their interpretations of the associated data, and advocate
for the designs they propose. (NRC Framework, 2012, p. 73)
Argumentation is a process for reaching agreements about explanations and design solutions. In science,
reasoning and argument based on evidence are essential in identifying the best explanation for a natural
phenomenon. In engineering, reasoning and argument are needed to identify the best solution to a design
problem. Student engagement in scientific argumentation is critical if students are to understand the
culture in which scientists live, and how to apply science and engineering for the benefit of society. As
such, argument is a process based on evidence and reasoning that leads to explanations acceptable by the
scientific community and design solutions acceptable by the engineering community.
Argument in science goes beyond reaching agreements in explanations and design solutions. Whether
investigating a phenomenon, testing a design, or constructing a model to provide a mechanism for an
explanation, students are expected to use argumentation to listen to, compare, and evaluate competing
ideas and methods based on their merits. Scientists and engineers engage in argumentation when
investigating a phenomenon, testing a design solution, resolving questions about measurements, building
data models, and using evidence to evaluate claims.

Practice 8  Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information
Any education in science and engineering needs to develop students’ ability to read and
produce domain-specific text. As such, every science or engineering lesson is in part a
language lesson, particularly reading and producing the genres of texts that are intrinsic
to science and engineering. (NRC Framework, 2012, p. 76)

Being able to read, interpret, and produce scientific and technical text are fundamental practices of
science and engineering, as is the ability to communicate clearly and persuasively. Being a critical
consumer of information about science and engineering requires the ability to read or view reports of
scientific or technological advances or applications (whether found in the press, the Internet, or in a town
meeting) and to recognize the salient ideas, identify sources of error and methodological flaws,
distinguish observations from inferences, arguments from explanations, and claims from evidence.
Scientists and engineers employ multiple sources to obtain information used to evaluate the merit and
validity of claims, methods, and designs. Communicating information, evidence, and ideas can be done in
multiple ways:  using tables, diagrams, graphs, models, interactive displays, and equations as well as
orally, in writing, and through extended discussions.

Reflecting on the Practices of Science and Engineering
Engaging students in the practices of science and engineering outlined in this section is not
sufficient for science literacy. It is also important for students to stand back and reflect on how
these practices have contributed to their own development, and to the accumulation of scientific
knowledge and engineering accomplishments over the ages. Accomplishing this is a matter for
curriculum and instruction, rather than standards, so specific guidelines are not provided in this
document. Nonetheless, this section would not be complete without an acknowledgment that
reflection is essential if students are to become aware of themselves as competent and confident
learners and doers in the realms of science and engineering.

Analyzing and Interpreting
Data

Scientific investigations produce data that must be analyzed in order to derive meaning. Because data patterns and trends are not always obvious, scientists use a range of tools—including tabulation, graphical interpretation, visualization, and statistical analysis—to identify the significant features and patterns in the data. Scientists identify sources of error in the investigations and calculate the degree of certainty in the results.
Modern technology makes the collection of large data sets much easier, providing secondary sources for analysis.

Engineering investigations include analysis of data collected in the tests of designs. This allows comparison of different solutions and determines how well each meets specific design criteria—that is, which design best solves the problem within given constraints.
Like scientists, engineers require a range of tools to identify patterns within data and interpret the results. Advances in science make analysis of proposed solutions more efficient and effective.
Analyzing data in K–2 builds on prior experiences and progresses to collecting, recording, and sharing observations.

Analyzing data in 3–5 builds on
K–2 experiences and progresses to introducing quantitative approaches to collecting data and conducting multiple trials of qualitative observations.
When possible and feasible, digital tools should be used.
Analyzing data in 6–8 builds on K–5 experiences and progresses to extending quantitative analysis to investigations, distinguishing between correlation and causation, and basic statistical techniques of data and error analysis.

Analyzing data in 9–12 builds on K–8 experiences and progresses to introducing more detailed statistical analysis, the comparison of data sets for consistency, and the use of models to generate and analyze data.

Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking

In both science and engineering, mathematics and computation are fundamental tools for representing physical variables and their relationships. They are used for a range of tasks such as constructing simulations; solving equations exactly or approximately; and recognizing, expressing, and applying quantitative relationships.

Mathematical and computational approaches enable scientists and engineers to predict the behavior of systems and test the validity of such predictions.

Mathematical and computational thinking in K–2 builds on prior experience and progresses to recognizing that mathematics can be used to describe the natural and designed world(s).

Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions

The end-products of science are explanations and the end products of engineering are solutions.

The goal of science is the construction of theories that provide explanatory accounts of the world. A theory becomes accepted when it has multiple lines of empirical evidence and greater explanatory power of phenomena than previous theories.

The goal of engineering design is to find a systematic solution to problems that is based on scientific knowledge and models of the material world. Each proposed solution results from a process of balancing competing criteria of desired functions, technical feasibility, cost, safety, aesthetics, and compliance with legal requirements. The optimal choice depends on how well the proposed solutions meet criteria and constraints.
Constructing explanations and designing solutions in K–2 builds on prior experiences and progresses to the use of evidence and ideas in constructing evidence-based accounts of  natural phenomena and designing solutions.

Constructing explanations and designing solutions in 3–5 builds on K–2 experiences and progresses to the use of evidence in constructing explanations that specify variables that describe and predict phenomena and in designing multiple solutions to design problems.

Engaging in Argument from
Evidence

Argumentation is the process by which evidence-based conclusions and solutions are reached.

In science and engineering, reasoning and argument based on evidence are essential to identifying the best explanation for a natural phenomenon or the best solution to a design problem.

Scientists and engineers use argumentation to listen to, compare, and evaluate competing ideas and methods based on merits.

Scientists and engineers engage in argumentation when investigating a phenomenon, testing a design solution, resolving questions about measurements, building data models, and using evidence to evaluate claims.
Engaging in argument from evidence in K–2 builds on prior experiences and progresses to comparing ideas and representations about the natural and designed world(s).

Engaging in argument from evidence in 3–5 builds on K–2 experiences and progresses to critiquing the scientific explanations or solutions proposed by peers by citing relevant evidence about the natural and designed world(s).

Engaging in argument from evidence in 6–8 builds on K–5 experiences and progresses to constructing a convincing argument that supports or refutes claims for either explanations or solutions about the natural and designed world(s).

Engaging in argument from evidence in 9–12 builds on K–8 experiences and progresses to using appropriate and sufficient evidence and scientific reasoning to defend and critique claims and explanations about the natural and designed world(s). Arguments may also come from current scientific or historical episodes in science.
