{# Template for PDF extraction with GPT-4 Vision #}
Extract all text from this image of page {{ page_number }} of a PDF document. Follow these specific instructions:

1. Extract ALL visible text from the image, including:
   - Main body text
   - Headers and footers
   - Page numbers
   - Table contents
   - Figure captions
   - Footnotes and endnotes
   - Sidebar text
   - References and citations

2. Maintain the original formatting structure as closely as possible:
   - Preserve paragraph breaks
   - Maintain heading levels (indicated with # for Markdown)
   - Preserve bullet points and numbered lists
   - Keep table structure using Markdown table format when possible

3. For tables:
   - If the table is complex, try to maintain its structure using Markdown table syntax
   - If that's not possible, describe the table structure briefly and extract all text content

4. For mathematical equations and formulas:
   - Render using LaTeX notation inside $ $ delimiters when possible
   - If the equation is complex, describe it briefly

5. For special content:
   - Clearly label footnotes as [Footnote: ...]
   - Indicate page numbers as [Page X]
   - Mark figure captions as [Figure: ...]

6. Error correction:
   - Fix obvious OCR errors
   - Correct hyphenation issues at line breaks
   - Join words split across lines

7. Return ONLY the extracted text content.
   - Do NOT include explanations, descriptions, or commentary about the extraction process
   - Do NOT include placeholders for images or other non-text elements beyond brief labels
   - Do NOT include your own analysis of the content

8. Special instructions:
{% if config.preserve_page_boundaries %}
   - Start the extraction with "=== Page {{ page_number }} ===" to clearly mark page boundaries
{% endif %}
{% if config.extract_columns %}
   - Handle multi-column layouts by extracting text from left to right, column by column
{% endif %}
{% if config.handle_rotated_text %}
   - Extract any rotated or sideways text, noting its orientation
{% endif %}
{% if config.extract_tables_only %}
   - Focus on extracting tables and their data, minimizing extraction of body text
{% endif %}

Return only the extracted text, formatted cleanly and ready for use.
