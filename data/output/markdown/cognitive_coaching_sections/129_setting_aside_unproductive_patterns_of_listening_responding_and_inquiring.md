## Setting Aside Unproductive Patterns of Listening, Responding, and Inquiring

In trying to really listen, I have often been inspired by the Zen Master Suzuki-roshi, who said: 'If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything; it is open to everything. In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities.'

-Sogyal Rinpoche

Mediators monitor and manage their own listening skills by devoting their mental energies to the other person's verbal and nonverbal communications. To listen with such intensity requires holding in abeyance certain normal, tempting, but unproductive behaviors that might interfere with the ability to hear and understand a colleague. These are normal ways that human beings listen, but as a coach, one must discipline oneself to set them aside because they interfere with mediating thinking. For example:

Autobiographical listening occurs when the brain exercises its

associative powers and the colleague's story stimulates the coach to think of her own experiences. Derber (1979) refers to this as narcissistic listening. If a colleague mentions recent automobile repairs, and, reminded of your car's most recent breakdown, you talk about that, you are engaging in autobiographical listening. Coaches set this type of listening aside as soon as they become aware that their attention has drifted into their own story. Besides being distracting, autobiographical listening may stimulate judgment in which negative or positive experiences prejudice listening. Autobiographical listening may also stimulate comparison, in which comparing the situations can further distract the coach. Finally, autobiographical listening may spark immersion, in which we are lost in attentiveness to our own story.

Inquisitive listening occurs when we begin to get curious about and delve into portions of the story that are not relevant to the problem at hand. Knowing what information is important is one critical distinction between consulting and coaching. As a consultant, a person needs lots of information in order to 'solve the problem.' As a coach, a person needs only to understand the colleague's perspective, feelings, and goals and how to pose questions that support self-directed learning. Scrutinizing is also a by-product of inquisitive listening. With scrutinizing, curiosity about that which is not relevant to the mediational moment sinks the conversation into a hole of analytical minutiae that may cause a coach and colleague to lose sight of the larger issue.

Mind reading is sometimes a by-product of inquisitive listening. With mind reading, we try to figure out what someone is really thinking and feeling. Mind reading does not allow us to pay sufficient attention to what a partner is saying.

Solution listening is what we have a tendency to do when we serve as problem solvers for another person. Because we may view ourselves as experienced and successful problem solvers, ready with help and eager to give suggestions, we immediately begin searching for the right solution to a problem. When coaching, however, thinking of solution approaches as your colleague speaks interferes with understanding the situation from the colleague's perspective. It also interferes with formulating mediational moves.

Filtering is often a by-product of solution listening in which we listen to some things and not to others, paying attention only to those ideas that support the solution approach we are developing. This is a common problem for physicians, who must work hard to stay open to possibilities during the early stages of diagnostic visits with a patient. Rehearsing, too,

can be a by-product of solution listening, as our attention gets focused on preparing and crafting the way that we are going to present a solution.
