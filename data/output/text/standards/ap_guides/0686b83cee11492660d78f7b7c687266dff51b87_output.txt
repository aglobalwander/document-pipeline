AP Equity and Access Policy
College Board strongly encourages educators to make equitable access a guiding
principle for their AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared
students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination
of barriers that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and
socioeconomic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented. Schools
should make every effort to ensure their AP classes reflect the diversity of their
student population. College Board also believes that all students should have
access to academically challenging course work before they enroll in AP classes,
which can prepare them for AP success. It is only through a commitment to
equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.

AP Calculus AB and BC Course and Exam Description
About AP
College Board’s Advanced Placement® Program (AP®)
enables willing and academically prepared students
to pursue college-level studies—with the opportunity to earn college credit, advanced placement, or
both—while still in high school. Through AP courses in 38 subjects, each culminating in a challenging
exam, students learn to think critically, construct solid arguments, and see many sides of an issue—skills
that prepare them for college and beyond. Taking AP
courses demonstrates to college admission officers that students have sought the most challenging
curriculum available to them, and research indicates
that students who score a 3 or higher on an AP Exam typically experience greater academic success in
college and are more likely to earn a college degree than non-AP students. Each AP teacher’s syllabus is evaluated and approved by faculty from some of
the nation’s leading colleges and universities, and AP
Exams are developed and scored by college faculty and
experienced AP teachers. Most four-year colleges and
universities in the United States grant credit, advanced placement, or both on the basis of successful AP
Exam scores—more than 3,300 institutions worldwide annually receive AP scores.
AP Course Development
In an ongoing effort to maintain alignment with best
practices in college-level learning, AP courses and exams emphasize challenging, research-based
curricula aligned with higher education expectations.
Individual teachers are responsible for designing their
own curriculum for AP courses, selecting appropriate
college-level readings, assignments, and resources.
This course and exam description presents the content
and skills that are the focus of the corresponding
college course and that appear on the AP Exam. It also
organizes the content and skills into a series of units that represent a sequence found in widely adopted college textbooks and that many AP teachers have
told us they follow in order to focus their instruction.
The intention of this publication is to respect teachers’
time and expertise by providing a roadmap that they
can modify and adapt to their local priorities and
preferences. Moreover, by organizing the AP course
content and skills into units, the AP Program is able
to provide teachers and students with free formative assessments—Personal Progress Checks—that
teachers can assign throughout the year to measure
student progress as they acquire content knowledge and develop skills.
Enrolling Students:
Equity and Access
College Board strongly encourages educators to
make equitable access a guiding principle for their
AP programs by giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP. We encourage the elimination of barriers
that restrict access to AP for students from ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups that have been
traditionally underserved. College Board also believes
that all students should have access to academically challenging coursework before they enroll in AP
classes, which can prepare them for AP success. It is
only through a commitment to equitable preparation and access that true equity and excellence can be achieved.
Offering AP Courses:
The AP Course Audit
The AP Program unequivocally supports the principle
that each school implements its own curriculum that will
enable students to develop the content understandings and skills described in the course framework.
While the unit sequence represented in this publication
is optional, the AP Program does have a short list of curricular and resource requirements that must be
fulfilled before a school can label a course “Advanced
Placement” or “AP.” Schools wishing to offer AP
courses must participate in the AP Course Audit, a
process through which AP teachers’ course materials
are reviewed by college faculty. The AP Course Audit
was created to provide teachers and administrators with clear guidelines on curricular and resource
requirements for AP courses and to help colleges and
universities validate courses marked “AP” on students’
transcripts. This process ensures that AP teachers’
courses meet or exceed the curricular and resource
expectations that college and secondary school faculty have established for college-level courses.
﻿ V.1 | 1

=== Page 9 ===
AP Calculus AB and BC Course and Exam Description
Return to Table of Contents © 2020 College Board
The AP Course Audit form is submitted by the AP teacher
and the school principal (or designated administrator) to
confirm awareness and understanding of the curricular
and resource requirements. A syllabus or course outline,
detailing how course requirements are met, is submitted by the AP teacher for review by college faculty.
Please visit collegeboard.org/apcourseaudit for more
information to support the preparation and submission of materials for the AP Course Audit.
How the AP Program
Is Developed
The scope of content for an AP course and exam is
derived from an analysis of hundreds of syllabi and
course offerings of colleges and universities. Using
this research and data, a committee of college faculty and expert AP teachers work within the scope of
the corresponding college course to articulate what students should know and be able to do upon the completion of the AP course. The resulting course framework is the heart of this course and exam
description and serves as a blueprint of the content and skills that can appear on an AP Exam.
The AP Test Development Committees are responsible for developing each AP Exam, ensuring the exam
questions are aligned to the course framework. The AP
Exam development process is a multiyear endeavor; all
AP Exams undergo extensive review, revision, piloting,
and analysis to ensure that questions are accurate, fair,
and valid, and that there is an appropriate spread of difficulty across the questions.
Committee members are selected to represent a variety
of perspectives and institutions (public and private,
small and large schools and colleges), and a range of
gender, racial/ethnic, and regional groups. A list of each subject’s current AP Test Development Committee
members is available on apcentral.collegeboard.org.
Throughout AP course and exam development, College
Board gathers feedback from various stakeholders in both secondary schools and higher education
institutions. This feedback is carefully considered to
ensure that AP courses and exams are able to provide
students with a college-level learning experience and
the opportunity to demonstrate their qualifications for advanced placement or college credit.
How AP Exams Are Scored
The exam scoring process, like the course and exam development process, relies on the expertise of
both AP teachers and college faculty. While multiple choice questions are scored by machine, the free response questions and through-course performance
assessments, as applicable, are scored by thousands
of college faculty and expert AP teachers. Most are
scored at the annual AP Reading, while a small portion
is scored online. All AP Readers are thoroughly trained,
and their work is monitored throughout the Reading
for fairness and consistency. In each subject, a highly respected college faculty member serves as Chief
Faculty Consultant and, with the help of AP Readers
in leadership positions, maintains the accuracy of
the scoring standards. Scores on the free-response
questions and performance assessments are weighted
and combined with the results of the computer-scored multiple-choice questions, and this raw score is
converted into a composite AP score on a 1–5 scale.
AP Exams are not norm-referenced or graded on a curve.
Instead, they are criterion-referenced, which means that
every student who meets the criteria for an AP score of
2, 3, 4, or 5 will receive that score, no matter how many
students that is. The criteria for the number of points
students must earn on the AP Exam to receive scores
of 3, 4, or 5—the scores that research consistently
validates for credit and placement purposes—include:
§§ The number of points successful college students earn when their professors administer AP Exam questions to them.
§§ The number of points researchers have found to
be predictive that an AP student will succeed when
placed into a subsequent higher-level college course.
§§ Achievement-level descriptions formulated by college faculty who review each AP Exam question.
Using and Interpreting AP Scores
The extensive work done by college faculty and AP teachers in the development of the course and exam and throughout the scoring process ensures
that AP Exam scores accurately represent students’
achievement in the equivalent college course. Frequent
and regular research studies establish the validity of AP
scores as follows:
AP Score

College Grade
Equivalent 5
Extremely well qualified
A 4

AP Calculus AB and BC Course and Exam Description
While colleges and universities are responsible for
setting their own credit and placement policies, most
private colleges and universities award credit and/
or advanced placement for AP scores of 3 or higher.
Additionally, most states in the U.S. have adopted
statewide credit policies that ensure college credit for
scores of 3 or higher at public colleges and universities.
To confirm a specific college’s AP credit/placement
policy, a search engine is available at apstudent.
collegeboard.org/creditandplacement/search credit-policies.
BECOMING AN AP READER
Each June, thousands of AP teachers and college faculty members from around the world gather for
seven days in multiple locations to evaluate and score
the free-response sections of the AP Exams. Ninety eight percent of surveyed educators who took part in the AP Reading say it was a positive experience.
There are many reasons to consider becoming an AP
Reader, including opportunities to:
§§ Bring positive changes to the classroom:
Surveys show that the vast majority of returning
AP Readers—both high school and college educators—make improvements to the way they teach or score because of their experience at the
AP Reading.
§§ Gain in-depth understanding of AP Exam and AP
scoring standards: AP Readers gain exposure to the quality and depth of the responses from the
entire pool of AP Exam takers, and thus are better
able to assess their students’ work in the classroom.
§§ Receive compensation: AP Readers are compensated for their work during the Reading.
Expenses, lodging, and meals are covered for Readers who travel.
§§ Score from home: AP Readers have online distributed scoring opportunities for certain subjects. Check collegeboard.org/apreading for details.
§§ Earn Continuing Education Units (CEUs): AP
Readers earn professional development hours and CEUs that can be applied to PD requirements by states, districts, and schools.
How to Apply

AP Resources and Supports
By completing a simple activation process at the start of the school year, teachers and
students receive access to a robust set of classroom resources.
AP Classroom
AP Classroom is a dedicated online platform designed to support teachers and students
throughout their AP experience. The platform provides a variety of powerful resources and
tools to provide yearlong support to teachers and enable students to receive meaningful feedback on their progress.
UNIT GUIDES
Appearing in this publication and on AP Classroom, these planning guides outline all required
course content and skills, organized into commonly taught units. Each unit guide suggests a
sequence and pacing of content, scaffolds skill instruction across units, organizes content
into topics, and provides tips on taking the AP Exam.
PERSONAL PROGRESS CHECKS
Formative AP questions for every unit provide feedback to students on the areas where they
need to focus. Available online, Personal Progress Checks measure knowledge and skills
through multiple-choice questions with rationales to explain correct and incorrect answers,
and free-response questions with scoring information. Because the Personal Progress
Checks are formative, the results of these assessments cannot be used to evaluate teacher
effectiveness or assign letter grades to students, and any such misuses are grounds for losing school authorization to offer AP courses.*
PROGRESS DASHBOARD
This dashboard allows teachers to review class and individual student progress throughout
the year. Teachers can view class trends and see where students struggle with content and
skills that will be assessed on the AP Exam. Students can view their own progress over time to improve their performance before the AP Exam.
AP QUESTION BANK
This online library of real AP Exam questions provides teachers with secure questions to use
in their classrooms. Teachers can find questions indexed by course topics and skills, create
customized tests, and assign them online or on paper. These tests enable students to practice and get feedback on each question.
* To report misuses, please call, 877-274-6474 (International: 212-632-1781).

Digital Activation
In order to teach an AP class and make sure students are registered to take the AP Exam,
teachers must first complete the digital activation process. Digital activation gives students
and teachers access to resources and gathers students’ exam registration information online,
eliminating most of the answer sheet bubbling that has added to testing time and fatigue.
AP teachers and students begin by signing in to My AP and completing a simple activation
process at the start of the school year, which provides access to all AP resources, including
AP Classroom.
To complete digital activation:
§§ Teachers and students sign in to or create their College Board accounts.
§§ Teachers confirm that they have added the course they teach to their AP Course Audit
account and have had it approved by their school’s administrator.
§§ Teachers or AP Coordinators, depending on who the school has decided is responsible,
set up class sections so students can access AP resources and have exams ordered on their behalf.
§§ Students join class sections with a join code provided by their teacher or AP Coordinator.
§§ Students will be asked for additional registration information upon joining their first class
section, which eliminates the need for extensive answer sheet bubbling on exam day.
While the digital activation process takes a short time for teachers, students, and AP Coordinators
to complete, overall it helps save time and provides the following additional benefits:
§§ Access to AP resources and supports: Teachers have access to resources specifically
designed to support instruction and provide feedback to students throughout the school year as soon as activation is complete.
§§ Streamlined exam ordering: AP Coordinators can create exam orders from the same
online class rosters that enable students to access resources. The coordinator reviews,
updates, and submits this information as the school’s exam order in the fall.
§§ Student registration labels: For each student included in an exam order, schools will
receive a set of personalized AP ID registration labels, which replaces the AP student pack.
The AP ID connects a student’s exam materials with the registration information they
provided during digital activation, eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions and reducing time spent bubbling on exam day.
§§ Targeted Instructional Planning Reports: AP teachers will get Instructional Planning
Reports (IPRs) that include data on each of their class sections automatically rather than
relying on special codes optionally bubbled in on exam day.

Instructional Model
Integrating AP resources throughout the course can help students develop skills and
conceptual understandings. The instructional model outlined below shows possible ways to incorporate AP resources into the classroom.
Plan
Teachers may consider the following approaches as they plan their instruction before teaching each unit.
§§ Review the overview at the start of each unit guide to identify essential questions,
conceptual understandings, and skills for each unit.
§§ Use the Unit at a Glance table to identify related topics that build toward a common
understanding, and then plan appropriate pacing for students.
§§ Identify useful strategies in the Instructional Approaches section to help teach the concepts and skills.
Teach
When teaching, supporting resources could be used to build students’ conceptual understanding and their mastery of skills.
§§ Use the topic pages in the unit guides to identify the required content.
§§ Integrate the content with a skill, considering any appropriate scaffolding.
§§ Employ any of the instructional strategies previously identified.
§§ Use the available resources on the topic pages to bring a variety of assets into the classroom.
Assess
Teachers can measure student understanding of the content and skills covered in the unit and provide actionable feedback to students.
§§ At the end of each unit, use AP Classroom to assign students the online Personal
Progress Checks, as homework or an in-class task.
§§ Provide question-level feedback to students through answer rationales; provide unit- and
skill-level feedback using the progress dashboard.
§§ Create additional practice opportunities using the AP Question Bank and assign them through AP Classroom.

AP Calculus AB and BC Course and Exam Description
About the AP Calculus
AB and BC Courses
AP Calculus AB and AP Calculus BC focus on students’ understanding of calculus concepts
and provide experience with methods and applications. Through the use of big ideas of
calculus (e.g., modeling change, approximation and limits, and analysis of functions), each
course becomes a cohesive whole, rather than a collection of unrelated topics. Both courses
require students to use definitions and theorems to build arguments and justify conclusions.
The courses feature a multirepresentational approach to calculus, with concepts, results, and
problems expressed graphically, numerically, analytically, and verbally. Exploring connections
among these representations builds understanding of how calculus applies limits to develop
important ideas, definitions, formulas, and theorems. A sustained emphasis on clear
communication of methods, reasoning, justifications, and conclusions is essential. Teachers
and students should regularly use technology to reinforce relationships among functions, to
confirm written work, to implement experimentation, and to assist in interpreting results.
College Course Equivalent
AP Calculus AB is designed to be the equivalent of a first semester college calculus course
devoted to topics in differential and integral calculus. AP Calculus BC is designed to be the
equivalent to both first and second semester college calculus courses. AP Calculus BC
applies the content and skills learned in AP Calculus AB to parametrically defined curves,
polar curves, and vector-valued functions; develops additional integration techniques and
applications; and introduces the topics of sequences and series.
Prerequisites
Before studying calculus, all students should complete the equivalent of four years of
secondary mathematics designed for college-bound students: courses that should
prepare them with a strong foundation in reasoning with algebraic symbols and working
with algebraic structures. Prospective calculus students should take courses in which they
study algebra, geometry, trigonometry, analytic geometry, and elementary functions. These
functions include linear, polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, inverse
trigonometric, and piecewise-defined functions. In particular, before studying calculus,
students must be familiar with the properties of functions, the composition of functions, the
algebra of functions, and the graphs of functions.
Students must also understand the language of functions (domain and range, odd and even,
periodic, symmetry, zeros, intercepts, and descriptors such as increasing and decreasing).
Students should also know how the sine and cosine functions are defined from the unit circle
and know the values of the trigonometric functions at the numbers 0, , , , 6 4 3 2 π π π π , and their
multiples. Students who take AP Calculus BC should have basic familiarity with sequences and
series, as well as some exposure to parametric and polar equations.

Introduction
The course frameworks for AP Calculus AB and AP Calculus BC define content students must know and skills
students must master in order to earn transferable, long-term understandings of calculus. The frameworks reflect
a commitment to what college faculty value and mirror the curricula in corresponding college courses. Teachers
may adjust the frameworks to meet state and local requirements.
The frameworks are organized into logical sequences, based on teacher input and commonly used textbooks.
These sequences represent one reasonable learning pathway for each course, among many. Teachers may adjust
the suggested sequencing of units or topics, although they will want to carefully consider how to account for
such changes as they access course resources for planning, instruction, and assessment.
Balancing guidance and flexibility, this approach helps to prepare students for college credit and placement.

The course framework includes two essential components:
1   MATHEMATICAL PRACTICES
The mathematical practices are central to the study and practice of
calculus. Students should develop and apply the described skills on a regular basis over the span of the course.
2   COURSE CONTENT
The course content is organized into commonly taught units of
study that provide a suggested sequence for the course. These units
comprise the content and conceptual understandings that colleges
and universities typically expect students to master to qualify for
college credit and/or placement. This content is grounded in big ideas,
which are cross-cutting concepts that build conceptual understanding and spiral throughout the course.

Mathematical
Practices
The AP Calculus AB and BC mathematical practices describe what a student
should be able to do while exploring course concepts. The table that follows
presents these practices, which students should develop during the AP Calculus
AB and AP Calculus BC courses. These practices are categorized into skills, which form the basis of the tasks on the AP Exam.
The unit guides later in this publication embed and spiral these skills throughout
the course, providing teachers with one way to integrate the skills in the course
content with sufficient repetition to prepare students to transfer those skills
when taking the AP Exam. Course content may be paired with a variety of skills on the AP Exam.
More detailed information about teaching the mathematical practices can be

Course
Content
Based on the Understanding by Design® (Wiggins and McTighe) model, this
course framework provides a clear and detailed description of the course
requirements necessary for student success. The framework specifies what
students must know, be able to do, and understand, with a focus on big ideas
that encompass core principles, theories, and processes of the discipline. The
framework also encourages instruction that prepares students for advanced
coursework in mathematics or other fields engaged in modeling change (e.g.,
pure sciences, engineering, or economics) and for creating useful, reasonable
solutions to problems encountered in an ever-changing world.
Big Ideas
The big ideas serve as the foundation of the course and allow students to create
meaningful connections among concepts. They are often abstract concepts
or themes that become threads that run throughout the course. Revisiting the
big ideas and applying them in a variety of contexts allows students to develop
deeper conceptual understanding. Below are the big ideas of the course and a brief description of each.
2
BIG IDEA 1: CHANGE (CHA)
Using derivatives to describe rates of change of one variable with respect
to another or using definite integrals to describe the net change in one
variable over an interval of another allows students to understand change
in a variety of contexts. It is critical that students grasp the relationship
between integration and differentiation as expressed in the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus—a central idea in AP Calculus.
BIG IDEA 2: LIMITS (LIM)
Beginning with a discrete model and then considering the consequences of
a limiting case allows us to model real-world behavior and to discover and
understand important ideas, definitions, formulas, and theorems in calculus:
for example, continuity, differentiation, integration, and series bc only.
BIG IDEA 3: ANALYSIS OF FUNCTIONS (FUN)
Calculus allows us to analyze the behaviors of functions by relating limits
to differentiation, integration, and infinite series and relating each of these concepts to the others.

UNITS
The course content is organized into commonly
taught units. The units have been arranged in a logical sequence frequently found in many college courses and textbooks.
The eight units in AP Calculus AB and ten units in
AP Calculus BC, and their weighting on the multiple choice section of the AP Exam, are listed on the following page.
Pacing recommendations at the unit level and on
the Course at a Glance provide suggestions for how teachers can teach the required course content and administer the Personal Progress Checks.
The suggested class periods are based on a schedule in which the class meets five days a week for 45 minutes each day. While these recommendations have been made to aid planning, teachers are of
course free to adjust the pacing based on the needs
of their students, alternate schedules (e.g., block scheduling), or their school’s academic calendar.
TOPICS
Each unit is broken down into teachable segments
called topics. The topic pages (starting on p. 35)
contain the required content for each topic. Although
most topics can be taught in one or two class periods,
teachers should pace the course to suit the needs of their students and school.

Introduction
Designed with extensive input from the community of AP Calculus AB and
AP Calculus BC educators, the unit guides offer teachers helpful guidance
in building students’ skills and knowledge. The suggested sequence was
identified through a thorough analysis of the syllabi of highly effective
AP teachers and the organization of typical college textbooks.
This unit structure respects new AP teachers’ time by providing one
possible sequence they can adopt or modify rather than having to
build from scratch. An additional benefit is that these units enable the
AP Program to provide interested teachers with formative assessments—
the Personal Progress Checks—that they can assign their students at
the end of each unit to gauge progress toward success on the AP Exam.
However, experienced AP teachers who are satisfied with their current
course organization and exam results should feel no pressure to adopt
these units, which comprise an optional sequence for this course.

UNIT OPENERS
Developing Understanding provides an overview that
contextualizes and situates the key content of the unit within the scope of the course.
The big ideas serve as the foundation of the course and help
develop understanding as they spiral throughout the course.
The essential questions are thought-provoking questions that motivate students and inspire inquiry.
Building the Mathematical Practices describes specific skills
within the practices that are appropriate to focus on in that unit.
Certain practices have been noted to indicate areas of emphasis for that unit.
Preparing for the AP Exam provides helpful tips and common
student misunderstandings identified from prior exam data.
Building the
Mathematical Practices
2.B
2.C
3.C
3.D
Mathematical information may be organized or presented graphically, numerically, analytically, or verbally. Mathematicians must be able to communicate effectively in all of these contexts and transition seamlessly from one representation to another. Limits lay the groundwork for students’ ongoing development of skills associated with taking what is presented in a table, an equation, or a sentence and translating that information into a graph (or vice versa). Help students explicitly practice matching different representations that show the same information, focusing on building their comfort level with translating analytical and verbal representations. This will be instrumental to their development of proficiency in this practice. The use of graphing calculators to help students explore these connections is strongly encouraged.
Mathematicians also explain reasoning and justify conclusions using definitions, theorems, and tests. A common student misunderstanding is that they don’t need to write relevant given information before drawing the conclusion of a theorem.
In Unit 1, students should be given explicit instruction and time to practice “connecting the dots” by first demonstrating that all conditions or hypotheses have been met and then drawing the conclusion.
Preparing for the AP Exam
This course is a full-year experience building toward mastery assessed using the AP Exam.
Therefore, it is important to consider both specific content and skills related to each unit and to build a coherent understanding of the whole. After studying Unit 1, students should be prepared to evaluate or estimate limits presented graphically, numerically, analytically, or verbally. To avoid missed opportunities to earn points on the AP Exam, students should consistently practice using correct mathematical notation and presenting set ups and appropriately rounded answers when using a calculator. Two sections of the exam do not allow calculator use. Some questions on the other two sections require it. From the first unit onward, emphasize the importance of hypotheses for theorems. Explore why each hypothesis is needed in order to ensure that the conclusion follows. Students should
establish the practice of explicitly verifying that a theorem’s hypotheses are satisfied before applying the theorem.
Developing Understanding
Limits introduce the subtle distinction between evaluating a function at a point and considering
what value the function is approaching, if any, as x approaches a point. This distinction allows us
to extend understanding of asymptotes and holes in graphs with formal definitions of continuity.
Consider reviewing rational functions when introducing limits, rather than beginning the year with
a full review of precalculus topics. Limits are the foundation for differentiation (Unit 2), integration
(Unit 6), and infinite series (Unit 10) bc only. They are the basis for important definitions and for
theorems that are used to solve realistic problems involving change and to justify conclusions.

column has been left blank so that teachers can customize the time they spend on each topic.
The suggested skills for each topic show possible ways to
link the content in that topic to specific AP Calculus AB and/or

in a way that scaffolds the skills throughout the course. The
questions on the Personal Progress Checks are based on this
pairing. However, AP Exam questions can pair the content with any of the skills.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples
below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways
that they approach teaching some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional
Approaches section beginning on p. 199 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 1.2
Notation Read Aloud
Begin by writing a limit expression in analytical form (e.g., x lim x 0 3 →− ), and then read the
expression aloud to the class: “The limit of x cubed as x approaches 0 from the left.”
Do the same for 1–2 additional examples that use a variety of limit notations (e.g., the
symbol for infinity). Then have students pair up and take turns reading aloud different limit expressions to one another.
2 1.3 1.4
Create Representations
Present students with a limit expression in analytical form (e.g., x x lim 9 3 x 3 2 − − → ),
and then have them translate that expression into a variety of representations:
constructing a graph, creating a table of values, and writing it as a verbal expression.
Then have students check their graphs and tables using technology.
3 1.7
Work Backward
Present students with a set of limit problems. Rather than determining the given limits,
have them make a list of the various strategies that would be used to determine the limits
(e.g., factoring, multiplying by conjugate, and simplify using trigonometric identities). After
confirming their list is complete, have students work in pairs to create and write limit
problems, each requiring one of the listed strategies. Then have them swap problems
with another pair of students to complete each other’s problems.
4 1.11
Discussion Groups
Give each group of students a piecewise-defined function, a graph paper, and a
list of x-values. Have them graph the function, then discuss whether the function is
continuous or discontinuous at each x-value, and explain why. Ask students to take
turns recording the group’s conclusion for each x-value. If continuous, have students
discuss and show that all three continuity conditions are satisfied. If discontinuous,
have students state which condition was not satisfied.
5 1.16
Think Aloud
In small groups, have students discuss the Intermediate Value Theorem and share
ideas about real-world applications (e.g., speed of your car and weight of your kitten).
Have groups post their ideas on a classroom wall using sticky notes.

This will be instrumental to their development of proficiency in this practice. The use of graphing calculators to help students explore these connections is strongly encouraged.
Mathematicians also explain reasoning and justify conclusions using definitions, theorems, and tests. A common student misunderstanding is that they don’t need to write relevant given information before drawing the conclusion of a theorem.
In Unit 1, students should be given explicit instruction and time to practice “connecting the dots” by first demonstrating that all conditions or hypotheses have been met and then drawing the conclusion.
Preparing for the AP Exam
This course is a full-year experience building toward mastery assessed using the AP Exam.
Therefore, it is important to consider both specific content and skills related to each unit and to build a coherent understanding of the whole. After studying Unit 1, students should be prepared to evaluate or estimate limits presented graphically, numerically, analytically, or verbally. To avoid missed opportunities to earn points on the AP Exam, students should consistently practice using correct mathematical notation and presenting set ups and appropriately rounded answers when using a calculator. Two sections of the exam do not allow calculator use. Some questions on the other two sections require it. From the first unit onward, emphasize the importance of hypotheses for theorems. Explore why each hypothesis is needed in order to ensure that the conclusion follows. Students should
establish the practice of explicitly verifying that a theorem’s hypotheses are satisfied before applying the theorem.
Developing Understanding
Limits introduce the subtle distinction between evaluating a function at a point and considering
what value the function is approaching, if any, as x approaches a point. This distinction allows us
to extend understanding of asymptotes and holes in graphs with formal definitions of continuity.
Consider reviewing rational functions when introducing limits, rather than beginning the year with
a full review of precalculus topics. Limits are the foundation for differentiation (Unit 2), integration
(Unit 6), and infinite series (Unit 10) bc only. They are the basis for important definitions and for
theorems that are used to solve realistic problems involving change and to justify conclusions.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples
below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways
that they approach teaching some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional
Approaches section beginning on p. 199 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 1.2
Notation Read Aloud
Begin by writing a limit expression in analytical form (e.g., x lim x 0 3 →− ), and then read the
expression aloud to the class: “The limit of x cubed as x approaches 0 from the left.”
Do the same for 1–2 additional examples that use a variety of limit notations (e.g., the
symbol for infinity). Then have students pair up and take turns reading aloud different limit expressions to one another.
2 1.3 1.4
Create Representations
Present students with a limit expression in analytical form (e.g., x x lim 9 3 x 3 2 − − → ),
and then have them translate that expression into a variety of representations:
constructing a graph, creating a table of values, and writing it as a verbal expression.
Then have students check their graphs and tables using technology.
3 1.7
Work Backward
Present students with a set of limit problems. Rather than determining the given limits,
have them make a list of the various strategies that would be used to determine the limits
(e.g., factoring, multiplying by conjugate, and simplify using trigonometric identities). After
confirming their list is complete, have students work in pairs to create and write limit
problems, each requiring one of the listed strategies. Then have them swap problems
with another pair of students to complete each other’s problems.
4 1.11
Discussion Groups
Give each group of students a piecewise-defined function, a graph paper, and a
list of x-values. Have them graph the function, then discuss whether the function is
continuous or discontinuous at each x-value, and explain why. Ask students to take
turns recording the group’s conclusion for each x-value. If continuous, have students
discuss and show that all three continuity conditions are satisfied. If discontinuous,
have students state which condition was not satisfied.
5 1.16
Think Aloud
In small groups, have students discuss the Intermediate Value Theorem and share
ideas about real-world applications (e.g., speed of your car and weight of your kitten).
Have groups post their ideas on a classroom wall using sticky notes.

TOPIC 1.1
Introducing Calculus:
Can Change Occur at an Instant?
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
CHA-1.A
Interpret the rate of change at an instant in terms of average rates of change over intervals containing that instant.
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
CHA-1.A.1
Calculus uses limits to understand and model dynamic change.
CHA-1.A.2
Because an average rate of change divides the change in one variable by the change in another, the average rate of change is undefined at a point where the change in the independent variable would be zero.
CHA-1.A.3
The limit concept allows us to define instantaneous rate of change in terms of average rates of change.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING

Building the
Mathematical Practices
1.E
2.B
4.C
Mathematicians know that a solution will only be as good as the procedure used to find it and that the difference between being correct and incorrect can often be traced to an arithmetic or procedural error. In other words, mathematicians know that the details matter. Students often find it difficult to apply mathematical procedures—including the rules of differentiation—with precision and accuracy. For example, students may drop important notation, such as a parenthesis, or misapply the product rule by taking the derivative of each factor separately and then multiplying those together. The content of Unit 2 is a foundational entry point for practicing the skill of applying mathematical procedures and learning to self-correct before common mistakes occur.
This is also an opportunity to revisit and reinforce the practice of connecting representations, as students will be seeing derivatives presented in analytical, numerical, graphical, and verbal representations. Students can practice by extracting information about the original function, f, from a graphical representation of f'. This can help prevent misunderstandings when examining the graph
of a derivative (such as misinterpreting it as the graph of the original function instead).
Preparing for the AP Exam
Students should practice presenting clear mathematical structures that connect their work with definitions or theorems. For example, when asked to estimate the slope of the line tangent to a curve at a given point based on information provided in a table of values, as in 2013 AP Exam Free-
Response Question 3 Part A, students must present a difference quotient:
( ) ( ) ( ) ′ ≈ − − = −
C
C
C 3.5 4 3 4 3 12.8 11.2 1 .
Failure to present this structure will cost students the point they might have earned, even with a correct numerical answer.
Similarly, to evaluate the derivative of ) ) ) ( ( ( = ⋅ f x u x v x  at = x 3, students should show the product rule structure, as in ) ) ) ) ) ( ( ( ( ( ′ = ′ + f u v v u 3 3 3 3 ' 3 , and import values. Finally, students should present mathematical expressions evaluated on the calculator and use specified rounding procedures, typically rounding or truncating to
three places after the decimal point. It is helpful to establish the habit of storing intermediate calculations in the calculator in order to avoid accumulation of rounding errors.
Developing Understanding
Derivatives allow us to determine instantaneous rates of change. To develop understanding of
how the definition of the derivative applies limits to average rates of change, create opportunities
for students to explore average rates of change over increasingly small intervals. Graphing
calculator explorations of how various operations affect slopes of tangent lines help students
to make sense of basic rules and properties of differentiation. Encourage students to apply the
order of operations as they select differentiation rules. Developing differentiation skills will allow
students to model realistic instantaneous rates of change in Unit 4 and to analyze graphs in Unit 5.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples
below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways
that they approach teaching some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional
Approaches section beginning on p. 199 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 2.1 2.2 2.3
Graph and Switch
Present students with two or three functions and the graph of each function. Have each
student choose a random derivative question and one function. Questions could include:
Find the average rate of change on an interval, instantaneous rate of change at a point,
derivative as a function, derivative value at a point, or equations for tangent or normal
lines at a point. Have students answer their question and place their answer onto the
function’s graph. Then have students share their solutions with each other to give and receive feedback.
2 2.4
Match Mine
Create cards containing graph images of functions with various continuous,
discontinuous, differentiable, and nondifferentiable points or intervals. Provide each
student in a pair with the same nine cards. Student A arranges their graphs in a 3 ë 3
grid, which is not visible to Student B. Student A describes each of their graph’s positions
using information about continuity and differentiability to describe the graph. Based on the
descriptions, Student B attempts to arrange their cards to match the grid of Student A.
3 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 2.10
Error Analysis
Assign a function to each student. Ask them to find the function’s derivative using one
or more derivative rules. Allow them to check their answers. Ask half of the class to redo
their work to include an error, thus having the wrong answer. Ask students to record their
correct or incorrect work on a card. Mix up the cards and redistribute, having students
determine if the answer is correct or incorrect. If incorrect, they should explain what error was made, and find the correct answer.
4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 2.10
Graphic Organizer
Provide students with colored paper, pens, and markers. Ask them to create a chart, a
foldable card, or other creative method to organize all the derivative rules. For each rule,
have them include the mathematical definition, examples, pictures, and helpful hints to understand and remember the rule.
5 2.8 2.9
Round Table
Provide each student with the same worksheet containing four functions that require
the product rule or quotient rule when finding the derivative. Then have students sit in
groups of four. Each student determines the derivative of function No. 1, and then they
pass their papers clockwise to the next student. Each student checks the first problem
and, if necessary, discusses any mistakes with the previous student. Each student now
completes function No. 2 on the paper, and the process continues until each student has their original paper back.

Mathematical Practices
1.C
1.E
3.G
Identifying composite and implicit functions is a key differentiation skill.  Students must recognize functions embedded in functions and be able to decompose composite functions into their “outer” and “inner” component functions. Misapplying the chain rule by forgetting to also differentiate the “inner” function or misidentifying the “inner” function are common errors. Provide sample responses that demonstrate these errors to help students be mindful of them in their own work. Reinforcing the chain rule structure sets the stage for Unit 6, when students learn the inverse of this process.
Students should continue to practice using correct notation and applying procedures accurately. Checking one another’s work, reviewing sample responses (with and without errors), and using technology to check calculations develop these skills.
Emphasize that taking higher-order derivatives mirrors familiar differentiation processes (i.e., “function is to first derivative as first derivative is to second derivative”).
Use questioning techniques such as, “What does this mean?” to help students develop a more solid conceptual understanding of higher-order differentiation.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Mastery of the chain rule and its applications is essential for success on the AP Exam. The chain rule will be the target of assessment for many questions and a necessary step along the way for others. One common error is not recognizing when the chain rule applies, especially in composite functions such as sin2x, tan (2x - 1), and ex2. In expressions like − y y x 3 2 , students must recognize that the chain rule applies to y because y depends on x. When multiple rules apply, students may struggle with the order of operations.
Offer mixed practice differentiating general functions using select values provided in tables and graphs. Focus on products, quotients, compositions, and inverses of functions, especially those with names other than f and g. Connecting graphs, tables, and algebraic reasoning builds understanding of differentiation of inverse functions.
Developing Understanding
In this unit, students learn how to differentiate composite functions using the chain rule and
apply that understanding to determine derivatives of implicit and inverse functions. Students
need to understand that for composite functions, y is a function of u while u is a function of x. Leibniz notation for the chain rule, = ⋅ dy dx dy du du dx , accounts for these relationships.
Units analysis can strengthen the connection, as in = ⋅ psi min psi m m min. Saying, “times the
derivative of what’s inside,” every time we apply the chain rule reminds students to avoid a
common error.  Mastering the chain rule is essential to success in all future units.

Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 3.1
Scavenger Hunt
Place a card with a starter question somewhere in the classroom, for example, “Find
the derivative of f (x) = sin(4x).” Place another card in the room with the solution to that
card plus another question: “Solution: 4cos(4x). Next problem: Find the derivative of
f (x) = (sin(x))4.” Continue posting solution cards with new problems until the final card
presents a problem whose solution is on the original starter card (note that this solution should be added to the starter card above).
2 3.1
Work Backward
Provide a chain rule problem with several possible answers. Have students identify
which piece of the original problem contributed its derivative to one of the factors in
the answer they are looking at. For each possible answer, students should say whether
the answer is correct. They should also identify which piece of the composition was
differentiated incorrectly or skipped, or state which factor of that particular answer did
not come from the original problem. Students often have trouble knowing when to stop
differentiating when learning ex or trigonometric functions, so make sure you include these types of problems.
3 3.2
Round Table
In groups of four, each student has an identical paper with four different problems on it.
Students complete the first problem on their paper and then pass the paper clockwise
to another member in their group. That student checks the first problem and then
completes the second problem on the paper. Students rotate again and the process
continues until each student has their own paper back.
4 3.4
Quiz-Quiz-Trade
Give students a card containing a question and have them write the answer on the
back. Students then circulate around the room and find a partner. One student quizzes
the other by showing only the side of the card with the question on it, and then they
reverse roles. They swap cards, find a new partner, quiz each other, and the process continues.

2.A
3.F
Students will begin applying concepts from
Units 2 and 3 to scenarios encountered in the world. Students often struggle to translate these verbal scenarios into the mathematical procedures necessary to answer the question.
To solve these problems, students will need explicit instruction and intentional practice identifying key information, determining which procedure applies to the scenario presented (i.e., that “rates of change” indicate differentiation), stating what is changing and how, using correct units, and explaining what their answer means in the context of the scenario. Provide scenarios with different contexts but similar procedures so students begin to recognize and apply the reasoning behind those problem-solving decisions, rather than grasping at rules haphazardly.
Students must also be able to explain how an approximated value relates to the value it’s intended to approximate. Students may not understand why they would use a tangent line approximation (i.e., linearization) rather than simply evaluating a function. Expose them to scenarios where an exact function value can’t be calculated, and then ask them to determine whether a particular approximation is an overestimate or an underestimate of the function.
Preparing for the AP Exam
With contextual problems, emphasize careful reading for language such as, “find the rate of change.” This will help students understand the underlying structure of the problem, answer the question asked, and interpret solutions in context. Students should not use words like “velocity” when they mean the rate of change in income, for example, even though the underlying structure is the same.
Emphasize that students must verify that ) ) ( ( = = → → f x g x lim lim 0 x a x a (or that both approach infinity) as a necessary first step before applying L’Hospital’s Rule to determine f x g x lim x a ( ) ( ) → . Students should understand that 0 0 or ∞ ∞ are appropriate labels for indeterminate forms but do not represent values in an equation. Therefore, it is incorrect to write f x g x lim 0 0 x a ( ) ( ) = → , for example. Note that f x g x f x g x lim lim lim x a x a x a ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ≠ → → → when g x lim 0 x a ( ) = → . Also emphasize that the conclusion of L’Hospital’s rule features the ratio of the derivatives of the numerator and denominator, respectively, rather than the derivative of the ratio.
Developing Understanding
Unit 4 begins by developing understanding of average and instantaneous rates of change in
problems involving motion. The unit then identifies differentiation as a common underlying structure
on which to build understanding of change in a variety of contexts. Students’ understanding of units
of measure often reinforces their understanding of contextual applications of differentiation. In
problems involving related rates, identifying the independent variable common to related functions
may help students to correctly apply the chain rule. When applying differentiation to determine limits
of certain indeterminate forms using L’Hospital’s rule, students must show that the rule applies.
BIG IDEA 1
Change  CHA §§ How are problems about position, velocity, and acceleration of a particle in motion over time structurally similar to problems about the volume of a rising balloon over an interval of heights, the population of London over the 14th century, or the metabolism of a dose of medicine over time?
BIG IDEA 2
Limits  LIM §§ Since certain indeterminate forms seem to actually approach a limit, how can we determine that limit, provided it exists?

Building the
Mathematical Practices
1.E
2.D
2.E  3.E
The underlying processes of finding critical points and extrema are the foundation for the justifications students will write in this unit. Students should use calculators to graph a function and its derivatives to explore the related features of these graphs and confirm the results of their calculations.
Students often struggle with misinterpreting the characteristics of the graph of a derivative as though they are characteristics of the original function. Or, they use nonspecific language that conflates different
functions (e.g., “it” rather than "f" ). To prevent ongoing misconceptions, hold students accountable for extreme precision by having them practice matching graphs of functions to their derivatives and requiring them to explain their reasons to a peer.
Students also tend to rely on insufficient evidence or descriptions in their justifications, stating, for example, that “the graph of f is increasing because it’s going up.” This happens especially when examining derivative graphs on a calculator. Model calculus-based justifications (i.e., reasoning based on analysis of a derivative) both in discussion and in writing. Give students repeated opportunities to practice writing and revising their own justifications based on teacher feedback and feedback from their peers.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Sound reasoning must be accompanied by clear communication on the AP Exam. It may be helpful for students to use the language in the question as a starting point. Suppose a question asks, “Does g  have a relative minimum, a relative maximum, or neither at = x 10? Justify your answer.” A student who writes, “g has neither a relative maximum nor a relative minimum at = x 10, because . . . ,” has begun well. Similarly, given a graph of the derivative, f', of a function, f , it is safer and easier for students to make arguments about f  based directly on the graph of the derivative, as in, “ f  is concave up on a x b < <  because the graph of f' is increasing on < < a x b.” Students should always refer to f, f', and f''  by name, rather than by “it” or “the function,” which may leave the reader unsure of their intended meaning.
Developing Understanding
In this unit, the superficial details of contextual applications of differentiation are stripped away
to focus on abstract structures and formal conclusions. Reasoning with definitions and theorems
establishes that answers and conclusions are more than conjectures; they have been analytically
determined. As when students showed supporting work for answers in previous units, students
will learn to present justifications for their conclusions about the behavior of functions over
certain intervals or the locations of extreme values or points of inflection. The unit concludes
this study of differentiation by applying abstract reasoning skills to justify solutions for realistic optimization problems.

Students often struggle with the relationship between differentiation and integration. They think that integration is simply differentiation in reverse order. However, to apply the rules of integration correctly, students must think more strategically, taking into consideration how the “pieces” fit together. Students will need explicit guidance for choosing an appropriate antidifferentiation strategy that’s based on the underlying patterns in different categories of integrands (e.g., using u-substitution when they recognize that the integrand is a factor of the derivative of a composite function or using integration by parts for an integrand, udv, that is related to a term in the derivative of the product uv bc only).
Students also struggle with relating a symbolic limit of a Riemann sum to that limit expressed as a definite integral, because of the complexity of the expressions. To help students feel more comfortable working with these expressions, use explicit strategies, such as helping students to break complex expressions into familiar components, or matching expressions for a definite integral with the limit of a Riemann sum, and vice versa.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Students should be careful applying the chain rule, both when differentiating functions defined by integrals and when integrating using u-substitution. Students will need to recognize integrands that are factors of a chain rule derivative and should practice u-substitution until the process is internalized. Students will additionally need to recognize integrands that suggest strategies such as integration by parts or partial fractions and should use mixed practice in preparation for the exam bc only.
When using a calculator to evaluate a definite integral in a free-response question, students should present the expression for the definite integral, including endpoints of integration, and an appropriately placed differential. When evaluating an integral without a calculator, students should present an appropriate antiderivative; they should include a constant of integration with indefinite integrals. As always, students should be careful about parentheses usage and should avoid writing strings of equal signs equating expressions that are not equal.
Developing Understanding
This unit establishes the relationship between differentiation and integration using the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Students begin by exploring the contextual meaning of areas
of certain regions bounded by rate functions. Integration determines accumulation of change
over an interval, just as differentiation determines instantaneous rate of change at a point.
Students should understand that integration is a limiting case of a sum of products (areas) in the
same way that differentiation is a limiting case of a quotient of differences (slopes). Future units
will apply the idea of accumulation of change to a variety of realistic and geometric applications.

SAMPLE INSTRUCTIONAL ACTIVITIES
The sample activities on this page are optional and are offered to provide possible ways to
incorporate various instructional approaches into the classroom. Teachers do not need to use
these activities or instructional approaches and are free to alter or edit them. The examples
below were developed in partnership with teachers from the AP community to share ways
that they approach teaching some of the topics in this unit. Please refer to the Instructional
Approaches section beginning on p. 199 for more examples of activities and strategies.
Activity
Topic
Sample Activity 1 6.3
Quickwrite
Present the class with several examples of definite integrals set equal to Riemann sums in summation notation, for example, x dx n ni ( 5) lim 7 2 7 5 n i n 2 5 2 1

2 ∫ ∑ + + =     −+         − →∞ = .
Ask students to take five minutes to identify and write about all common elements
between the two expressions and why they think the two expressions are equivalent.
After finishing the five minutes, ask students to share their observations with the class.
2 6.9
Look For a Pattern
Present students with several indefinite integrals and proposed, yet incorrect, antiderivatives, for example, x x d x
C 5 2 1 21 5 2 20 21 ∫( ) ( ) + = + + . Ask them to check the
antiderivatives by differentiating each and comparing to the original integrands.
As students see that each antiderivative is incorrect, ask them to identify a pattern
within the errors. Identifying this pattern will establish the foundation for integrating using substitution.
3 6.10
Odd One Out
To help students select a strategy, form groups of four, presenting each student an
indefinite integral whose integrand is rational. For each group, include one integrand
that requires long division or completing the square. Ask students to decide if their
example fits with the group. Identifying the odd one out will help students connect integrand form to the appropriate strategy.

Building the
Mathematical Practices
1.E
2.C
3.G
4.D
In this unit, students will translate mathematical information from one representation to another by matching equations and slope fields, rewriting verbal statements as differential equations, and sketching slope fields that match their symbolic representations. Provide students with explicit guidance on how to select an appropriate graphing technique. As students practice Euler’s method, encourage them to transfer skills using tangent line approximations, rather than simply memorizing an algorithm bc only.
Because the problems in this unit model real world scenarios, help students to develop proficiency in transferring the mathematical procedures they’ve learned in “x’s and y’s” to equivalent environments with variable names other than x, y, and t. Using differentiation to confirm that solutions to differential equations are accurate and appropriate also helps students to develop an understanding of what it means to say that an equation is a solution to a differential equation.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Students should practice setting up and solving contextual questions involving separable differential equations until the solution strategy becomes routine: separate variables, antidifferentiate both sides of the equation and add a constant of integration, use initial conditions to determine the constant of integration, and rearrange the resulting expression to complete the solution. Failure to separate variables or omitting the constant of integration severely limits the number of points a student can earn on the AP Exam. A common error in antidifferentiation is to assume that all differential equations involving fractions have logarithmic solutions, presumably because some do.
Students should learn to recognize the forms of differential equations resulting in exponential and logistic bc only models.
These may be used or interpreted without performing the derivation. Students should also be reminded that differential equations give us information about the derivative and may be used directly to find information about a slope or rate of change.
Developing Understanding
In this unit, students will learn to set up and solve separable differential equations. Slope fields
can be used to represent solution curves to a differential equation and build understanding
that there are infinitely many general solutions to a differential equation, varying only by
a constant of integration. Students can locate a unique solution relevant to a particular
situation, provided they can locate a point on the solution curve. By writing and solving
differential equations leading to models for exponential growth and decay and logistic growth
bc only, students build understanding of topics introduced in Algebra II and other courses.

Building the
Mathematical Practices

2.D
3.D
4.C
As in Unit 4, students will need to practice interpreting verbal scenarios, extracting relevant mathematical information, selecting an appropriate procedure, and then applying that procedure correctly and interpreting their solution in the context of the problem.
Now that students have been exposed to application problems involving both differentiation and antidifferentiation, some may struggle to determine which procedure is applicable. Walk students through different types of scenarios and explain the underlying reasons why some situations call for
differentiation while others call for integration.
This unit also involves geometric applications of integration. When using the disc and washer methods, focusing on orientation (i.e., horizontal or vertical) will help students determine whether the “thickness” is with respect to x or y. Students should practice solving variations on these calculus-based geometry problems until they can decide which variable to integrate with respect to without prompting. Relating graphical representations to symbolic representations, such as Riemann sums and definite integrals, develops these skills and helps students to master the content.
Preparing for the AP Exam
On the AP Exam, students need to identify relevant information conveyed in various representations. Key words, such as “accumulation” or “net change,” help to identify mathematical structures and corresponding solution strategies. Some students confuse the average value and the average rate of change of a function on an interval. To alleviate confusion, first provide students with average value problems accompanied by relevant graphs and guide them to an understanding of why an average value may be less than, equal to, or greater than the midpoint of the range.
Then review average rate of change problems from Unit 2 and present students with free response questions that will allow them to practice distinguishing between average value and average rate of change problems.
In free-response questions, continue to require students to show supporting work by presenting a correct expression using appropriate notation and the mathematical structures of solutions, as in
V f x g x dx 3 3 1 4 2 2 ∫ π ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) = − − −   , for example.
Developing Understanding
In this unit, students will learn how to find the average value of a function, model particle motion
and net change, and determine areas, volumes, and lengths bc only defined by the graphs of
functions. Emphasis should be placed on developing an understanding of integration that can
be transferred across these and many other applications. Understanding that the area, volume,
and length bc only problems studied in this unit are limiting cases of Riemann sums of rectangle
areas, prism volumes, or segment lengths bc only saves students from memorizing a long list of
seemingly unrelated formulas and develops meaningful understanding of integration.

Post around the room 8–10 problem cards, each of which also includes a solution to
a previous problem. Include average value problems with tables and functions; also
include tables that have values from 0 to 16, for example, but where the average value is
only on the interval from 0 to 12. Card 1 could say: Find the average value of f (x) = sin(x)
on the interval [0, π]. A second card would have the answer to that card 2 π     along with
a new question: Find the average value of f (x) = 3x2 − 3 on [1, 3]. A third card would
have that answer (10) and so on. The answer to the last card goes on top of the first card.

problem:
§§ Identify all points of intersection.
§§ Set up the integral(s).
§§ Integrate by hand.
§§ Integrate using a calculator.
Have students complete the first step on their paper, and then pass the paper
clockwise to another member in their group. That student checks the first step and
then completes the second step on the paper. Students rotate again and the process
continues until each student has their own paper back.

UNIT 9
Building the
Mathematical Practices
1.D
1.E
2.D
3.D
As students transition to parametric and vector-valued functions, they’ll need to practice previously learned concepts and skills to reinforce the new procedures and representations they’re learning in Unit 9.
As with particle motion on a line, students learning to handle motion in the plane will need to practice interpreting which procedure is needed for different scenarios (differentiation or integration) and solving for speed, velocity, distance traveled, or initial position.
Reinforce the importance of precise notation, particularly regarding the variable of differentiation, as well as correct application of the chain rule. Leibniz notation helps students to remember how to find the derivative of y with respect to x for coordinates defined using the parameter t:
dy dx dy dt dx dt dy dt = =  dt dx , provided dx dt 0 ≠.
Since dy dx is in terms of t, students must be particularly careful when determining d y dx 2 2 .
Similarly, using definite integrals to represent lengths and areas defined by polar curves is based on the same principles as calculating lengths and areas defined by the graphs of more familiar functions (i.e., the limit of a
Riemann sum). Students will need to practice with trigonometric identities, radian measures and formulas for arc length and area of a sector to reinforce practice with associated calculus topics.
Preparing for the AP Exam
While students need more experience shifting mindsets from rectangular to polar coordinate systems, errors in arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, and procedures such as the chain rule are often even more problematic.
Provide opportunities for students to reinforce familiar skills and concepts as they practice new techniques in preparation for the AP Exam. As with analysis of graphs, sign charts can be useful tools for identifying answers to questions about the direction of motion or whether speed is increasing or decreasing, for example. To earn points for justification, however, students must connect their work to a relevant definition or theorem, as in the Scoring Guidelines for 2017 AB5.
Continue to emphasize accounting for initial values, as in past units, as well as precise communication and notational fluency. Paying attention to subscripts in problems involving more than one particle is essential to clear communication.
Developing Understanding
In this unit, students will build on their understanding of straight-line motion to solve problems in
which particles are moving along curves in the plane. Students will define parametric equations
and vector-valued functions to describe planar motion and apply calculus to solve motion
problems. Students will learn that polar equations are a special case of parametric equations and
will apply calculus to analyze graphs and determine lengths and areas. This unit should be treated
as an opportunity to reinforce past learning and transfer knowledge and skills to new situations,
rather than as a new list of facts or strategies to memorize.

Sample Activity 1 9.2
Numbered Heads Together
Organize the class into groups of four and give each student a number. Give the
class one set of parametric equations and have students individually find the second
derivative. When all students in a group have finished, have them stand up to discuss
their answers, make any necessary corrections, and then sit back down. Choose a
group and call a specific student number so that the student can share the answer with the class.
2 9.5 9.6
Scavenger Hunt
Create cards containing a parametric initial value question and the answer to a different
question. Students can start at any question, moving around the room to make a full
circuit of all questions once complete. Focus on giving students an initial value and
asking for one or both component values at a different t- or x-value (e.g., x ′(t) = 2t,
y ′(t) = cos(t), and position is (2, 0) at t = π. Find position at t 5 6 π = .).

Create Representations
Give students polar equations of various types: circle, limaçon with inner loop, cardioid,
dimpled limaçon, rose curve, or lemniscates. Have students create a table of values,
sketch the graph of the curve using rectangular coordinates, and sketch the graph of
the curve using polar coordinates. Preface this activity by modeling the steps with one
function on large paper, using wiki sticks to show the y-values as heights becoming the r-values as radii.

Paraphrasing
Give students a proof which derives the polar area formula. Ask them to restate the
meaning and derivation of this formula in their own words. Have them also compare
and contrast this formula to the integration used to find areas under functions in the
Cartesian coordinate system.
5 9.9

Building the
Mathematical Practices
1.E
1.F
2.C
3.D
In Unit 10, students will need to develop proficiency with complex series notation and the ability to communicate their reasoning. Emphasize appropriate use of notation, precision of language, and establishing conditions for using a particular test. Remind students that a sound justification relies upon both mathematical evidence and reasons why that evidence supports the conclusion.
Additionally, students will need to practice determining which application is appropriate for different scenarios (for example, using the definitions of harmonic or p-series to classify certain infinite series) and then applying associated procedures accurately.
Students will also need to practice using
Taylor polynomials to approximate the value of a function, choosing and implementing an appropriate method to bound the error involved in the approximation, and effectively communicating supporting work.
Connecting representations is an important skill to develop in this unit. For example, students will need to identify infinite power series to represent functions presented symbolically or move between graphic and symbolic representations of an interval of convergence.
Preparing for the AP Exam
Students are more likely to demonstrate an incomplete understanding of series or to struggle with communicating their understanding of it compared to other topics. Continue to model and expect correct notation and language to present solutions, explain reasoning, and justify conclusions.
For example, using the ratio test to find a radius of convergence, or operating on a known series to create another series, requires proficient, well-presented algebra.
Applying a convergence test requires explicit verification that all necessary conditions are met. Determining that a given number is an error bound requires calculating an appropriate value and communicating that the value is less than the given number.
Intentional focus on the recurrent theme of using limiting cases to move from discrete approximations to analytic calculations and determinations is one way to help students to finish the year with a strong performance on the AP Exam and to come away with an enduring, meaningful understanding of calculus.
Developing Understanding
In this unit, students need to understand that a sum of infinitely many terms may converge to a
finite value. They can develop intuition by exploring graphs, tables, and symbolic expressions for
series that converge and diverge and for Taylor polynomials. Students should build connections
to past learning, such as how evaluating improper integrals relates to the integral test or how
using limiting cases of power series to represent continuous functions relates to differentiation
and integration. Students who rely solely on memorizing a long list of tests and procedures
typically find little success achieving a lasting conceptual understanding of series.

Predict and Confirm
Demonstrate a geometric series, the harmonic series, and the alternating series by
distributing pieces of a donut, pizza, or licorice. Ask the class to predict how much
the student(s) will eventually receive in total. For instance, give three students each
one-fourth, then one-fourth of the remaining fourth, and so on. Students should guess
that since the remaining part is approaching zero, each student will eventually receive one-third.
For alternating harmonic series, give one student a whole piece, then take away ½, then give 1/3, then take away ¼, and so forth.

include each test’s conditions and how to choose which test to apply.
3 10.13
Odd One Out
Begin by modeling an example, such as three images that are pieces of furniture and one
image of a houseplant, explaining that the houseplant is the “odd one out” because it’s not
like the other images. Then distribute a set of series such that all of the series, except one,
have something in common. For example, all of the series except one could have the same
type of interval of convergence (open, closed, open at left or right endpoint). Or they could
converge only at the series’ center or they could converge for all real numbers. Then have
students decide which series in the set is the “odd one out.” 4 10.15
Collaborative Poster
Use this strategy for groups to create their own free-response questions. Give each
group of four students a basic series, such as sin (x), cos (x), ex, or x 1 1+ . Ask the
first two members to choose a manipulation of the series and show work to complete
the task. Ask the final two members to watch silently and confirm the first two steps.
Then the final two members choose further actions to perform on the new series (i.e.,
differentiate, integrate, and find interval of convergence).

Selecting and Using Course Materials
Textbooks
While College Board provides examples of textbooks to help determine whether
a text is considered appropriate in meeting the AP Calculus Course Audit curricular
requirement, teachers select textbooks locally. AP Central has a list of textbook examples that meet the resource requirements.
Graphing Calculators and Other Technologies in AP Calculus
The use of a graphing calculator is considered an integral part of the AP Calculus
courses, and it is required on some portions of the exams. Professional mathematics
organizations such as the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), the
Mathematical Association of America (MAA), and the National Academy of Sciences
(NAS) Board on Mathematical Sciences and Their Applications have strongly
endorsed the use of calculators in mathematics instruction and testing.
Graphing calculators are valuable tools for achieving multiple components of
the mathematical practices, including using technology to develop conjectures,
connecting concepts to their visual representations, solving problems, and critically
interpreting and accurately reporting information. The AP Calculus courses also
support the use of other technologies that are available to students and encourage
teachers to incorporate technology into instruction in a variety of ways as a means of facilitating discovery and reflection.
Appropriate examples of graphing calculator use in AP Calculus include but certainly
are not limited to:
§§ Zooming to reveal local linearity
§§ Constructing a table of values to conjecture a limit
§§ Developing a visual representation of Riemann sums approaching a definite integral
§§ Graphing Taylor polynomials to understand intervals of convergence for Taylor series
§§ Drawing a slope field and investigating how the choice of initial condition affects the solution to a differential equation
Online Tools and Resources
In addition to the resources offered through a teacher’s choice of textbook, many
useful educational resources exist online—and are often free. Below are a few
examples of these types of resources. This is not a comprehensive list, nor is it an
endorsement of any of these resources. Teachers can sample different resources to find which ones can most benefit students.

Instructional Strategies
The AP Calculus course framework outlines the concepts and skills students must master in order to be successful
on the AP Exam. In order to address those concepts and skills effectively, it helps to incorporate a variety of
instructional approaches and best practices into daily lessons and activities. The following table presents strategies
that can help students apply their understanding of course concepts.
Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Always,
Sometimes,
Never
Students are given justification statements and are asked to determine whether that line of reasoning is always true, sometimes true, or never true.
Allows students to hone the precision and thoroughness of their justifications by having them determine the validity of given statements, and by explaining why certain statements could be true under certain conditions.
When justifying properties and behaviors of functions based on derivatives, provide students with a list of statements such as the following (assuming f x ( ) is twice differentiable):
§§ If f c( ) 0 ′ =  and f c( ) 0 ′′ < , then x c =  _____ locates a local maximum of f x ( ).
§§ If f x ( ) ′ changes from negative to positive at x c = , then x c =  _____ locates a relative maximum of f x ( ).
§§ If f c( ) 0 ′ =  and f c( ) 0 ′′ > , then x c =  _____ locates an absolute minimum of f x ( ).
Then have students write “always,” “sometimes,” or “never” in the appropriate blanks to make the statement true. (Solutions for the sample statements above,
respectively: always, never, sometimes)
Ask the expert
Students are assigned as “experts” on problems they have mastered; groups rotate through the expert stations to learn about problems they have not yet mastered.
Provides opportunities for students to share their knowledge and learn from one another.
When learning rules of differentiation, assign students as “experts” on product rule, quotient rule, chain rule, and derivatives of transcendental functions. Students rotate through stations in groups, working with the station expert to complete a series of problems using the corresponding rule.

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Collaborative
Poster
In groups of four, students are assigned a colored marker and a subpart of a free response question. Each student completes their subpart on the poster using their assigned marker.
Allows students time to analyze each other’s work and explain their reasoning to others.
Have students divide their poster into four corners and give each student a colored marker for their part of the free-response question:
§§ Green for part a §§ Purple for part b §§ Red for part c §§ Blue for part d
After completing their parts, have students hang their posters in the room and walk around to review each other’s work. Students can use yellow sticky notes to leave positive comments and pink sticky notes for recommended corrections.
Concepts with Color
Students use colored highlighters, post its, or sticky flags to note where particular concepts, vocabulary, or processes appear or to note connections between different representations of the same concept.
Useful for illustrating, emphasizing, and/or tracing how a particular concept manifests in a problem, process, or verbal description.
Can be modified for students with color blindness such that symbols or typeface features are used instead of color.
At the end of the course, have students revisit their notes from previous units and use highlighters or sticky notes of different colors to tag places where specific concepts have been discussed in different contexts, for example:
§§ Blue for “continuity” §§ Orange for “rate of change” §§ Green for “accumulation”
Then have students discuss in their groups the themes and key aspects of those concepts as they have threaded throughout the course.
Construct an
Argument
Students use mathematical reasoning to present assumptions about mathematical situations, support conjectures with mathematically relevant and accurate data, and provide a logical progression of ideas leading to a conclusion that makes sense.
Helps develop the process of evaluating mathematical information, developing reasoning skills, and enhancing communication skills in supporting conjectures and conclusions.
This strategy can be used with word problems that do not lend themselves to immediate application of a formula or mathematical process. Provide distance and velocity graphs that represent a motorist’s behavior through several towns on a map and ask students to construct a mathematical argument either in defense of or against a police officer’s charge of speeding, given a known speed limit.

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Create a Plan
Students analyze the tasks in a problem and create a process for completing the tasks by finding the information needed, interpreting data, choosing how to solve a problem, communicating the results, and verifying accuracy.
Assists in breaking tasks into smaller parts and identifying the steps needed to complete the entire task.
Given an optimization problem that asks for a choice between two boxes with different dimensions but the same cross-sectional perimeter, have students identify the steps needed to determine which box will hold the most candy. This involves selecting an appropriate formula, differentiating the resulting function, applying the second derivative test, and interpreting the results.
Create
Representations
Students create pictures, tables, graphs, lists, equations, models, and/or verbal expressions to interpret text or data.
Helps organize information using multiple ways to present data and to answer a question or show a problem solution.
In order to evaluate limits, introduce a variety of methods, including constructing a graph, creating a table, directly substituting a given value into the function, or applying an algebraic process.
Critique
Reasoning
Through collaborative discussion, students respond to the arguments of others and question the use of mathematical terminology, assumptions, and conjectures to improve understanding and justify and communicate conclusions.
Helps students learn from each other as they make connections between mathematical concepts and learn to verbalize their understanding and support their arguments with reasoning and data that make sense to peers.
Given a table that lists a jogger’s velocity at five different times during his or her workout, have students explain the meaning of the definite integral of the absolute value of the velocity function between the first and the last time recorded. As students discuss their responses in groups, they learn how to communicate specific concepts and quantities using mathematical notation and terminology.
Debriefing
Students discuss their understanding of a concept to lead to a consensus on its meaning.
Helps clarify misconceptions and deepen understanding of content.
In order to discern the difference between average rate of change and instantaneous rate of change, have students roll a ball down a simplified ramp and measure the distance the ball travels over time, every second for five seconds.
Plotting the points and sketching a curve of best fit, have students discuss how they might determine the average velocity of the ball over the five seconds and then the instantaneous velocity of the ball at three seconds. A discussion in which students address the distinction between the ball’s velocity between two points and its velocity at a single particular time would assist in clarifying the concept and mathematical process of arriving at the correct answers.

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Discussion
Groups
Students work within groups to discuss content, create problem solutions, and explain and justify a solution.
Aids understanding through the sharing of ideas, interpretation of concepts, and analysis of problem scenarios.
Once students learn all methods of integration and choose which is the most appropriate given a particular function, have them discuss in small groups, with pencils down, why a specific method should be used over another.
Distractor
Analysis
Students examine answers to a multiple choice question and determine which answers are incorrect and why.
Allows students to become familiar with the procedural or communication errors that might cause them to get a problem wrong.
To help students practice applying derivative rules, provide multiple choice questions with a set of “distractor answers,” along with a separate list of descriptions—one for each answer choice—without telling students which description applies to which answer. For example, if the question asks for the derivative of f x x x ( ) 1 2 2 3 ( ) ( ) = − + , then one distractor answer could be x x x 6 1 2 2 2 ( ) ( ) − + , and its corresponding description could be, “This choice is for the student who applied the chain rule correctly to x 2 2 3 ( ) + but who never applied the product rule.” Have students match up each distractor answer choice to its corresponding description in the list.
Error Analysis
Students analyze an existing solution to determine whether (or where) errors have occurred.
Allows students to troubleshoot existing errors so they can apply procedures correctly when they do the same types of problems on their own.
When students begin to evaluate definite integrals, have them analyze their answers and troubleshoot any errors that might lead to a negative area when there is a positive accumulation.
Four Corners
Students are given a sheet of paper that’s been divided vertically and horizontally with four equal sections and a topic name in the middle. Each section has a problem that uses a different representation (e.g., numerical, graphical, analytical, and verbal).
Helps to deepen understanding of a concept by having students explore different representations and make connections between those representations.
To help students learn about limits, provide a four corners activity sheet that asks them to find limits based on analytical functions in one corner, a graph in another corner, a table in another corner, and a verbal description in the last corner.

Strategy
Definition
Purpose
Example
Graph and Switch
Students generate a graph (or sketch of a graph) to model a certain function, and then switch calculators (or papers) to review each other’s solutions.
Allows students to practice creating different representations of functions, and then give and receive feedback on each other’s work.
As students learn about integration and finding the area under a curve, have them use calculators to shade in the appropriate area between lower and upper limits while calculating the total accumulation.
Since input keystrokes are critical in obtaining the correct numerical value, have students calculate their own answers, share their steps with a partner, and receive feedback on their calculator notation and final answer.
Graphic
Organizer
Students represent ideas and information visually (e.g., Venn diagrams, flowcharts, etc.).
Provides students a visual system for organizing multiple ideas and details related to a particular concept.
In order to determine the location of relative extrema for a function, have students construct a sign chart or number line while applying the first derivative test, marking where the first derivative is positive or negative and determining where the original function is increasing or decreasing.
Guess and Check
Students guess the solution to a problem, and then check that the guess fits the information in the problem and is an accurate solution.
Allows exploration of different ways to solve a problem; may be used when other strategies for solving are not obvious.
Encourage students to employ this strategy for drawing a graphical representation of a given function, given written slope statements and/ or limit notation. For example, given a statement describing the graph of a particular function, have students sketch the graph described and then check it against the solution graph.
Identify a
Subtask
Students break a problem into smaller pieces whose combined outcomes lead to a solution.
Helps to organize the pieces of a complex problem and reach a complete solution.
After providing students with the rates in which rainwater flows into and out of a drainpipe, ask them to find how many cubic feet of water flow into it during a specific time period and whether the amount of water in the pipe is increasing or decreasing at a particular instant. Students would begin by distinguishing functions from one another and determining whether differentiation or integration is appropriate. They would then perform the relevant calculations and verify whether they have answered the question.

Look for a
Pattern
Students observe information or create visual representations to find a trend.
Helps to identify patterns that may be used to make predictions.
Patterns can be detected when approximating area under a curve using Riemann sums. Have students calculate areas using left and right endpoint rectangles, midpoint rectangles, and trapezoids, increasing and decreasing the width in order to determine the best method for approximation.
Marking the
Text
Students highlight, underline, and/or annotate text to focus on key information to help understand the text or solve the problem.
Helps to identify important information in the text and make notes about the interpretation of tasks required and concepts to apply to reach a solution.
This strategy can be used with problems that involve related rates.
Have students read through a given problem, underline the given static and changing quantities, list these quantities, and then use them to label a sketch that models the situation given in the problem. Then have students use this information to substitute for variables in a differential equation.
Match Mine
Students work in pairs to describe the layout of cards on their game board, without being able to see each other’s boards.
Emphasizes the use of appropriate vocabulary and allows students to practice accurate communication around different representations.
Create a blank 3×3 grid as a “game board” and nine graph images depicting concepts related to limits/ continuity. Pair up students and insert a folder between the partners so they can’t see each other’s boards. Distribute a blank grid and a set of the images to each partner.
Student A arranges the graphs however they choose on the grid and then describes that arrangement so that Student B can attempt to match it on their own board. When the pair thinks that they have correctly made all matches, have them compare their arrangements to see how well they did.
Model
Questions
Students answer questions from released
AP Calculus Exams.
Provides challenging practice and assesses students’ ability to apply multiple mathematical practices on content presented as either a multiple-choice or a free-response question.
After learning how to construct slope fields, have students practice by completing free-response questions in which they are asked to sketch slope fields for given differential equations at points indicated.

Purpose
Example
Notation Read
Aloud
Students read symbols and notational representations aloud.
Helps students to accurately interpret symbolic representations.
This strategy can be used to introduce new symbols and mathematical notation to ensure that students learn proper terminology from the start. For example, after introducing summation notation, ask students to write or say aloud the verbal translation of a given sum.
Note-Taking
Students create a record of information while reading a text or listening to a speaker.
Helps in organizing ideas and processing information.
Have students write down verbal descriptions of the steps needed to solve a differential equation so that a record of the process can be referred to at a later point in time.
Numbered
Heads Together
Students are put into groups and assigned a number (1 through 4). Members of a group work together to agree on an answer.
The teacher randomly selects one number.
The student with that number answers for the group.
Allows students to process information individually, and then sync with their peers to develop a common understanding of a particular concept or approach.
In groups, have students begin by solving a problem individually. When all students have finished, have them stand up and discuss their answers.
Students sit back down when they have all agreed on a solution. Then call on one number in the group (1, 2, 3, or 4) and have that student stand up to share the group’s answer.
Odd One Out
In groups of four, students are given four problems, images, or graphs. Three of the items should have something in common.
Each student in the group works with one of the four items and must decide individually whether their item fits with the other three items and then write a reason why. Students then share their responses within their groups.
Allows students to explore relationships and underlying principles for mathematical concepts that are similar to, or different from, one another.
Begin by modeling an example, such as three images that are four-legged animals and one image that’s an object, explaining why the object is the “odd one out.” Then provide each student in the group with one of four images displaying graphs.
Three of the graphs should represent functions with discontinuities, while the fourth graph represents a continuous function. Have students examine their graph and write on mini whiteboards, “My graph is in because . . . ” or “My graph is out because . . . .”
Each group discusses and signals when they’ve reached consensus.
Then reveal the answer and explain what the three similar graphs had in common, and why the other was the odd one out.

Example
Paraphrasing
Students restate in their own words the essential information in a text or problem description.
Assists with comprehension, recall of information, and problem solving.
After reading a mathematical definition from a textbook, have students express the definition in their own words. For example, with parametric equations, have students explain the difference between y being a function of x directly, and x and y both being functions of a parameter t. bc only
Password-Style
Games
Students are in pairs with one student facing the teacher and the other with their back to the teacher. The teacher projects a word and the student facing the teacher describes the word to their partner.
This repeats every 10 seconds for 6 words.
Students then switch roles.
Reinforces understanding of key vocabulary terms by having students use different approaches for describing those terms.
Students arrange themselves into partners (or triads), with one partner seated with their back to the teacher.
When the teacher projects the term, “tangent line,” the students facing the teacher provide clues to try to get their partner to write the term on their mini whiteboard. After 10 seconds, the teacher projects a new term, “derivative.” The process continues for as many vocabulary terms as there are for that activity.
Predict and Confirm
Students make conjectures about what results will develop in an activity and confirm or modify the conjectures based on outcomes.
Stimulates thinking by making, checking, and correcting predictions based on evidence from the outcome.
Given two sets of cards with functions and the graphs of their derivatives, have students attempt to match the functions with their appropriate derivative match. Students then calculate the derivatives of the functions using specific rules and graph the derivatives using calculators to confirm their original match selection.
Quickwrite
Students write for a short, specific amount of time about a designated topic.
Helps generate ideas in a short time.
To help synthesize concepts after having learned how to calculate the derivative of a function at a point, have students list as many real-world situations as possible in which knowing the instantaneous rate of change of a function is advantageous.

Definition
Purpose
Example
Quiz-Quiz-
Trade
Students answer a question independently, and then quiz a partner on the same question.
Allows students to talk to multiple peers and solve many problems while coaching each other and hearing different ways of solving or arriving at a solution.
Give students a card containing a question and have them write the answer on the back. Students then stand up and find a partner. One student quizzes the other, and then they reverse roles. They switch cards, find a new partner, and the process repeats.
Reciprocal
Teaching
Students are divided into groups and each member of the group is assigned a role.
Each student reads the problem and completes their assigned role for that problem. Students take turns sharing what they wrote with their group, while other group members take notes. Students then rotate roles and begin on another part of the problem.
Helps students gain an entry point into a problem by breaking it down. Also allows students to see multiple ways of approaching a problem as peers explain their solutions to one another.
To help students practice free response questions, divide groups into four roles, each responsible for a different task on their activity sheet:
1.	 Read the problem. Identify key words (highlight or underline and list them).
2.	 Represent the key words with a picture.
3.	 Describe what needs to be done to complete that part in mathematical terms.
4.	 Explain any important details that must be on your paper to get full credit on the AP Exam (use prior knowledge).
Then have students work through the problem one part at a time (including the question stem), rotating roles for each part.
Round Table
Students are given a worksheet with multiple problems and work individually to solve them, and then rotate after each problem to allow other group members to check their work.
Allows students the chance to analyze each other’s work and coach their peers, if necessary.
In groups of four, give each student an identical paper with four different problems on it. Have students complete the first one on their paper, and then pass the paper clockwise to another member in their group. That student checks the first problem and then completes the second problem on the paper.
Students rotate again and the process continues until each student has their original paper back.

Purpose
Example
Scavenger
Hunt
Provide students with a “starter” question. Then place solution cards around the room. Each card should contain the solution to a previous problem, along with the next problem in the “scavenger hunt.”
Students walk around answering each new problem and finding the corresponding solution around the room.
Allows students to self-correct and analyze their own work if they get an answer they don’t see posted.
When practicing the chain rule, place a card with a starter question somewhere in the classroom: “Find the derivative of f x x ( ) sin(4 ) = .”
Place another card somewhere in the room with the solution to that card, plus another question, for
example: “Solution: f x x ( ) 4cos(4 ) ′ = .
Next problem: Find the derivative of f x x ( ) sin( ) 4 ( ) = .” Continue posting solution cards with new problems until the final card presents a problem whose solution is on the original starter card (note that this solution would be added to the starter card above). Students begin by solving the starter question, then searching around the room for the solution they found, as this will lead them to the next problem they need to solve, until they end up at the first card they started with.
Sentence
Starters
Students respond to a prompt by filling in the missing parts of a given sentence template.
Helps students practice communication skills by providing a starting point and modeling a sentence structure that would apply for a particular type of problem.
To help students practice writing conclusions based on the
Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT), provide a function or table of values, along with a scenario for which IVT would be applicable. Then have students use a given sentence starter to justify that the function is continuous. For example, students could be given this scenario: “Given f x x x x ( ) 3 5 4 3 2 = − + −, verify that there is at least one root for f x ( ).”
A sentence starter could then be provided to help students begin their justifications, such as “The function is continuous because . . . .”
Sharing and Responding
Communicating with another person or a small group of peers who respond to a proposed problem solution.
Gives students the opportunity to discuss their work with peers, to make suggestions for improvement to the work of others, and/or to receive appropriate and relevant feedback on their own work.
Given tax rate schedules for single taxpayers in a specific year, have students construct functions to represent the amount of tax paid by taxpayers in specific tax brackets.
Then have students come together in a group to review the constructed functions, make any necessary corrections, and build and graph a single piecewise function to represent the tax rate schedule for single taxpayers for the specific year.

Simplify the
Problem
Students use “friendlier” numbers or functions to help solve a problem.
Provides insight into the problem or the strategies needed to solve the problem.
When applying the chain rule for differentiation or u-substitution for integration, review how to proceed when there is no “inner function” before addressing composite functions.
Stand Up, Hand
Up, Pair Up
Students are paired up and assigned a problem to solve. One student solves the problem aloud while the other student records the solution. The students reverse roles and repeat the steps. Together they stand up and put their hand up, and then find a new partner and work on a new problem.
Allows students to talk to multiple peers and hear multiple perspectives. Can be used to have students quickly review homework or warm up answers.
Pair up students and distribute a different problem to each pair.
Determine which student in each pair will “solve” first.
Step 1: Student A and Student B read the problem individually.
Step 2: Student B solves the problem out loud while Student A records the solution on paper.
Step 3: Student B signs Student A’s paper.
Step 4: Students reverse roles.
Step 5: Students stand up, put their hand up, then they pair up with a new partner and continue.
Think Aloud
Students talk through a difficult problem by describing what the text means.
Helps in comprehending the text, understanding the components of a problem, and thinking about possible paths to a solution.
In order to determine if a series converges or diverges, have students ask themselves a series of questions out loud to identify series characteristics and corresponding tests (e.g., ratio, root, integral, and limit comparison) that are appropriate for determining convergence.
Think-Pair-
Share (or Wait,
Turn, and Talk)
Students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then conclude by sharing results with the class.
Enables the development of initial ideas that are then tested with a partner in preparation for revising ideas and sharing them with a larger group.
Given the equation of a discontinuous function, have students think of ways to make the function continuous and adjust the given equation to establish such continuity. Then have students pair with a partner to discuss their ideas before sharing out with the whole class.
Use
Manipulatives
Students use objects to examine relationships between the information given.
Supports comprehension by providing a visual or hands-on representation of a problem or concept.
To visualize the steps necessary to find the volume of a solid with a known cross-section, have students build a physical model on a base with a standard function using foam board or weighted paper to construct several cross-sections.
Work Backward
Students trace a possible answer back through the solution process to the starting point.
Provides another way to check possible answers for accuracy.
Have students check whether they have found a correct antiderivative by differentiating their answer and comparing it to the original function.

Mathematical Practice 4: Use correct notation, language, and
mathematical conventions to communicate results or solutions
The data indicate that students consistently struggle with communication and appropriate use of notation on the
AP Calculus Exams. Students often need targeted support to develop these skills. Remind students that communicating
reasoning is at least as important as finding a solution. Well-communicated reasoning validates solutions.
Reinforce that when students are asked to provide reasoning or a justification for their solution, a successful response will include the following:
§§ A logical sequence of steps
§§ An argument that explains why those steps are appropriate
§§ An accurate interpretation of the solution (with units) in the context of the situation, if appropriate
In order to help students develop these communication skills, teachers can:
§§ Have students practice explaining their solutions orally to a small group or to the class.
§§ Present an incomplete argument or explanation and have students supplement it for greater clarity or completeness.
§§ Provide sentence starters, template guides, and communication tips to help scaffold the writing process.

Task Verbs Used in Free-Response
Questions
The following task verbs are commonly used in the free-response questions:
§§ Approximate: Use rounded decimal values or other estimates in
calculations, which require writing an expression to show work.
§§ Calculate/Write an expression: Write an appropriate expression or
equation to answer a question. Unless otherwise directed, calculations
also require evaluating an expression or solving an equation, but the
expression or equation must also be presented to show work. “Calculate”
tasks might also be formulated as “How many?” or “What is the value?”
§§ Determine: Apply an appropriate definition, theorem, or test to identify
values, intervals, or solutions whose existence or uniqueness can be
established. “Determine” tasks may also be phrased as “Find.”
§§ Estimate: Use models or representations to find approximate values for functions.
§§ Evaluate: Apply mathematical processes, including the use of appropriate
rounding procedures, to find the value of an expression at a given point or over a given interval.
§§ Explain: Use appropriate definitions or theorems to provide reasons or
rationales for solutions and conclusions. “Explain” tasks may also be phrased as “Give a reason for...”
§§ Identify/Indicate: Indicate or provide information about a specified topic, without elaboration or explanation.
§§ Interpret: Describe the connection between a mathematical expression
or solution and its meaning within the realistic context of a problem, often including consideration of units.
§§ Interpret (when given a representation): Identify mathematical
information represented graphically, numerically, analytically, and/or verbally, with and without technology.
§§ Justify: Identify a logical sequence of mathematical definitions, theorems,
or tests to support an argument or conclusion, explain why these apply, and then apply them.
§§ Represent: Use appropriate graphs, symbols, words, and/or tables of
numerical values to describe mathematical concepts, characteristics, and/ or relationships.
§§ Verify: Confirm that the conditions of a mathematical definition, theorem,
or test are met in order to explain why it applies in a given situation.
Alternately, confirm that solutions are accurate and appropriate.

If the limit of a function exists at a discontinuity in its graph, then it is possible to remove the discontinuity by defining or redefining the value of the function at that point, so it equals the value of the limit of the function as x approaches that point.
LIM-2.C.2
In order for a piecewise-defined function to be continuous at a boundary to the partition of its domain, the value of the expression defining the function on one side of the boundary must equal the value of the expression defining the other side of the boundary, as well as the value of the function at the boundary.
