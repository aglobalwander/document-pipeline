a ­humanities or social science subject, an experimental science, mathematics
and one of the creative arts. Instead of an arts subject, students can choose two
subjects from another area. It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes
the Diploma Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare
students effectively for university entrance. In each of the academic areas students
have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can choose subjects
that particularly interest them and that they may wish to study further at university.
Normally, three subjects (and not more than four) are taken at higher level (HL), and
the others are taken at standard level (SL). The IB recommends 240 teaching hours for HL
subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater depth and breadth than
at SL. In addition, three core elements—the extended essay, theory of knowledge and creativity,
activity, service—are compulsory and central to the philosophy of the programme.

I. Course description and aims
The business management course is designed to meet the current and future needs of students who
want to develop their knowledge of business content, concepts and tools to assist with business decision making. Future employees, business leaders, entrepreneurs or social entrepreneurs need to be confident,
creative and compassionate as change agents for business in an increasingly interconnected global
marketplace. The business management course is designed to encourage the development of these attributes.
Through the exploration of four interdisciplinary concepts: creativity, change, ethics and
sustainability, this course empowers students to explore these concepts from a business perspective.
Business management focuses on business functions, management processes and decision-making in contemporary contexts of strategic uncertainty.
Students examine how business decisions are influenced by factors that are internal and external to
an organization and how these decisions impact upon a range of internal and external stakeholders.
Emphasis is placed on strategic decision-making and the operational business functions of human
resource management, finance and accounts, marketing, and operations management.
Business management is a challenging and dynamic discipline that more than meets the needs of our
students growing and developing in a complex business environment. This course prepares students to be
global citizens ready to face up to the challenges and opportunities awaiting them in our ever-changing world.
